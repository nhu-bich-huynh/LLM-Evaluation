"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) This very good report will not be well received in Ankara."
"On the one hand, we recognise the efforts made, namely adoption of the Law on Foundations, reform of the Penal Code regarding freedom of expression, and the constitutional changes announced."
"On the other hand, certain issues still remain unresolved. These include freedom of religion for faiths other than Islam, interference in the activities of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, and the slow progress of investigation into the murder of Hrant Dink and the three Christians from Malataya."
"It is also the case that certain provisions in the Association Agreement have not been complied with."
"We wrote about each one of these issues last year."
"One might well conclude that time passes very slowly in the region of the Bosporus."
"Instead of pressing for the full integration process, we should perhaps set out a legal framework for a type of cooperation between Turkey and the Union that would be better suited to both partners. That could be done immediately."
"The political dimension of such a framework could well transcend the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"The alternative package would not cause tensions such as those currently experienced in Ankara and in European capitals regarding the debate about Turkey becoming a full member of the European Union."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we will abstain on this resolution, especially in view of the way the Kurdish issue is side-stepped."
"In particular, I do not believe that Turkey's actions in northern Iraq can be described merely as 'disproportionate military operations'; instead we should assert that this is an open violation of international law."
"The Kurdish issue cannot be reduced solely to a social matter."
"It is first and foremost a political issue and we must tell the government in no uncertain terms that it must open talks with the local authorities in the Kurdish region and with the DTP."
"We cannot keep silent on the fact that there is no hint of a mention of the Luxembourg Court's decision on the different status given to the PKK on terrorist lists as has been the case to date."
"We believe that there have been many appeals to Turkey on the Kurdish issue but that hitherto no substantive change whatsoever has been noted."
"This is the reason for our abstention."
"Madam President, I have read the report by my fellow Member Mrs Oomen-Ruijten with great interest and respect, and I congratulate her."
"However, try as I might, I cannot reconcile it with current events. Developments in Turkey are preventing us from seeing what kind of future will emerge for that country with its inherent Asiatic traits."
"Turkey has tried in the past to carry out reforms."
"Let us not forget the Tanzimat reforms or the reforms of Abdul Hamit and Hatt-ı Hümayun."
"Reforms have been attempted for hundreds of years without success."
"The decision of the Constitutional Court is an ominous threat: political parties are being abolished."
"I do not understand why Turkey does not have to follow Europe's example, if it is an accession country and if..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(NL) I should like to say to Mr Swoboda that a political party has in fact already been banned in Europe. I am talking about Belgium, where Vlaams Blok, the largest Flemish party, was actually banned in 2005."
"Obviously that is no excuse for Turkey to ban political parties as well."
"Having said that, I am astounded, Madam President, that the Council and the Commission are satisfied with the cosmetic changes to the notorious Article 301 in the Turkish Penal Code, which will still put just as many restrictions on freedom of expression."
"It is now a punishable offence to insult 'the Turkish nation', rather than 'insulting Turkishness'."
"It is simply a question of semantics, which can still lead to actual prison sentences."
"Article 301 does not need to be amended, it needs to be abolished, along with all legal provisions that conflict with freedom of expression and democratic fundamental rights."
"If that is not done, the negotiations must simply be stopped, as has always been promised."
"It was promised that the negotiating process would keep pace with reforms in Turkey."
"Well, that is really not the case, certainly since it is already believed that two new chapters are to be opened shortly."
"If the European Union approves cosmetic improvements like this, it loses all credibility and the whole of the rest of the negotiating process becomes a grotesque farce."
"(NL) I also want to pay tribute to the rapporteur and the way in which she has drawn up this report."
"The report clearly shows the direction that Parliament wants to go in, which is to negotiate on membership of the European Union and nothing else."
"2008 was announced as the year of reforms in Turkey."
"Of course we support that ambition, but we are waiting to see how internal developments in Turkey will turn out."
"Mr Swoboda has said enough about that."
"If it goes wrong, we shall have to deal with a Turkey that cannot really act."
"Talking of reforms, I should also like to draw attention to Article 301 of the Penal Code, which is used to restrict freedom of expression in Turkey in a number of ways."
"The government has announced that it wishes to amend this article."
"We believe that this is a step forward, but what we would like most and what we think is the best solution is for the article to be abolished for good, along with other restrictive provisions, to put an end to a practice that, unfortunately, still persists, namely the misuse of these articles in order to restrict freedom of expression."
"Secondly, I should like to join with Mr Lagendijk in saying that we were also outraged at the way in which the police intervened at the 1 May demonstration in Istanbul."
"You will realise that, for us as social democrats, for whom 1 May is an important day, this was something very disturbing."
"We hope that it will never happen again and appeal to the authorities to ensure that it does not."
"Finally, a remark on the Kurdish question."
"We want the political debate in Turkey actually to take place and we want a political solution to be sought through decentralisation, but also, for example, by promoting the use of Kurdish in general."
"I think that is an important point to be stressed again today."
"Finally, I also want to draw attention to a point that we have discussed repeatedly, the expression of support for the initiative by the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Zapatero, and his Turkish counterpart, Mr Erdoğan, on what they call the Alliance of Civilizations."
"We hope that Parliament will eventually support our amendments on that today."
"Madam President, first I would like to defend Joost Lagendijk from the scandalous attacks upon his integrity by the CHP and certain nationalistic journalists."
"Joost Lagendijk is a good friend of Turkey and a first-class chairman of the JPC."
"Those who attack Lagendijk attack this Parliament and they seek to sacrifice democracy upon the altar of an aggressive laicism."
"Our own message must be absolutely clear: if Turkey's Supreme Court continues to close political parties, they will kill off all prospects of Turkish membership of the Union."
"(DE) Madam President, I would also like to start by thanking the rapporteur for her fair cooperation and very balanced report."
"The report highlights the critical points being identified by the people in Turkey themselves: for example, the solution to the Kurdish problem on a consensus basis while safeguarding the rights of all ethnic groups in Turkey, the headscarf problem in Turkey, which includes respecting the interests of those who do not wish to wear the headscarf, and the issue of religious freedom which must apply to everyone in Turkey, including Alevites, Christians and the Ecumenical Patriarch of Istanbul, for example."
"We are saying all this because we are friends of Turkey, and because we want to see a European Turkey within the European Union."
"That is why we are expressing this criticism, as one friend to another."
"The European Union can also do more."
"Signals such as those sent out by Mr Sarkozy - that Turkey, regardless of what it does, will never join the European Union - certainly do not help."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the excellent work she has done to identify very clearly the current political, social and administrative situation in Turkey."
"Regardless of whether one's position on the accession of Turkey to the European Union is positive, lukewarm or downright hostile, there can be no argument that Turkey lags way behind in terms of modernisation and human rights."
"Admittedly, some efforts have been made, but corruption is a genuine blight and the Cyprus issue remains unresolved, not to mention the fact that there is a lot of work to do in relations with the Armenians."
"There is the Kurdish question, violence against women is still a sore point and the same is true for forced marriages and honour crimes."
"Also cause for concern is the situation regarding registration of births and low levels of schooling."
"This list is certainly not exhaustive and gives a snapshot of a very difficult situation which Parliament must continue to monitor very carefully and steadfastly."
"There can be no compromise on freedom and basic rights ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(EL) Madam President, provided that Turkey complies fully with all the Copenhagen criteria and the obligations it has entered into under the Association Agreement and the Supplementary Protocol to the Ankara Agreement, it can and should accede to the EU."
"It is perfectly clear to us that the aim is Turkey's full accession and that a partnership of some kind is not an alternative."
"The prospect of Turkey's accession to the EU will put pressure on the country to respect the human rights of everyone living in Turkey, including Kurds and religious minorities."
"Despite our concerns about the court proceedings now in progress on the question of the ruling party and the superficial change to Article 301 of the Criminal Code, we believe that Turkey has made some progress."
"However, if her accession course is to proceed unhindered, she must do as previous accession countries have done and comply with its treaty obligations to the EU as a whole."
"Turkey must therefore honour its commitments, open its air and sea ports to the aircraft and ships of the Republic of Cyprus, and lift the veto on Cyprus's participation in international organisations."
"Today, as we watch progress being made thanks to the efforts of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities following the agreement of 21 March between the leaders of the two sides in Cyprus, Turkey must not stand in the way."
"(NL) The Republic of Turkey is disqualifying itself from membership of the European Union."
"I can draw no other conclusion from the mistreatment of its tiny Christian minority, perhaps 100 000 people, or just one hundredth of a per cent of the total population."
"In the light of the Copenhagen criteria, the Council, the Commission and Parliament have no other choice either."
"The direct persecution to which Syrian Orthodox and other Christians in south-eastern Turkey, Tur Abdin, have been subjected for many years is a direct indictment of the Turkish State."
"Does a country in which citizens who attend Christian services and are regularly questioned about that by the police or security services belong in the European Union?"
"Questioning that, moreover, is coupled with threats to their personal lives or employment and even, in some cases, torture."
"Turkish situations, Turkish self-disqualification."
"The point is, however, how honest is the European Union to itself about this?"
"(PL) Madam President, I have every respect for the Turkish nation and am fully aware of the centuries of close and neighbourly relations between my country, Poland, and Turkey. Nonetheless, I have to say that the idea of Turkey's membership of the European Union defies comprehension."
"Although Turkey has had a presence on European territory for many centuries, it is not, in cultural terms, a European country."
"We should cooperate with Turkey to the best of our ability, but the implications of the accession of a Muslim country to a European club are hard to quantify."
"Indeed, the current situation in Turkey indicates that the authorities in Ankara are not particularly eager to become integrated into Europe."
"In addition to Turkey's relations with the European Union, I should also like to refer to its relations with Armenia."
"I am glad the motion for a European Parliament resolution calls on the Turkish Government to end its economic blockade of Armenia."
"It is regrettable, however, that the document makes no reference to the Armenian genocide."
"(FR) Madam President, the report by our colleague Ria Oomen-Ruijten is thorough, honest and courageous at a very testing time for Turkey, and I wish to congratulate her on this. The report, however, forms part of a genre that I feel is becoming increasingly unreal."
"Parliament and many other institutions are carrying on with their pretences, as though our tireless teachings can change Turkey."
"This, in fact, is the crux of the matter: the contradiction between this country, this nation, this great people, its evolution and the project we wish to operate together."
"Turkey is a nation-state, one of the last of its kind, one of the strongest and one of the most aware."
"Its unity is a nationalist unity, and this is clearly discernable in relation to the acknowledgement of genocide in Armenia."
"Its policy is increasingly inspired by a single religion even as it backs away from the secular aspects that form the very basis of its constitution."
"It manifests its desire for independence, while here we wish to implement a principle of integration and delegation of powers and sovereignty."
"This is nothing other than a head-on collision between both parties."
"Let us be under no illusions, let us refrain from telling the Turks anything and everything, and having them believe we are willing either to accept their accession without actually meeting the Copenhagen criteria, or reject it because of them, when what is actually at stake is us, and what we want our European project to be."
"Furthermore, let us define a durable partnership structure that uses a win-win approach to allow Turkey to take up its role as a regional power, and the EU to continue the construction of its world identity."
"(FR) Madam President, since I only have one minute I will get straight to the point."
"The conciliatory posture of the rapporteur, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, has prevented quite a number of stumbling blocks."
"One does remain, however, and that is the disagreement on Amendment 14 concerning reproductive health."
"The Socialists feel that this amendment is not a minor detail, a mere woman's problem."
"It is an indication of a clear separation between the Church and the State, and a symbol of secularism."
"If we no longer want Turkish secularism to be defended by the army or by judicial coups, let women take care of this."
"They will defend it with their bodies."
"In a country which still practises honour killings, calling for sexual rights for women means opposing fundamentalist excesses from any corner."
"(HU) Madam President, let us not put a gloss on the situation: the issue of Turkey's accession has reached a critical stage."
"It is being held back both by uncertainties in Turkish domestic politics and by hesitation on the part of the European Union with regard to Turkey."
"In this situation it is important to reiterate that the accession process is an open-ended process, but the common goal is EU membership."
"We have committed ourselves to this, and so has Turkey."
"It is in our strategic interests that Turkey should become part of the political body of Europe in the long term."
"Associate membership via the Mediterranean Union can complement but not take the place of the integration process."
"Turkey must also do a great deal more than hitherto to strengthen democratic institutions, reinforce civilian control of the military, reform the legal system, and promote human and minority rights."
"We have a joint responsibility to ensure that this process is a success, because it is our failure too, and not just Turkey's, if the negotiations run aground. Thank you."
"(DA) Madam President, Turkey is too large and too different to become a member of the EU."
"If Turkey really wanted to live by Kemal Atatürk's famous words: 'There is only one civilisation', we would not be standing here year after year stating that Turkey is most certainly not willing to comply with the EU's demands concerning the adoption of European values and give up Ottoman values."
"Turkey clearly expects to tire the EU out simply by negotiating without complying with our pivotal demands for change."
"For the 34th year in a row, Turkey is occupying over one third of an EU Member State's territory."
"Cyprus as a whole is suffering under Turkish occupation, and the occupied region is suffering the most."
"It is obvious that the vast majority of European citizens do not want Turkey to become a member of the EU."
"It would also seem that an increasing proportion of Turkish citizens do not want it either."
"It is time to stop this theatrical performance."
"Turkey can have an extended trade agreement."
"Europe has no place in the future that Turkey is looking to create."
"Mr President, I congratulate Ria Oomen-Ruijten for her balanced and fair but strict approach on such a controversial issue."
"Military coups are now old-fashioned and are being replaced by a coup d'état by the judiciary."
"It is unbelievable that the constitution and laws allow the judicial overthrow of the government democratically elected by 47% of the people, for a charge totally disproportionate to the requested sentence compared with EU, Council of Europe or Venice Commission standards."
"EU principles are incompatible with a 'deep state' or the military hindering the government from responding to its new challenges: on Cyprus, to demonstrate, now that negotiations have resumed, that Ankara has the political will to reach a settlement based on the principles on which the EU is founded, without the presence of Turkish troops on the island or the right of unilateral military intervention; on human rights and the freedom of expression in Article 301; on respect for the rights of non-Muslim religious minorities and the Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch; on the obligations of Turkey relating to the Ankara Protocol; on issues like crimes of passion against women and the conspiracy of silence that exists on this issue; on the issue of the Armenian genocide and the blocking of Armenia and so forth."
"These are the challenges Turkey faces if it wants to prove that it is a candidate country destined to become a member of the European Union."
"(EL) Madam President, Turkey has a place in the European family and our only aim should be full accession."
"The Union must honour its commitments."
"Turkey, in turn, must comply with the Copenhagen criteria and the obligations it has undertaken."
"However, very little progress has been achieved in the field of human rights in the past year."
"The repeal of the notorious Article 301 and of all the provisions that make a mockery of the freedom of expression remains the ultimate aim."
"Furthermore, the situation in south-east Turkey needs immediate attention."
"We condemn violence and believe that a definite solution must be found by peaceful means."
"Violence cannot be met with violence."
"This is why I believe there should be an in-depth investigation into the use of Turkish territory by US aircraft in connection with the secret abduction of suspects to Guantanamo Bay."
"We should aim to create a peaceful, democratic and stable society."
"For this reason, we are particularly concerned at the latest developments in Turkey resulting from repercussions of the possible banning of the Justice and Development Party (AKP)."
"Let me conclude by congratulating the rapporteur..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Madam President, we all know that the main obstacle to Turkish progress towards democracy is the Turkish army, an army that not only controls millions of soldiers and their dependants, but also controls political parties and processes, the police and secret service, much of the judiciary (including the supreme and constitutional courts), as well as the religious, educational, social and economic affairs of the country."
"Since General Atatürk's revolution in the 1920s, Turkey has in reality been under a military dictatorship, either directly or indirectly."
"Recently, the prospect of EU accession has given the opportunity for some brave people like the leaders of the AKP party to challenge the army supremacy."
"We have a duty to help these people not just with words, but in deeds."
"The army derives most of its strength from the support of the West."
"Billions of euros in direct aid and in lucrative joint defence ventures are given by the USA, Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain."
"These countries and others, including Russia and China, have a duty to cease all such economic support to the Turkish army until and unless true democracy is securely established in the country."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, only strong geopolitical and geoeconomic interests, not the interest and will of our peoples, are in favour of Turkey's entry into Europe."
"This report seems to be an encyclopaedia of reasons against European Union membership on the part of a country which every day is becoming more Islamicised, where Muftis publicly preach that women who do not wear the veil are all devil-worshippers."
"The Turkish Constitution is a compendium of rules which are upheld, but which are contrary to the human rights we hold dear."
"The report does, unfortunately, gloss over essential issues: Cyprus, the Armenian genocide and the Kurdish question."
"Moreover, on becoming a member of Europe, the rules of this Islamic country which strictly forbids the use of alcohol will also be imposed on our peoples, including the glorious Celts, from the Irish to the Bretons, and we people of the Po valley who are proud to love our wine and our beer."
"(ES) Madam President, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report which we will be adopting today is a serious report, generally balanced, and also a demanding document."
"It cites the progress made, but also highlights reforms outstanding."
"We are all pleased that the Turkish authorities consider 2008 to be the year of reforms, because we know that accession negotiations make them necessary."
"Moreover, the changes themselves will be good for Turkey."
"The Turkish Government's large parliamentary majority means reform cannot be delayed."
"Were it introduced, EU citizens would also perceive the extent of Turkey's commitment in terms of accession to the EU and its values, including respect for rights and freedoms."
"Thus the report emphasises our firm wish that no incidents should seriously disrupt democratic political life in Turkey."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we support reforms. We also support compliance with commitments."
"Commitments outstanding include the normalisation of relations with Cyprus and full implementation of the Additional Protocol to the Ankara Agreement."
"Another important issue for the EU is immigration control."
"We must prevent illegal immigration, which occasionally uses Turkey as a country of transit, and combat the mafias which extract profit from this."
"External borders must be controlled, and mechanisms implemented to repatriate illegal immigrants."
"These courses of action require cooperation by Turkey, and thus I regret that no readmission agreement has yet been reached."
"Terrorism, ladies and gentlemen, is also a very real threat in Turkey and in the European Union."
"We must step up cooperation to combat this scourge more effectively."
"I am finishing up now."
"There is another wider field, foreign policy, where the EU and Turkey must make a greater effort to merge their positions."
"I refer, for instance, to the Mediterranean or Central Asia."
"We also have many mutual interests in terms of energy security, one of the greatest challenges of our times."
"In short, ladies and gentlemen, Turkey and the European Union need each other, and we must continue to work with this in mind."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am extremely pleased with the balanced nature of this report that sends out a positive signal to Turkey."
"The Socialists will ensure accession negotiations continue their positive trajectory under the French Presidency."
"It is precisely because we are in favour of accession that there cannot be any shadows over events concerning our common democratic values."
"It is not acceptable that intellectuals such as the journalist of Armenian origin, Hrant Dink, risk their lives by discussing certain periods of Turkey's history."
"Nor is it acceptable to allow an official line to be perpetuated that trivialises the Armenian genocide as a great tragedy, dismissing the suffering of a people, the number of whose deported is comparable to the numbers of those suffering from influenza in the United Kingdom."
"Like the philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy, I feel that denying genocide is in fact part of the genocide."
"I also urge the Turkish authorities to take the reasonable path of truth and help rehabilitate all national minorities."
"Madam President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for this report."
"It underlines that Turkey in many areas already is part of European projects, but it also underlines that there is development, there is a movement going on, regarding reform of Turkish society."
"At the same time it underlines that those reforms and those changes are being made far too slowly, that there is much more to do."
"But that leaves us with a fundamental question: is the European Union and are Europe and European values better off with a Turkey that is fulfilling all the requirements and has made all the reforms that are underlined in the report, or are we better off with a Turkey that will maybe lean in the future more to other parts of the world, to other values?"
"I think the answer to this question is quite obvious, and that underlines that we must of course keep the pressure on regarding all the changes that need to be made in Turkey with regard to freedom of expression, reform of the Article 301 paragraph, freedom of religion, equal rights for women and men, not only in legislation but also in reality, and of course the need for a solution to the Cyprus issue and a number of other issues."
"But with that perspective, if the accession negotiations deliver all these results, it is very important that the European Union is open for the membership of Turkey because this would strengthen European values, Europe and the European Union, and I think that is the necessary and obvious conclusion of this debate."
"Madam President, may I begin by welcoming the balanced and conscientious approach of the rapporteur and indeed of the Commissioner and of the presidency on this important brief."
"I emphasise three points."
"To my Turkish friends: the detention of 530 trade unionists on 1 May 2008 was a breach of the fundamental ILO right of free association and of the Copenhagen criteria."
"Please protect trade unions, including preventing further attacks against the Turkish road transport union Tümtis."
"To the opponents of Turkish accession: do not exploit the case against the AK party in the Constitutional Court for your political ends."
"After the crisis of the presidential nomination, elections were held and democracy won."
"Today, one way or another, I expect democracy to win again."
"To Mr Claeys, Mr Langen, Mr Belder, Mr Toubon and others who deliberately seek to undermine public support for EU accession in Turkey by the language and the threats used in this morning's debate: Turkish public opinion should understand you are not in a majority, you do not speak for this Parliament and you will not succeed in obstructing its European perspectives."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today, Turkey is a more important country for the European Union than ever before."
"The reform process in Turkey must therefore be supported and it is important for us to have a democratic Turkey based on the rule of law."
"We must have some concerns, however, which are also expressed in Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report. The question is whether Turkey is sufficiently capable of reform."
"If I look at what is happening with Article 301 of the Penal Code, freedom of religion and the Law on Foundations, minority rights and so forth, it is clear that the Erdoğan government is trying to make progress, but it has always stopped short of what is required because quite obviously, at a domestic level, the limits of Turkey's reform capacity have been reached."
"When I see, too, that there are moves to ban the governing party, just like that, and then a couple of weeks later, it starts up again under a different name without certain persons who are no longer welcome in politics, then this means that ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(ES) Madam President, violent Islamic fundamentalism that targets the West but also harms Islam is on the increase in the Middle East and the Maghreb."
"Radical Islamic fundamentalism, though non-violent, is also on the increase in a number of countries."
"This indicates the major role that Turkey can play vis-à-vis the Muslim world in its relations with the European Union."
"It can do this in its capacity as a country which is officially secular but obviously has Muslim roots and culture, and this is a true asset in terms of the relations between the EU and Muslim countries."
"That is why my Group has tabled two amendments to congratulate Turkey as co-sponsor, along with Spain, of the official UN Alliance of Civilizations project."
"This should not be forgotten, since it is through this project that Turkey shows its commitment to assist with relations between the West and the Arab-Islamic world."
"(DE) Madam President, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, may I voice my praise and respect for this report."
"It is balanced and fair, and that is a line which we should keep to today."
"We are right to emphasise that Turkey has to make further efforts."
"The goal of achieving a stable and prosperous democracy in Turkey is not only in Turkey's own interests, but is also an important strategic interest of the EU."
"I am concerned about the attitude of the incoming Council President, Mr Sarkozy."
"His policy on Turkey does not aim to achieve EU accession for Turkey."
"He is insisting on references to Turkey as an accession candidate being deleted from EU documents, and emphasises that France will only endorse the opening of chapters which do not aim at full membership."
"The EU's credibility is at stake here."
"Let me underline one point: pacta sunt servanda!"
"The opening of accession negotiations was agreed unanimously, and that means that France agreed to it as well."
"Instead of sending out negative signals, the EU should deal constructively with Turkey."
"In this House, we have decided by a majority that, with Turkey, we ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Madam President, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has produced a very balanced and objective report on Turkey which is highly commendable."
"There is a remarkable consensus among the neighbouring member countries that there should be a clear perspective for EU membership of Turkey."
"This is not by chance; the neighbouring countries always know the situation better."
"Turkey has already made immense progress in the reforms introduced to reach European democratic standards."
"Of course much remains to be done but we have to encourage Turkey in this process; we have to encourage the pro-European reform forces in Turkey, both among the ruling party and the opposition."
"With regard to the pending constitutional decision on the AK party closure case: of course it is not acceptable."
"I believe we should stay calm because I am sure that Turkey will find reason enough to overcome a potential crisis."
"We the neighbouring countries should encourage Turkey and make every effort to enhance the bilateral and trilateral transborder cooperation and reach a new quality of good neighbourly relations."
"This includes solving all outstanding bilateral issues, such as the case with the..."
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"(DE) Madam President, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has presented a sound and objective report."
"She has highlighted some progress and drawn attention to many questions and unresolved problems."
"The key question which has only been touched upon in passing is this: if Turkey were reformed, would it then have a right to membership?"
"Our current EU law offers a political alternative at the end of the negotiating process, both for the European Union and for Turkey itself."
"That is why in Austria, and elsewhere, we are calling for open-ended negotiations."
"Accession is one option, but it is not a foregone conclusion."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, since Turkey forms part of European history, since Turkey is a component of European culture, since Turkey constitutes a considerable economic and demographic opportunity for the EU, this position in favour of accession means that I can demand even more: more with respect to democratic principles, more with respect to secularity and more with respect to human rights."
"The European Union was built on values and principles that we cannot disown with a deafening silence during an accession procedure for the sake of diplomacy."
"Turkey must acknowledge the Armenian genocide, a historic and symbolic act, and this will bear witness to its political maturity."
"Parliament has insisted with all due conviction and force on this acknowledgement since June 1987."
"Twenty-one years on, must we come up with such a bland formulation?"
"If Parliament accepts this, it means taking a step backwards."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to vote for Amendment 23, to drive home to the authorities ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) The mentality of the Turks has changed little since the times of Kemal Atatürk."
"Their religious tradition is directing them along their own specific course, which differs from that of us Europeans."
"Geographic proximity does not equate to cultural closeness. In addition, the unwritten social codes do not suggest that the Turkish people are gravitating towards a European identity."
"The question then arises as to whether Turkey wishes to change and adopt our sociopolitical model, because Article 301 seems to deny this."
"Are we entitled to lecture the Turks and tell them what they should do?"
"Through its amendments, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament wishes to impose an ideologically based solution on the Turkish people, but the latter are happy as they are."
"Hardly any progress has been made on reforms, and the army still plays a very important role."
"Are we to impose well-being on the nation by force, changing its identity, tradition and culture?"
"In any case, is all this actually susceptible to change?"
"Madam President, the Council decided on negotiations in good faith, so that Turkey could become a bridge between Europe and Islam. Now it is no longer convinced that its own decision was right."
"All we have left is wishful thinking."
"(PT) Madam President, in general I welcome and support Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report, particularly the concern expressed about the implications of the AK Party closure case."
"Furthermore, we now have a fabulous window of opportunity which must be used to settle the Cyprus question."
"As stated by the report, it is also essential that the Turkish Government pursues its reforms, with respect for pluralism and diversity in a democratic and secular Turkey, and that all citizens should be able to develop their cultural identity within the democratic Turkish state."
"Clearly, progress is also needed in other areas, such as the defence of trade union rights and greater advances along the road towards effective gender equality."
"However, the report recognises that much progress needed to modernise Turkish society has already been made."
"Madam President, Turkey's progress towards full integration must continue strictly in accordance with the conditions agreed by the European Council and adopted by this Parliament."
"No more and no less."
"(EL) Madam President, we all know that there is a new climate in Cyprus today."
"Both Greek and Turkish Cypriots want a solution to the Cyprus problem and are eager to serve the interests of their country for the good of both sides."
"This is precisely where Turkey is intervening, as Turkish forces are occupying part of Cyprus."
"Turkey is controlling the situation politically, and it is time it realised that it has to abandon this policy."
"It is in Turkey's interests that the Cyprus problem should be solved."
"Above all, the army, which has been negatively interfering throughout the process, has to realise that the Cyprus problem needs to be solved."
"It is high time for Turkey's occupation and interference to come to an end so that Greek and Turkish Cypriots can coexist peacefully in the EU."
"We can achieve this and I believe that we can live peacefully."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) Given the shortage of time and the noise in the hall I shall try to be very brief."
"The debate that has just been concluded, and above all the report prepared by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, have confirmed what the Council is also aware of: every reform process is difficult."
"This also applies to Turkey."
"In this process the State is faced with considerable dilemmas concerning values such as secularism, democracy and human rights."
"This is evident from the trials that have been mentioned numerous times, which have been mentioned in the report and which the Council too has considered, from trials such as the proceedings against political parties, from the debate on ladies' head-scarves, on the status of women in general, on religious freedom, and on freedom of expression, among other things."
"I would emphasise this: in those areas in which Turkey has achieved progress, the progress is evident although not sufficient."
"Progress is evident in changes made to the criminal justice system, basic legislation, the status of women - just look at the number of women in Parliament, which has increased - but of course, in all these areas the progress made is still not sufficient."
"As regards Cyprus, I should also like to emphasise that the Council expects from Turkey primarily two things: a constructive role in the negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations, and the implementation of a protocol which was added to the Ankara Treaty."
"These are the main tasks, but there are also others."
"In all of this it is, of course, useful if Turkey has an objective."
"And this objective has been provided, it has been mutually agreed when the European Union granted Turkey candidate status, and the accession negotiations have been continued under this precondition."
"The Slovenian Presidency has set the accession negotiations with Turkey as one of its primary objectives, and we hope that this goal will be achieved, so that we can open additional negotiation chapters in the near future."
"Of course, the achievement of the final objective is not certain; it depends on the accession negotiations, on how successful the reforms are, and it depends on us, the Member States, as well as on the candidate countries."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I want to thank the rapporteur and the Members for a very serious and responsible debate at a very critical time for EU-Turkey relations."
"I have taken due note of your messages which are also codified in the draft resolution and in the compromise amendments."
"I would pick up three particular messages, the first being that it is essential to relaunch the reforms in full so that the fundamental freedoms of Turkish citizens are enhanced and Turkey is itself helped to meet the EU Copenhagen criteria."
"The second message is that citizens' rights must be respected in the everyday life of society."
"I share your concern in compromise Amendment 32 about the excessive use of force by Turkish police against demonstrators at this year's May Day rally in Istanbul."
"It is important that we reaffirm that the freedom of association and the peaceful operation of trade unions represent a fundamental right under the European Convention of Human Rights."
"The third and final message is that the European Parliament is clearly very concerned about the closure case."
"Closing down a political party is not, and cannot be, business as usual."
"It cannot be taken lightly in a European democracy."
"So there is much at stake again this year in Turkey and in EU-Turkey relations."
"The best medicine to truly revitalise Turkey's EU accession process is to ensure that the reforms move forward, that a genuine political dialogue is started in Turkey and that both democracy and secularism are respected."
"rapporteur. - (NL) I thank my colleagues who have worked together so excellently."
"As I have said before, it is only if we are united that we can make it clear that the reform process in Turkey is necessary."
"We can all send a positive signal by voting for the report by a large majority."
"That will help Turkey reform and ensure that individual freedoms are guaranteed and the rule of law is established."
"That is all necessary for a modern society in which men and women do well."
"I once again urge my fellow Members to avoid any political games when voting on the amendments and to make sure there is a large absolute majority for this report on Turkey to be adopted in plenary."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
", in writing. - Turkey as the largest state with accession perspectives is and will be a strategically important partner and ally of Europe."
"It is in the interest of all to develop a reliable relationship based on values and mutual respect."
"The EU must support the democratically elected government and should condemn attempts to undermine it."
"However, pursuing EU membership can only be reliable if the candidate country recognizes and conducts normal relations with each and every EU Member State."
"Although the current situation shows signs of consolidation, I still call upon Turkey to finally meet the fundamental accession criteria in recognizing the Republic of Cyprus and withdrawing Turkish army units."
"Fully meeting the Copenhagen criteria is continuously a key condition for EU membership."
"The Turkish administration has made considerable efforts in this field."
"In 2007 democracy was strengthened there."
"Still, a political initiative for a lasting settlement of the Kurdish issue is expected, including real possibilities to study and use the Kurdish language."
"We also look forward to convincing measures to stop religiously motivated violence against Christian minorities and the providing of equal opportunities for all religious communities to freely erect houses of worship."
", in writing. - (FI) Madam President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for a balanced report."
"In my opinion it sends an honest and critical, though at the same time, positive and optimistic signal to Turkey."
"It supports the attempts at reform made by Turkey's progressive and moderate forces by clearly mentioning those aspects of society where the country has made progress."
"At the same time it still expresses its concern for the situation regarding freedom of speech, gender equality, the Kurds and other minorities, and the use of violence by the authorities."
"We have to remember that we are now engaged in accession negotiations based on the Copenhagen criteria."
"If the country meets the criteria and fulfils the principles of a European state governed by the rule of law, I see no reason why accession should be blocked."
"The Turkey which will perhaps join the EU ten or twenty years from now will be a different Turkey from that we see today."
"If we really want a democratic, stable and peaceful Turkey, we should at least not close the door to membership in its face."
"Do not let us be accused of cheap populism and xenophobia."
"A European Turkey is in the interests not only of the EU and Turkey itself, but the world as a whole."
"Turkey should be given a chance."
", in writing. - (HU) We are debating Turkey's accession, in other words whether this country, with its Asian legacy, can become European."
"Acknowledging the genocide of the Armenians, guaranteeing the rights of the Kurdish minority, equal opportunities for women - these are only a few among many fundamental problems."
"We speak of European Union expectations and standards, but meanwhile there are persistent problems within the EU itself with regard to democracy and human and minority rights."
"In Romania just now we are preparing for local authority elections."
"In recent days the past has reared its head again in Timişoara, or Temesvár: by a majority vote, the election committee of Timiş County upheld a complaint lodged by a physical person requesting the removal of some posters belonging to the RMDSZ, the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania."
"The only votes in favour of the RMDSZ member came from the Democratic Liberal Party, PDL, and two female judges on the election committee."
"The anti-minority, anti-Hungarian attitude demonstrated by members of some political parties is intolerable and unacceptable."
"What can we expect of Turkey if we are still battling with problems like these within the EU?"
"Anti-Roma sentiment in Rome, collective guilt in Slovakia, anti-Hungarian attitudes in Timişoara ..."
", in writing. - (DE) Regrettably, since the start of this year, tragic and worrying reports have continued to pour in to us about cross-border incursions by the Turkish military, about deaths and injuries caused in combat in the south-east of the country and on Turkey's border with northern Iraq, and about disproportionate and brutal assaults by the security forces, especially on children and women, during this year's Kurdish Nevroz festival."
"The report by the Dutch Member, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, makes some important points but is far too timid a response to the seriousness of the political situation in Turkey."
"So as to avoid giving offence to the country's political leaders, it fails to demand, with the requisite clarity, the core elements of the reforms that are necessary in Turkey."
"In my view, these core elements can be clearly defined:"
"1. civilian measures to restrict and control the influence of the military in Turkey;"
"2. a conclusive break with the notion that the Kurdish question can be resolved by military means, and a clear commitment to a political solution and reconciliation;"
"3. the unconditional repeal of Article 301 of the Penal Code and all other articles which curtail freedom of thought and freedom of opinion;"
"4. a declaration of a clear political commitment to the full emancipation of women."
"The report should have expressed itself in less equivocal and far more resolute terms on these issues."
"2."
"Banning of exports and the safe storage of metallic mercury ("
"- Before the vote:"
"Mr President, I thank the shadow rapporteurs once again for their excellent cooperation."
"During or dialogue with their representatives who were present at all stages, we have arrived at a very satisfactory compromise with the Council, thanks to the Commission's contribution."
"However, there is a risk that this compromise may collapse, leaving us back at square one, if Amendments 37 and 41 on Almadén are approved."
"Let me remind you, ladies and gentlemen, that at first reading I, too, as rapporteur, supported the Almadén amendments, but we are now faced with reality."
"Neither the Council nor the Commission accepts these amendments."
"If they are approved, we shall be back at square one."
"A year ago, the Council accepted only one of the European Parliament's amendments."
"Now, with the cooperation of all the political groups, we have succeeded in having 22 amendments accepted in the text of the agreement."
"I ask you: are we going to sacrifice this success?"
"Yesterday, Commissioner Dimas was quite clear."
"The Commission does not accept Amendments 37 and 41."
"In the Council, not even the Spanish Government insisted on these amendments."
"I therefore call on you to reject these amendments so that we can make good the significant progress achieved in our agreement with the Council over protecting the environment and public health."
"This will allow us to approve a satisfactory move towards banning the export of mercury by a very large majority."
"3."
"Protection of the environment through criminal law ("
"- Before the vote:"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this declaration may not amount to the same rhetoric as Mr Cohn-Bendit's."
"I have to read this declaration and I quote: 'The Commission took note of the following amendment adopted in the Committee on Legal Affairs: ""Where a continuing activity proves after a lapse of time to give rise to environmental damage which may in turn give rise to criminal liability under this Directive, the question whether or not the perpetrator of the damage acted intentionally or negligently should be determined by reference to the time when the perpetrator became aware, or should have been aware, of the facts constituting the offence and not to the time when the perpetrator commenced its activity."
"It should be borne in mind in this connection that the prior grant of an authorisation, licence or concession should not constitute a defence in such circumstances.”"
"We fully understand the concerns expressed in this amendment."
"These matters fall within the competence of Member States and we are confident that they will take due account of these important concerns.'"
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the two declarations prompt me to point out, for the benefit of those fellow Members who may not have fully understood what is going on, that these declarations form part of the compromise which we have agreed."
"We asked for clarification of two or three problems which has been provided in this way."
"However, the subject of the legislative procedure is of course solely the text as agreed jointly by us."
"I have the letter here from the Chair of Coreper - which is currently chaired by Slovenia - which confirms that this text, if we adopt it today, will also be approved by the Council. That means, of course, that we will have agreement at first reading which will give us the legislative success that we want to achieve."
"4."
"Farm structure surveys and the survey on agricultural production methods ("
"- Before the vote:"
"rapporteur. - (HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, farm structure surveys are some of the oldest Community-level statistical surveys, and they provide substantial and necessary information on agricultural holdings in the European Union."
"Especially now that we have an enlarged EU that includes twelve new Member States, and since we are working at this very moment on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, it is exceedingly important to be able to conduct a new and comprehensive survey as soon as possible."
"We need comparable and uniform data to enable us to devise an equitable and properly functioning agricultural policy."
"This is why I have tried to ensure that we will be able to reach an agreement at the first reading, and get these surveys under way as soon as possible."
"I would especially like to thank my fellow Members who participated in the trialogue for their exceptionally constructive approach; I would particularly like to thank Mrs Elisabeth Jeggle and Messrs Nicolas Meves and Alexis Kuhl for their work."
"The amendments tabled as a result of the trialogue have been put into block one."
"I would ask you all to support the amendments in block one and then we will be able to close this dossier. Many thanks."
"5."
"Conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator ("
"- Before the vote on Amendment 108:"
"(DE) Mr President, Amendments 108 and 117 are not compatible in my view and so, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I propose that we support Amendment 108 and withdraw Amendment 117."
"6."
"International carriage of passengers by coach and bus (recast) ("
"- Before the vote:"
"(DE) Mr President, in the interests of fairness, I announced on Monday that we would be requesting the postponement of the vote on this report, not because Mr Grosch has done a bad job - quite the contrary - but because we want to take more time to look at the issue of rest periods and integrate it in precise terms in this report."
"We have held talks with the groups and have found that there is considerable backing for this proposal."
"Even Mr Jarzembowski, who was most difficult to convince, advised me this morning that he now supports the proposal."
"I therefore hope that we can deal with the matter in this way, and so I request postponement to one of the two next part-sessions."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, as the rapporteur, I agree with the proposal, as does the PPE-DE Group, and I would like to make it clear that we have taken note of the agreement between the social partners."
"However, we are using the time with a view to incorporating this into an amendment."
"(Parliament approved the proposal)"

"Scientific facts of climate change: findings and recommendations for decision-making ("
"- Before the vote:"
"On the Florenz report, I should state that Amendments 5, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 are inadmissible for this report."
"However, they may be tabled when we deal with the main report."
"I have received a number of e-mails on this issue."
"All the services and the Legal Service have looked at this in detail and have concluded that these amendments are inadmissible for this report."
"They are, however, admissible for the final report."
"Mr President, I must say that I am able to accept this argumentation for all amendments with the exception of 15."
"I do not know why 15 is not acceptable for voting just now."
"Mr Březina, the answer which I have received - and I have received an e-mail about this specific amendment - was the same as for all these particular amendments."
"I have to rely on that."
"Amendment 15 may be tabled for the main report, however, so it could become part of the main report."
"13."
"Turkey's 2007 progress report ("
"- Before the vote on Amendment 11:"
"(DE) Mr President, we agree with our fellow Members that we should give appropriate recognition to the role of the Kurdish language in Turkey."
"Paragraph 11 requires some linguistic clarification on one point, however."
"I would therefore like to propose an oral amendment which has been agreed with the other shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteur."
"In the amended version, the sentence would therefore read as follows:"
"'including real possibilities to learn Kurdish within the public and private schooling system and to use it in broadcasting, in daily life and in access to public services'."
"(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)"
"- Before the vote on paragraph 19:"
"rapporteur. - (NL) We want to drop the word 'neighbouring' because we want the Ombudsman to work with all European ombudsmen and ombudswomen."
"(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)"
"Voting time"
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(For the outcome and other details of the vote: see Minutes)"
"Mr President, before we take the vote on the calendar, could I raise the point about tomorrow's intended strike."
"I understand that Air France will be on strike, the trains will be on strike and the airport workers will be on strike."
"This makes our life as parliamentarians impossible."
"I have spent the morning trying to reschedule flights in order that I can return to my constituency."
"It means that I will miss the voting session tomorrow."
"It is interfering with our work as parliamentarians."
"We are about to vote on the calendar, which requires us to come here twelve times a year, and yet France does nothing to make our life easy in coming here."
"It is almost impossible."
"If we are going to continue to come to Strasbourg, perhaps we could make some changes to the transport systems to enable us to come here?"
"(Applause)"
"Mr Stevenson, we note what you have said but we should not start a debate at this juncture before we adopt the calendar of part-sessions on this general basis."
"(FR) Mr President, I simply wish to tell the Member that the right to strike exists in the European Union, the right to strike is the right to strike, and I also find it incredible for a country to be asked to provide a strike calendar."
"This is ridiculous, completely ridiculous."
"I also wish to tell our colleague that Belgian workers have been on strike on many occasions, and so where would this Parliament go if the Belgians went on strike?"
"It is a ridiculous discussion."
"If he wishes to go back, he can go back; if he wishes to stay, all he has to do is stay another day and have some asparagus."
"(Applause from the left)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, these two contributions have made it clear how pluralistic the European Union is in nature, and I think that in principle we should be grateful for that."
"However, I would like to add - and I say this in all seriousness, not as a criticism but as an example of how the law of the European Union works - that if someone starts to question applicable law, we will end up in chaos."
"I therefore suggest that we now proceed to the vote and respect the law of the European Union."
"We all know who decides on the seat of the European Parliament, so I would ask all of you, please, to allow us to proceed calmly to the vote on the calendar of part-sessions."
"Mr Stevenson, you will receive notification from the administration, as will everyone else, on the situation with regard to travel conditions tomorrow."
"Rheumatic diseases (written declaration): see Minutes"
"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"Mr President, I have only a brief remark regarding the parliamentary calendar next year."
"Although the parliamentary elections have been fixed for the period from 4 to 7 June, thus cutting my term one week shorter than 5 years, I am glad that the elections are not being held from 11 to 14 June."
"Sunday is traditionally the day when elections are held in Estonia, but had the European elections been held on 14 June - the national day of mourning commemorating the mass deportation of 1941 carried out by the Soviet authorities - the flags would have been flying at half mast all over Estonia."
"It would not have been a very happy day to hold the elections to the European Parliament."
"(DE) Mr President, this was the last calendar vote in this legislative term and we have averted five attempts to challenge Strasbourg as the seat of Parliament, and as the sole seat of Parliament, through irrational amendments."
"Nonetheless, may I say that we should have a comprehensive reform, because it is after all a matter of money and CO2 emissions."
"May I make the point that, if we were to concentrate on the 12 plenary weeks in the year and fully utilise all five days in these weeks once more, we could then do away with the expensive and unnecessary mini-plenaries in Brussels and replace them with constituency weeks. This would bring us closer to our citizens and give us more time for our real work."
"It would also be much cheaper, we would cut our CO2 emissions, and all this could be achieved through our own decisions without an amendment of the Treaties."
"As long as there is no Treaty amendment, we should use the current Treaties as rationally and efficiently as possible."
"That is why I believe that we should adopt the approach that I have proposed."
"Mr President, when this regulation came before Parliament at first reading, I opposed attempts to allow mercury to be stored, not only in salt mines but also in underground facilities adapted for waste disposal."
"It was clear that anhydrite mines were being included in the expanded definition and this was very worrying for the people of Billingham in my constituency, who are fighting plans to use the former anhydrite mines under their homes for waste disposal."
"Unfortunately, the text voted today at second reading has reintroduced the possibility of storing mercury in sites other than salt mines, specifically in deep underground hard rock formations."
"As the Billingham anhydrite mines may come under this new definition of permitted sites, I felt it necessary to abstain on the vote on the compromise package since there is no final vote at second reading."
"This is despite agreeing very much with the ban on the export of mercury from Europe."
"(CS) Today it is no longer tolerable for serious environmental crimes and crimes concerning public health to be considered merely an offence, as they have been to date in some countries, for example in Italy or Cyprus."
"That is why I supported the directive obliging all countries to include relevant criminal sanctions in their legislation within two years, in spite of objections from Eurosceptics."
"On the other hand, the Czech Republic, as well as many other countries, will have to introduce liability under criminal law for legal persons, which for post-socialist countries is an unknown historical concept."
"We will have to decide whether to go for the German model in which violations of law by legal persons are decided by administrative authorities or whether to choose the judicial authorities model typical of France, Britain and now also Slovenia."
"We will also have to decide whether it should be the entire legal person or the management who will be held liable."
"I fear that the two years we have to complete implementation will not be enough."
"Mr President, I voted against this measure."
"It seems that climate alarmism and environmentalism are rapidly taking on the characteristics of a religion."
"They are based on faith not fact."
"And the possibility of carbon offsetting has been rightly compared with the medieval purchase of papal indulgences."
"Now we have Mr Nassauer introducing what appears to be a sort of environmental blasphemy law."
"I have considerable reservations about these environmental issues being dealt with by criminal law rather than civil law, in any case."
"But the real problem here is the extension of European law."
"The people I represent want to have trade, want to have cooperation in Europe but they do not want political union and they do not want a European legal system."
"We should resist every further move to create Europe responsibilities and European competence in these areas."
"Mr President, while this report seems to remove references to specific sanctions, it does make reference to what actions should be considered criminal activity within Member States."
"So let us consider a scenario where someone in my constituency - London, the greatest city in the world, capital of the greatest country in the world - commits an act which is not considered a criminal act under English law (a body of law that has been arrived at through common law tradition and through reason) but which, because we have decided to impose this EU law from above, setting reason aside, over the heads of the citizens of my constituency, is now considered a criminal act under EU law."
"What will that lead to?"
"How will my constituents respond?"
"I will tell you how they will respond."
"They will say: 'What nonsense is this?"
"Why is it that what is not considered under reasonable English law to be a criminal act, is a criminal act under European law?"
"It is time to leave the European Union!'"
"Therefore we have to be careful we are not driving the UK out of the EU."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I asked the President for the floor for a moment following the adoption of Mr Nassauer's report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament on protection through criminal law."
"I particularly wanted to congratulate the rapporteur because this is a report of great importance."
"There was a major debate in committee and we reached a very intelligent, high-quality compromise through the intervention of Monica Frassoni."
"Indeed, I feel the need to highlight this particular area of the committee's work and especially congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Nassauer."
"(PL) With reference to the report by Mr Nassauer, I have to say that I voted in favour of it."
"Although all Member States have adopted the same provisions, the latter are being implemented in many different ways."
"This encourages undesirable behaviour whereby irresponsible entrepreneurs relocate their economic activity to countries where criminal sanctions for offences against the environment are less severe."
"This affects the new Member States of the Union in particular."
"It should be emphasised that offences committed within the framework of criminal organisations are becoming more and more significant, and that offences against the environment are increasingly of a cross-border nature."
"I agree with the rapporteur's stance that the legal framework defined in the proposal for a directive represents an important contribution to effective protection of the environment, and can guarantee uniform and responsible implementation of environmental protection law within the Community."
"Appropriately trained officials are a sine qua non for effective implementation of the law and actual reduction of offences against the environment."
"The proposal to specify the obligations of Member States in this regard clearly is therefore entirely relevant."
"I should like to make the following comment for the benefit of the Member from the United Kingdom who may be labouring under a misunderstanding."
"We are not creating new Community legislation to impose sanctions. That proved impossible."
"Instead, we are insisting that every Member State implements the necessary legislation within its own legal system so as to ensure that across the length and breadth of Europe uniform penalties are applied for similar offences."
"(CS) Today, 21 May, marks another nail in the coffin of the Eurosceptics because, together with the Council, we have voted for a joint decision that will help to partly transfer the telecommunication spectrum rights of the 27 Member States to the European Union."
"This shows the importance of the European Union."
"If the Member States cannot successfully manage something themselves, they entrust the Union with it, in the interests of European citizens."
"Today it is a matter of removing legislative obstacles to the future development of mobile satellite services for emergency communications, for saving the lives, health and property of half a billion citizens."
"Ships and aircraft already use this system which, thanks to modern technology, could perform further functions as two-way multimedia, satellite television broadcasting and broadband internet access."
"However, this decision should not become a standard in the area of telecommunications."
"The exclusive rights to other parts of the spectrum continue to remain a matter for the national regulators."
"I hope that in countries that are somewhat Eurosceptic, such as the Czech Republic or Britain, the media will pay sufficient attention to this subject, which represents good news for citizens."
"Mr President, I am pleased to be able to support this report because it does not seem to be an example of coercion but rather of cooperation."
"In fact I worked in this area in a previous career."
"I advised companies on mobile satellite services."
"One of the things that the companies had to face up to was the fact that they misunderstood the market."
"About five operators launched global satellite services in the late 1990s."
"Despite their best estimates, they completely misunderstood the market because they thought the market was the international business traveller, but the technology in this market was superseded by developments in cellular technology."
"I am pleased that we have an opportunity for these companies to try again to create a global mobile satellite service market, which I think would be of great benefit, particularly to people in developing countries where terrestrial networks have no reach."
"Therefore I welcome this report and I voted in favour."
"(CS) I would like to explain why I voted the way I did on the report by Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz."
"In the final vote I voted against this report and I want to emphasise, as Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, that the reason was not my lack of understanding of the seriousness of this subject or an intention to dismiss or dispute the rapporteur's work in any way."
"I did not agree with several statements and phrases which I not only found to be politically incorrect but also - in some cases - untrue."
"I also consider the decision of the Tabling Office regarding the inadmissibility of the proposal without giving any reasons to be unacceptable, scandalous and somewhat erroneous. Thank you for your understanding."
"(CS) I did not vote for the report by my colleague Mr Florenz either."
"Everything that is branded, and presented, as a scientific fact must explain the scientific opinions expressed by both groups of scientists, those who agree as well as those who do not agree."
"The statements in the report are presented as a clear scientific consensus."
"However, this is not the case."
"The opposing camp is also important."
"The principle of tentative caution was often stressed during the debate."
"Could we not also use this in regard to overly strict and one-sided conclusions concerning climate change policy?"
"As a geologist I can assure you that, many times in the past, the earth has warmed up much more than by those demonised 2°C, and no tragic events took place."
"After all, humankind has always been living in a time of continuous climatic change."
"(SK) I voted for the interim report by the rapporteur, Karl-Heinz Florenz, in which the scientific knowledge of climate change plays an important role."
"At the same time I find it regrettable that some amendments by my colleague Mr Březina and 40 other Members, in particular Amendment 15, were not accepted in this report."
"These amendments would have enhanced the text."
"Scientists constantly keep revising their theses, which means that we too must be open to new ideas."
"Some of the global climate change brought about by human activity manifests itself, to a large degree, as water drainage in certain regions."
"Consequently, containing rainwater in a region and draining away only the natural surplus water is a prerequisite for ensuring environmental security and global stability and, last but not least, for maintaining economic growth."
"I trust that the New Water Paradigm will become a new useful idea over the next few decades, and that it will become humankind's manifesto for the future of civilisation."
"(PL) Mr President, we have today adopted an exceptionally important report on combating climate change."
"There are close links between the latter and problems relating to energy."
"We are experiencing more and more frequent droughts, floods, desertification, and the melting of glaciers. It must surely be clear to everyone by now that our climate is changing."
"Social, environmental and financial problems are emerging due to the rising temperatures."
"If we really want to protect our planet, our own Earth, then all of us, all the countries and societies in the entire world have to slow down or halt further increases in the level of CO2 emissions and emissions of other greenhouse gases."
"Environmentally friendly investment should be promoted, along with clean energy and energy-saving installations. Above all, priority should be given to convincing people to save energy, and to increasing their knowledge and awareness."
"That may well prove the quickest way to achieve results."
"We need to find a compromise solution on restricting emissions of greenhouse gases within the Union."
"The new Member States should be treated differently from the more developed ones. The former would then have a chance to catch up and eliminate differences in the level of economic development."
"(DE) Mr President, first of all, may I comment on Mr Florenz's report which, in my view, has summed up the current scientific consensus very well."
"Nonetheless, I voted against the report. The climate is an important issue, and I agree that we must take action here."
"However, the scientific consensus is only a provisional consensus, just as every scientific consensus of the past hundred years was short term in nature."
"In every case, we move on from them."
"The report before us does not offer us enough opportunities here."
"What is more, the specific measures outlined are one-sided."
"We must ensure that Europe does not forfeit any of its economic capacities. Europe cannot save the world on its own."
"Other countries need to be involved as a matter of urgency in addressing this global problem."
"That is the only way to implement the scientific consensus."
"We cannot bear this burden on our own."
"Against this background, what I feel is lacking in the report is the catalogue of measures which are required to mitigate climate change."
"We probably cannot stop it altogether."
"That being the case, I believe that measures that will permanently alter our industrial structures cannot be adopted on the basis of what is only a provisional scientific consensus."
"Mr President, I voted against the Florenz report."
"One of the greatest myths of climate alarmism is that there is a scientific consensus and that all scientists agree."
"As a member of the Temporary Committee on Climate Change I know why Mr Florenz's report turned out the way it did: they only listened to one side of the debate and therefore they concluded there was a consensus."
"In the debate earlier today, Mr Booth reminded us of the Oregon Declaration, which 30 000 relevant scientists have signed, challenging the whole basis of climate alarmism."
"There is no consensus; there is a powerful and growing body of scientific opinion which takes the other view."
"In the mean time we are going to do huge economic damage to the people we represent in a futile and doomed attempt to influence a speculative problem, which, in the view of many people, does not exist."
"It is the economic damage which will crucify us, and it will crucify specifically Europe because developing countries like China and India have far too much common sense to be taken in by it."
"(BG) The delegation of the Ataka Party voted against the so-called Report on Turkey's Progress because we do not see what this progress might involve."
"What we do see in Turkey is a state where an Islamistic party is in office, the head of state is an Islamistic president."
"A state which does not even come close to respecting human rights, a state which exercises oppression against an entire nation and wages a war, even as we speak, on an entire nation with the aim to destroy it, and that nation is the Kurdish people."
"A state which is heavily militarized, where there is a covert military junta, and Turkish policy takes whatever direction the generals point it to."
"A state which continues to occupy the territory of an EU Member State even as we speak."
"A state like that is not eligible for any negotiations until these severe problems have been eliminated in real terms."
"(NL) To my mind, the Oomen-Ruijten report is yet another missed opportunity to get down to business on the potential accession by Turkey to the European Union."
"The report focuses on what are, in my view, a number of side issues, whereas the main point about all this is still, of course, that Turkey is in no way a European country, will never in any way be a European country and consequently there can be no question of a non-European country acceding to the European Union."
"End of story!"
"However, I should also mention, by the way, that I was surprised to hear in the debate, from my Socialist colleague Mr Swoboda amongst others, that it is absolutely unacceptable for parties to be banned in Turkey."
"I remind you that in my country in 2004 the biggest party in the country, Vlaams Blok, which won 24% of the vote, was simply proscribed and had to be disbanded."
"I do not recall any protest from the Socialists at the time."
"On the contrary, their solidarity is confined to the Islamic fundamentalists, which is duly noted."
"(CS) Mr President, I have been saying, for many years, that a privileged partnership between the Union and Turkey would have been far more beneficial than the promise of Turkey's entry into the European Union."
"Unfortunately, the progress report confirms that, although accession negotiations have been opened, the Copenhagen criteria have not yet been met."
"This is not the case with just one area."
"It affects freedom of religion, minority rights, equal opportunities (for women in particular), corruption, Kurdish and Cyprus issues and of course also the power of the army over government policies."
"Just like the rapporteur, I also welcome the government's efforts to ensure progress but, alas, this progress is not visible."
"On the contrary: Turkey is banning a political party, has a new Article 301 used to prosecute writers and intellectuals for insulting Turkishness, and politically or religiously motivated hostility and violence are also on the increase."
"The murder of Hrant Dink has not been solved so far, and neither have other murders."
"That said, I accept that the report is well-balanced and honest."
"(PL) Mr President, we have adopted an important report."
"We should give due recognition and support to the changes implemented in Turkey pursuant to the accession negotiations."
"In view of its particular geopolitical position, Turkey is a strategic partner for the Union where the latter's negotiations with countries in the Black Sea area, Central Asia and the Middle East are concerned."
"Turkey is also vitally important to ensuring Europe's energy security, because energy resources from the Caspian and Black Sea areas are transported to Europe across Turkish territory."
"In addition, Turkey has enormous economic potential."
"It has a dynamic economy, a huge internal market, and a society largely of an age to be active on the labour market. I am confident that all this will contribute to the development of Europe's economy in the future."
"One further aspect of Turkey's accession merits a mention. As an Islamic country that is also a Member State of the Union, it will be able to play an important role in developing relations between the West and the Islamic world."
"(DE) Mr President, I voted in favour of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report although it contains many compromise phrases."
"I did so because, at the start, it contains a crucial sentence, namely that the opening of negotiations is the starting-point for a long-lasting and open-ended process. That is the only reason why I was able to vote in favour of the report."
"Let me make it quite clear that my party, the Christian Social Union, has always been, and continues to be, pro-Turkish."
"We campaigned and worked hard for the Customs Union which was adopted by this House by a majority of just one vote."
"It could be argued that, at the time, it was my vote."
"We have supported Turkey in NATO and on a wide range of issues."
"Let me also make it quite clear, however, that Turkey is not a European country, and I share Mrs Roithová's view that a privileged partnership, a tailor-made special status, is the right solution."
"This is the solution which will ultimately be achieved."
"We should finally stop pursuing this blind alley towards supposed accession."
"This accession is not going to happen, so it would be more honest and better for both sides if we could get together as soon as possible and agree to pursue another route, a route towards a partnership of equals, without common institutions but with common interests and a practical and agreed programme of cooperation."
"(DE) Mr President, although Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report contains many criticisms of Turkey, I voted against it because, in my view, full membership for Turkey cannot be the aim of the accession negotiations."
"Mr Posselt has already made this point."
"I believe that we should start as quickly as possible to offer Turkey this privileged partnership."
"Turkey is not part of Europe nor does it perform a bridging function to the Islamic countries."
"In Sudan, persecution of Christians has been taking place for years in Darfur."
"Turkey has had the opportunity for many years to play a part in ending these crimes against Christians in Sudan."
"However, I have yet to see Turkey make any moves in that direction."
"That is why I voted against the report: because Turkey does not belong as a full member of the European Union."
"(BG) Mr. President, I supported the Report on Turkey's Progress although there are still certain risks related to that country's way to the European Union."
"I was motivated by the fact that the report includes texts dealing with protection of human rights, protection of the rights of women in two important areas: reproductive health and equal opportunities, particularly in terms of access to education."
"The second point I would like to note refers to the safeguards demanded in the report in relation to neighbourhood policy."
"The issues still outstanding in terms of neighbouring countries need to be resolved, and one such issue refers to Bulgarian refugees from Thrace."
"This issue also has to do with fundamental human rights."
"Its dimensions go beyond property and financial aspects."
"Its moral aspects are particularly important."
"Without getting preoccupied with the past, we would like to see clear actions in the future and observation of the agreement signed between our two countries; that is why I supported the report."
"Written explanations of vote"
"in writing. - I supported all the amendments to the calendar that reduced our time in Strasbourg and increased it in Brussels."
"The current situation is bizarre, trekking as we do backwards and forwards between Brussels and Strasbourg at vast cost in time and money."
"We should meet at a single location."
"I do however reject Mr Stevenson's complaint regarding the current transport strikes."
"We recognise and support the right to strike."
"Our objection to Strasbourg is not based on any opposition to the exercise of workers' rights in France, but the inherent waste involved in our current institutional arrangements."
"I voted against making an exception for the Monday of Orthodox Easter when we make no provision for not meeting on 14 July."
"Secular celebrations deserve the same treatment as religious festivals."
"in writing. - (SV) We actually want all the sittings of the European Parliament to be held in Brussels and we want the travelling circus between Brussels and Strasbourg to end as soon as possible."
"We have therefore voted for the proposals that the Monday sittings and Thursday afternoon sittings during Strasbourg part-sessions should be discontinued, in the hope that the sittings in Strasbourg will be phased out completely."
"The European Parliament should have a single seat and a single place of work."
"It is regrettable that there are Member States whose political leaders consider themselves to be strong supporters of the European idea but at the same time will not give an inch when their national interests are at stake."
"in writing. - I am generally in favour of what is proposed for the 2009 calendar of part-sessions."
"However, I believe that amendments requesting an extension of the time spent in Strasbourg would not contribute to the efficient running of the Parliament."
"Indeed, efficiency and logic demands that there be one single Parliament seat in Brussels."
"My views on this issue are reflected in my vote."
"in writing. - (PT) We regard as positive the recognition of the environmental and social problems arising from the closure of mercury mines in the Community. We also regard as positive the acceptance that projects and other initiatives must continue to be supported, based on the available financing instruments, in order to allow affected areas to find viable solutions for the local environment, employment and economic activity."
"It has also been agreed that the permit applicant must take the necessary measures, through a financial guarantee or equivalent mechanism, to ensure that the obligations arising from the permit (including maintenance operations after closure) shall be fulfilled and that the closure operations shall be carried out."
"It has also been approved that industry sectors that gain mercury from the cleaning of natural gas or as a by-product from non-ferrous mining and smelting operations must provide relevant data to the Commission and the competent authorities of the Member States concerned."
"The Commission shall make this information publicly available."
"We also feel it is right to encourage the provision of technical assistance to developing countries and countries with economies in transition, especially assistance which facilitates the shift towards alternative mercury-free technologies and the eventual phase-out of uses and releases of mercury and mercury compounds."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for this report which aims to bring the ban on exports of mercury forward to 15 March 2011, three months before the date proposed by the Council."
"Mercury can be produced by waste recycling (fluorescent tubes or batteries, for instance), cleaning of natural gas or industrial processing of non-ferrous metals."
"I am pleased that, in addition to metallic mercury, the ban includes mercury-containing products that cannot be sold or distributed in the European Union, cinnabar ore and mercury compounds."
"It is likewise extremely important that compounds used for research and development, in medicines or in analytic processes not be included in the ban, as stated in the report."
"Storage must be made secure, as suggested by both the report and the Council."
"Mercury waste stored temporarily for more than one year must be kept in deep underground hard rock formations or in above-ground facilities in such a way as to prevent any risk to human health and the environment before it is processed."
"in writing. - I generally support Dimitrios Papadimoulis' report on the banning of exports and the safe storage of metallic mercury."
"Bringing forward the date of the export ban to 2010 allows for greater coherence with the EU's overall mercury strategy."
"I also support the extension of the types of mercury covered within the ban."
"I further feel that, before the ban comes into force, more research is required regarding safe disposal methods for mercury."
"I voted in favour of the report."
"Does hypocrisy have no limits?"
"The European Commission rightly proposes banning the use of mercury and creating suitable infrastructures to store it, in view of its high toxicity and the risks to public health."
"The Commission nonetheless insists on promoting fluorescent bulbs to save energy, knowing that they contain at least 5 mg mercury each, a particularly dangerous amount, given the number of bulbs in every home or workplace."
"Profit is everything."
"The investments and profits of monopolies must be protected even if they are demonstrably at the expense of public health."
"The EU prohibits the use of mercury but allows companies to offer free light bulbs containing mercury in order to promote their sales."
"Responsibility for public health is assigned to the companies. They have to manage waste collection, although it is known that waste will end up in dumps and refuse bins."
"Society as a whole, and not just those who use the bulbs, will be exposed to the considerable risk of contamination."
"This, of course, is why in general they can be disposed of in landfills. Indeed, to forestall protests that would affect sales, not even the most basic steps are being taken to inform the public of the risks they run from leakage of the contents of these bulbs into the environment."
"in writing. - (PL) Mercury is one of the most powerful environmental poisons."
"Under normal circumstances this metal is a liquid with high vapour compressibility."
"It does not biodegrade and therefore remains in the environment for a very long time. Mercury accumulates in trophic chains that can pass into the human body in significant concentrations."
"Industrial development resulted in the use of mercury because it is a metal with special properties and is cheap to obtain."
"It seems difficult to eliminate the use of mercury in the production of low-energy light bulbs."
"Effective collection systems for such waste should be developed, however, together with safe technology for its recycling, so as to prevent further degradation of the natural environment."
"One of the most serious cases of poisoning with mercury compounds took place in Japan between 1953 and 1960."
"There was mass illness amongst the inhabitants of the gulf of Minamata who showed symptoms of nerve damage that often resulted in death."
"The European Union should do all it can to ensure mercury is safely stored."
"The export of metallic mercury should be banned."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the report by my esteemed German colleague, Hartmut Nassauer, drawn up at first reading of the codecision procedure on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of the environment through criminal law."
"I support the position of reinserting this mechanism within the strict jurisdiction of Community law by limiting the effects of the directive only to cases of infringement of Community legislation on environmental issues, and thus allowing the Member States to determine the penalties that they will apply in the event of any infringement of such laws."
"This wise position follows that of the Court of Justice of the European Communities which ruled that the EU has the power to adopt criminal measures only in cases of 'justified need', in other words, concerning common transport and environment policies."
"It should be pointed out that the directive aims to oblige the Member States to lay down criminal sanctions within their own legislation for serious infringements of Community law with regard to protection of the environment, without creating any obligations for application of these penalties that may be invoked in individual cases."
"in writing. - Given the trans-boundary nature of environmental crime, we believe that an established set of minimum standards and sanctions concerning environmental crime at international level would be a useful instrument in maintaining a comprehensive and effective environmental protection strategy."
"However, we do not believe that the EU has or should have the competence to establish criminal measures in first-pillar matters."
"Therefore I voted against the report today"
"in writing. - (PT) Importantly, the rapporteur has recognised that, pursuant to the Court of Justice judgment of 23 October 2007 in Case C-440/05, criminal law and the rules of criminal procedure do not fall within the Community competence and therefore the type and level of the criminal penalties to be applied cannot be determined."
"Amendments have therefore been made to the European Commission's proposal for a directive which was not acceptable."
"It is also important that the Commission and the Council have accepted these proposed amendments."
"However, despite this, they are insisting on the possibility of the Community legislator being able to require Member States to make provision for sanctions of this kind to ensure that the laws that they enact in the area of environmental protection are fully effective."
"As the role of the Member States in the whole process has not been sufficiently clarified, we chose to abstain in the final vote."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this report as it will allow criminal sanctions for serious environmental offences."
"Member States must take a strong stance on environmental protection and ensure strict application of this directive."
"In particular I am voting for the inclusion of an annex to the directive which clarifies which legislation is subject to criminal sanctions."
"An annex is crucial to give greater legal clarity about what Community legislation is affected."
"It should both cover existing legislation, where this Directive will have competence to impose criminal sanctions, and allow for future legislation to be covered."
"Furthermore, an annex will ensure the directive is restricted only to enforcement of Community law and implementing national legislation and has no impact on what is purely national law."
"in writing. - (FR) The adoption of common criminal law within the EU, thus depriving the Member States of their sovereign exclusive right to determine, in an independent fashion, what types of behaviour they consider to be offences and also of the chance to define the qualifications and limits of criminal penalties, is on its way."
"An impressive power play by the Court of Justice of the European Communities in its judgment of 13 September 2005 on the case known as 'protection of the environment' granted it the right to interfere in the criminal law of Member States in the event of infringements of environmental legislation."
"Now, in an all-new phase, the idea is to draw up a harmonised set of infringements to be sanctioned by criminal law in all the Member States and to harmonise the criminal penalties in cases of environmental infringements."
"The Court has seized power and has handed it over to the Commission with total disdain for the countries, national constitutions, parliaments and sound application of laws."
"Those of us who are sovereignists and defend the freedoms and rights of countries to decide for themselves reject these methods."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the Nassauer report on the protection of the environment through criminal law."
"Whilst substantive criminal law is and should remain a matter for Member States, it is equally clear that environmental protection is something which can best be coordinated at the EU level."
"I am satisfied that the compromise package will allow the EU take the lead in environmental protection whilst respecting the integrity of national legal systems."
"The proposed directive opens the way to imposing unified EU criminal law on the Member States."
"It uses environmental protection and workers' concerns about environmental problems to promote the adoption of common EU criminal law."
"It even revokes the rule of the Member States' unanimity that has applied to criminal matters until now."
"This paves the way to acquis communautaire, giving the EU the right and power to institute and impose criminal penalties wherever it deems this necessary."
"In the final analysis, certain provisions of the European Constitution are being reinstated. From now on their application comes under the new name 'Treaty of Lisbon' before it has even been ratified or entered into force."
"This is a dangerous development at the expense of the peoples of Europe."
"Investing the EU with the power to adopt unified criminal law without the unanimous agreement of the Member States is tantamount to abolishing one of the fundamental sovereign rights of nations: to decide what actions constitute a criminal offence and to specify the type and level of penalties."
"The aim is to impose directly on the people of Europe the will of legally sanctioned European capital monopoly. At the same time, the personal rights and democratic freedoms of peoples will be drastically reduced."
"in writing. ? (PL) Caring for the environment is a duty incumbent on us all."
"The world is not discharging this duty very well, however. There is a tendency not to recognise its importance and to put it off until later."
"In 1998 the European Council took the decision to protect the environment through criminal law."
"Adoption of the new directive means that the set of offences subject to criminal sanctions in all countries is now clearly defined."
"I believe it is also necessary to emphasise the responsibility of manufacturers, exporters, importers and carriers for the products and services they provide, to ensure there are no loopholes or opportunities to evade responsibility."
"Resources are needed, however, to provide the necessary equipment and staff training for example, so that the new principles can be properly implemented and offences against the environment reduced. I believe resources should be made available from the European Union's budget, at least for the new Member States."
"Only if all the Member States act in solidarity will it be possible to achieve the aims set."
"In the absence of such solidarity, regional differences will simply become more pronounced."
"in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of the environment through criminal law because the introduction of new legal provisions and the establishment of a common list of offences against the environment for the entire Community will ensure more effective implementation of Community legislation."
"The same provisions are in place in all Member States of the Union, but the way they are implemented varies considerably."
"This encourages undesirable behaviour whereby irresponsible entrepreneurs relocate their economic activity to countries where criminal sanctions for offences are less severe."
"This affects the new Member States in particular."
"It should be emphasised that offences committed within the framework of criminal organisations are becoming more and more significant, and that offences against the environment are increasingly of a cross-border nature."
"I agree with the rapporteur's stance that the legal framework defined in the proposal for a directive represents an important contribution to effective protection of the environment, and can guarantee uniform and responsible implementation of environmental protection law within the European Union."
"Appropriately trained officials are a sine qua non for effective implementation of the law and actual reduction of offences against the environment."
"The proposal to specify the obligations of Member States in this regard clearly is therefore entirely relevant."
"The adoption of a set of offences against the environment and the associated penalties will constitute a very helpful instrument for the common implementation of environmental protection legislation within the European Union."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the report by my Hungarian colleague, Gábor Harangozó, that amends, at first reading of the codecision procedure, the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on farm structure surveys and the survey on agricultural production methods."
"I support the idea of allowing derogations for Member States that wish to implement the farm structure survey in 2009 rather than 2010 due to the decennial population census in 2011."
"I likewise support any simplifications envisaged."
"in writing. - (PT) The proposal for a regulation is justified by the Commission's new political approach involving the simplification of legislation and better regulation."
"I agree with the Commission proposal which aims to simplify procedures by reducing the number of internal inspections while, at the same time, maintaining the necessary level of rigour imposed by previous legislation on the performance of structural surveys on crop and animal production, agricultural work and equipment used."
"Furthermore, and with the aim of simplification, the proposal introduces only one new type of inspection and does not in any way require Member States to alter their administrative systems."
"in writing. - (PT) As agricultural subsidies come from public money, it is essential to ensure their fair distribution based on objective criteria."
"We therefore agree with the need to carry out surveys to determine conditions on agricultural holdings."
"However, the application of these principles cannot be allowed to impose yet another bureaucratic burden on farmers, particularly small and medium-sized farmers whose resources are limited or non-existent."
"Likewise, this cannot form a way of preventing farmers, due to technical or other errors of which they are unaware, from getting the support to which they are entitled, as has sometimes happened in Portugal with satellite recognition and identification."
"We therefore feel it is positive that the report recognises the significant methodological and technical difficulties in many Member States and also that it insists on the need for the Commission to provide farmers with the necessary technical and advisory assistance in respect of the satellite recognition of agricultural holdings."
"In this respect, we also wish to draw attention once again to the need for the Member State authorities to guarantee access to and use of the data gathered during satellite recognition exclusively for the specified purposes."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the report by my Romanian colleague, Silvia-Adriana Ţicău, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator."
"The former Directive 96/26/EC on admission to the occupation of road haulage operator and its four Regulations on access to the haulage market, with deregulation of the prices of international road haulage implemented a number of years previously, have shaped the internal haulage market, albeit with minimum haulage quality, while the opening of the market as arranged by the Regulations has created more competition."
"Experience has demonstrated that these measures are wrongly or unequally applied since they are ambiguous or incomplete, or can no longer be applied due to changes in the sector."
"Companies remain subject to unequal surveillance and monitoring, depending on the Member States, with some extremely different levels of professional qualifications and financial solvency."
"Thus there was an urgent need for legislation, demanding conditions relating to good repute, financial standing and professional competence, and implementation of mutual acknowledgement of certain documents required to obtain permission to operate."
"in writing. - (PT) Aside from the criticism of certain aspects included in this proposal for a regulation, its contents should not be assessed without taking into account its 'role' in the increasing liberalisation of international road haulage and passenger transport as promoted by the European Commission and by the European Union institutions with codecision power, namely the European Parliament and the Council."
"As a matter of fact, this central idea is highlighted by the European Commission itself in its proposal: 'Directive 96/26/EC on admission to the occupation of road transport operator, the four Regulations on access to the road transport market, together with the deregulation of international transport prices which took place a few years earlier, shaped the internal market in road transport'."
"In other words, 'common requirements for admission to the occupation' were laid down while 'the opening-up of the market as a result of the Regulations has made for greater competition'."
"As we highlighted with regard to the proposal for a regulation on common rules for access to the international road haulage market, this proposal aims to increase the liberalisation of international road transport by seeking to promote greater competition between operators in a sector that is already overwhelmed with countless heavy costs for its workers."
"in writing. - (DE) Harmonisation of the existing rules in this field is important as a means of optimising road transport in Europe."
"Moreover, a regulation is more expedient than a directive in this context."
"The rules governing the occupation of a road transport operator must fulfil precisely defined criteria if we are to achieve the highest possible level of safety on our roads."
"These rules must encompass both requirements and sanctions."
"A key element is the monitoring and checking of data, which must be carried out with due respect for personal privacy."
"It is very important that the national electronic registers containing the data should be interconnected so that data can be compared and the regulation therefore serves its intended purpose."
"I am opposed to Amendments 7 and 102 which seek to water down the six-day rule."
"A reintroduction of the 12-day rule, which has already been rejected, would be inconsistent with the substance of this report."
"in writing. - (PT) Mrs Ţicău's report is part of a package of measures that, together with two other reports, aims to regulate road transport activity."
"This activity is supremely important within the European Economic Area as it enables the open and competitive market of which we are nowadays so proud."
"Under this new proposal, companies must hire a transport manager with certified training who shall be responsible for managing the company's transport activity."
"The conditions already laid down for accessing the occupation - namely good repute, financial standing and professional competence - are maintained."
"This recasting is intended to make the existing legislation more intelligible and demanding in terms of safety and efficiency in this type of business."
"I therefore welcome the work carried out by the rapporteur to increase responsibility in terms of safety and guarantees of commitment in this sector and also the measures on professional competence which involve high-quality training and mutual recognition of diplomas and licences."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the report by my esteemed colleague, Mathieu Grosch, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for access to the international road haulage market which aims to merge the texts regulating access to the international road and cabotage transport market, currently governed by previous regulations and directives."
"Within the internal market, international transport between the Member States has been fully liberalised, although a number of restrictions still remain for cabotage."
"I welcome these indications and simplifications, and also the stepping up of penalties for infringements committed in Member States other than that of establishment."
"in writing. - (PT) This is just another step towards and another instrument aimed at increasing the liberalisation of international road haulage by seeking to promote greater competition between operators in a sector that is already overwhelmed with countless heavy costs for its workers."
"One of the current aims is to find a way of facilitating the inclusion of 'cabotage' operations by road transport - in other words, carrying out up to three transport operations following an international journey, provided that these are carried out within seven days - in a market which is already so liberalised that this will profoundly impact on the finances and survival of national operators."
"This decision will also have harmful consequences for road haulage workers."
"This can be seen, for example, in the proposal by a majority of this House to remove the reference to 'working time', just leaving the terms 'driving time' and 'rest periods', in other words allowing longer working hours which will adversely affect working conditions and worker safety."
"If we take account of the recent Court of Justice decisions, not even the reference to Directive 96/71/EC on the secondment of workers will protect the labour rights of many workers in this sector."
"in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of adoption of the report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for access to the international road haulage market (recast) - C6-0146/2007 - 2007/0099 (COD))."
"I agree with the rapporteur that adoption of the Commission's proposal will be instrumental in simplifying and clarifying the principles applicable to road haulage."
"I support the report by Mr Grosch, aimed at providing opportunities for neighbouring Member States to open their markets still further to cabotage transport operations."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted for Mathieu Grosch's report on access to the international road haulage market."
"The merging of the existing Regulations and Directive 2006/94/EC will simplify and improve access to the road haulage market."
"I endorse the rapporteur's view that the restrictions on cabotage must be eased and that the rules governing cabotage must be brought into line with those that apply to cross-border haulage within the internal market."
"It is therefore important to define cabotage clearly in order to guarantee a uniform approach."
"Although empty runs must be avoided for the sake of the environment and efficiency, and although cabotage on the homeward route from other countries should also be supported, subject to the restrictions set out in the report, it must not be forgotten that such measures also weaken the position of the railways."
"in writing. - (EL) We are voting against the report on access to road transport. It liberalises the Community road transport market and opens up international carriers to national transport."
"International and internal road transport of goods and passengers is thus handed over to the monopoly companies. The consequences are disastrous for small and medium-sized transport companies and especially for the workers and drivers who will be exploited even more by the monopoly groups."
"The European Parliament's proposal is heading down an ever more reactionary path than that of the Commission. It removes even the minimum proposed restrictions and demands full liberalisation of the market for international and national transport."
"The possibility of limitless loading and reloading operations in the Member States, and unlimited time spent by vehicles and personnel in other Member States after carrying out purely international transport operations, is intended to reduce labour costs. It will violate the rights protecting the wages, labour and insurance of international transport workers and promote the concentration of activities in large multinationals, ravaging the sector if unchecked, and downgrading the quality of services."
"The working-class labour movement must vigorously oppose this in a show of insubordination and disobedience to the EU's anti-labour, anti-popular policy."
"in writing. - (PT) This proposal is part of a package of measures within the road transport sector."
"This particular proposal aims to improve the coherence of Community legislation in the area of international road haulage by merging two existing Regulations, thus ensuring greater efficiency in the application of rules and clarifying and facilitating the application of the cabotage concept."
"It also lays down measures to simplify and standardise the Community licence and driver attestation, thus reducing administrative costs and delays, particularly in the event of checks at the roadside."
"Member States will also be able to beef up their communication systems which will help with the reporting of offences committed by a road transport undertaking in the Member State in which it is established."
"I believe that this text is extremely important to the development of this sector in the European market and will give it the necessary efficiency, regulation and structure conducive to an open, regulated and fair market."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the report by my British colleague, Fiona Hall, who did an excellent job and amended, at first reading of the codecision procedure, the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the selection and authorisation of systems providing mobile satellite services (MSS)."
"As rapporteur for my political group, the PPE-DE Group, I fought for optimum geographic coverage of services on EU territory."
"I am pleased that I have made a contribution to the requirement that applications must include the undertaking that the mobile satellite system proposed will provide a service in at least 60% of the aggregate land area of the Member States, from the time the service commences."
"Moreover, the service proposed must be provided in all the Member States for at least 50% of the population and in at least 60% of the aggregate land area of each Member State by the time stipulated by the applicant, but no later than seven years from the date of publication of the text."
"Finally, applications will include a commitment on the part of the applicant to allow the mobile satellite system proposed to be made available to public protection and disaster relief services."
"There are positive points in this report which we welcome, in particular the proposals on the importance of mobile satellite services covering areas outside the main urban centres of Member States and of providing the best possible services in order to bridge the digital divide, and also the argument that the initial service coverage area of the proposed mobile satellite services should be set at a sufficient level, therefore leveraging the coverage capacity of such systems."
"However, we cannot ignore the context in which these proposals are made, namely the liberalisation and advance of the internal market for telecommunications."
"We therefore had to vote against this report."
"Likewise, we do not agree that Member States should give up their national rights on spectrum allocation because mobile satellite services have a large satellite footprint making it difficult to avoid interference across national boundaries."
"In fact, the February 2007 Commission decision did recognise that Member States should retain the right to grant authorisation for the operation of complementary ground components within their territories."
"in writing. - (SV) The report on the selection and authorisation of systems providing mobile satellite services is about how we are to provide a common European system of satellite services, an important factor in strengthening the continued competitiveness of Europe in advanced technological research and industry."
"The report is good and focuses on how this work can be improved."
"However, one crucial question regarding the coverage of this service has presented problems from a Swedish point of view, since the compromise settled on 60% of the EU's land area."
"This means that parts of Sweden will not be covered, which is negative from the point of view of the development of the technology and research."
"I therefore chose to abstain."
"in writing. - (FR) The adoption of this decision is a decisive step towards reinforcement of the internal electronic communications market."
"The objective is simple: to give everyone high-speed Internet access and to provide mobile multimedia services and public protection services in the event of natural or human disasters."
"The means implemented match the expectations of our fellow citizens, particularly in terms of Internet access: a service for 50% of the population and at least 60% of each Member State does constitute an effective means of bridging the digital divide, and it can also be utilised by rural areas."
"This decision is even more of a success since it entails much greater harmonisation of management of the radio spectrum on a European scale which, as if we needed any reminding, is an increasingly scarce resource."
"This is also the result of the wishes of all the Member States to provide the telecommunications industry with the means to create a services market on a European level, which had previously been much too fragmented."
"In short, mobile satellite services (MSS) are set to be a success in the industrial sense and also as an enhancement of cultural diversity and pluralism in the media."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the own-initiative report by my German colleague, Klaus-Heiner Lehne, on a simplified business environment for companies in the areas of company law, accounting and auditing, in response to the European Commission's communication on the subject."
"Like my colleagues, I welcome the Commission's general aim of reducing the administrative burden for businesses in Europe."
"This reduction, however, cannot be implemented at the price of legal or accounting uncertainty when the internal market begins to be penetrated by SMEs."
"I am pleased that Parliament did not accept the suggestion of raising the thresholds referred to in the communication for micro-entities, below which the entities are exempted from the accounting, auditing and disclosure requirements under European law."
"I am also very glad that Parliament voted for an amendment that I proposed in committee which was not adopted at that stage. This recommends that consultations be held relating to the necessity and feasibility of creating a European accounting and audit services regulator."
"in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the Klaus-Heiner Lehne report on a 'simplified business environment for companies' because I was convinced of the need for 'new' reforms in company law, accounting and auditing."
"Company law is now strongly and, in my view, positively influenced by European rules."
"We must prevent this from imposing unnecessary, excessively bureaucratic requirements while avoiding overlap with burdens which are already imposed under national rules."
"These reforms will have to be aimed at making for easier reading of the applicable rules and reducing bureaucratic and administrative burdens, especially in accounting."
"Simplification will be to the great benefit of undertakings, especially SMEs which as a general rule do not have large legal and accountancy departments."
"I am convinced that understandable rules which are easy to apply will first and foremost foster compliance with the law."
"At the same time, through clear rules which are easy to identify, the creation of a positive, active economic environment will be fostered."
"I believe that the work both of the committee involved and of the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, has resulted in a fair compromise between requirements to comply with the principle of subsidiarity and the creation of a harmonised route for Member States which are engaged in a joint effort to simplify company rules at European level."
"We must avoid creating bureaucratic obstacles which serve to muzzle dynamism and entrepreneurship to the point of suffocating them."
"in writing. - Amendment 11d calls for the deletion of Paragraph 26."
"There are two ways of interpreting Paragraph 26."
"Some are concerned that it could be a call for 'one share, one vote' and for that reason have voted for the deletion of the paragraph."
"This is not my interpretation."
"The paragraph does specifically refer to 'special individual obstacles to the freedom of movement of capital' and refers to a specific judgment concerning Volkswagen."
"My interpretation of this is that the paragraph invites the Commission to remedy special, and extreme, protectionist measures."
"For this reason I voted against the amendment and for retention of the paragraph as a statement against protectionism."
"in writing. - (PL) I am in favour of simplifying reporting procedures and methods of communication between public administrations and entrepreneurs."
"At present, the bureaucratic procedures imposed on entrepreneurs are unduly complex."
"The report sets out to improve communication and also recommends introducing the XBRL standard."
"This is an open standard, which means that it is easily accessible even to the smallest companies."
"I therefore decided to support this report."
"in writing. - I and my British Conservative colleagues wish to make clear that we strongly oppose Paragraph 23 of this report which supports the establishment of a 'common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB)' in the EU."
"We have, however, made our policy on this clear on many occasions, and the balance of the rest of the report in promoting simplification of business rules has our support, subject to this clarification."
"in writing. - (PT) The report generally aims to simplify and reduce Community legislation on the grounds that this will particularly benefit SMEs."
"It is true that there may be some positive aspects to this simplification and normally we support the simplification of measures relating to company legislation, provided that this results in the removal of red tape."
"However, we cannot vote in favour of a report which, on the one hand, calls for simplification while, on the other, it calls for the creation of new Community legal frameworks."
"The following proposals in the report led to our abstention due to their dubious and negative nature: legislation on possible coordination between Member States' tax authorities so as to harmonise the information requests made to businesses; review of the Statute for the European Company to bring it more closely into line with the rest of Community law; creation of a new legal framework for undertakings, and establishment of a common consolidated corporate tax base on the grounds that this would render the Statute for the European Company more useful and effective."
"in writing. - (PL) The Commission communication on a simplified business environment for companies in the areas of company law, accounting and auditing sets out measures aimed at reducing the administrative burden on European companies and ensuring that they can compete effectively at global level."
"Not only do the Member States fail to take advantage of the optional measures to reduce bureaucracy, but they also often counter Community concessions through stricter national provisions, thus depriving local companies of the opportunity to simplify procedures pursuant to Union legislation."
"The Commission should therefore concentrate on encouraging Member States to harmonise classification of requirements concerning reporting in the area of financial information. It should also press Member States to adopt new technology in order to reduce costs."
"Furthermore, a solution involving establishing a common consolidated corporate tax base would render the European company statute more useful and effective."
"The proposal to exclude so-called micro-enterprises from the scope of application of the directives on accounting is also to be welcomed. In practice, this would mean exempting them from the requirement to keep accounts, submit an annual financial report and publish the reports required under European legislation."
"The proposed changes are certainly commendable. Nonetheless, further simplification of the Union's acquis in the area of company law and its effective implementation in Member States would seem essential, if European companies are to compete successfully on the ever more demanding global market."
"in writing. - I supported Mr Lehne's report on simplifying the business environment for companies."
"The EU has a vital role to play in ensuring that businesses operate in a competitive environment, yet often businesses and Member States find themselves hindered by over-complex rules."
"Moves to simplify the business environment are therefore to be welcomed."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of this report, but I consider that we should implement a more comprehensive package of actions to ensure the simplification of the European business environment."
"I refer in particular to the problems met when starting a business."
"Eurostat shows that, in the EU Member States, the period required in order to fulfil the administrative formalities for starting a business vary between one day and several months."
"Moreover, some Member States were ranked far below the OECD average in a ranking of the ease of doing business in various world countries."
"Last but not least, the different rules in the 27 Member States as regards company law prevent the transnational movement of capital and the starting of new businesses in a Member State other than the one of origin."
"I believe these two elements are essential for achieving the economic growth objective of the Lisbon Strategy and, consequently, they should be promoted more by the European company legislation."
"in writing. - (PL) Mr President, the European Union is not perceived as an area where the provisions concerning running a business are particularly straightforward, in terms of ease of use."
"In fact the general feeling is that this is an overly regulated area by world standards, which creates particular difficulties for small enterprises."
"Every step towards simplifying provisions, as indicated in the Commission communication of 10 July 2007 should therefore be welcomed."
"The most important and most desirable effect of simplification should be to encourage small companies to operate on the common European market. To date, the latter has not been very accessible to new enterprises from Central and Eastern Europe."
"If that aim is to be achieved, national provisions must be harmonised, in addition to repealing unnecessary provisions further to the two options proposed by the Commission."
"This does not, however, require harmonising taxation, as suggested in paragraph 23 of the report by Mr Lehne, the so-called light formula for consolidating the corporate tax base."
"The rapporteur favours the second of the options proposed by the Commission which is less far-reaching."
"Nonetheless, against the background of the European Union's current tendency to regulate, it would certainly amount to a reversal of the unfavourable trend that definitely restricts opportunities for European firms to compete on the global market."
"in writing. - (NL) The Commission communication raises fundamental questions which are to determine European policy on company and accounting law."
"The Lehne report put forward good answers to these questions, which I can also approve."
"However, there is one problematic point where the Commission proposes the introduction of a 'micro-entities' category."
"These are smaller enterprises below a specific threshold which are to be exempt from the European financial reporting and annual accounting obligations."
"The Lehne report is in favour of that approach and even suggests raising the thresholds."
"In Belgium, 75% of undertakings would be released from the present transparency requirements."
"At first sight, abolition of the accounting system for small enterprises seems a major simplification of the bureaucracy, but, given the importance of financial information for all the parties concerned (providers of credit, for example), it could lead to more bureaucratic red tape and higher costs."
"Since there will be no generally accepted financial reporting, enterprises will be asked to provide figures à la carte, in a variety of ways."
"Furthermore they are depriving themselves of a useful tool for internal company monitoring which is certainly important for an SME."
"I therefore abstained from the final vote."
"in writing. - (PL) Mr President, higher education has become more widely accessible and growing numbers of women are gaining university degrees."
"Nonetheless, women are still poorly represented at the highest levels of academia. Although the majority of lecturers are women (over 50%), they tend to hold less senior posts."
"I am in favour of the idea of promoting family-friendly measures by providing for the introduction of flexible working times and better childcare services. I also support the provision of access to social insurance abroad and the introduction of parental leave conditions that would allow men and women freedom of choice."
"The career breaks taken by female scientists for family reasons should not impact negatively on their subsequent career options thus giving men an undue advantage with regard to furthering their scientific career."
"I supported the report by Mrs Thomsen because I believe that it rightly tackled issues relating to gender stereotypes. The latter still exist in many European Union Member States."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of Britta Thomsen's report on women and science as I consider it essential to facilitate equal access for both genders to scientific careers."
"Factors such as the stereotypes associated with natural science or the obstacles created due to the difficulty of reconciling personal and family life with professional life result in numerous disadvantages and difficulties for women scientists and researchers which exclude many women from scientific research."
"The disparities between men and women in relation to their presence in positions of academic and scientific leadership, the respective salaries and the demands of personal life require measures to counteract these gender stereotypes in science, to attract women to scientific careers and to remove the existing inequalities."
"in writing. - (PT) We know that there are more women than men in higher education, yet when it comes to choosing the research career, women are still outnumbered by men."
"The huge increase in participation of women in higher education has neither led to a corresponding change in the ratio of women to men in particular fields of study or professions nor has it eliminated the gender-specific wage gap."
"As the rapporteur points out, women researchers are still a minority in the government and higher education sectors with both sectors having an EU average of 35% women."
"In all countries these two sectors nevertheless have higher proportions of women researchers than the business enterprise sector with an EU average of 18% women, but there are large cross-country variations."
"The countries with the fewest women in business research are Germany (11.8%), Austria (10.4%) and the Netherlands (8.7%), whereas Latvia, Bulgaria and Romania all have over 40%."
"The distribution of researchers by main fields of science shows different patterns for men and women."
"Among male researchers in the higher education sector, 54% work in natural science and engineering compared to 37% among women researchers."
"in writing. - (SV) Improved access for women to activities in the scientific field, as the rapporteur states, is of crucial significance."
"How we can arrive at that result in each individual country, on the other hand, is something that varies depending on the country's culture and other specific features."
"The problem manifests itself differently in the EU's 27 Member States, hence solutions must also vary."
"It is not possible to generalise on the situation of women in all 27 Member States."
"Junilistan is convinced that the route to equality in practice must be mapped out at national level."
"We have therefore chosen to vote against the report."
"in writing. - (PL) In my capacity as a female professor with many years of experience working in a Polish university, I am aware of the magnitude of the challenges involved and therefore support the report by Mrs Thomsen."
"The report takes an interesting approach to the problem of gender discrimination in the scientific world, identifying the social, cultural and financial obstacles causing women to remain under-represented."
"There are few of us in the state sector and in higher education, a mere 35%, and only 18% in the private sector."
"How are we supposed to build a knowledge-based society, develop Europe's science and economy, meet the challenges of the Lisbon Strategy, and fulfil Europe's expectations at the threshold of the 21st century without the involvement of women in science?"
"We have to create conditions that will enable women to become more widely involved in the scientific world and that will open the doors of university laboratories to them. It must also be made possible for women to aspire to the highest academic posts."
"Promotion in the scientific world depends on academic achievement, and a woman's chance of being appointed to a Chair is three times lower than that of a man."
"This is regrettable and cannot be explained exclusively by women's heavier family commitments."
"Few women are members of the decision-making bodies of European higher education institutions, and it is therefore difficult to implement policy on gender equality in these institutions."
"We only need to refer to the shameful example of the Scientific Council of the European Research Council. Only five of its twenty-two members are female!"
"in writing. ? (PL) Women's participation in the labour market is increasing systematically right across the European Union."
"Poland is no exception, although women's participation in the labour market in Poland remains below the Union average."
"I should like to emphasise, however, that more Polish women hold positions of responsibility than their counterparts in Western Europe."
"I believe that increasing women's professional activity is an important issue."
"In this context, it is important to consider the situation of female scientists, as it has similarities with the situation of all women faced with the need to reconcile professional duties with family life."
"Nonetheless, I do not feel that imposing parity should be the way to increase women's participation in the labour market."
"Decisions on employment should be made above all on the grounds of qualifications and competences acquired by women through appropriate education."
"The proposal aimed at increasing the transparency of recruitment procedures, competitions for managerial positions and the award of grants for scientific research does seem appropriate, though."
"These changes should be accompanied by reform of the labour market, however."
"European Union science requires support."
"Scientific and technical courses should be promoted as attractive studies for both genders, given the importance of science for economic development."
"We should therefore encourage young people to take up higher education courses of this nature."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of Britta Thomsen's report on women in science because women remain under-represented in the world of science."
"The report outlines important steps towards a balance between men and women in the academic sphere."
"The promotion of academic careers for women must play a key role."
"Great significance is attached to the elimination of gender stereotypes."
"The current tendency to assign male and female attributes to individual academic disciplines is detrimental to a fair balance between the sexes."
"With the aid of new programmes and recruitment procedures, it is possible to ensure that the skills and qualifications of candidates are paramount, not their sex."
"The same must apply to promotion opportunities and pay levels."
"A non-binding target quota of at least 40% women and at least 40% men on selection panels is one way of ironing out imbalances between the sexes in academic occupations, but applicants' skills and qualifications must always be paramount."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted for the report regarding the situation of women in science, which I consider vital for achieving the Lisbon Strategy objectives of growth and employment."
"In the new EU Member States, the number of women researchers is approximately 40%, as compared to the Western countries, where it is approximately 11% but, unfortunately, a very high percentage of them are employed in fields where research and development expenses are among the lowest."
"I would like to call attention to the importance of the article on the integration of the family angle through possibilities for flexible working hours and the creation of child-care facilities, for reconciling family life and a professional career."
"I believe the rapid implementation of this report's provisions will provide an essential support for having a 25% percentage of the women working in research in management positions in 2010. I congratulate Mrs. Britta Thomsen on her report."
"in writing. - (ES) Since I was unable to attend and join in the debate for health reasons, I wish to justify my support of the report."
"It was an excellent and comprehensive piece of work covering all the major issues to secure a balanced representation of women and men in science and technology."
"It is also a most timely report since, if the EU needs 700 000 more researchers to meet its objectives by 2010, this is the right time for the Commission and the Member States to implement the specific measures set out in the report to correct this anomaly."
"Qualifications and merits are shared equally between men and women."
"In fact, at the present time women outnumber men at university and also obtain better results."
"There are objective data for all this."
"Moreover, governments in particular ought to favour the presence of more women in science and technology, since using only half the brains is not intelligent or efficient."
"I am glad Parliament has finally initiated an in-depth examination of this issue."
"in writing. - (FR) Distorted truths, erroneous statements and sexist remarks primarily stigmatising men represent, in a few words, a few brutal words, the substance of this report."
"Equality between men and women and better integration of women in professional careers cannot be conceived in an authoritarian and repressive fashion."
"This can only make the results negative and counterproductive."
"It is certainly true that delays in terms of integration, wage gaps or a lack of career profiles are legion for women, particularly in the field of science and research."
"Once again, however, it is dialogue, implementation of non-restrictive measures to encourage girls to study science long term, and active support for women throughout their careers that will finally move them forward in society."
"in writing. - (SV) Britta Thomsen's report notes that female researchers are in a minority in the EU."
"They have inferior financial security and in their professional careers, and they are penalised to an increasing extent by their family responsibilities."
"This is serious, both on grounds of principle and as regards practical consequences."
"Modern economies - and democracies - cannot afford to give negative special treatment to persons of academic eminence."
"I therefore voted for the report."
"Nevertheless I would point out that parts of the report were not put to the vote and I find it difficult to see how that is reasonable."
"Paragraph 7 asks that age be taken into account as a criterion of excellence together with family situation, including the number of the researcher's dependents."
"I think that would be difficult to apply in practice and might even be counter-productive."
"There is always a risk in simplifying the gender roles and speaking of 'qualities that tend to be more prevalent in women scientists' or creating absolute standards to measure the performance of researchers."
"On the other hand, I wholeheartedly support the recommendation to introduce non-binding targets requiring that both genders be represented by at least 40% each in scientific committees of various kinds."
"I also agree with the criticism that the EU sometimes aims short when it comes to equality."
"The policy of presence must not be underestimated - although it should not be turned into a religion."
"in writing. - (PL) Women make a major contribution to the development of science."
"The Polish Nobel Prize winner for physics and chemistry, Marie Skłodowska-Curie, is one fine example."
"Streets, hospitals and a university have been named after this famous scientist."
"When opting for a career in science, women face a greater challenge than men do."
"This is partly due to their role in childbearing and bringing up their families."
"Women scientists therefore need to be supported through the development of preferential maternity leave conditions, and through special grants for women who are bringing up children whilst simultaneously pursuing a scientific career."
"Contrary to what is advocated in the motion for a resolution before us today, however, it is not desirable to impose percentages for female representation on academic staff, or on committees of various sorts, in order to ensure gender equality."
"Decisions on jobs and careers in science should not be made on the basis of gender."
"Instead, they should be made on the basis of the particular person's individual choice, ability and knowledge."
"in writing. - (SK) I would like to thank Mrs Thomsen for her report which points to a certain type of discrimination against women in science and research."
"Although women make up more than 50% of EU students, they hold only 15% of senior academic posts in science and research."
"University study is seldom followed by a result matching the significant amount of time and finances invested in it."
"After many years of study, women often sacrifice their personal and working lives or have to reconcile them."
"It should be in the interest of society to cooperate with and support citizens with a high intellectual potential and to let this potential reflect in the cultural, spiritual, historic and scientific heritage of the nation."
"Motherhood in particular has an impact on women's career opportunities, paradoxically punishes them in terms of the opportunity to get to top positions, fulfil themselves and be justly rewarded, and does not offer them adequate compensation for the social investment of giving birth to and bringing up children who will be responsible for tomorrow."
"I think that this could be solved by a reform in the area of study conditions for young women, long-distance studying and working, and life-long learning, as well as by encouraging fathers to support mothers who want to become scientists."
"The state too has a responsibility for supporting women participating in scientific work: for supporting them during their studies, helping them to reconcile their family and working lives and to receive just rewards for their work, providing them with direct social benefit payments and helping, in as natural a way as possible, with child care."
"in writing. - (PT) The dismantling of ships continues to have a major social and ecological impact, both because of the way in which this is done, which can be harmful to the environment, and because the number of ships under construction has been increasing for years."
"This explains the continuing importance of innovation and development in the shipbuilding industry in the Member States in order to improve ships and make them less environmentally damaging."
"Since 2005, the IMO (International Maritime Organization) has been cooperating with the ILO (International Labour Organization) and UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme) to draw up binding international rules on the clean dismantling of ships."
"Negotiations are now proceeding on a draft convention which should be adopted by 2009 but would then only enter into force a few years later."
"According to the current draft, the convention would not apply to warships or other ships which are the property of the State."
"No agreement has yet been reached on standards outside the framework of the IMO, basic standards for ship-recycling businesses, reporting obligations (including inter-state notification) and enforcement instruments."
"in writing. - I welcome the Blokland report on the Green Paper on ship dismantling."
"Ship breaking is a dangerous trade which has a high cost both in terms of human life and on the environment."
"It is unacceptable for the EU to turn a blind eye to the export of ships to developing countries for breaking up."
"These ships are in effect hazardous waste and it is vital that the EU acts to prevent this export."
"I welcome this House's support for my own group's amendments which highlight the urgency for action to be taken in this area."
"in writing. - Johannes Blokland's report on the Green Paper on better ship dismantling seeks to achieve environmentally and socially sustainable ship dismantling."
"The report aims to address problems currently encountered in that sector, particularly the major health and safety concerns for workers in the shipyards of Bangladesh and India."
"I therefore voted in support of the report's recommendations."
"in writing. - (PT) European concerns about the environment and working conditions in third countries merit our agreement in principle."
"The export of conditions of misery, whether for the environment, labour or in any other respect, can never form part of our vision of worldwide trade and exchange."
"It is vital, however, that we do not defend such an absolute and modern view of our position on certain values that our focus on a single part obscures the bigger picture."
"The adoption of drastic measures to stop practices that are in truth social or environmental dumping, but which would also lead to the destruction of an economic sector in a third country and would therefore cause even greater misery for an extremely vulnerable part of the population is not in line with what we defend."
"Gradual reforms and the imposition of tailor-made standards that promote development are a more effective and desirable solution."
"We cannot put a stop to misery and human degradation if we can only offer, as an alternative, misery and human degradation."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the interim report by my German colleague, Karl-Heinz Florenz, on the scientific facts of climate change as considered by Parliament's Temporary Committee."
"Scientific consensus on the origins and causes of climate change is well-established and recognised worldwide."
"Scientific evidence from all continents and most oceans shows that many natural systems have already been affected by regional climate changes due to historical carbon emissions from the industrialised countries."
"It has also been scientifically proven that the underlying causes of global warming are predominantly man-made."
"I welcome the fact that the report stresses the need for further analysis and research into the consequences of climate change, such as the effects on economic competitiveness, energy costs and social development in Europe, the role of land use, forests and deforestation, the role of the marine environment and calculation of the external costs of climate change in industry, not least the transport sector, including quantification of the effects of air transport pollution."
"in writing. - (IT) The last intergovernmental conference on climate change and the various conferences within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have shown that the greenhouse gases produced by man are the cause of climate change and that the increase in the world's temperature must be halted at 2°C above pre-industrial levels."
"I therefore agree with the Temporary Committee on Climate Change and the rapporteur on the need for more urgent, major studies into the effects of climate change, monitoring phenomena such as desertification, melting of the ice-caps, changes in the marine environment, catastrophic atmospheric incidents and so on. The latest reports of the European Environment Agency point to the need to do much more to comply with the Kyoto and other targets for reduction set out at the March 2007 EU Council."
"In the light of the energy and climate package in the communication on 'Limiting Global Climate Change to 2 degrees Celsius', I am nonetheless persuaded that further measures can be taken to improve 'energy efficiency', which would give rise to considerable savings in greenhouse gas emissions."
"This would include a labelling system stating the greenhouse gas footprint."
"I am of the view that individuals, European citizens and the peoples of third countries should be more directly involved in promoting awareness and active involvement in the fight against climate change through small steps to save energy."
"in writing. - (DE) Climate change is a serious issue and presents mankind with a formidable challenge."
"The extent to which it is the result of human activity, however, is completely unclear."
"The latest scientific findings certainly cannot yet be regarded as hard and fast evidence and are still in a state of flux; they are not the be-all and end-all."
"Besides, the report refers to some alleged facts which are actually fallacies."
"Assumptions and false assertions, however, cannot serve as a basis for the development of any rational, effective, affordable and socially acceptable measures."
"This is why I voted against the report."
"in writing. - (SV) We have today voted for the interim report on the scientific facts of climate change."
"It requires strong backing and determination to achieve the best possible results in meeting the political challenges of climate change."
"In this context we want to stress the importance of ensuring that research is free and that criticism and questioning are a key prerequisite for the progress and development of all research."
"To limit this possibility is not just a threat to research itself but also a restriction of the right of every individual to express his or her views."
"Poverty is the biggest polluter and the ambition to mitigate climate change does not conflict with growth and modernisation."
"An essential condition for the progress of poor countries to prosperity, hence also for the development of resources and possibilities of investing in more modern and cleaner technology, is that they should be able to trade their goods freely."
"Against this background, any carbon dioxide tariffs or the like on imports constitute an inappropriate solution which risks running counter to its purpose."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the interim report of the Temporary Committee on Climate Change on the scientific facts of climate change (findings and recommendations for decision-making) because I am convinced that the broad scientific consensus on the human origins of climate change urgently requires increased action by the political powers, with particular emphasis on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and a future international climate change agreement."
"Increasing and disseminating scientific understanding of the climate change phenomenon will make people more aware of the need to alter their lifestyles and will make the decision-making processes more responsible, informed and effective."
"Encouraging research into the economic and social impacts of climate change must be a priority."
"in writing. - (PT) This is yet another report which, despite starting off with some correct statements about the current situation, makes little or no progress with regard to the solutions required."
"It is unclear on the recommended measures and limits itself to listing some vague proposals and justifications."
"It seems more aimed at facilitating the launch of new companies seeking to make ever greater profits from new activities in the areas of the environment and energy, at the cost of climate change."
"I therefore want to say that it would be good to show the same effort and persistence, and also concern, with regard to other global problems that are fundamentally ignored or merely confined to a list of chronic concerns: elimination of curable diseases, protection of soil and habitats, exhaustion of finite resources, especially hydrocarbons, and so on."
"In conclusion, the rapporteur considers that the scientific basis of climate change is settled and recommends that the European Parliament's Temporary Committee continues its work and presents, at the end of its mandate, a report to Parliament containing, as appropriate, recommendations as to actions or initiatives to be taken on the EU's future integrated policy on climate change."
"We will await this future report."
"in writing. - (PT) The scientific facts set out in this report were discussed at length with world experts during meetings of the Temporary Committee on Climate Change and cannot therefore be lightly called into question."
"Like the Florenz report, I welcome the fourth report of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) as the most comprehensive study on climate change. I agree that it is absolutely essential to avoid an increase of more than 2ºC in the global temperature, so as to avoid the most catastrophic scenarios, suggesting that the ambitious EU targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions should be maintained."
"As this is the most credible compendium of information currently available, cutting off at the root those recurrent ideas of certain isolated extremists who continue to question whether human activity is really the main cause of global warning, the Florenz report sends a clear signal that the European Parliament will maintain its strict and ambitious position in the fight against climate change. It therefore has my support."
"in writing. - (FR) In the 1960s, having agreed the benefits of planning, the French Parliament voted a growth rate for the economy every year with a view to taking its decisions on that basis, since it turned out for several years in succession that actual growth was exactly as it had voted."
"I get the same impression from reading Mr Florenz's report: the impression that this Parliament intends to vote on the world's temperature."
"Let me make this clear: what I am criticising is not man's need to protect his environment, to preserve the immense diversity of nature or, in terms of economics, to find the means to use natural resources better in order to save them."
"It is the ritual sacrifice to the new religion of climate and its new gurus, these partially-minded scientists who pour anathema on all those whose work opposes their untouchable conclusions."
"It is the systematic stigmatisation of Man as a supposedly evil entity, especially the Western and European variety."
"This is institutionalised repentance."
"It is the industrial and economic suicide of Europe, alone at the altar of so-called global warming, with no benefit to the environment worldwide, but the worst human and social consequences for the peoples of Europe."
"That is why I voted against this report."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the Florenz report on climate change and think that it is right that this Parliament takes the issue so seriously."
"Efforts to combat climate change require action at all levels, and the EU institutions as well as the nations of Europe must all work together to move towards a low-carbon economy."
"The vote on the report comes on the same day that a major energy conference takes place in Aberdeen."
"The Scottish Government has signalled their intention for Scotland to become the green energy capital of Europe."
"That government fully supports the EU's targets for renewables and is committed to a non-nuclear Scotland producing 50% of its electricity demand from renewable sources by 2020."
"I hope that other nations throughout Europe can look to Scotland as a good example in the fight against climate change."
"in writing. - Scientific findings prove the human origins of the current global warming trend and Mr Florenz's report re-iterates these results."
"There is an urgent need for action at EU level to combat climate change and limit the increase in global temperature to no more than 2 C above pre-industrial levels."
"Unlike some members from the Conservative Party, I fully accept these facts and voted in support of Mr Florenz's report ""Scientific Facts of Climate Change: Findings and Recommendations for Decision Making""."
"in writing. - (DE) When we here in Europe invest in the latest environmentally friendly technology and in renewable energy, at however great an expense, while a country like China has a new coal-fired power station coming on stream every week, our best efforts here can only be a drop in the ocean."
"We have a ludicrous situation in which those nations that accelerate climate change through unbridled industrialisation and overexploitation of natural resources and which are not prepared to exercise restraint expect the West, and particularly Europe, to help them out when they are hit by disasters."
"We are supposed to protect the environment, often to the detriment of our industry and our import trade, and then even provide the polluters with humanitarian aid in the event of a disaster."
"Unless we are all content with a global situation in which any hope of improvement will always be a pipe dream, we must sharply increase the pressure on those six countries that are responsible for almost 50% of global greenhouse gas emissions."
"The interim report of the Temporary Committee on Climate Change does not contain any new ideas, thoughts or recommendations useful to the peoples of Europe regarding environmental protection."
"It perpetuates the EU's well-known anti-popular policy of providing a 'green' excuse for the over-accumulation of capital. It confines itself to reproducing the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change."
"The report considers the 2˚C ceiling on global warming to be a 'strategic objective' of the EU, while accepting that 'such a level of warming would already heavily impact on our society and individual lifestyles'."
"It says nothing about the responsibility capitalists have assumed in over-exploiting natural resources. Instead of calling for measures at least to make monopolies more accountable, it fully adopts the multinational propaganda that we are all to blame for the aggravation of climatic conditions and stresses that 'individual changes in lifestyle patterns are necessary'."
"The agreements reached in Kyoto, Bali, etc. have proved ineffective: their primary objective is not environmental protection, but the protection of capital and its profits."
"The solution to environmental problems will not be provided by the multinationals and monopolies responsible for today's situation, but by the peoples who have to suffer the consequences."
"in writing. - (PL) History teaches us that new scientific findings can prove that theories previously widely believed to be true may lack any factual basis."
"I believe the science relating to climate change, confirming global warming, has not yet proved to be sufficiently well-founded."
"It certainly has not been proved to such an extent as to allow us, with a clear conscience, to draft law resulting in the imposition of specific behaviour in Member States of the European Union."
"We can see the increase in the average temperature of the global atmosphere. No answer has yet emerged, however, to the question as to the extent to which this is due to human activity."
"The scientific world is divided on the subject."
"Certain scientists believe major climate changes are a natural cyclical phenomenon that has affected the world for millions of years. They maintain that those scientists that issue warnings concerning the impact of human beings on climate change do so in order to attract funds for research and spread alarm amongst the population."
"Other scientists state that human beings' ability to predict long-term climate change is very limited. They allege that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is guided by politics rather than by science."
"In addition, the claim that a majority of scientists support the view that climate change is due to the action of human beings is dubious."
"The aforementioned counter-arguments are readily accessible."
"They are also irrefutable, and raise doubt and the question: can any sort of cohesive policy be built on uncertain scientific arguments put forward by lobby groups?"
"in writing. - (FR) I am in favour of the report by Mr Florenz on behalf of the Temporary Committee on Climate Change since he analyses the incidences and effects of climate change, insofar as they are vouched for by scientific proof."
"Thus the claim that the costs of climate change could account for between 5% and 20% of GDP by 2050 unless some extremely ambitious measures are taken ought to concern us."
"Even if all the Member States have made good progress to date, we must nonetheless be much more ambitious in our efforts to reduce emissions."
"We must also remain vigilant as to the potential harmful effects of promoting biofuels over world food supplies and deforestation."
"in writing. - (PT) Scientific discussions cannot involve debates about beliefs, and doubts about the accuracy of the majority opinion cannot be interpreted as negativism or as a political choice."
"Furthermore, recent episodes such as the debate about the unwanted or unexpected implications of the incentive to increase biofuel production clearly reveal how constant doubt is the only scientific certainty that we must embrace without hesitation."
"On the other hand, in discussions about the options given the scientific facts, here we are clearly in the area of political choice."
"Although I do not regard myself as scientifically competent to give an opinion on the first question, on the second I consider that I have a duty to do so."
"I have argued and I would stress that, faced with the predictable increase in consumption (particularly of energy) by our enormous population due to the positive effects of globalisation, we must find scientific answers and technological solutions."
"Some changes in behaviour, both individual and collective, are certainly welcome."
"However, it is in science that we will find the basic solutions that we need."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted against this report in the final vote because I take the struggle against climate change seriously and cannot subscribe to dogmatic and apocalyptic formulations that would spread alarm among the people of Europe."
"The report presents scientific findings with a 60-70 % probability as proven facts."
"If I were one of the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in John's Book of Revelation, I would rather be sitting on the white horse than on the pale one."
"Climate change is a sensitive issue that cannot be reduced to slogans."
"in writing. - (FR) I abstained on the own-initiative report by my Dutch colleague, Ria Oomen-Ruijten, on Turkey's 2007 progress report with a view to accession, even though, like our Committee on Foreign Affairs, I welcome the undertaking by Prime Minister Erdoğan to make 2008 the year of reforms and to turn Turkey into a modern and prosperous democracy based on a secular state and a pluralist society."
"However, we would do well to recall Turkey's undertaking to ensure good neighbourly relations with Greece and Bulgaria and the need to secure a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus question based on EU principles."
"Furthermore, Turkey is not answering the call to end the economic blockade of Armenia and start a process of reconciliation, allowing for a frank and open discussion of past events."
"These negotiations are important for the EU and Turkey since the latter is taking up the Community acquis."
"Under no circumstances, however, should the negotiations prejudge the final political decision on Turkey's accession to the EU."
"in writing. - The Fine Gael delegation of the EPP-ED Group voted in favour of the overall Oomen-Ruijten report on Turkey's progress in 2007."
"We support the reforms which Turkey is undertaking towards democracy, good governance and the rule of law."
"These steps are positive both for Turkey and the EU and we support Turkey's efforts towards reform."
"However, we the undersigned, voted against Amendment 14 relating to paragraph 16 in the report which included the words 'sexual and reproductive rights'."
"We voted against this section of the amendment for the reasons set out in our joint declaration to Parliament in the plenary of 13 March 2008."
"in writing. - I voted for the Oomen-Ruijten report on Turkey's progress towards membership of the EU in 2007."
"I do believe that Turkey should be capable of joining the Union."
"Currently there are difficulties on issues of trade-union and human rights and the rights of minorities such as the Kurds and the Christians."
"However, progress is being made, albeit slowly, and should be acknowledged."
"I did support the amendments dealing with the Armenian genocide."
"I know it was a long time ago, but a nation must come to terms with its history and so far Turkey has failed to come to terms with this bloody stain on its record."
"It may not be a final barrier to membership of the EU, but we cannot in all honestly just sweep it under an all too convenient Turkish carpet."
"in writing. - (FR) The remarks by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten in her report on Turkey's progress with a view to accession show, as though any further proof were required, that Turkey, in terms of its civilisation, its mindset, its traditions - all perfectly respectable, of course - is not a European country."
"Moreover, it is not necessary to look elsewhere to uncover the reasons for the immense difficulties encountered during the accession negotiations."
"The French Presidency, commencing on 1 July, may be the chance to raise this essential ambiguity: the fiction of Turkey's European vocation as set out in the 1963 Treaty."
"Betraying his electoral promises, Mr Sarkozy now says he wishes to continue negotiations, and in fact start up fresh negotiations in areas 'not directly linked to accession', according to a formula as demagogic as it is hypocritical which solves no problems whatsoever."
"Who can be persuaded that discussions merely concern a 'quasi-accession'?"
"I fear that the sole objective in retaining the French Constitution's compulsory consultation of the people on any new European accession is to let citizens and citizens alone take responsibility for 45 years of political and diplomatic cowardice not attributable to Turkey itself, but only to their governments."
"in writing. - (PT) Despite certain contradictions, it is a fact that Turkey is strategically important for the EU's ambitions, particularly given the current deepening crisis in the capitalist system."
"While its final status remains in doubt - full member of the EU or of a future Mediterranean Union - what seems certain is that the EU is trying to find solutions which best serve the interests of the major economic and financial groups in the main countries, in particular Germany."
"Turkey offers a huge market which is awakening various appetites."
"It is a vast country, with a huge and cheap workforce and a plentiful supply of consumers, which, however, is not permitted to commemorate the first of May, as was recently seen in the brutal repression by Turkish security forces of trade union members and demonstrators."
"It is a vast territory that occupies an important geostrategic position between Europe, Asia and the Middle East, that is playing a central role in the dispute about ownership of and access to the energy resources of Central Asia (such as the Nabucco project) and that has a key role to play in the US-NATO-EU partnership."
"Turkey is also a country whose authorities are militarily and illegally occupying part of the territory of an EU Member State, Cyprus."
"in writing. - (CS) Although the motion for a European Parliament resolution quotes a number of documents, the fundamental information is missing."
"This country has been a candidate country since 1963."
"Conditions for opening negotiations have been discussed all the time."
"The so-called Copenhagen criteria, laid down in 1993, cannot be found in the opening preambles of the text."
"When we sink our teeth into the European Commission's Turkey 2007 progress report, we find out that, although some progress has been made, the legislation adopted in regard to national minorities has not yet been sufficiently implemented."
"The fact that approximately 10% of the Turkish population capable of work are employed in the countries of the EU is an indicator of the depth of the long-standing relations between Turkey and the EU."
"What will surprise us is the state of implementation of regulations in the economic area, rather debatable so far."
"Although these regulations are formally enshrined in Turkish legislation, we often see a very 'un-European' approach in dealing with individual cases."
"We can say that, although Turkey has achieved significant success, in many areas the differences between Turkey and most countries of the EU (including the Balkan States) have not significantly diminished so far."
"The army's influence over the country's political system and the powerful status of Sunni Islam are the most obvious features of Turkish society, distinguishing it from EU countries."
"The report portrays the present situation of the society rather accurately."
"Although paragraph 12 of the resolution is not balanced, the GUE/NGL Group will not vote against it."
"in writing. - (FR) Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report illustrates the autistic side of the leaders of Brussels' Europe in their denials of the evidence: Turkey is an Asian country."
"Their blindness leads them to deny the foreseeable consequences of its accession."
"With a population of over 100 million by 2020, Turkey will have the EU's largest population and will therefore be the major state in the European institutions."
"This means our Parliament runs the risk of being dominated, not by the PPE-DE Group or by the Socialist Group, but by AKP Islamists."
"Turkey will also be the country receiving most assistance: Turkish regions will absorb the vast majority of structural funds, and its ten million farmers will destroy the common agricultural policy."
"This refusal to accept reality also leads our governments to ignore the wishes of the peoples of Europe."
"Thus, having imposed the European constitutional treaty on France which the country rejected in 2005, Mr Sarkozy is making ready to remove Article 88.5 of the Constitution, submitting the accession of new EU states to a referendum."
"If Brussels succeeded in imposing Turkey's accession, we would have to suggest our nations quit such a setup, which would be European only in name, in order to build another Europe, a European Europe: the Europe of nations."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of the report on Turkey's progress towards EU membership in 2007."
"I must express my dismay, however, at reading in the German newspaper Die Welt that Turkey, which likes to be portrayed as a moderate Islamic country, has enacted a law prohibiting the purchase and public serving of wine in glasses."
"Wine is a European cultural asset which is legally manufactured in most Member States of the EU and which can be sold and consumed in all Member States."
"Such a law is incompatible with full membership of the EU."
"All legally manufactured products - and that includes wine - are goods, the free movement of which within the internal market must be guaranteed."
"Such a ban also infringes the anti-discrimination rules of the EU."
"A country that restricts the free movement of any legally manufactured good from other Member States cannot be a full member of the EU."
"The Prime Minister, Mr Erdoğan, pledged that 2008 would be the year of reform, designed to make Turkey a modern democracy based on a secular state and a pluralist society."
"In view of the Turkish ban on the sale and consumption of wine in glasses, I have to ask whether this pledge amounts to 'words, idle words'."
"in writing. - Ria Oomen-Ruijten's Turkey 2007 Progress Report is a comprehensive and encouraging analysis of the country's progress towards accession."
"Turkey appears to have made progress on areas such as freedom of speech and judicial reform."
"The Government's proposals to reform Article 301, a hurdle to full democratic freedom in the country, are also to be welcomed."
"Of course, further effort is needed in areas pertaining to rights for minority groups in the country and the current case going through the Constitutional Court is of concern."
"I support the report's recommendations and I voted in favour."
"in writing. - (SK) I welcome Turkey's 2007 progress report by my colleague, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, which urges the Turkish Government to fulfil its promises to pursue reforms and modernise the country."
"I also want to express my long-held view, which is a view of the vast majority of Europeans as well, that the EU should not offer Turkey the prospect of full membership."
"Geographically, culturally and spiritually, Turkey is outside the European identity concept."
"In addition to that, the budget of the Union is not and will not be capable of coping with the burden that Turkey's full membership would bring."
"That said, I support the vision of close cooperation, the so-called 'strategic partnership' between the EU and Turkey."
"I also see the significance of the report in this light."
"I welcome the fact that Turkey has achieved some progress in several areas in 2007."
"In spite of that, the dismal human rights situation still persists."
"In the context of this report, we should insist more on improving the situation of the national minorities (namely the Kurdish minority) and on introducing complete freedom of speech and religion."
"I also support the call for Article 301 of the Penal Code to be abolished and for the Greek Orthodox Halki Seminary to be immediately re-opened."
"We also must make demands on Turkey to look back upon its past and accept the fact of the Armenian genocide, as well as the illegality of its military interference in Cyprus."
"in writing. - (DE) Time and again, Turkey demonstrates that it is not ready for EU membership by oppressing its minorities, by launching air strikes against a neighbouring country and, most recently, by vetoing the appointment of the head of the Austrian archaeological excavation team in Ephesus, apparently because of anti-Turkish comments made by a member of her family."
"The cosmetic amendments to the article of the Penal Code prohibiting the denigration of Turkey and Turkishness are diverting the attention of Brussels from the use of brute force against demonstrators and from the acts of military aggression against northern Iraq."
"In view of Turkey's lack of readiness for EU membership, the only option is immediate cessation of the accession negotiations; talks on a privileged partnership could be conducted as an alternative."
"Every report on Turkey is an expression of the EU's imperialist competitive designs on that country."
"This particular report has opted to support the Turkish Government by trying to place undue emphasis on the progress Turkey is making in various areas, which is contrary to reality."
"As usual, the report sings the praises of democratic rights, despite the well-known autocratic, repressive policy of the Turkish Government, as was recently proved by the brutal suppression of the May Day demonstrations."
"The report tolerates Turkey's anti-Kurdish policy."
"The report indirectly supports Turkish attacks on Iraqi territory. While condemning the 'violence' perpetrated by the PKK and 'other terrorist groups', it merely advises the Turkish army not to engage in any 'disproportionate military operations'."
"The report glosses over the continuing Turkish occupation of Cyprus and avoids categorically and unconditionally demanding the withdrawal of Turkish military forces."
"The report welcomes Turkey's active participation in the imperialist missions and interventions of the EU and NATO."
"Given Turkey's position in the imperialist system and its competitiveness in the wider arena, the EU aims to use the accession process to its advantage in order to gain control of the energy and geostrategic resources in the same arena."
"For these reasons we are voting against the report."
"in writing. - (FR) Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report is extremely balanced: it welcomes the legislative initiatives made by the Turkish authorities to continue the process of reforms, but also presses Turkey to step up the pace of reform in order to guarantee respect for the principles of the rule of law."
"The Kurdish issue, including its cultural and economic aspects, must likewise be addressed."
"In the same way, the matter of equal opportunities for women must be enshrined in the new draft constitution."
"The Turkish Government is also asked to respect pluralism and religious diversity in a secular democratic state."
"Negotiations may continue only with full adherence to the principles and values of the European Union."
"in writing. - (PT) The progress made in various areas of society, the economy and politics in recent years gives us good reason to note how the desire to accede to the European Union can successfully lead to major reforms in countries where this possibility exists."
"As this is the case with Turkey, and as these negotiations have always remained open, there is no longer any need to stress the importance of taking full advantage of this opportunity in order, whatever the outcome of the negotiations, to promote the most comprehensive and essential reforms in Turkey."
"Alongside the recognition given by this report - and also the statements made by senior EU officials, in particular the Commission President - we cannot fail to be concerned about the legal proceedings brought against the AK Party."
"Although the fact that there has been no military intervention is preferable, we still regret this attempt to obtain, through the courts, what the ballot boxes have denied."
"On the other hand, the persistent doubts about the true intentions of the AK Party are also worrying."
"The defence of religious freedom, as we understand it in the European Union, merits our agreement."
"The widespread imposition of one religious view on the whole of society would be unacceptable."
"in writing. - Having supported the report, may I remind you that the first speech that I made in this Chamber, on 13 December 2004, concerned Turkey's progress towards accession, insisting that before even considering their membership, Turkey should first recognise the legitimate Greek Cypriot government, acknowledge the 1915 Armenian genocide and improve the situation of the world's largest stateless nation, the Kurds."
"In four years none of those issues has been resolved."
"There has been no remarkable progress in Turkey's relations with Cyprus, no sign of willingness to admit past crimes."
"Instead, the Turkish Army, with the authorisation of the Turkish Parliament, is carrying out genocide against the Kurds."
"The European Union must take a firmer stance on Turkey and halt the negotiations until the aforementioned issues have been resolved."
"in writing. - (FR) By voting against the report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs on the situation in Turkey, the French UMP Delegation wishes to state that the Commission, the Member State Governments and the European Parliament are wrong to continue stoking the illusion of Turkey's accession."
"The UMP is not opposed to Ria Oomen-Ruijten's report, which is an excellent piece of work, but to a refusal to take into consideration the reality of Turkey and its policy, at odds with our project for European integration."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted against this report and the resolution proposed in order to state once more my opposition to the principle of Turkey's accession to the EU."
"The European Commission, the Member State Governments and the European Parliament are wrong to continue stoking this illusion, which is duping both Turkish citizens and European citizens."
"I refuse to associate myself with a political posture that takes no account of the reality of Turkey and its policy, at odds with our project for European integration."
"If Europe is a space of shared values, we cannot close our eyes to the disturbing tendencies of the Turkish authorities in relation to the principles of the rule of law, freedom of expression and thought, or respect for minority rights."
"Taking a soft line with the Turkish authorities vis-à-vis their responsibilities is a strategic error that distances them from the progress to be made, not towards accession to the EU, but to allow the Turkish people to reap the benefits of their basic rights and social and economic development in Turkey."
"A privileged partnership with Turkey will help these objectives to be met, with respect for the integrity of both parties."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.50 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"Tragic situation in Burma (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the tragic situation in Burma."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) We are all still shaken by the human suffering that the destructive cyclone Nargis caused to the poor and oppressed population of Burma, or Myanmar."
"We expressed the European Union's deepest sympathy in numerous statements published in the aftermath of the disaster."
"Moreover, the European Union immediately promised urgent funds in aid of humanitarian needs."
"So far the Union's commitments have exceeded the sum of EUR 60 million."
"At the same time it should be emphasised that the amount that has been promised will top up the already existing aid provided by the European Union, which is not a small amount."
"In spite of this, the key issue continues to be the access to areas that have been affected, and how to distribute help quickly."
"Last Tuesday the Presidency, in cooperation with the Commissioner Louis Michel, convened an extraordinary session of the European Union Council."
"On that occasion the development ministers agreed that there was a danger of an even greater tragedy if the Burmese authorities were not ready for a better cooperation."
"The situation is still critical."
"This is why the European Council urged the Burmese authorities to introduce urgent measures facilitating access to help for people who are in dire straits."
"The Council welcomed the efforts made by the Commissioner Louis Michel to convince the authorities in Burma/Myanmar that the humanitarian help is urgent and neutral."
"At the same time we regret that the Burmese authorities were not prepared to make use of all the help that the European Union and the international community are prepared to provide."
"In addition, the Council has expressed its full support to the UN General Secretary and to all the initiatives given by the UN bodies that would help to meet humanitarian requirements."
"We also welcome the UN General Secretary Ban Ki-moon's visit to Burma, scheduled for tomorrow."
"The Council has raised the issue of the situation in Burma at all political meetings that have been recently held with its Asian partners."
"The Asian countries have been invited to influence the Burmese authorities and to convince them that the nature of the international humanitarian aid is neutral and unbiased."
"On 19 May the Foreign Ministers of the ASEAN Member States met in Singapore."
"The European Union had previously presented this group with a demarche asking the countries in the region to influence the Burmese authorities to open the borders to humanitarian aid and humanitarian aid workers."
"On Monday, 26 May, the General Affairs and External Relations Council will have a debate on the humanitarian situation in Burma, and on the denial of access to humanitarian aid experts and the delivery of aid to the affected area."
"Burma, or Myanmar, also continues to be a priority topic in the Council's debates because of the political situation in that country."
"The fact that, in spite of the huge scale of the humanitarian disaster, the Military Junta has not cancelled the national referendum is a cause for concern."
"We believe that this may lead to irregularities in the new constitution's adoption procedure."
"We are also concerned due to reports of escalating intimidation during the period of preparations for the referendum."
"I should emphasise that the European Union is also disappointed because the authorities have not paid any attention to the calls of the United Nations for a more inclusive and more legitimate transition to democracy."
"I should like to affirm that the European Union will continue to support the endeavours of the United Nations."
"Finally, please take note that on 29 April the European Union revised the common position adopted back in November 2007."
"This position, which was adopted as a response to suppression of peaceful protests, from now on includes firmer restrictive measures against Burma."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first and foremost I wish to thank you for placing Burma on the agenda for this sitting."
"In view of the scale of the catastrophe caused by Cyclone Nargis on 2 May, we suggested the Presidency call an extraordinary meeting of the Council of EU Foreign Affairs Ministers."
"The Council meeting was convened as soon as possible by the Slovenian Presidency, who I wish to thank, and was held on 12 May."
"At the meeting the EU called for increased cooperation by the Burmese authorities to allow access and distribution of international humanitarian aid."
"I decided to follow up the call directly by visiting Burma on 15 and 16 May."
"During my mission, which I made clear was strictly humanitarian and non-political, I was able to meet the Burmese authorities and the representatives of humanitarian organisations in Burma, and I made a visit on the ground to the areas affected around Yangon."
"I had two and a half hours of quite intense meetings and discussions with the Minister for Planning - who obviously held most authority and was certainly the most authoritarian of the three I met - the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Health."
"What emerged very clearly from my mission was that the Burmese authorities are still extremely reluctant to create the operational conditions normally required to provide an international humanitarian response to meet local needs."
"It is equally clear to me that an approach seeking to impose international humanitarian aid on the Burmese authorities, in due consideration of our current means, is doomed to failure and could even be counterproductive."
"All the humanitarian organisations in Burma told me this, and confirmed that the problem is obviously not the lack of organisations on the ground, or even a lack of funds, since a lack of means also certainly depends on access to international experts and professionals, but rather lack of access."
"My mission certainly made a modest contribution to opening up a tiny window to gradually create a minimum humanitarian space for international humanitarian aid."
"The Burmese authorities provided a partial response to various specific demands: for example, visas for experts working for the Commission were extended by two weeks."
"They had been issued with three-day visas and these were extended for two weeks."
"We had requested one month."
"We also clarified a situation that appeared genuinely serious."
"At certain locations, the local authorities were demanding a permit, and therefore written authorisation, even for local workers, meaning people employed by our agencies, by the UN or by NGOs, and in most cases this was of course impossible."
"This was clarified, and obviously no authorisation is required for local workers."
"Authorisation is also no longer required to enter the disaster areas, in particular Pathein airport."
"I also asked for a second airport to be opened up for planes arriving with equipment, in other words Pathein airport which is a military airport."
"I was told that this was not possible because the technical standards used by the control tower differed from international standards and, in any case, that this would not make the work any easier since the roads between Rangoon and the delta, the area worst affected, were in much better condition and much easier to use."
"Unfortunately I had no authorisation to check this kind of information for myself."
"I feel it is important for international pressure to be maintained, both by neighbouring countries and by the international community as a whole."
"I ought to say that, in my discussions with the authorities, I also made a specific request - I made, in fact, five specific requests which I will tell you about in just a moment - that doctors and medical staff from neighbouring countries be allowed to deploy in the areas worst hit, and they obtained authorisation for this on the day I left."
"This means that 140 doctors were deployed and also medical staff from Laos, Cambodia, India, Bangladesh and Thailand."
"They were thus able to visit the areas worst hit."
"The role to be played by neighbouring countries is crucial, and I was also able to have quite a long discussion with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon while waiting for my plane to return to Bangkok."
"I passed on all this information to him, told him my feelings on the issue, and also how the mission had gone."
"The UN Secretary-General agreed with this analysis, but had two specific suggestions to make himself: to deploy a joint UN/ASEAN humanitarian aid coordinator, and to quickly organise a donor conference co-presided by the UN and ASEAN on 24 and 25 May in Bangkok."
"Following on from the recent visit by the United Nations humanitarian aid coordinator John Holmes, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is visiting Burma tomorrow to discuss how to channel international aid."
"In relation to needs, the humanitarian situation in Burma remains dramatic. There is a danger that the first catastrophe caused by the cyclone could be worsened by a second humanitarian disaster: the risk of famine, since harvests were destroyed, and also epidemics among survivors whose living conditions are deplorable."
"There is a risk of epidemics."
"When we were there, the World Health Organization did not see identify risk of cholera, but large numbers of children were suffering from diarrhoea and so on."
"This meant there was a risk of epidemic caused by water pollution."
"There is also a risk of famine."
"The region stockpiles large amounts of rice, and all food in storage has been destroyed."
"There is one practical problem: this land ought to be sown to ensure a harvest in October."
"The timeline is therefore a maximum of three to four weeks."
"A number of people at the temporary camps, as they call them, do not wish to return to their own areas for all sorts of reasons, while others do wish to return, but need special kinds of seeds since all the soil has been salinated, and therefore they need much stronger plants, and also fertilisers."
"I thus attempted to engage in constructive, practical dialogue with the authorities on this matter."
"It was thought that the UNDP micro-credit scheme could be used as a finance mechanism."
"We are still discussing this at present."
"I must tell you it is no rapid process."
"The Commission provided a rapid response, with an emergency decision of two million euros adopted on 5 May."
"As you know, I am authorised to release three million euros right away with no official procedures."
"Of course, since we had no identification, we began by releasing two million."
"We subsequently decided on an envelope of five million euros in food aid, and also an additional emergency envelope of ten million euros."
"We are, of course, willing to do more on the basis of needs assessments and assurances in terms of aid monitoring."
"When I left after my two and a half hours of discussions with the authorities, I sent them a specific written note of the various requests I had made."
"My first request concerned visa extensions for those working temporarily on the mission, namely the Commission staff."
"We were given a two-week extension."
"I also asked for final clarification, and for them to notify our local authorities that Burmese workers at our agencies and other operators no longer require official authorisation or a travel permit."
"This point has obviously been clarified."
"I asked for multiple-entry visas for six months to allow the EU-financed NGOs working there to triple their international personnel."
"When I left Burma there were one hundred or so visa applications outstanding for UN agencies, and just over one hundred NGO applications."
"I asked to be informed regularly."
"Some have been issued since, but it is a far cry from what was requested."
"I also requested visas and travel permits to visit the delta and to ensure that sufficient personnel could be mobilised."
"As I said, I then asked for permits to be issued rapidly to doctors in the area and local medical staff."
"It would appear they understood this point perfectly."
"As for Pathein airport, which could have acted as a kind of redistribution hub for products arriving in planes sent by the international community, the answer here was an outright no. The reason was, according to them, that the control equipment and means were not in line with international standards, and that it was much easier to go via Rangoon."
"I doubt this because, when I was there, Rangoon was already overwhelmed and had a number of problems which were subsequently rectified to a certain extent."
"I am not sure that these were sorted out thanks to me."
"It was simply that they could not find a way to operate Rangoon airport either."
"I also feel that operations were handled in this manner for reasons relating to institutional comfort."
"All in all, it was an extremely frustrating mission, I can tell you."
"I feel there is total distrust of the international community."
"There are some very deep-rooted a priori concerns in the country."
"One occasionally has the distinct impression that nobody is listening to anyone else."
"It is extremely difficult to reach the conscience and mindset of the person we are talking to."
"The talks went well because for two and a half hours we had a genuine discussion, all quite courteous but firm too, because one nagging question persists: why say no to the international personnel that is so necessary to assist with operations?"
"I also mentioned the responsibility to protect, in this way in particular, and even this led to a problem of principles."
"At that point I was told that certain questions required no answers."
"That was how the mission went."
"Obviously I was sad I had not secured anything more specific, but I cannot pretend I was not glad to return to Europe."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commissioner has provided us with a persuasive and graphic portrayal of the way in which the ruling military government in Burma is cynically and brutally betraying its own people."
"I wish to address myself here to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the ASEAN Member Countries."
"For many years, the European Parliament has maintained friendly relations with the parliamentarians of the ASEAN countries."
"Not too long ago, those countries signed a new ASEAN Charter in which they explicitly affirm their adherence to the principle of respecting and protecting human rights."
"It goes without saying that ASEAN bears some responsibility for Burma, which is one of its Member Countries, and that the global reputation of the ASEAN countries will suffer if it continues to let the Burmese military junta act as it is acting at the moment."
"I appeal to the Member Countries of ASEAN, in their own best interests and for the sake of their good and friendly relations with the European Union, to do whatever they can to persuade the Burmese military junta that it must let the outside world help its country's population."
"As I have indicated, this lies within the power and responsibility of the ASEAN countries."
"They will be asked how they are exercising this responsibility, and whether or not they use their scope for action in this matter will influence our relations with ASEAN."
"They need not act by means of public appeals - there are other ways - but the European Union expects that Burma's neighbours in particular will do whatever they can to change the attitude of its ruling regime."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) I shall begin by complimenting the Commissioner on behalf of my Group. Today he has stated clearly that he is doing what he can, in very difficult circumstances."
"He himself referred to a dialogue of the deaf."
"We must note that the situation in Burma takes bizarre forms."
"It is nearly three weeks now since the cyclone hit the country, and the government is still letting in hardly any outside aid."
"The authorities themselves seem to be remaining rather passive."
"The country has been closed to aid workers, experts and media for weeks."
"It is almost Kafkaesque that the junta did let a referendum designed to strengthen its own position go ahead a week and a half ago."
"According to a number of sources, the official death toll is around eighty thousand."
"Tens of thousands are still missing and the number displaced is over two million."
"These are gradually becoming Pol Pot proportions, or at least we believe so, because there is just as little information coming out of the country as there is aid going in."
"Former UN coordinator Jan Egeland said at the beginning of this week that refusing to allow aid in is murder."
"The Burmese Government is turning its responsibility to protect into a farce."
"The contrast with China, tragically struck by a violent earthquake last week, is remarkable."
"The widespread devastation was not covered up and could be seen on TV everywhere, including in China itself, and the Chinese Government issued an international appeal for help."
"The image of the Burmese Government can no longer be damaged much more."
"It has more or less reached an all-time low."
"China is in a position to do much more to urge the Burmese Government to accept help."
"So area Russia and India which must put pressure on the junta either in the UN or in ASEAN."
"I agree with the comment by Mr Nassauer on that point."
"Last Monday agreement was reached within ASEAN on international aid to Burma."
"All aid is to be coordinated through ASEAN."
"This is a step forward, but direct aid from the West is still ruled out."
"A donor conference is to be held next week."
"I appeal to Europe to contribute generously and wholeheartedly, but that is only if guarantees are given that our contribution will actually go to the right place and that journalists will also be allowed into the country, so that we can get a proper picture of the situation there."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) How many times have we stood in this House before talking about Burma?"
"Several times a year we stand here and still the case remains hopeless."
"However, the situation in Burma has become even worse than last time we spoke about it."
"One point four million victims have still not received any help."
"Thirty thousand children are suffering from acute malnutrition."
"Hundreds of thousands are homeless and at risk of cholera, pneumonia and infectious diseases."
"I understand that this morning as many as eight foreign doctors from Médecins Sans Frontières have been allowed into the disaster area."
"I should like in any case to back the appeal that Mr Nassauer has made to ASEAN."
"It must now finally show determination, because it is clear that the junta is more interested in the survival of its own regime through the referendum that is not worthy of the name - Mr Wiersma calls that 'Kafkaesque' - than the survival of its own people."
"The generals think that foreigners coming into the country would threaten the survival of the military regime."
"It is clear, though, that Médecins Sans Frontières, Oxfam, the British, French and US ships are bringing aid goods, not regime change, however much I might wish for that myself."
"However, we can apparently not convince the junta of that, so we have to look for alternatives."
"I think the best alternative is the Security Council."
"Europe and the United States must insist that the situation in Burma is put on the agenda."
"All the United Nations Member States have signed up to the following two principles: accepting responsibility for the protection of citizens and, if a country is no longer able or willing to do that, the right of the international community to intervene in disasters."
"The United Nations has to act."
"I understand the problems and I am proud of Commissioner Michel who, instead of wringing his hands and convening working groups, just got down to it with the motto 'deeds, not words'."
"That impresses me."
"I also think the support promised by the European Union is exemplary."
"I believe the French Minister, Mr Kouchner, is right in saying that the junta is guilty of a crime against humanity."
"I do wonder why we, the other 26 EU Member States, are not listening hard."
"Mr President, aid must be brought to the Burmese people, with or without the consent of the junta."
"Withholding essential support is a crime against humanity."
"I would like to see the European Union take the initiative in getting the United Nations and the Security Council to refer this case to the prosecutor at the International Criminal Court in The Hague."
"Enough is enough, patience has run out."
"I would say, drag the junta into the International Criminal Court."
"That is what we want."
"The way the situation is now, they are the ones who belong behind bars, not the dissidents in Burma!"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Madam President, I feel we ought to be slightly more precise in the way we talk about this issue; for example, the concept of neutrality."
"We are not neutral."
"If we are for the people of Burma, this means we are against the military junta."
"Since the military junta has no intention of helping the people of Burma, we are against the military junta."
"We must not support it, and this is exactly how we are perceived."
"Louis Michel held discussions for two and a half hours."
"The entire story has a surrealist ring to it: he says he went there, he talked to them for two and a half hours, he was told that such-and-such an airport could not be mobilised in 24 hours, whereas technical facilities were provided to open an airport in Sarajevo."
"It is therefore obvious we are at an extremely specific juncture, and I agree: the responsibility to protect means the military junta is committing a crime against humanity, against its own population."
"This is a fact."
"We will see what becomes of this state of affairs in the public debates to follow."
"It is, however, true that this obvious case must be submitted to the International Court of Justice."
"What is most interesting is that in doing this we are addressing the Security Council, and Burma's protectors, the Chinese, are in fact talking a rather unintelligible language."
"We could say, in fact, that China may have done the right thing by opening up its borders, but at the same time it continues to protect Burma, and continues to protect a government that is massacring its own people."
"Thus I feel that in this situation it is obvious nobody can impose food."
"We must nevertheless exert pressure, all the pressure we can."
"Even a possible solution involving assistance manu militari would give us and countries in Asia some chance of putting pressure on Burma."
"I think Louis Michel's speech to us today was quite explicit: talk to me honey, talk to me, I'm listening, but I couldn't care less."
"That is what he told us in his diplomatic way, for which I have the utmost respect."
"Today, however, the authorities in Burma are deaf."
"They will not listen, they are not interested in a constitutional referendum, as has been mentioned."
"They are laughing at us all."
"Henceforth, therefore, pressure must be stepped up to the maximum, and we must ask for the consequences to be submitted to the Security Council and the International Criminal Court in The Hague."
"Mr President, nearly three weeks have passed since cyclone Nagris hit Burma destroying the harbours and the deltas of the Ayeyarwady."
"It destroyed houses and towns killing thousands of people and leaving thousands of others homeless."
"History has taught us that, unless we react immediately when people suffer, their suffering is bound to increase by multiples and factors way beyond our conception."
"In many ways, the failure of the Burmese regime is a reflection of what we have been saying in this Parliament over the last number of years concerning the military junta that is presently in place in Burma."
"However, despite our objections to that military junta, we must find mechanisms - however they are arrived at - to deliver aid directly to the people."
"I welcome the fact - and little did I think I would be saying this today - that the military junta has now allowed in five United Nations helicopters to distribute food, despite the fact that a French naval vessel and American naval vessels are in the bay waiting to deliver food and medical aid to the people."
"It is incumbent on all of us to guarantee that we can make the best possible efforts to assist human beings when they are suffering."
"Indeed, with regard to those great defenders of Burma, the Chinese, Burma could learn from the way in which the Chinese reacted to their most recent natural disaster by appealing for international aid and assistance from Japan and other countries."
"Hopefully among these different alliances we can create conditions whereby the aid and succour can be delivered."
"The issue with regard to the International Criminal Court is a matter for another day."
"Our first and most immediate aim and task, following what Louis Michel has already said, is to guarantee that we put in place the mechanisms to deliver that aid, to rebuild the infrastructure, to rebuild homes and, most importantly of all, to prevent the continuing suffering of the Burmese people."
"Madam President, a regime which wantonly allows its own citizens to needlessly suffer in pursuit of its own xenophobic paranoia is not just amoral but evil, and sadly such a junta rules in Burma."
"Unmoved as it is by the plight of its own people, it is unlikely to be influenced by what is said in the European Parliament, but in the name of humanity we must speak out."
"We are not trying to control Burma, we are just trying to help its people, though the reality is that without regime change little will improve in the long term for the Burmese."
"Yes, we must maximise humanitarian aid, considering food and supply drops as a necessary tactic; but ultimately the restoration of democracy is how this once-thriving country will reclaim its position and put the people's needs before the junta's preservation."
"Madam President, firstly let me express my heartfelt sympathy for all the Burmese people who have been bereaved or injured by the effects of Cyclone Nargis."
"The people of Burma are in the thoughts and prayers of many Europeans."
"However, our condolences are not enough."
"We must discuss practical measures and see how we can implement them so that we alleviate the suffering of the survivors."
"Many countries and international organisations are both willing and able to provide immediate humanitarian aid; they have been for a matter of weeks now."
"Unfortunately, the ruling military authorities consider the preservation of their own power as of prime importance; the suffering of their own people seems to be of little consequence."
"They fear any kind of foreign involvement in Burma, even if this is of aid workers."
"The Commissioner's first-hand account of his discussions with the Burmese military authorities makes for sobering listening and there is not much hope that the Burmese authorities will change their position."
"So while we talk and wring our hands in dismay over the impossibility of getting the Burmese authorities to accept help and over the impotence of ASEAN, hundreds of thousands are suffering."
"The UN Security Council can and should call on its principle of responsibility to protect and provide aid without the consent of the Burmese authorities."
"I would strongly urge the UK Government - which currently holds the Presidency of the Security Council - to sanction immediate airdrops of aid."
"The Burmese authorities are responsible for a crime against humanity, but we cannot sit by passively allowing them to continue in this crime."
"And while I agree that an airdrop is not the ideal way of getting aid into a country - for we would rather have trained aid workers distributing help - it is better than nothing, so, please, let us get some help in and let us get it in now."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I want to add my voice to those who have expressed their sincere sympathies with the bereaved families of the tens of thousands of victims of the deadly Cyclone Nargis in Burma (Myanmar)."
"I also want to express my full solidarity with the hundreds of thousands of people who have lost, as a result of this natural disaster, their livelihoods and roofs over their heads."
"I welcome the speed with which the European Commission's humanitarian aid was offered and I also appreciate Commissioner Michel's quick action."
"Unfortunately I cannot approve of the behaviour of the Burmese Government and the Burmese authorities."
"It was inhuman and cruel how they were preventing their own people, victims of this horrible disaster, from receiving foreign humanitarian aid."
"Consequently I want to call on the Burmese Government and on the Burmese senior officials to fully open the borders to foreign aid, and to allow the goods and the workers of foreign humanitarian organisations to enter the country."
"I also call on China, India, Singapore and other countries in the region, including the ASEAN Member Countries, to use their influence to persuade Burma to open up to foreign aid."
"No country in the world is capable of coping with a natural disaster of this magnitude on its own."
"Madam President, the situation in Burma following the recent catastrophic cyclone is tragic and is getting worse every day."
"Those civilians who survived when the cyclone first struck now face illness and death by hunger, lack of shelter and appropriate medical care."
"Yet the military dictators ruling Burma remain largely apathetic to the urgent need to allow proper help to reach the victims."
"These heartless military generals care much more about clinging to power and far less about the destiny of the disaster survivors."
"The way the Burmese regime has acted and continues to act is unacceptable and criminal."
"The international community, and the EU in particular through Commissioner Michel, has done its best to convince the junta of Burma to listen to reason but, alas, without the desired effect."
"I think there is now no other way but to proceed with some form of forced aid delivery to the affected region."
"Such an undertaking can be launched with urgent approval from the UN and with the necessary logistics provided by appropriate military delivery systems in close coordination with other countries such as the USA."
"This is truly a last-resort, exceptional measure, but is absolutely necessary in my view in order to save thousands of innocent lives."
"We just cannot remain inactive and watch the suffering and demise of the Burmese people go on any longer."
"(DE) Madam President, the scale of the crisis in Burma is horrific: 100 000 deaths, 200 000 people missing and more than two million homeless in a country of 54 million inhabitants."
"The Irrawaddy Delta is Burma's largest rice-producing region and plays a key role in food production."
"The tidal wave swept inland for 22 miles, flooding fields and leaving many of them heavily salinated."
"In other words, the present humanitarian disaster is set to be compounded in the medium term by a food production crisis in the Irrawaddy Delta."
"The people of Burma urgently need immediate as well as long-term help from the international community."
"That help, unfortunately, must be forced through against the will of the generals, come what may."
"A government blocking emergency aid is a scandal without precedent in the history of international relations."
"The victims of the cyclone are being held hostage by a paranoid and murderous band of soldiers that has ruled Burma for several decades."
"Last September the popular pro-democracy movement led by Buddhist monks was brutally crushed. Thousands were killed or abducted, and now tens of thousands are dying because the government is not letting aid through."
"Its refusal to accept aid for the people is killing them."
"This murderous regime belongs at the very top of the United Nations' blacklist, and the members of the junta belong in the dock at the International Criminal Court."
"(PL) Humankind has not yet learnt how to prevent the tragic consequences of natural disasters."
"These consequences are even more dramatic in the case of countries governed by dictators."
"The plight of the Burmese nation is a contemporary example of this."
"The people of Burma have suffered both as a result of the cyclone and as a result of the behaviour of the military regime in power there."
"It became evident how heartless the ruling Burmese generals were when they refused international aid to save the Burmese people, even though the generals themselves were unable to do so."
"That decision amounted to a premeditated crime against the entire nation."
"Despite widespread international condemnation, the Burmese generals are maintaining their criminal course of action."
"Humanitarian aid seems to be ending up in the hands of the military and their families, or is being traded."
"At the same time it is ever more urgently needed, due to the spread of hunger and disease."
"Particular attention should be paid too to the situation of Burmese orphans."
"There are more and more indications that people traffickers are turning to these orphans in their search for sex slaves for brothels the world over."
"Respect for human rights does not just mean that national authorities should refrain from torture, murder and arrests."
"Failing to assist disaster victims or deliberately hindering assistance amounts to committing genocide."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his work to date on this matter."
"It is now clear that over 125 000 people have died as a result of the cyclone which hit the southern regions of Burma on 2 and 3 May."
"The United Nations estimates that in excess of 2.4 million people have been directly affected by this tragedy."
"Many are severely injured and it is likely that there will be an outbreak of disease due to lack of food and clean water."
"It may already have taken hold in the area."
"The policies of the military junta in preventing humanitarian aid workers from getting access to the affected areas are unprecedented."
"These aid workers and the agencies that they work for have the expertise to put in place a comprehensive relief operation which would bring assistance to a large number of people in a short period of time."
"Will another similar number have to die before the military regime allows the aid agencies in?"
"The combined efforts of the EU, China, India, all of the South-East Asian nations and the UN have the power to force the Burmese authorities to remove the restrictions."
"It is by working together that we can change the mindset of this corrupt government."
"In particular we must bring China and India on board to force the change."
"It is now 18 days since the cyclone hit the region."
"The international community must continue to work so that every person affected by the disaster receives food, clean water, the necessary medical care and shelter."
"Let us continue to keep the pressure on the Burmese leadership and force them to allow the international aid agencies to carry out their work."
"Let each country within the EU, and the EU itself, continue to apply diplomatic pressure."
"This is where immediate action is required."
"We must not allow another 18 days to pass before action is taken."
"The time for removing the restrictions is now."
"(NL) Two weeks after the disaster, some of the Burmese people have finally received rice, beans and medicines, but that aid is still not reaching a quarter of all victims and is arriving criminally late through the fault of the junta."
"The UN World Food Programme says that it was able to give rice and beans to 212 000 of the 750 000 people who are the worst affected."
"Therefore a special UN aid fund is needed, as the Social Democrats are also asking."
"I am grateful to the Commission for all its valuable efforts in Burma and also from Brussels."
"However, millions of people are being abandoned to hunger, thirst and sickness."
"That is a form of torture, that is murder and a total failure of the duty to protect."
"These are actions verging on genocide."
"Therefore the army is responsible for crimes against humanity."
"For our Group and tomorrow for this Parliament, that is a matter for the International Criminal Court."
"The Security Council has to have an investigation opened into the crimes of the regime."
"What is the view of the Commission on that?"
"As rapporteur on Burma, I ask myself when do you reach the limit of respect for the sovereignty of a country?"
"The limit was, after all, somewhat closer in the case of Iraq."
"When does respect for fundamental human rights become inviolable for the same international community?"
"Now the credibility of human rights is tarnished all over the world by the refusal, mainly of neighbouring countries, to deal with the Burmese Government, and the unwillingness to come to the aid of the people without the consent of the generals."
"Sovereignty does not entitle you to throttle your own people."
"Hence the request to the Council of the European Union, and particularly to the United Kingdom as current President of the Security Council, for the situation in Burma to be discussed again in the Security Council."
"China and Russia must understand that the situation there now is even more criminal, even more serious, than shortly after the cyclone."
"(DE) Madam President, 130 000 dead and more than two million homeless: that is the bitter reality in Burma."
"In addition, widespread famine is threatening."
"The floods are causing diarrhoea pathogens, such as Salmonella, to spread like wildfire."
"There is a high risk of illnesses such as typhoid, cholera, malaria and dengue fever."
"Children, who have weaker immune systems and whose bodies dehydrate faster, are particularly endangered."
"The survivors of the disaster need clean drinking water, which cannot be provided on a sustainable basis without good treatment plants."
"They need emergency accommodation, not least to prevent the spread of respiratory diseases."
"The military junta remains unwilling to admit Western aid workers, as Commissioner Michel just confirmed in his powerful speech."
"It is thereby jeopardising the existence of tens of thousands of people."
"What is the responsible approach?"
"Exerting pressure by petitioning the Criminal Court in The Hague?"
"Absolutely!"
"However, is there also a need to amend international law so as to restrict national sovereignty in the event of a humanitarian crisis?"
"That would be difficult to achieve, and the Chinese would be sure to veto it in the UN Security Council."
"China is one of the few allies of the Burmese dictators."
"It must, however, make every effort - and so must the Member Countries of ASEAN, as Hartmut Nassauer stated - to ensure that the international teams of experts and aid materials, which have been in place for some time now, are allowed to enter the country."
"One of the reasons why Myanmar is blocking the numerous aid operations mounted by the international community is evidently a desire to influence the donors' conference in order to obtain multimillion sums and be able to use them as it sees fit."
"Like the Burmese regime's contemptuous and brutal treatment of peaceful demonstrators during the Buddhist monks' revolt in September 2007 and its subsequent imposition of a news embargo lasting several months, this is a totalitarian act which is directed against the interests of the population."
"This alleged exercise of national sovereignty is entirely unstatesmanlike and totally inhuman."
"(PT) Over 63 000 people dead and missing and two and a half million homeless is now the combined result of the cyclone and the cruelty of the Junta which is mismanaging and oppressing Burma and which has prevented international aid from reaching those in need."
"What a contrast to the openness and promptness of China in helping the survivors in Sichuan!"
"The UN Security Council can no longer refrain from holding the Burmese Military Junta responsible for the protection of its people, by allowing international humanitarian NGOs and agencies to access the country in order to help the abandoned population of the Irrawaddy Delta."
"It also cannot refrain from bringing the Burmese Military Junta before the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity."
"This Parliament hopes that the European governments will bring immediate pressure to bear on the UN Security Council."
"It is time that all members of the Council, including China which has supported the Burmese dictatorship, accept their responsibilities towards the sacrificed people of Burma."
"(LT) Today we are talking about the tragic situation in Burma in the aftermath of the cyclone that swept across the country at the beginning of the month."
"The disastrous consequences of the tragedy are that hundreds of thousands of people are dead, injured, sick and lost, with huge numbers losing their homes and in need of food and water."
"Every day on TV we witness haunting scenes from a country ruined by this cyclone and it is impossible to remain indifferent."
"It is true that humankind still remains powerless in the face of natural disasters, especially when they happen without warning."
"However, the recent situation in Burma is different, as we are aware of the fact that the Indian Government warned Burma's leaders of the impending cyclone two days before it reached the country, so they had been informed."
"Nevertheless, the cyclone hit the country's people with all its might, because the generals in charge of the country could not be bothered to warn their people about the disaster that was imminent."
"Such a government is worthy of condemnation, as its recent actions demonstrate absolute inefficiency and indifference towards citizens, which is an obvious breach of human rights."
"The generals in charge are to blame for having given their blessing to this natural disaster developing into a catastrophe of such proportions."
"The list of criminal acts committed by Burma's leaders, which will never be forgotten, comprises forbidding international aid workers to enter the country, refusing to assist those seeking help and showing total disregard for the international community's efforts to help the suffering."
"The generals' shameful attempts to hold a referendum on the constitution in such circumstances only add to this list."
"I truly believe that the European Union must pursue every possible avenue - I repeat: every possible avenue - of cooperation with the governments of India, China and other Asian countries and make use of all the institutions in the United Nations network to ensure that the people of Burma receive the maximum possible help."
"Madam President, in today's debate I would like to raise three issues."
"First, the problem of a new constitution."
"The Myanmar junta announced that a pro-military constitution has won overwhelming support in the referendum which was held despite widespread criticism and the needs of a national tragedy."
"Human rights groups have dismissed the vote as a mockery."
"A referendum conducted in those conditions has to be of dubious credibility."
"Probably it will be impossible to hold the second round of voting in most areas of the Irrawaddy delta on 24 May."
"Second, there is a more general problem about sanctions, particularly EU sanctions."
"Do they really work?"
"The people most affected are the population at large."
"Some observers - seasoned journalists, diplomats, former EU ambassadors in South-East Asia - say that isolating Burma in this way does not help."
"Third and last but not least, the time has come for the UN Security Council to act."
"The United Nations Security Council should insist that aid deliveries and humanitarian workers be given unfettered access to Burma."
"The EU countries delivering aid should insist on monitoring to ensure that aid reaches the cyclone victims most in need."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the few seconds available I would like to draw the House's attention to the cry of alarm which has reached me from volunteers working for the international organisation Save the Children, informing us of the imminent risk of a tragedy to compound the tragedy."
"Rescue crews have reported that, in the marsh area of the Irrawaddy Delta, over 30 000 children are dying through want, children who have survived Cyclone Nargis and, in many cases, their own parents, who are now the victims of hunger and thirst, ill with dysentery and exhausted by rain and the cold."
"Commissioner, in this context, the policy of refusing aid adopted by the regime of Than Shwe and his military coadjutants is madness."
"There is no time to lose!"
"With malnutrition already present, a lack of drinking water, the spectre of disease and the absence of aid, these children will not survive long: either we intervene immediately or we will be responsible fair and square for not having done enough!"
"Madam President, I would like to thank and commend the action taken by Commissioner Michel."
"We have heard today that Cyclone Nargis has brought devastation to two and a half million Burmese people and, as the Commissioner said, the situation has been exacerbated by the regime's intransigence in denying foreign aid, so that only a quarter of those in need of urgent help have actually received it."
"This is unbelievable and a heartbreaking denial of the Burmese people's most basic human right."
"But it is also verging on criminal negligence."
"Recently we have heard about some limited flexibility by the junta but I urge the Commission and Council to exercise caution towards this softening, because this is the regime that ruthlessly repressed its own pro-democracy movement."
"I would stress that it is vital to keep up the pressure on the junta so that all UN agencies with the experience and logistical know-how to deal with the situation are allowed in."
"I am especially concerned that, as the Commissioner stressed, it is the children who are suffering the most."
"Accordingly UNICEF needs to be allowed in, to alleviate the threat of disease and malnutrition."
"Finally, I call on those who have influence with Burma, namely the neighbours and EU partners - India, China and the ASEAN countries - to encourage the junta to accept relief from others."
"I also call on the Commission and others to take steps to make it clear to the junta that democracy and engagement with the outside world are the only viable ways out of the crisis."
"I hope that Commissioner Michel will provide an answer to the questions 'Where do we go from here?' and 'How do we move forward?'"
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the very failure of the mission described by Commissioner Michel, who I do, however, thank for his utmost sincerity, gives us an understanding of how at this moment in time it is appropriate to focus on the doctrine of humanitarian intervention to foster not only relations with the Burmese authorities, but also with the Chinese authorities who are currently demonstrating a different kind of sensitivity in light of the serious disturbances and disasters which have also occurred in their country."
"Focusing on relations with the Chinese may serve to open windows for humanitarian intervention which may move from establishing a no-fly zone for direct aid drops to the opening of a genuine humanitarian corridor."
"I have a question for the Council too: the European Union appointed a representative to Burma; while thanking Commissioner Michel for his dedication and for visiting what he has called an area of frustration, what is the representative's purpose?"
"What is he seeking to achieve?"
"Madam President, there is one human priority: to get international humanitarian aid to the millions of human beings who have been pushed to the verge of extermination."
"It is a military junta that bears responsibility first for failing to warn their population in time about the approaching cyclone and secondly for refusing to let humanitarian aid enter the country."
"Now I think it is time to take this gang, which has committed crimes against humanity, to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, but this needs a concentrated international effort."
"In the mean time, all possible pressure should be put on the Burmese rulers and their allies, including China, to engage first in the humanitarian relief phase before starting the self-proclaimed reconstruction phase."
"Madam President, the tragedy of Burma has been only compounded by the refusal of the military junta to allow the delivery of aid and assistance."
"They have refused more than token assistance from a US task force, home-based in Okinawa, which was fortuitously deployed off Thailand."
"While hundreds of thousands have died in the initial disaster, this can only be multiplied massively with the refusal to receive aid and therefore control the outbreak of disease."
"Oxfam have estimated that up to two thirds of a million people may be threatened in the current circumstances."
"We have to urge everyone - the Chinese, the European Union, other neighbours - to put as much pressure as possible on the regime to moderate its position and open its doors to aid and aid workers currently parked in Bangkok and Thailand."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I obviously comprehend and fully share the general sentiments expressed in the House - sentiments of criticism and frustration, of course."
"Almost all the speakers mentioned resorting to the Security Council, the concept of the responsibility to protect, the right to interfere to a certain extent, the boundaries of national sovereignty, and sanctions in general."
"This is, in fact, what we are dealing with."
"However, I wish to speak on the means available to the international community to take all the courses of action you mention and to ensure respect for all these principles."
"This issue is slightly more difficult for it basically raises the serious matter of respect for international humanitarian law, a subject the European Commission and Parliament have already decided to discuss in relation to specific cases in September."
"Thus there is broad consensus as to the analysis: we all agree it is unacceptable, we all agree it is inhumane, and we all agree there must be better access and so on."
"What I do wish to suggest - this is obviously a personal opinion - is that we make a bid in the short term to capitalise on or at least to extract maximum advantage from whatever emerges from the donor conference arranged on the initiative of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, with the donors being the European Union and ASEAN, and, within the framework of this initiative or proposal, to appoint a joint EU/ASEAN coordinator."
"This is in the very short term."
"It will obviously be a difficult task."
"If the international community wishes to ensure a certain degree of coherence, if no results emerge from the two initiatives, it will be difficult to act as if there were nothing else to be done, and at that point the international community, whether this be the UN or other institutions, ought to focus on slightly different means."
"I say this because - and I am finishing up now - what is evidently the most frustrating thing of all to some extent, which discredits or at any rate weakens the moral duty to intervene and the very concept or application of the concept of the responsibility to protect, is that, beyond the declarations of principle we are all led to make, because this is the way we feel, this is our culture, this is our view of democracy and human rights and so on, there are means available to us, or means we are politically capable of implementing."
"This is the truth of the matter. This is the political courage that must be sought."
"For it is all too easy to say: 'we must do something, we must send this, we must force them, we must do this and that'."
"Yes, fine, but where are the means?"
"Are our countries able and willing politically to accept the ultimate consequences - of using force, if necessary - and do we have the ability to act in this way?"
"That is the real question."
"I agree with everything that has been said here, but conclusions must be drawn from our generous positions."
"I wish to explain why I feel that there are two parts to this debate."
"There is the general debate on which we all agree, and there is the immediate issue."
"I think the latter consists of providing full support and placing a Secretary-General at the best location for dialogue to make sense, and allowing him to extract the best possible advantage from his two initiatives."
"This is more or less what I would suggest."
"I doubt that any statements, threats or tough talk, here and now - even if it is necessary - can change the situation."
"Unfortunately, I do not think so."
"I therefore feel that we ought to go along with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's two initiatives, and back them to the hilt."
"I have received six motions for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
", in writing. - (SK) I am shocked by the terrible tragedy that has befallen the Burmese people."
"It is despicable that the generals who have a firm grip on the country will not be swayed by the vast number of victims of the destructive Cyclone Nargis, the number of whom may still increase due to the lack of drinking water, food and medical help."
"I do not understand the kind of people who ignore their nation's misfortune and keep Burma completely isolated, although it is clear that the country cannot cope on its own."
"The arrogance of power probably has no limits."
"In such an extraordinary crisis situation, the question of state sovereignty is an absolutely inhuman concept."
"The humanitarian organisation Oxfam has warned that, unless help gets quickly to those affected, the number of victims may reach as many as 1.5 million."
"According to the UN, the disaster has affected up to 2 million people who need help."
"These are alarming voices and we have to adopt a clear standpoint quickly."
"We cannot keep waiting, watching helplessly as hunger kills more victims."
"I will vote for the European Parliament resolution on the tragic situation in Burma."
"I am convinced that the EU must not be indifferent."
"It must make use of all available means to help the Burmese people."
"Considering the huge scale of this disaster, the EU must also use enforcement measures as 'national authorities are manifestly failing to protect their population from genocide, war crime, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity'."
"Natural disaster in China (debate)"
"The next item is the statements of the Council and the Commission on the natural disaster in China."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, I also wish to thank you for placing a debate on the agenda on the humanitarian situation in the Chinese province of Sichuan following the earthquake on 12 May."
"President Barroso, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner and I have expressed our condolences and stressed the desire of the European people to help the Chinese people."
"Mobilisation by the Chinese authorities and the army in particular was swift and large-scale."
"It must be said that the crisis management was efficient, and the authorities deserve our congratulations. In view of the extent of the damage and its needs, the Chinese Government appealed for international assistance on 13 May and the EU was quick to respond to the call."
"The Commission sent an ECHO humanitarian aid expert on a one-week mission to the area affected."
"Following a report by the expert on 16 May, the Commission adopted an emergency relief decision to disburse two million euros."
"This will allow the Red Cross to supply tents, blankets, drinking water and basic essentials."
"The coordination and assessment team of the Commission's civil protection mechanism is also at Chengdu."
"It is in contact with the local authorities to bring in European aid more rapidly for those in need."
"The Member States also responded swiftly to the emergency call from the Red Cross Federation by sending emergency equipment and providing search and rescue teams."
"The total EU contribution is already over ten million euros."
"The European Commission, the Monitoring Information Centre and the Crisis Platform are working together and are keeping the Member States and China up to date with EU assistance."
"It should be noted that the Chinese authorities exercise strict control over local access permits for international teams."
"On the basis of our evaluations, the main needs are water and sanitation, temporary shelters, essential products, medicines and medical equipment."
"Many major after-shocks are hampering rescue operations, unfortunately."
"The main concern is that vital infrastructure such as dams, dykes or electrical power stations will break down or collapse, thereby creating a second humanitarian disaster."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my Group endorses the expressions of sorrow and sympathy made to the Chinese people by the Council and the Commission following the horrific earthquake of 12 May."
"We offer our sincere condolences to all those who have been left bereaved or injured as a result of the earthquake."
"We also welcome the fact that the Chinese authorities have initiated rapid rescue measures, and we welcome the Chinese Government's willingness to accept foreign aid."
"Let me also voice our hope that it will continue to do so in future, enabling aid to be dispensed effectively at the point of need."
"In addition, we are pleased that in this case the Chinese Government has also allowed the foreign media to report in detail on the earthquake, and we hope that it will permit foreign reporting on the reconstruction effort in the affected areas too."
"We particularly regret that so many pupils died when buildings in state schools collapsed, and we support the declared intention of the Chinese authorities to investigate the reasons why schools might not have been built to withstand earthquakes and to hold those responsible to account."
"Above all, we are willing to give the Chinese people the assistance they need."
"They do not need large sums of money, for they possess the world's largest currency reserves."
"What they need is practical help, and we Europeans and our Member States can provide that help, and we thank the Commissioner for the aid measures he has already initiated."
"We shall support every action designed to help the people in the disaster areas and to assist them in the reconstruction of their villages."
"Some may have to be resettled in other areas."
"We shall provide the aid that is required for that purpose."
"It is truly a great human tragedy, and we empathise with the population of the stricken areas and with the entire Chinese nation."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (CS) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Lenarčič, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I want to join with all those who have expressed their deepest sympathies with the bereaved families of the tens of thousands of victims of the terrible earthquake that hit Sichuan province."
"I also want to express my full solidarity with the hundreds of thousands of people who lost the roof over their head or were forced to leave their homes as a result of this disaster."
"A short while ago we debated the situation in Burma and criticised the completely unacceptable behaviour of the Burmese junta."
"China, in complete contrast with Burma, must be praised."
"China immediately asked the international community for help and opened its borders to foreign aid."
"I also approve, just like my fellow Member, the openness of the Chinese authorities, both at national level and in Sichuan province."
"I welcome the way they dealt with organising the rescue work and informing the public, both at home and abroad, on the events of the disaster."
"For example, this up-front information provided also included the confession that, apart from tens of thousands of victims, thirty-two sources of radioactive emissions were also buried in the rubble."
"Both the Commissioner and Mr Lenarčič informed us of the extent of the humanitarian aid that the European Union has offered and provided to China."
"I am thanking them both for the speed with which the Commission and the Council have acted, and I am also calling on them to ensure that the European Union is prepared to respond quickly to potential requests for further help by our Chinese partners, not only in regard to humanitarian aid but also with rebuilding affected areas, if help is asked for."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) First of all, I should like to express my sympathy with all the victims on behalf of our Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"I also endorse the period of mourning that the Chinese Government has announced."
"On Monday, before coming to Strasbourg, I went to sign the book of condolence at the Representation to the EU in Brussels, on behalf of the Delegation for Relations with China and I assume also on behalf of Parliament as a whole."
"Last week the bureau of the Delegation met the Chinese ambassador and he told me how much he appreciated the European Parliament support."
"We are facing an enormous and serious disaster."
"Tens of thousands of people are dead or still missing, millions homeless, property damage on a scale that is barely calculable at the moment."
"We have not seen in China what we saw in Burma, as discussed in the previous debate."
"Here we see a country where everyone, from the highest to the lowest level, is doing everything possible to help and to see that anything that can still be saved is saved."
"I also see a country that has very openly communicated, and continues to communicate, the pain and despair of the people in Sichuan and the problems the rescue teams are facing, rescue teams that have even lost a couple of lives."
"I see a country that is even open to the criticism the victims of the disaster had of the aid effort, a picture that we are also very familiar with whenever something similar happens here."
"Madam President, we have to look to the future."
"I think China has asked us for very specific types of aid."
"I see that we are showing solidarity and I am grateful to the Commission and the Council for what they have done. I urge them to provide further help when the Chinese ask for it."
"When the rescue effort is over, rebuilding will have to begin, and there again we have to be able to help as much as possible."
"In the longer term, I would ask that we look into how we can provide technical assistance, with building regulations and techniques that make buildings more resistant to this kind of occurrence."
"It might also be a task for the international community to look at what we can do to set up a sort of early warning system, a system that warns people before these disasters."
"We have to at least try to develop that."
"I think there are quite a number of regions in the world that might benefit from that."
"At any rate, I think it is important that we in the European Parliament have shown our solidarity with the Chinese in this debate."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Madam President, following this terrible earthquake that has plunged China and the entire world into mourning, the authorities have played the game of transparency for the first time and responded to the drama with large-scale emergency deployment, which the EU and the entire international community are doing their best to sustain."
"However, we have all heard sharp criticism in China of the poor quality of buildings, especially the most recent structures and public locations such as schools, which have led to the disappearance of thousands of schoolchildren, with very few rescued."
"This disaster is showing up the poor quality of building work in the country, a sensitive issue in China where millions of people have been expropriated in the larger cities in the run-up to decisive events such as the Olympic Games."
"Other worrying matters, already mentioned, loom over this drama: the strength of hydroelectric facilities such as the concrete dam at Zipingpu makes us fear the worst for the 600 000 people living downstream."
"The earthquake also caused damage to 391 reservoirs."
"As yet there is little information available on the plutonium-enrichment facilities in the north-east of Sichuan province, despite their close proximity to the epicentre, and this is likewise extremely disturbing."
"Would it not be a good idea to carry out an independent international assessment on such vital issues, since the Chinese are still showing a certain amount of opacity and any official statements are all reassurance?"
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Europe should offer China as much support as possible, for both humanitarian and political reasons."
"I am one of the very many Members of this House who are strongly opposed to China's barbaric policy towards Tibet and towards Christians."
"I believe we should react very forcefully indeed to any instance of aggression towards Taiwan."
"On the other hand, however, we must take advantage of every opportunity to show the Chinese people that the demands we are making of their leaders are not motivated by any feeling of enmity towards their country and its traditions."
"We must prove that friendly partnership is possible, and an excellent opportunity to do so has now arisen."
"We should offer extensive assistance to the victims and commit ourselves wholeheartedly to reconstruction work following the recent disaster."
"It would be a great mistake to miss this opportunity of building trust between Europe and China."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, natural disasters sadden us all the more because they create so many victims, as recently in China or Burma."
"They remind us of the value of any human life, and also the fact that we cannot control nature."
"We wish to send a message of compassion to those suffering natural and political disasters."
"One of the aims of politicians is to prevent public misfortune from befalling their people."
"Thus, if they cannot prevent natural disasters, they can attempt to anticipate them and alert the people, and above all they must minimise risk through responsible prevention policies."
"By way of example, China's Promethean infrastructure, such as its huge power dams and nuclear power plants, has held out."
"Yet how long can it hold out?"
"Is it not better to use a larger number of smaller structures to spread the risk, and increase public information on the risks involved?"
"The most tragic situation for the Chinese people, however, is in relation to political disasters."
"Although we acknowledge the admirable character of this hard-working skilful people and its sensitive culture, we can judge political acts without delving too far into domestic policies."
"Its calamitous single-child policy is a major disaster."
"It affects children, the large numbers of peasant families obliged to dispose of daughters, a poor source of revenue that does nothing to ensure the continuity of farms and retirement, or the second child who has no right to exist on the orders of Creon."
"Such is the disdain for human rights when a political order does not allow parents to have as many children as they want."
"Here again, life is not considered at its true value, but as a mere utilitarian function."
"Natural disaster and political disaster merge, however, when a school's roof falls in, crushing the only child and leaving the parents distraught."
"When the 30 000 journalists expected in Beijing for the Olympic Games arrive there, they should take time out to investigate, beyond mere appearances, the reality of this country which, through overriding power and efficiency, risks losing all respect for human beings, the real basis of the political order."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, during the public minutes of silence ordered by the Chinese authorities, people stood still - people in the streets, on buses and in shops - and their facial expressions left no doubt of the sincerity of their feelings."
"It was quite different from the normal compulsory collective demonstrations of solidarity."
"Why was that? Because state television was able to report round the clock, evoking a profound sense of shock at the unimaginable suffering of the people in the stricken areas."
"That inspired a new sense of solidarity in China."
"Respect for the individual has become apparent again, even among political leaders."
"The only great national focal points had hitherto been China's economic growth and, more recently, the Olympic Games, but in the light of the present disaster, these things almost fail to register any more with many people."
"What should the international community do?"
"This question has already been answered to some extent: besides sending aid materials, disaster plans and, of course, technical equipment, there is a need to pool the experience gathered in the aftermath of the major earthquakes in Armenia, where more than 100 000 lives were lost and a nuclear power plant was damaged, in Turkey, where tens of thousands lost their lives, and in China in 1976, where several hundred thousand people died, and to use that collective experience to develop principles of good practice for the international community and apply them for the benefit of China."
"I know it has been mentioned that what could happen to dams in particular should make us examine the earthquake resistance of public buildings, hospitals and schools."
"There is much that can be done in this respect, and appropriate indications can be given as to which rules should apply to the building of earthquake-proof structures."
"As a member of the Delegation for Relations with China, I naturally subscribe to the messages of condolence conveyed by the previous speakers."
"(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, we all regret the disaster that has devastated southern China."
"Over 50 000 people have died and 4.8 million have been left homeless."
"We all stand as one with the affected families."
"The European Union has acted as it should: it has activated the civil protection mechanism and it has supported the Chinese authorities."
"The international community as a whole has also lent its support."
"Never before has China received so many expressions of solidarity and offers of tangible support because, this time, the Chinese authorities have not tried to hide the scale of the tragedy."
"On the contrary, they have provided the necessary information, allowed access to the international media and, overall, acted transparently and efficiently, unlike what has happened in Burma."
"Climate change is at the root of the rise in natural disasters."
"Preventing the planet from overheating is all our responsibility."
"China must therefore also contribute to reducing CO2 emissions by supporting the European Union's efforts to reach an international agreement by the time of the Copenhagen Conference in December 2009."
"(NL) With unprecedented openness, the Chinese mass media have reported on the terrible consequences of the serious earthquake that struck Sichuan province over a week ago."
"Within the country, this openness on the part of the authorities led to an unprecedented solidarity with the victims."
"The harmonious society came to the fore."
"Tens of thousands of volunteers presented themselves."
"Rescue teams flocked to the disaster areas from every province."
"Practical help has reached a record high in China."
"In short, openness by the authorities pays off."
"The European institutions therefore need to hold the Chinese authorities to this unprecedented openness in the future."
"This is certainly the case with the critical question already raised in China as to why so many school buildings collapsed."
"China has been equally open with the rest of the world."
"For instance, the Chinese Government accepted the Japanese offer to send a rescue team."
"In the meantime, Taiwan has pledged EUR 42 million of relief for the earthquake victims."
"I sincerely hope that this sympathy will lead to the normalisation that is needed in relations between China and Taiwan."
"I can wholeheartedly join those Members who have expressed their deep sympathy for the inexpressible suffering of the Chinese people and I particularly appreciate Mr Sterckx signing the book of condolence at the Chinese Representation in Brussels on behalf of us all."
"I can fully endorse that."
"(NL) First of all, I should like to express my sympathy for the relatives of the many victims of the natural disaster in Sichuan province on 12 May."
"The Chinese authorities fortunately acted promptly after the disaster."
"I also welcome the European Union response."
"I therefore wish to support the European institutions, the Commission and the Council, in the approach they have opted for so far."
"After initially refusing foreign help, China has opened its borders."
"The Chinese authorities themselves have said that they can use every possible assistance to deal with this widespread disaster."
"Japanese, South Korean and Russian rescue teams are already in the stricken area."
"I find that and the fact that the neighbouring countries of Singapore and Taiwan are providing aid very encouraging."
"Political relations with neighbouring countries are not always good and this might improve them."
"A great deal of attention has been devoted to the disaster in the national and international media."
"I am pleased that the press is being allowed access to the affected area and being given the opportunity to write what it wants and inform the rest of the country and the world."
"Transparency is important in obtaining a clear picture of the disaster and also in ensuring that the right aid is provided on the ground."
"That allows greater involvement by the rest of the population."
"A free press and good governance usually go hand in hand."
"A free press can report policy failings in good time and policies can be adjusted."
"Building and government supervision in that area also need to be discussed."
"Conclusions can be drawn for future building projects and recommendations can be made for better management and better official organisation."
"Natural disaster prevention and preparation are primary government responsibilities."
"It is only in recent years that these have been properly organised in many European countries too."
"Finally, I should like to ask the European Commission and the Council to offer China help if necessary to train the authorities and the civil service in drawing up plans for dealing with crises and disasters."
"(HU) Thank you very much, Madam President."
"Every decent person was shocked by last week's natural disaster in the Far East."
"It is natural that the attention of the world should be centred on these countries."
"China is very much in the focus of public attention at present: the Olympic Games this summer, the Chinese Premier's visit to Taiwan, events in Tibet, the Dalai Lama's tour of Europe and how it was received, the visit to China by the European Commission; all these things have contributed to focusing attention on China."
"Now is not the time, however, to speak about boycotts or about Tibet."
"The earthquake, which had a magnitude of 8.0 and left the Sichuan plateau in ruins, caused the deaths of 50 000 people and rendered millions of survivors homeless, not to mention the economic damage caused."
"This is why I am asking every European Union institution to make sure that we give all the human assistance we can and make humanitarian aid available to those affected by the disaster for as long as it is needed."
"Let us thank the rescue teams and aid organisations for their help; they worked around the clock to improve the situation of the people living in the region, and let us assure the Chinese people of our unconditional solidarity and sympathy."
"Madam President, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 and an epicentre near Chengdu in Sichuan killed over 100 000 people on 12 May."
"We can only offer our condolences to all those who have lost family members, and in particular parents who have lost children."
"However, unlike the parallel tragedy in Burma, where some have suggested responsibility to protect should lead to direct international intervention, the Chinese have employed exceptional emergency resources, along with soldiers and medical staff."
"China has welcomed foreign assistance, including Japanese rescue workers who are currently working in the area, as well as allowing the Chinese and foreign media to follow the disaster in its aftermath."
"The European Union has already contributed EUR 10 million in aid, as Commissioner Michel has said."
"We urge the Council and Commission to provide further emergency aid, technical assistance and reconstruction aid to the region concerned in the coming months and years."
"Madam President, this is the time when we show solidarity and sympathy to China."
"In these tragic days we have seen victims; we have seen a great tragedy of society in China."
"I have been impressed by the way in which the Chinese authorities have behaved - state leaders, administrative, provincial and party leaders - the behaviour of the Chinese state has been rational, something good at this time."
"But at the same time, as a human rights politician, I have to report to Parliament that, according to the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy, 55 nuns were arrested on 14 May."
"That is a reality too in these days in China."
"The earthquake cannot become a pretext for human rights abuses."
"(HU) Madam President, the terrible tragedies of the Chinese earthquake and the cyclone that preceded it in Burma shocked the public around the world."
"The response by countries around the globe was exemplary, with countries from Japan to the United States, from Russia to Jordan providing aid to the tune of more than two billion dollars."
"The European Union and its Member States reacted at once, and the Commission too took decisive action, sending EUR 2 million in emergency aid to China and assisting relief efforts by dispatching mobile hospital units, drugs, rescue equipment, and rubble-clearing gear."
"It was particularly laudable on the part of the Tibetan government-in-exile in India to ask its followers to halt their demonstrations against China temporarily and make donations to help the earthquake victims."
"Aid funds from Hungary originally intended for Burma were redirected to China due to the isolationist attitude of the Burmese military dictatorship."
"The Chinese leadership, unlike the Myanmar regime, was wise to accept foreign aid."
"The responsible manner in which China handled the publicity was also very positive, and it shows that there has been significant progress in terms of developing democracy. Thank you for your attention."
"(PL) Nature has once again proved how defenceless humankind is against major natural disasters and calamities."
"China is the most populated country on earth, its economy is booming, and it is enthusiastically preparing for the forthcoming Olympic Games. It was, however, devastated by the recent tragic earthquake."
"The people of China liken this disaster to earlier cataclysms accompanying major historical changes in that country."
"I am not sure if that is the way to interpret this dreadful event. Nonetheless, I am certain that at such a time we must express our solidarity with the tens of thousands of ordinary men, women and children who are heroically enduring this personal and national tragedy."
"That is why the European Parliament is right to send a clear signal to the Chinese people today, indicating that the Members of this House stand shoulder to shoulder with them, that we understand their suffering and want to help. After all, the principle of solidarity is one of the Union's most important fundamental values."
"Madam President, China must be congratulated for the way in which it has reacted to this disaster."
"I would also like to thank the European Commission and Council for the way they have acted in dealing with this tragedy."
"It is a welcome development in China that they have opened up the area to all of those who can give assistance; hopefully it is something they will do in the future in relation to other areas."
"Allowing the necessary information out to the world media is the correct step forward."
"I should also like to congratulate the media for highlighting the scale of the disaster and the assistance that is required."
"May it also be a lesson to China in seeing how they can use their power to put pressure on other regimes, in particular in Burma, to try to get them to see that they also need assistance from the world community."
"Saving lives is the priority in China; let others like the junta in Burma learn from this experience."
"(PL) Madam President, I should like to express my very sincere condolences to all those who have suffered and lost loved ones in China."
"I wish to express my heartfelt sympathy to all those who have lost their children, wives or husbands."
"I was myself in China last week when this dreadful disaster occurred."
"I was in Beijing and Shanghai, and I represented Parliament at the opening of the Shanghai Food Fair. The disaster happened on the Monday, just as I was arriving."
"I sent letters of condolence to the Chinese ambassadors in Poland and Brussels straight away."
"I was able to see reports on the tragedy for myself on television, and realised the extent of human suffering caused."
"I also saw the immediate large-scale help provided to the victims by ordinary people, the government and the army. The scale of the effort was unprecedented."
"I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to thank the Union and all the Member States for the aid provided. I should also like to thank the House for its gesture of solidarity in holding this debate today."
"(PL) I believe there are two different approaches to China."
"One is to provide assistance following the misfortune that has recently befallen it."
"We cannot react otherwise. It is our moral duty to help."
"The fact that we enjoy a better financial and economic situation is a further reason to offer aid."
"We simply have to do so."
"The second approach involves remaining constantly aware that in normal times we should help the Chinese. By this I mean that, when the country is not afflicted by disaster, we ought to help the people of China by reminding their leaders about their citizens' rights."
"We should do so most emphatically."
"We need to respond appropriately to both situations."
"This will make things very clear. I believe the people of China will recognise our effort and thank us for it."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) I think that it is very important that the European Parliament has decided to dedicate today's debate to the natural disaster in China."
"Primarily in order to be able to give China a message, on the one hand expressing the European Union's condolences, and, as Mrs Grabowska expressed it, to convey to China and its people the European Union's solidarity with them."
"The difference is also obvious in the tone of the debate held on this, and that on the immediately preceding item."
"And of course, part of the reason for this is also the way the Chinese leaders have acted, and we can truly say that its response to this terrible disaster was quick and efficient, that it has used considerable national resources, that it has named or appointed the Prime Minister personally as the aid coordinator."
"To successfully overcome such difficulties there must be good coordination, and this was obviously achieved."
"The media also regularly kept the public informed, both nationally and internationally, as to the developments."
"Foreign journalists were allowed access to the affected areas, and also some foreign experts, according to our information, amongst others from Japan."
"Therefore I believe that we can be satisfied that in facing this huge disaster and in providing help to its population, the Chinese authorities have been well organised, and above all, that that they are willing to accept foreign aid, including ours."
"And I can assure you that the Council will continue to be prepared to provide help."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Very briefly, Madam President, you may be sure that I take due note of your remarks, and I wish to reply by saying that we will naturally still be willing to add to the aid we have already committed, aid based on analysis of needs."
"Moreover, I feel that everyone welcomes China's reaction, and the way in which the authorities have been open in terms of access and transparency."
"I mean this with particular reference to access to the press."
"I should like to take up an idea mooted by Mrs Flautre - the suggestion of providing a team of international experts to assess collateral risk and damage, particularly in relation to nuclear facilities."
"I feel it would be a good idea to pass on this message."
"There is no obligation to do so, of course, but I still think it would be good to initiate discussions with the Chinese authorities to this end."
"I have received six motions for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Global treaty to ban uranium weapons (debate)"
"author. - Madam President, in December 2007 the UN General Assembly accepted by an overwhelming majority a resolution that urged investigations into the health effects of uranium weapons on civilians and military personnel."
"We congratulate Germany, Ireland and Italy as the only NATO countries that supported the UN resolution."
"The reason for that support may be the fact that many of their soldiers returned with fatal diseases and/or later had children with serious malformations."
"Therefore we appeal to other EU countries to follow their example and submit health reports in line with the UN request."
"DU (depleted uranium) was used in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan."
"DU is waste, and is an extremely cheap material for making arms."
"The estimated global stocks are 1.3 million tonnes. Far less than 1 microgram inside the body can be fatal."
"Apart from the radiation, DU is a chemical toxic compound."
"Nobody informs the troops, or the populations of the countries where DU weapons are used."
"The latest findings of the World Health Organisation's experts concerning the harmful effects of DU have been censored."
"We urge the EU to inform its citizens and the populations of targeted countries."
"We call on the Commission and Council to make sure that an international treaty will be established as soon as possible."
"In order to gain a detailed insight into the matter, it is high time for the Commission and Council to provide access to all existing reports and initiate the further investigations which Parliament has been urging since 2001."
"Meanwhile we reiterate our call to ban DU on the basis of the precautionary principle."
"author. - (NL) The fight for a worldwide ban on armed uranium in weapons and ammunition is part of our general fight for arms control and disarmament."
"We are focusing particular attention on weapons and ammunition that are extremely dangerous and harmful to civilians and remain dangerous long after the conflict is over, such as landmines, cluster bombs and weapons containing armed uranium."
"I know it is a little ironic to be talking about weapons that are more dangerous and more harmful than others, but that is the way it is."
"That is why we are concentrating on those that can have the worst effects on innocent civilian populations."
"In November 2006, this Parliament called for a moratorium on that type of weapon, that is weapons containing armed uranium."
"Last year my country, Belgium, passed a law not just on a moratorium but on an actual ban on any use of uranium weapons and I think I can be a little proud of that."
"Now I should like to ask the Commission and the Council what action they will take to make that moratorium more general and support a general ban."
"Furthermore, as the previous speaker has already explained at length, uranium weapons also appear to have harmful effects on soldiers that use them or are exposed to their use."
"Even if this might not yet be absolutely certain, it is nonetheless advisable for the Council to ensure that soldiers and other personnel taking part in operations under the European Security and Defence Policy are not exposed to risks of that kind."
"I should therefore like to ask the Council what concrete measures are being taken to ensure that soldiers and personnel taking part in such operations are not exposed to these risks and that the population in the areas where such operations take place are also not exposed."
"I shall be grateful for your response."
"author. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, in a recent letter to The Times in London, nine former British military commanders urged the Government of the United Kingdom to join those campaigning for a ban on cluster munitions."
"Their argument was the same as that made in the context of anti-personnel mines: however useful a weapon may be in the short term, in military logic the fact of causing indiscriminate harm in the long term is sufficient to justify the suspension of its use by responsible armed forces."
"The same logic applies in relation to depleted uranium munitions."
"The European Organisation of Military Associations, EUROMIL, is closely monitoring this issue and its position, based on information received from military personnel throughout Europe, is categorical: depleted uranium munitions must be abandoned as soon as possible."
"The European Parliament has already come out in favour of a total ban on these weapons and the UN General Assembly resolution passed last December, which included the issue of armaments and munitions containing depleted uranium on the agenda for the sixty-third session of the General Assembly, confirmed that the European Parliament is right to take the lead and to ask the Council to also take a lead in this debate on disarmament and humanitarian law."
"The 'counter' arguments of the sceptics among us do not wash."
"The most basic precautionary principle demands the stigmatisation of these weapons even before the extensive circumstantial evidence pointing to their indiscriminate and carcinogenic effect is replaced by irrefutable scientific proof."
"What will people, and even today's sceptics, say about us politicians in ten years' time when the harmful effects of these weapons have become clear and unquestionable if, in the meantime, we have done nothing to take them out of circulation?"
"Will they say the same as they now say about anti-personnel mines: how could they have waited so long!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to stress that I call upon my country - Latvia - to subscribe to the UN Resolution of December 2007."
"Secondly, I call upon the High Representative to submit a reasoned opinion on the initiative contained in that resolution."
"Thirdly, I call upon the European Union to ensure that information is circulated between the Member States concerning the types of munitions that may be expected to be used in operations."
"In the context of depleted uranium, I have particular personal experience."
"I was the Latvian defence minister for five and a half years."
"It was precisely during my period of responsibility that Latvia joined the US coalition in the Iraq war."
"At that time, suspicions arose on several occasions concerning the use of depleted uranium in Iraq."
"The international community reacted sharply on this issue."
"Latvian troops did not use depleted uranium munitions."
"In Latvia, however, for several months I was asked to take political responsibility for these events as a minister of the coalition."
"Unfortunately, as a minister of the coalition, I was not informed about the use of depleted uranium."
"That is unacceptable."
"Not only must the EU Member States seriously evaluate the need for munitions of this type in their arsenal of weapons, but the European Union must also ensure that it is compulsory for Member States to exchange information on the possible use of depleted uranium in operations."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Mr Kristovskis, I did not cut you off because your account as a Minister of Latvia was extremely important, but I would point out that you exceeded your time-limit by a considerable margin."
"author. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, much has been said on this topic in the past and unfortunately I am of the view that much will still have to be said before a definitive solution is found; my colleagues said as much earlier and explained it very well."
"Measures have been put in place by some Member States to prohibit the production and any use of this type of armament for commercial or bellicose purposes."
"There have been several requests by this Parliament, there are documents in the form of photographs and testimonies, and there are reasonable grounds for considering that Italian military personnel died as a result of exposure to these kinds of weapons."
"There is a UN resolution expressing widespread concern and there have been various requests for in-depth studies of the issue."
"There is the precautionary principle which, in accordance with European Union law, should dictate a general moratorium at least until such time as definitive scientific data is produced."
"However, none of this has so far resulted in the anticipated outcome."
"Depleted uranium continues to be used in theatres of war, whether rural or urban."
"There is no question that chemical matter penetrates the soil and gets into aquifers and crops and therefore there can be no question that particles of depleted uranium which are in contact with the soil disperse into the subsoil, contaminating underground waters and agricultural produce, obviously resulting in the spread of disease among exposed populations and, to a lesser extent, worldwide through the water cycle and the cycle of elements, especially in an ever-expanding global market system."
"There are, admittedly, no definitive studies as yet to prove the danger, but there can be no denying that the parameters of which we are aware today do not rule out that a risk may exist."
"That consideration alone must force advanced democracies to study the matter in more depth and take a decision."
"The European Union in particular cannot, in my opinion, continue to do nothing."
"The Union has clear duties towards its Member States, clear duties towards the rest of the world, clear duties towards its own citizens."
"The Union has economic resources which it can use and no restrictions in terms of science and available laboratories."
"Doing nothing is unquestionably the result of a choice, not of a lack of available resources and means."
"In view of all this, it is clear that the Council and the Commission cannot avoid their citizens, whether civilians or military personnel, from being posted to areas of the world where these types of munitions are and have been used, but neither can they avoid taking every possible initiative at an early stage to make adjustments to their manufacture and use and, in the light of scientific data, prepare for an outright ban and definitive destruction."
"This is what we are seeking in the hope that the Council and the Commission will demonstrate in practice their sense of responsibility, given that this is not a woolly political issue, but a matter of public health."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) Madam President, thank you very much."
"In the name of the Council, I would also like to thank the MEP for posing the question concerning the global ban, or the global treaty to ban uranium weapons."
"Of course, Members are probably aware of the fact that such an agreement does not yet exist."
"There is no agreement that would regulate depleted uranium weapons on a multilateral level."
"It is also known that there is no unanimity within the Council."
"A debate on the effects of the weaponry containing depleted uranium has recently been held in the United Nations, where, at the end of last year, the UN First Committee adopted a resolution entitled 'Effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium'."
"As has already been mentioned, the EU Member States all voted differently on this resolution."
"I would say very differently: five voted in favour, four voted against it, and all others abstained."
"I would say that this is a rather good illustration of the current situation in the world."
"With your permission, I would now briefly like to try and answer the particular questions that have been asked."
"As regards the first question in connection with the European Parliament's resolution concerning biological weapons and some types of conventional weapons, I would like to point out that the European Union has been, still is, and will continue to be very active in its international endeavours to implement the convention on biological and toxic weaponry."
"Amongst other things, the EU played an important role at the Second Survey Conference in 2006 and it will also be active for the duration of the expert programme until the next Survey Conference, scheduled for the year 2011."
"As regards the Convention on Conventional Weapons, the European Union and its member states both actively participate in the current negotiations, which include a debate on the humanitarian consequences of cluster bombs."
"The Member States have committed themselves to achieve by the end of this year, through negotiations, a legally binding instrument which will take into consideration all the aspects of cluster bombs."
"Regarding the second question, I would like to explain that so far weapons containing depleted uranium have not been included in the European Unions' strategy for weapons of mass destruction."
"A debate is currently still under way on whether it is possible at all to include such ammunition in weapons of mass destruction."
"There are, in fact, some who think that depleted uranium is already covered by the Convention on Conventional Weapons; others believe that Protocol No 3, which is part of this Convention, should be expanded to include the issue of projectiles and warheads containing depleted uranium."
"In short, the debates are still ongoing."
"As regards the third question, I should make it clear that the choice of military equipment, including the ammunition used in the operations conducted by the European Union, is within the remit of the Member States, and given that we do not have a multilateral agreement regarding this issue, I cannot offer any additional information on the use of depleted uranium."
"The fourth question, regarding safety provisions for the soldiers and civilians involved in operations of the European Union: I should point out that it is the operation commander, within the operative plan approved by the European Council, who bears the responsibility for safety provisions, and who must take any measures he deems necessary."
"Of course, at the same time he must take into consideration operational limitations."
"In any civilian missions of the European Union, this responsibility lies with the head of the mission under the civilian operation commander's leadership."
"As to the last question, regarding dialogue between the European Council and the USA, non-governmental organisations and individuals, I can only say that until now in the dialogue with the United States this issue has not been raised - nor has it yet been raised with the other parties mentioned in the question."
"In any event, I shall follow the further debate on this matter with interest."
"Thank you."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Parliament resolution adopted in November 2006 invites the European Union and the Member States to undertake to extend the scope of Protocol III of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons in a bid to curtail the use of depleted uranium weapons."
"I wish to remind the House that Parliament is calling for action which, as you know, goes beyond the powers of the Commission, given that the Community is not a signatory to the Convention."
"Moreover, under the Treaties, the Community institutions have no powers in military affairs."
"I have no wish, nevertheless, to convey the impression that the Commission is indifferent to problems in connection with the production, storage and utilisation of weapons covered by the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) or the issue of inhumane weapons in general. Its position is quite the contrary, in fact."
"The Commission is fully engaged in implementing a common course of action, adopted by the Council last year, in favour of the universal nature of the CCW and its Protocols."
"Three seminars have been held this year, one for Latin America and the Caribbean in Santo Domingo in March, and two more for the African countries in Lomé last month."
"Following these seminars, the Dominican Republic has already announced that it is willing to ratify the Convention shortly, and Surinam has stated that it is ready to take the necessary steps towards ratification."
"The Commission also supports implementation of the Biological Weapons Convention and is also following up initiatives to create a new instrument in response to humanitarian concerns aroused by cluster bombs, within the framework of the CCW and the Oslo Peace Process."
"The Commission has also taken action in response to the problems caused by explosive ordnance."
"In 2006, for example, five million euros were disbursed to help clear explosive war debris in Lebanon."
"In relation to the second question, the scientific results available to us cannot confirm that depleted uranium (DU) munitions entail a significant risk to the health of civilian populations in the areas of combat concerned, or to military personnel who are serving or have served in these areas."
"This is the opinion stated in surveys by the UN, WHO and the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), and also a Group of Experts established by the European Commission according to Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty, which pronounces as follows, and I quote: 'On the basis of available information, it is concluded that exposure to DU could not produce any detectable health effects under realistic assumptions of the doses that would be received', unquote."
"The Commission is willing to take another look at the issue."
"It will also continue to guarantee the health of its personnel and be ruled by WHO directives in the event of deployment under conditions entailing potential exposure to DU."
"Concerning dialogue with EUROMIL, the Commission is of course willing to talk to any representatives of civil society."
"In relation to the last three questions, the Commission does not currently intend to make any financial commitments in these areas."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (CS) Weapons containing depleted uranium represent an enormous burden on the environment."
"The argument that their harmful effects have not been proven sounds totally absurd to anyone who has ever seen the consequences of their use."
"Dirty bombs will shatter into pieces the several centimetre thick armour plates of the most modern tanks."
"Their destructive power is enormous."
"They have an impact on people's health."
"They kill without mercy."
"There is no doubt about the need to cease trading in them, and to stop their production, use and storage."
"Parliament and the Union are building European Armed Forces and European defence, step by step."
"We will be the future partners of both NATO and the US."
"We must therefore become a credible partner."
"Standing up and shouting 'I am calling for a moratorium on depleted uranium' is comical."
"Equally comical is to call on the Council to prepare an impact study."
"The first necessity is to reach a political consensus between the Member States, such as France, Britain and perhaps the Czech Republic."
"Then we have to start cooperating with the UN, to lay the groundwork for the global treaty to ban depleted uranium."
"This will include the preparation of a plan for a gradual ban on manufacturing, acceptable to all Member States, and on storing of and trading in uranium, and will set the date when the use is finally banned."
"Then we have to have a conference that will adopt this plan and start the process leading up to the final ban on these weapons."
"We need an accurate analytical study assessing the side effects."
"What we need in the first place, though, is political cooperation that will start the gradual process of finding the political will and achieving international recognition, consensus and decision."
"This process will take years."
"It would be great if the European Union were a party to the new treaty on the ban on all military use of depleted uranium."
"Therefore we must behave in a responsible manner."
"Let us not allow silly shouting, professional ignorance and unfinished work to impair the EU's credibility."
"We need to continue to be partners in this important game."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - In the UK, hundreds of veterans believe that exposure to depleted uranium in the First Gulf War has left them with chronic illnesses and disabilities and in Iraq there is evidence that the use of depleted uranium has caused an increase in babies being born with only one eye or who are missing both eyes."
"Seven of the eight babies missing both eyes had fathers who were exposed to depleted uranium during the war in Iraq in 1991."
"At least 17 countries still have depleted uranium weapons in their military arsenals, including three EU members: France, Greece and the UK."
"We now urgently need an international treaty establishing an immediate moratorium on the use, development, production, stockpiling, transfer and testing of depleted uranium weapons as well as the recycling or destruction of the existing stocks."
"I hope everyone will support this resolution."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, caution alone is quite sufficient reason to work towards the effective elimination of weapons using depleted uranium."
"Work on expert studies on the effects of the use of such weapons on human beings and on the natural environment should most certainly be speeded up."
"A moratorium on the use of weapons of this type could be brought in immediately, however, and the issue dealt with under the new European Security Strategy."
"The challenge now before us is to start work on an international treaty based on the UN system. Such a treaty would regulate the use, production, storage and testing of this type of weapon."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, this debate was long overdue."
"I am glad that we are holding it today."
"Depleted uranium is used by many countries, and especially Western countries, as ammunition in their wars because of its high penetrative power, especially against armoured vehicles."
"DU munitions, however, contain highly poisonous chemical substances - in other words they are toxic - and they are radioactive too."
"Depleted uranium is a by-product of the nuclear industry, resulting from the enrichment of uranium or the production of nuclear weapons."
"The use of nuclear energy, in short, is also part of the problem."
"DU munitions have long-term effects."
"When a hard target is hit, depleted uranium is released at high temperatures and burns into depleted-uranium oxides, which take the form of a fine alpha-radioactive toxic dust that is easily inhaled and can be spread by wind and water."
"This dust is difficult to remove from the environment and is trapped in the lungs on inhalation."
"We know of the Gulf War syndrome and the Balkans syndrome; time and again the same phenomenon has been observable, with combatants evidently contracting cancers, such as lung cancer, because of their exposure to DU oxide."
"There have also been increases in the incidence of such cancers among the population of areas where these munitions have been used."
"The interesting thing is that the military effectiveness of DU munitions is actually very limited, while their use entails numerous incalculable risks."
"NATO used DU munitions in its war of aggression against Yugoslavia."
"In Iraq the US forces have used a total of 300 tonnes of DU munitions. There is an increased percentage of deformed children in that country, especially in Baghdad."
"The Government of Afghanistan has now called for an inquiry into the use of DU munitions in Afghanistan and says that the US military did not inform it that DU munitions were being used, particularly in the eastern part of the country."
"DU munitions were used in the war in Lebanon, mainly by Israel, and they were also used very extensively in the first Gulf War."
"The figure of contaminated combatants has been put at 66 000."
"The problem is plain to see."
"The first war pensions for the effects of depleted uranium have been awarded to veterans such as Kenny Duncan from the UK."
"If DU dust were a cosmetic product or a substance used in food production, for example, it would have been banned long ago."
"Troops are instructed to wear protective clothing when dealing with DU munitions."
"EUROMIL, the European Organisation of Military Associations, has been calling for a ban on weapons that fire these munitions."
"Belgium has banned DU munitions, and for that we congratulate it."
"The UN Disarmament and International Security Committee voted by 122 to 6, with 35 abstentions, to call for a report on the harmful effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium. The six votes against included those of the Czech Republic, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom."
"What we need is a ban on the production and use of DU munitions."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the use of depleted uranium for bellicose purposes is contrary to international law; there is incontrovertible evidence of its genuine toxicity both to man and the environment."
"I agree that, as part of European Security Strategy, full consideration must be given to the matter and I am of the view that the ban on these weapons in the Member States of the Union must be total and absolute."
"Both questions put forward assessments and raise reasonable joint issues which have been very widely documented; here I shall take the opportunity to note the example of the Italian soldiers posted to the Balkans who are still awaiting fair compensation which, I fear, they will never receive."
"As it does not appear able to remedy damage caused in the past, the Union should give a decisive, strong signal at least for the future by banning the manufacture, storage and placing on the market of this type of arms within the Member States of the Union."
"author. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I consider Jana Hybášková's call for real politik to be misplaced and altogether cynical."
"Sloth or negligence, like State secrets, are not acceptable where people's health is concerned."
"The use of uranium weapons has devastating and irreparable consequences."
"When they explode, uranium projectiles irradiate fine, contaminating dust; they contaminate the air, land and water, penetrate the respiratory system, and increase the likelihood of tumours, leukaemias and malformations."
"Anyone who uses them is evidently acting in violation of international humanitarian laws."
"Since the Gulf War of 1991, the association of relatives of military personnel victims has calculated that there have been 50 deaths in Italy alone."
"Recently the Minister for Defence said there had been 77 deaths and that the number of people suffering illness was between several hundred and about two thousand."
"Over 2 000 tonnes of depleted uranium were used between 1991 and 2003."
"Some 70% of the territory of Iraq is contaminated and even today we are not certain of the extent of the terrible human cost of depleted uranium."
"In Basra hospital in Iraq I have seen the bodies of deformed children;"
"I have seen the terrible damage wrought on their little bodies."
"There are thousands of faceless civilians who still live and die in land contaminated by radiation: in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Kosovo, in Bosnia, in Somalia, unaware of their fate."
"Since 2001 we, as the European Parliament, have been seeking the introduction of a moratorium."
"We confirmed this in 2006 with the adoption of a resolution on chemical weapons and inhumane conventional weapons."
"The resolution adopted by an overwhelming majority at the UN in 2007 urges the Member States of the United Nations to examine the damage to health."
"Six countries voted against: the US and Israel and, unfortunately, several Member States of the European Union, namely France, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands."
"They should instead have followed the example given by Belgium which, in March 2007, was the first country in the world to decide to ban depleted uranium completely because of its toxicity."
"Along with other colleagues of, I am glad to say, all political persuasions, I argued strongly for this debate because it is crucial to act against violations of international, humanitarian and environmental law and to act to ensure that military hierarchies, states and the war industry assume their responsibilities in full."
"Omissions and military secrets, failure to implement rules regarding protection and the precautionary principle could sweep the danger of uranium under the carpet along with the opportunity to prevent a large number of deaths."
"On those grounds I reassert the calls made in our resolution, especially to ensure maximum transparency by signposting contaminated areas and above all pursuing the idea of an immediate moratorium to achieve a complete ban soon on depleted uranium weapons and cluster bombs, which are still claiming victims."
"In Lebanon, for example, the Israeli army launched more than a million cluster bombs on villages and homes in the last few hours before it withdrew."
"Take action."
"Thank you to the Council and the Commission for their replies but also for what they will do, despite the limitations referred to by Commissioner Michel, to achieve freedom from uranium weapons and cluster bombs."
"(PL) Depleted uranium is 70% heavier than lead."
"Due to its kinetic energy, even a very small calibre missile can therefore penetrate a tank's armour plating."
"That is why depleted uranium has been used by the military."
"There is approximately one and a half million tonnes of depleted uranium in the world."
"One can readily understand the temptation to make use of it."
"As it turns out, however, weapons of this type have not proved nearly as effective as was anticipated. Seventy per cent of damaged Iraqi tanks were damaged by weapons of other types."
"Obviously, the question of the consequences of using such weapons remains outstanding."
"It should be clearly stated that no definitive answer has yet emerged."
"After all, thousands of individuals have been working in uranium mines for many years, with no obvious ill effects."
"Nonetheless, there is still doubt surrounding the issue and a moratorium should therefore be declared, to allow the matter to be finally resolved."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the nature and extent of the damage resulting from the use of depleted uranium is such that it seems inappropriate to describe it as 'collateral'."
"The damage is wrought in successive waves on enemy personnel and on the personnel using these weapons: for example, Gulf War syndrome, Balkan syndrome."
"The people who then bear the cost for decades afterwards are the civilian populations, resident in the theatres of war, who inhale and ingest the depleted uranium as it contaminates aquifers and the food chain, and who experience the effects of radiation."
"The highest price in terms of the typical damage caused by exposure to heavy metal radiation, of which we are all aware, is paid by children, growing bodies, especially unborn children."
"The exponential growth of genetic malformations and infantile tumours in areas where uranium has been used is proof of this."
"A recent study by the BBC in Britain showed that 24 hours after the massive bombardment of the Balkans, readings of atmospheric radioactivity in the north of England were the highest on record."
"We therefore propose not only a ban on depleted uranium but also the prosecution for war crimes of those who use it in full knowledge of its consequences and of those who do so when a ban is in place."
"Mr President, while we are on the subject of radioactive weapons, this Parliament has been remarkably quiet about a British citizen - unfortunately consequently an EU citizen - killed by a radioactive weapon in London in December 2006."
"I refer of course to Mr Alexander Litvinenko, who was murdered in an act of state-sponsored terrorism by means of polonium-210."
"The chief suspect for the crime is Mr Andrei Lugovoi, who is now a Member of the Russian Parliament and cannot be extradited under the Russian Constitution."
"Meanwhile Mr Litvinenko's widow is denied an inquest into her husband's death in the British courts, which could scrutinise the evidence of his murder in the absence of a trial of those suspected of the crime."
"This murder was an act of war by Russia on the UK."
"The British Government does not want to confront that fact."
"But if you want to discuss radioactive weapons, why not hold a debate on Mr Litvinenko's murder and its far-reaching consequences?"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) Very briefly, I would like to express my thanks for this debate."
"I would like to reiterate that the Council remains very active concerning external security issues in line with the EU strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"Within these strategies the priority objectives of the Council are constantly being updated, and new developments in this area are constantly being taken into consideration, and are then also included in the updated documents."
"An example of this is, for instance, the measure adopted by the Council, in support of the global adoption of the convention on banning and limitation of some types of conventional armaments."
"It is interesting that the purpose of Protocol Five in this Convention is to reduce as much as possible the creation of explosive military waste, once the military conflicts are over."
"It is also interesting that the largest producers and users of armaments containing depleted uranium are already signatories to the above-mentioned Convention."
"It is too early to make any forecasts yet."
"I have mentioned the situation in the Council, which is evident from the voting results on the General Assembly's First Committee Resolution, which has been mentioned several times today."
"It is to be hoped that the debates such as the present one in the European Parliament will contribute to achieving a consensus in the Council."
"However, there will more on this in the near future."
"Thank you."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Very briefly, Mr President, obviously I take due note of the splendid remarks and specific proposals made here, and have every intention of passing them on to my colleague Benita Ferrero-Waldner and the Commission."
"I must, however, remind the House that the Commission's scope for action is extremely limited."
"It obviously has declamatory or incantatory powers; it may submit proposals, but has no power beyond that."
"I do wish to make this clear."
"Having said that, I do take due note of the very clear message that there must be a guarantee of transparency, as Mrs Morgantini said. I am quite in favour of this point."
"She suggests a moratorium, and I will pass on this suggestion."
"I also seem to have perceived the need to re-update the surveys performed to date, or the possibility of this."
"There is no reason why these surveys should not be updated again."
"You should know in any case that I will report to the Commission on all the fine speeches and arguments I have heard here, and I have no doubt that in due course initiatives will be taken."
"In any case, however, ideas will be passed on and the voluntarist spirit will form part of the process, believe me, because it is obvious we must hope that all the other European countries will be able to do what Belgium has done."
"I am not saying this merely because it is Belgium, but of course I am pleased it was my country that did it."
"This is perhaps what you were seeking."
"There have certainly been some useful and interesting sources of inspiration, but I wish to let you know that I will pass on all the suggestions, comments and requests made here in all conviction and sincerity."
"I have received six motions for a resolution pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"(The sitting was suspended at 5.35 p.m. and resumed at 6 p.m.)"
"Council Question Time"
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0156/2008)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Council."
"Subject: Passport discrimination in the EU"
"In some EU countries, passports and other documents used for crossing borders are issued not only to the nationals of those countries, but also to stateless persons residing permanently in the countries concerned."
"Given that most of these persons belong to ethnic minorities, does the Council intend to adopt or propose formats for passports and other similar documents which no longer include negative details such as 'aliens', and thus put an end to discrimination based on ethnic origin?"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) I have a rather brief answer."
"Namely, that the issuing of passports or travel documents to stateless persons permanently resident in a Member State does not fall under the competence of the Community."
"Therefore, neither the European Commission nor the Council is competent to propose any changes in connection with this sort of passport, or any other travel documents."
"(ES) Mr President, the reply from the President-in-Office of the Council is very clear indeed: there may be no discussion of this kind of issue."
"Perhaps I ought to ask the question in slightly different terms."
"Can the Council envisage any kind of EU harmonisation in relation to passports and identification of passports, or does it feel this issue will be permanently beyond the Member States' jurisdiction?"
"(DE) I would like to ask a question about a different type of discrimination."
"In July, your country, Slovenia, is planning to introduce motorway toll stickers and intends to issue two variants: a yearly and a half-yearly sticker."
"This amounts to discrimination against tens of millions of EU residents travelling to the Mediterranean for their summer holidays."
"What proposal does the Presidency intend to make to the Slovenian Government to resolve this problem?"
"My thanks to the Presidency."
"I welcome the fact that 13 Member States to date have ratified the Lisbon Treaty."
"You will be aware that Ireland is the only country that will be ratifying it through the referendum process."
"We have major difficulty at home at the moment in trying to counteract the various different groups on the 'no' side."
"These groups spread fear and confusion in relation to the Lisbon Treaty, deliberately or not, often on issues that are very important but have nothing to do with the Treaty."
"Can you then confirm for me, Mr President-in-Office, that Ireland's right to veto future direct taxation proposals will in no way be compromised by the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, and that there is no connection between the WTO negotiations and the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty at all?"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) Mrs Doyle, thank you for the two additional questions."
"I can confirm that, firstly, any decisions in the sphere of taxation will continue to be made consensually."
"In other words, even once the Lisbon Treaty comes into effect, provided it is ratified by all the Member States, Ireland, or any other Member State, will continue to have the right to veto any matter concerning taxes."
"As regards your second question, namely regarding the negotiations currently being held within the World Trade Organisation, I can also confirm that these negotiations have no direct connection with ratification of the Lisbon Treaty."
"Therefore, to both of your additional questions the answer is - yes."
"Mr President, I too want to ask the Minister a question with regard to the Treaties and the ratification process in Ireland at the moment."
"One of the arguments that is raging at the moment is that, after the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, countries may lose their veto in the ratification of international trade agreements - WTO agreements, for example."
"As it stands, there is a veto, and the 'no' side are maintaining that after Lisbon this will change."
"I would like the confirmation of the Slovenian presidency as to whether this is the case or not."
"ith the luck of the Irish, the electors of Ireland alone are to be allowed to decide on a Treaty which fundamentally affects the future of us all."
"Will you, on behalf of the Council, pledge to accept their democratic verdict or, like the voters of France and Holland, will they be treated with contempt if they dare to vote 'no', very much in the disreputable tradition of 'Croppy, lie down!' and Nice II?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately I cannot give the floor to any more speakers as the Rules of Procedure do not permit this."
"I believe everyone is aware that we are studying a change to this Question Time in order to make it more flexible and also more useful."
"I myself am assisting the working group and we will definitely have positive news in due course."
"At the moment, the Rules stand as they are and I cannot give the floor to Mr Higgins, despite this having been requested, because he was the third person to request this."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) As the scope of the question is quite wide my answer will be slightly longer."
"The negotiations with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on their EU membership have not yet commenced."
"Until such time as it joins the European Union, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is currently the primary framework for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's European relations."
"In line with the priority tasks defined in the Association Partnership, the country's progress towards gaining European Union membership has been assessed in the Commission's Progress Report."
"As a rule, the report is published at the end of October or the beginning of November."
"The Council is looking forward to the Commission producing its next assessment in autumn this year."
"In its conclusions of 10 December 2007, the European Council took note of the progress that the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia had made, and expressed its regret that the implementation of its reforms had been delayed."
"The delays were due to internal political tensions, as a result of which the attention of the country's political institutions was turned away from the European integration priority tasks."
"At this point we can mention some positive examples, indicating that the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is making efforts to avoid such delays."
"Of the political criteria, the country has achieved progress in the sphere of decentralisation, anticorruption policy, cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, as well as in the interethnic relations, and the implementation of the Ohrid Agreement."
"Following the publication of the EU Commission's November Progress Report, the country adopted the Law on Public Prosecutors, the Law on the Public Prosecutors Council and legislation on the Board for Interethnic Issues, and the empty seat on the Judicial Council has also been filled."
"Progress has also been made in the sphere of security of documents, border controls and migration."
"The Council will continue to encourage all the political parties to intensify their dialogue and cooperation and that with different ethnic groups, so that the country can achieve progress with the integration process."
"The Council will also continue to encourage both sides to renew their efforts constructively, so that in the negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations a mutually acceptable solution regarding the name issue could be achieved."
"This would improve regional cooperation and contribute to good relations with their neighbours."
"The main reforms that the country still needs to carry out in line with the recommendations from the Association Partnership areas are:"
"in accordance with the Ohrid Agreement they must continue with decentralisation: two thirds of the municipalities are already in the second stage of the fiscal decentralisation;"
"they must improve equal representation of ethnic minorities in public administration, the sphere of internal affairs being a good example of this."
"The next reforms are the police reform, the judicial reform, and the two major unresolved issues from the so-called May Agreement requiring a wider political consensus, namely the law on languages, and the agreement on regulating the status of victims from the conflicts of 2001."
"On 18 February 2008 the Council adopted a decision on the principles, principal tasks and conditions from the EU Association Partnership with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"The Council has updated the current partnership by defining the updated principal tasks for further work on the basis of the findings contained in the Commission's Progress Report for the year 2007."
"Thank you very much for your response."
"I am just wondering: are you satisfied that the tensions have now eased enough to allow progress to be made?"
"And if they have eased sufficiently, what sort of timescale are you talking about for the necessary reforms to be implemented in full so that the full negotiation process can get back on track?"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) As we know, in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia elections have been called for 1 June."
"We hope that the campaign period will not cause a delay in carrying out the necessary reforms."
"Also, hopefully, the reforms will be continued before and also after the election period."
"In particular, the Presidency is making efforts to achieve progress in the integration of the West Balkan countries, including the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on its road towards European Union membership."
"We hope that this progress will be achieved as soon as possible, and that the country will be given, among other things, a date when membership negotiations can commence."
"Of course, this primarily depends on the country itself, on the rate and quality of their reforms which still need to be completed, and which I have mentioned in my answer."
"As the author is not present, Question No 4 lapses."
"Subject: Climate change and international security"
"Javier Solana's recent paper on Climate Change and International Security draws the Council's attention to some major issues relating to climate change and addresses in particular the implications of territorial claims, exclusive economic zones and access to new trade routes brought about by the consequences of climate change."
"The emphasis on security and geopolitical power opportunities is a departure from the EU's approach to climate change to date that looks to curbing emissions and increasing EU and global preparedness."
"Is the Council working towards a position and strategy relating to these important issues?"
"I thank the Minister for his reply, but I wonder if the institutions are to some extent at cross purposes here."
"On the one side we are staring environmental catastrophe in the face, with Europe and the world continuing as normal, while on the other side we move to engage with the problem of climate change and take the hard decisions that our future generations are dependent upon."
"As the Minister has said, in its Spring conclusions the Council did undertake to move towards tackling the serious problem of climate change and to take the serious decisions needed."
"But is Mr Solana singing from the same hymn sheet?"
"He has been saying different things: talking of the need for fossil fuel exploration rights in one of the last environmentally pristine places on earth, and calling this an opportunity."
"Does that not fly in the face of what the European Council is saying?"
"Could we please co-ordinate our messages?"
"We do have the rapporteur on the climate here, Mrs Doyle, who will be listening to all of this."
"President in Office. - (SL) I can assure you that the Secretary-General of the Council - the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy - has, without any doubt, the same viewpoint as the European Council."
"He prepared his recommendation on behalf of the Council."
"The Council has welcomed the report, and has not found any discrepancies or contradictions in relation to the Council's other decisions, including decisions in the sphere of the integrated climate protection and energy policy."
"So I do not share the opinion that there are any discrepancies between the High Representative's activities, and the Council's decisions or intentions."
"(ES) Mr President, I wish to pick up on the reply from the Council to our colleague's pertinent question by suggesting, particularly in the Member States around the Mediterranean, that we should also discuss the problem of climate change."
"One of the proposals in the Commission communication concerns enhancement of the Horizon 2020 Initiative for the depollution of the Mediterranean region, both a victim and a cause of climate change, and there can be no doubt that some very pragmatic action can be taken through this proposal."
"Does the Council not feel that this is a regional priority in the fight against climate change within the framework of the EU's global agenda?"
"President in Office. - (SL) I believe that Mr Higgins is aware that the Council attributes great importance to the efficient management of external borders."
"With the free movement of people within the European Union, the appropriate protection and management of external borders is of key importance so as to provide the Member States with internal security and to effectively combat terrorism, illegal immigration and people trafficking."
"To this end the European Council has so far produced a number of important measures."
"It has, among other things, adopted legal instruments such as the Schengen Borders Code, the External Borders Fund, the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States - FRONTEX for short."
"It has also adopted measures in connection with the setting up of the Rapid Border Intervention Teams."
"I would also like to draw your attention to three communications which the Commission made public on 13 February this year."
"These communications contain proposals and recommendations on a possible means of border management at the EU level, on the future development of FRONTEX, on the possible formation of the European Border Surveillance System called EUROSUR, and on the external borders entry-exit system."
"The debate on the Commission's proposals and recommendations from these communications took place on 12 March, at the Ministerial Conference in Slovenia."
"It is anticipated that in June the Justice and Home Affairs Council will adopt the Council's conclusions on the management of the external borders of the EU Member States."
"These conclusions should list the short-term and long-term priorities for FRONTEX's future development, further recommendations regarding the European Commission's work on using state-of-the art security technology, better management of external borders and guidelines on further work for establishing EUROSUR."
"Apart from this, we have been carefully monitoring FRONTEX's activities, particularly as regards the implementation of joint operations, the European Coastal Patrol Network, the further upgrading and utilisation of equipment which is recorded centrally, the so-called CRATE, and the possible deployment of the Rapid Border Intervention Teams."
"The establishment of a Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre - Narcotics (MAOC-N) in September of last year was an important step forward for border protection."
"This is a centre for criminal prosecution with military support, established by seven Member States: the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Italy and Portugal."
"The centre is also available to any other Member State."
"The centre's objective is to eradicate the illegal trade in banned substances by sea or by air across the Atlantic to Europe and Western Africa."
"This objective should be achieved with intensified collection, exchange and analysis of information, and with optimal utilisation of the Member States' maritime and air facilities."
"Among the Council's priority tasks should also be strengthened border control, and the collection and exchange of classified information on the routes of drug trafficking."
"Mr President, as drug usage increases and as more drugs become available, it is clear the security authorities are unable to stop the drug supply from entering especially from South America."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you made a reference to coastal patrol; are you and the Council aware of the fact that there is only an occasional inspector on duty at the harbours and airports of the Atlantic coast in the west of Ireland?"
"There is only one boat."
"And it is only too clear that Ireland is being used as a gateway to export drugs to the other Member States - to your own country and to other countries in the European Union."
"Are you and the Council worried about this situation?"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) I am thankful to Mr Higgins for his additional question."
"I should like to emphasise that the European Council is really concerned about this, and will remain concerned while drug trafficking continues to exist."
"As regards Ireland, I should like to emphasise, as I mentioned earlier, that Ireland is one of those countries that have, in September last year, established the Maritime Analysis and Operation Centre - Narcotics (MAOC-N)."
"Its task is precisely the eradication of illegal trade in banned substances that is taking place via this route, that is, either by sea or by air, across the Atlantic, towards Europe or West Africa."
"So given the recent establishment of this centre, I expect it to become more active in future, and the Presidency will support these developments, providing encouragement with the leverage that is at its disposal."
"(DE) Minister, the extension of the area covered by the Schengen Accords last December has raised concerns among many citizens of the EU that they no longer enjoy the level of security to which they had become accustomed."
"Following the enlargement of the Schengen area, can it be said that cooperation between the police authorities of Member States in the enlarged area has achieved the desired results?"
"(EL) Mr President, I thank the Council representative for his answer to my question about safeguarding acceptable standards for decent working and living conditions."
"Decent work is an aim of both the UN global community, under the auspices of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), and the EU."
"We have in any case passed a resolution on this."
"How does the Council intend to implement these decent working and living conditions for citizens, particularly for children?"
"(PT) We agree with the aims behind alternative energies but it is clear that the food problem and hunger which seem to be increasing are making many people wonder whether biofuels are the right step."
"My question is, while agreeing that we need to move forward with alternative energies, whether you are able to say publicly and assure our citizens that this route is not increasing the cost of foodstuffs and world hunger."
"My thanks to the President-in-Office for the further call he has made tonight."
"I wonder, given the changes in government in Cuba, whether he and the Council have detected any change and increase in the enthusiasm of Cubans to enter into the open political dialogue he mentioned?"
"I wonder also if he could reflect on the current debate taking place in the United States and the debate that no doubt takes place between the Council and the United States in our transatlantic relations."
"Does he detect any change of policy there which may incentivise further improvements in human rights in Cuba?"
"(SK) The release of the four Cuban prisoners of conscience is a very positive step, as is the Cuban Government's signing of two legally binding covenants from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights at the United Nations on 28 February 2008."
"However, at least 58 people still remain incarcerated in Cuban prisons purely for insisting on their fundamental rights."
"In the context of these two UN human rights covenants, what can the Council do for the 75 prisoners of conscience from the 'March group'?"
"I trust that the Council will call on high-ranking Cuban officials to review all cases concerning Cuban dissidents by impartial and non-partisan courts, and will try to get them released."
"I was slightly disappointed by your reply because I think the Cubans are indicating a real willingness to move and that the change in government is a change in emphasis in terms of the Cuban approach to the outside world."
"It would be a great pity if the EU did not use this opportunity and grasp the chance to have a serious dialogue with Cuba."
"So let us not keep putting more pressure on Cuba to make concessions, let us start with the EU engaging with the Cubans."
"(DE) Mr President, it baffles me how the Council can simply leave without batting an eyelid."
"I have been a Member of this House for a long time."
"Question Time with the Council used to begin at 9 p.m., and the Council was with us until half past ten."
"Then the Council asked that Question Time be brought forward to 6 or 7 p.m., and we deferred to its wishes."
"That was our first mistake."
"Since then, Question Time has always started late, and the representatives of the Council have had to leave on the stroke of seven, regular as clockwork."
"It is not the fault of the Slovenian Presidency; it is a general problem that we must discuss with the Council."
"For half of the year, the representatives of the Council can surely stay until Thursday in this beautiful city of Strasbourg and be available to us on Wednesday evenings too."
"Your comment is noted."
"Today we actually started on time at 6 p.m."
"The sitting therefore did not start late."
"In any event, the Council has asked for the floor and may speak."
"(DE) Mr President, allow me to inform the Council that Question Time normally lasts for an hour and a half; when we complain to the Bureau, we are invariably told that Question Times which last for only one hour are the exception."
"The exceptional arrangement applies every time now."
"Mr Posselt, that is a matter for the Conference of Presidents to decide."
"It is not a question of whether or not I agree."
"I should like us to have more time, but we must abide by the decision of the Conference of Presidents."
"In any event, your criticism has been noted and will be forwarded to the Conference of Presidents."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"

"Mid-term review of industrial policy (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Jordan Cizelj, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the mid-term review of industrial policy - A contribution to the EU's Growth and Jobs Strategy."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, three years ago we modernised the industrial policy of the EU and established it as a cornerstone of our entire economic strategy."
"We are able to say today that it was the right decision."
"European industry is better placed as a major competitor when it comes to defending its share of the market."
"The excellent export performance of European industry contributes to macroeconomic stability, even in times of crisis."
"On the basis of a mid-term review, we have presented you with a timetable and work plan for the coming years."
"I ask you to support this plan."
"I should like to thank Mrs Jordan Cizelj for drafting this report, and you will understand why I am truly pleased and want to express my delight that this report is so favourable and gives us such strong backing."
"Like me, the rapporteur sees the main functions of industrial policy in the creation of the right conditions for businesses, making the European Union a sustainably attractive location for industries and strengthening our industrial base so that we shall also have sufficient good and secure manufacturing jobs in future."
"Industrial policy in the 21st century no longer bears any resemblance to what used to be called industrial policy."
"Let me reiterate clearly that our industrial policy is based on the premise that our companies must face up to competition and that we cannot protect them from competition and indeed have no wish to do so."
"Our task is not to protect industries."
"Our job is to provide them with conditions in which they can fully develop their potential."
"I am pleased that the parliamentary report endorses not only the aims of our industrial policy but also the method by which we are pursuing them."
"This method is based on a combination of cross-sectoral and single-sector initiatives."
"There is certainly a need to act in numerous areas that have a great impact on the whole of European industry."
"Let me cite just three examples, namely cutting red tape for European businesses, strengthening their innovative capacity and fostering an enterprise culture."
"On the other hand there are matters that only concern specific industries."
"Let me remind you that we have introduced a system which guarantees the safe production and marketing of chemical substances in the Union."
"We have just launched a comprehensive package of measures designed to strengthen the European defence industry, and there is an ambitious programme, adopted only this week, to simplify the legal provisions governing the automotive industry."
"I could add many more examples to this list."
"All of these things have been done in close partnership, not only with industry but also with all groups of stakeholders."
"I attach great importance to the fact that we have done all this together with Parliament, with the trade unions and with the environmental and consumer organisations in open, transparent and verifiable processes."
"I reject the idea of making industrial policy behind closed doors or in back rooms."
"European industry is the vital driving force of innovation in Europe and an absolutely crucial factor in safeguarding our position in global trade, and its achievements therefore merit recognition and praise; they merit measures to enhance the ability of European industry to maintain its performance in future as far as possible, and they merit efforts on our part to meet the challenges that lie immediately ahead."
"These challenges stem, of course, from the gathering momentum of economic globalisation - we should have no illusions about that."
"What we have seen so far is only the beginning."
"The same surely applies to technological change and the pace at which it is happening, with all the implications for productivity, structures and jobs, and, of course, to the increasingly central question of the ways in which our climatic and environmental objectives impact on our industrial policy."
"Adjustments are needed here, and they will occupy us in the immediate future."
"For this reason, the Commission's next major initiative, which is to be launched before the end of this month, is the initiative for sustainable industrial development, a sustainable industrial policy and sustainable industrial production."
"The political aim is to pursue an integrated approach comprising environmental, employment and industrial policies."
"We want a strong economy, safe jobs, less energy dependence and a clean environment."
"The way to these goals lies in products and processes that are innovative and designed to meet future needs, less environmental pollution in Europe and more support for other regions in their essential efforts to cope with climate change with the aid of modern technology made in Europe."
"That is the path we intend to pursue in our industrial policy."
"In addition, we have also launched new initiatives on industry clusters and pilot markets."
"I shall present you with an action plan on standardisation and examine ways in which industry can obtain higher-quality and more competitive services."
"Two new sectoral initiatives have also been launched."
"The first deals with problems specific to the food industry, and that has now acquired great significance, of course, in the light of rising food prices, while the other relates to the challenges facing another of Europe's key industries, namely electrical engineering."
"All in all, I believe we can say that our industrial policy is now well on the way to creating the right conditions for European businesses to flourish."
"Let me say again that our aim is not to intervene or to favour particular economic players, nor do we seek to relieve the Member States of their responsibility; what we are aiming for is partnership, optimum coordination and the common achievement of common goals."
"We are in the process of dovetailing the industrial policy of the European Union more closely with those of the Member States, and I am delighted that Parliament has also given its firm backing to that effort."
"on behalf of the PSE group. - (RO) I would like to congratulate Mrs. Cizelj and thank her for the openness she has shown in the process of making this report."
"I submitted four amendments that we can find at items 18 and 27 of the report."
"I begin by calling attention to the need to correlate industrial development with the improvement of social protection systems."
"All employees in industry should have decent working conditions."
"At Item 18 of Mrs. Cizelj's report, the European Parliament considers that industrial development is closely related to the availability of an efficient transport infrastructure at European level."
"A developed transport infrastructure will allow the development of industrial areas outside urban communities as well."
"Member States can also use the regional development funds for the creation of industrial and technological parks in rural areas close to large urban agglomerations."
"Through another amendment I submitted, I requested the Commission and Member States to support and accelerate the achievement of the projects that the European Council declared of European interest for energy safety and diversification of the European Union energy sources."
"At item 27 of the report, the European Parliament calls attention to the need to further invest in education, professional training and research."
"Industrial development and the competitiveness of European products depend on the quality of human resources and their level of training, as well as on the innovations contained in the new products."
"Unfortunately, at the level of the European Union, in spite of the Community research programmes and the funds allocated to them, too little is invested in applied research and this is true especially in the case of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"They are dealing with difficulties in providing the co-financing required for their participation in the research framework programme."
"In this context, I consider the banking system could prepare financial instruments to facilitate the participation of SMEs in the research framework programmes."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, let me begin by expressing my thanks to Romana Jordan Cizelj whose report truly touched on all aspects of a modern industrial policy and stressed the particular importance of creating the right basic conditions."
"I am very grateful to her."
"We cooperated well on this report."
"In your explanatory statement, Mrs Jordan Cizelj, you say that, in general, industry in the EU is healthy and dynamic."
"Yes, we are even experiencing a renaissance of the so-called 'old economy'."
"I myself come from a highly industrialised state."
"No one ever thought, for example, that the steel industry would suddenly boom again."
"We are a vibrant global force."
"The state of our industry is robust, and our flagship, the euro, has indeed steered us through the straits."
"Nevertheless, in spite of the sound industrial base and the resumption of investment activity in Europe, we note that the tide is turning."
"The speed of technological change is breathtaking."
"The question is how we should deal with this."
"Is this the right time to be conducting a mid-term review of our industrial policy?"
"Without raw materials and cheap labour - neither of which we possess - we shall come under competitive pressure that we shall be unable to withstand unless we are creative."
"For this reason, I wish to congratulate the Commission first of all for having designated 2009 as the Year of Creativity and Innovation."
"Yet what does that mean?"
"Innovation, as we know, must be far more effective in turning knowledge into wealth."
"We have established the EIT, the European Institute of Innovation and Technology - or, to be more precise, it will soon be established - and that is a good basis."
"Yet the creative people in the world are not only leaving Europe, they are now even quitting the United States."
"You should read the book by Richard Florida in which he reflects on this situation."
"What is happening with regard to the creative class in this world?"
"Creative people will settle in places that fulfil three criteria, which Florida calls the three Ts - technology, talent and tolerance."
"The question is whether these three Ts are present in sufficient abundance here in Europe."
"I believe we have laid good foundations with the Seventh Framework Programme and the EIT, but that is not enough."
"We must do a lot more."
"The three Ts need more money."
"The clusters are a sound initiative."
"It is essential, however, to select the right specialisations; the cluster initiative must be coherent, as must the whole industrial policy of the EU, and it must be appropriate and balanced."
"In the case of the car industry, of course, we see some lack of consistency; we see that, in certain respects, we are overtightening the screw."
"That has to do with our policy on climate change, which is increasingly becoming a fanatical moral crusade, subjecting Europe to a form of lifestyle regulation that sometimes goes over the top."
"How else can it happen that CO2 emissions from exhaust pipes are penalised 24 times more heavily than emissions from chimneys?"
"We must ensure, Commissioner Verheugen, that the policy of the EU is coherent."
"We cannot be the lead market and possess an 80% share of global trade in premium cars and yet pull the rug from under our own feet in this very part of the market."
"We must take care to act consistently."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the value of the rapporteur's work deserves to be fully recognised."
"The review undertaken presents an encouraging picture of the state of many sectors of the Union's industry."
"We must, however, recognise the challenges facing our Community."
"These challenges mainly relate to the pace of technological change, notably regarding new materials, to the need to save energy and water, to environmental protection and also to demographic conditions affecting the labour market."
"We need to improve our approach to the implementation of innovative solutions in all areas, including technical and organisational, legal and financial."
"The current legal, administrative and bureaucratic barriers are detrimental to the competitiveness of our industrial products."
"The question of the transition from idea to production should be raised in this context, as should the subject of patents and European discoveries."
"Every effort must be made to devise solutions that will be acceptable to small and medium-sized enterprises as well as to large ones."
"European products can and must succeed through their attractive design, finish, excellent quality, creativity and outstanding service."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the sole objective of this report and today's discussions is simply to conceal a glaring reality in the European Union: industry is in crisis and the damage being caused is substantial."
"The figures provided are certainly dream-like: 80%, 73%."
"They could well have been replaced with billions of euros to show them off to everyone."
"They fool no one, however."
"They do nothing but hide the real state of affairs."
"One of the major concerns of industry as a whole is that the only thing that counts is the profit margin."
"The endangered species of captains of industry has now been replaced by sombre-talking slot machines."
"No matter what decisions are taken and their consequences for the women and men of Europe, profit must be as high as possible and it must be immediate."
"I am well aware that some people will tell me that never has so much been invested, produced, exchanged and earned by industry."
"That is true, but what is the significance of huge financial reward benefiting a handful of people when most are suffering and seeing their little dreams of happiness going up in smoke?"
"We cannot fail to see that the theme of employment is not a feature of this report, and nor are the concepts of land planning, population needs, taxation and social issues."
"The fact of the matter is that the commercial success of major industrial groups in Europe is now making ever smaller contributions to EU development."
"The large European groups are relocating and outsourcing to countries that operate dumping in terms of wages, welfare, health, taxes and the environment, and meanwhile the EU refuses to enact any industrial policy."
"This policy is also strangling small and medium-sized enterprises and encouraging them to do the same."
"It is obvious it is not the ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr Henin, the time was not established by us, it was established by your group."
"Unfortunately, you have got one minute and thirty seconds."
"So, if you protest, just send this protest to your group."
"(NL) Europe is rightly staking a lot on maintaining and strengthening competitiveness and we know how to keep our market share in essential sectors but, as the Commissioner has just said, we are only in the first wave of globalisation."
"We really need to keep on the edge of our seats."
"Then there is the question of this new combination of research, development and making and selling innovative products in a way that is actually profitable."
"This report by Mrs Jordan Cizelj does put the emphasis in the right place."
"We have to eliminate the bureaucracy and we actually have to talk about more efficiency in laws and legislation."
"The action programme gives the initial impetus for that, but I should like to make a heartfelt plea."
"It is still difficult for industries to find their way through the typical European instruments."
"The Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme and the Seventh Framework Programme are central top-down instruments to be decided in Brussels."
"The structural funds are decentralised in nature."
"All have their own front doors, their own criteria, you name it."
"My message is that there should be more combination, more coordination, more choice of priorities and their definition, even within the European Commission."
"Then I would see the effect in the regions."
"I would see clustering develop in successful sectors."
"Last month in my region we set up an office, a one-stop shop, for the various instruments and that provides clarity."
"In conclusion, fragmentation and bureaucracy are unnecessary."
"We need to know what we want and that also increases the visibility for businesses and the public that is so necessary."
"They have to say that Europe has chosen well and implemented properly."
"On that point there is still a great deal to be desired."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I was delighted to hear the statement by the Commissioner just now."
"I should like to refer to three points he made in it. Firstly, Commissioner, you emphasised that we must individualise our approach to certain sectors of transport."
"Secondly, you said that specific regions require greater assistance."
"Thirdly, you referred to the issue of innovation."
"Some parts of our industry operate at global level and others at local level."
"I would like to mention the shipbuilding industry."
"Typically, this industry is linked to coastal regions. It is, however, one of the industries experiencing difficulties at global level."
"Not only is Poland affected, but also for example Malta, along with other Member States of the European Union."
"Contracts span several years, Commissioner."
"Three years ago nobody anticipated that the rate of the dollar in relation to the euro would fall. Nobody anticipated either that the rate of the dollar and of the euro would fall in relation to the Polish złoty, for example."
"This has resulted in very serious economic problems. I appeal to you, Commissioner, to deal with protection of the European shipbuilding industry by way of the European Union's policy, so that ways of protecting the former can be found, precisely within the framework of these global conditions, in the context of competition with Chinese and Indonesian shipyards."
"I feel sure that this must be a matter close to your heart, Commissioner, as you are an honorary doctor of Szczeciń University."
"(LT) The implementation of EU industrial policy, which is within the competence of the Member States, is facing a number of obstacles that prevent better results and higher competitiveness from being achieved."
"I will highlight some of these - regulation and sustainable development."
"Industry in the EU is challenged by excessive regulation and bureaucracy."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises suffer the most because of the unbearable burden of administration."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises account for more than 90% of all enterprises; they are known for their innovation, dynamism and flexibility and their important role in withstanding competitive pressure as well as creating new jobs."
"I therefore call on the European Commission and the Member States to make major changes and simplify the regulatory environment of SMEs."
"Sustainable development is the horizontal dimension of all EU policy."
"In the EU we must strive to achieve the transition to industry based on lower CO2 production and efficient use of resources, allowing a reduction in environmental pollution, the export of pollution to third countries and the effect on climate change."
"Sustainable development should be based on new technologies, so funding for scientific research should be improved, since we lag behind the United States and Japan in this sphere."
"However, the cost of patents should be reduced to facilitate the spread of innovation."
"Although industrial policy falls within the national sphere of competence, I have previously urged the Commission to take on a more substantial role, especially in carrying out studies and delivering forecasts along with preparing recommendations to governments on which spheres would be competitive, which is very important in terms of moving production to third countries."
"I therefore welcome the Commission's new sectoral initiatives in electrical engineering and the food industry, the problems of which are most acute nowadays."
"(PL) Mr President, I should like to draw attention to two issues in this debate."
"Firstly, as a result of the financial crisis and subsequent economic crisis in the United States, the rates of economic growth and employment within the European Union in both 2008 and 2009 will be lower than previously forecast."
"This may cause serious difficulties, particularly in relation to the operation of SMEs."
"Secondly, the European Commission has set ambitious targets for limiting emissions of carbon dioxide by European industry, when the best that can be said about other countries in the world is that they are being careful regarding emissions. As a result of this approach, the cost of production in Europe will increase, just as economic growth is set to slow down."
"A further negative consequence for the activities of European manufacturing relates to allocation of carbon dioxide emissions between individual Member States, without considering how far some of them lag behind in terms of development."
"The impact on the new Member States has been disastrous, notably in the case of particularly sensitive economies based on coal, such as the economy of my country."
"It seems that the report before us today does not consider these two issues, especially where their effects on economic development and employment in Europe are concerned."
"(PT) The central issue in this debate is the priority that must be given to the defence and promotion of existing industries in the various Member States, bearing in mind their specific natures, whether these are textile, clothing and footwear industries, or automobile, naval or chemical industries, or any other traditional sector or new sector involving new materials and innovative technologies."
"This priority demands not only measures to stimulate innovation and effectively support micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, but also an international trade strategy which takes account of the current situation and the industries existing in our countries, defence of employment with rights, promotion of development in our regions and social inclusion."
"It is not enough to say that we want a forward-looking industry."
"We urgently need to look at the present and place industries and their social impact at the centre of the decisions that must be made in terms of macroeconomic, financial and commercial policies at both Community and national level."
"(PL) Mr President, within the framework of the new Lisbon cycle, the emphasis should be on industrial policy, because a flourishing industry is very important in terms of making full use of the European Union's economic potential."
"It is true that industrial policy falls largely within national competence. Nonetheless, better coordination between action at national and European level is needed in order to guarantee the effectiveness of political strategies."
"The new Action Plan on Sustainable Industrial Policy should take account of aspects such as better legal regulations to reduce the administrative burdens that are particularly onerous for SMEs."
"It is the latter, however, that play one of the most important roles in generating economic growth and strengthening competitiveness in Europe through their potential for innovation, dynamism and flexibility."
"Environmental objectives such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing energy efficiency should also be taken into account. After all, the advantage resulting from the implementation of innovative solutions could turn European industry into a world leader in the area of environmentally friendly and socially acceptable technology, products and services."
"(PL) Commissioner, Europe's updated industrial policy, the new approach, the reduction in the number of regulations, increased competitiveness and innovation are all due to you, Commissioner Verheugen. I should like to make that very clear."
"We are all agreed that the undue amount of regulations affecting enterprises should be reduced. This includes reducing administrative burdens, especially for SMEs."
"We have made high demands of industry in terms of quality requirements, environmental standards, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, energy saving, and ensuring suitable working conditions."
"All this increases costs. At the same time, we want the products manufactured to be competitive on the market."
"How can this be achieved?"
"Is it even possible?"
"I should like to add that the Union and its industry need appropriately qualified workers suited to the needs of a knowledge-based economy."
"It is therefore necessary to support measures to improve the quality of human capital through all types of training, and to fund investment in the development of individuals."
"(RO) I would like to call attention to the insufficiency of European funds to support the ambitious objectives of the European Union regarding climate change."
"The Commission has come up with legislative initiatives that would have an important impact on the different industrial sectors, measures that have no correspondent in the Union's budget either."
"I also consider that an ambitious industrial policy has to go hand in hand with a European employment strategy."
"The free movement of people, combating illegal immigration and, in particular, respect for the rights of all European citizens can ensure equitable work conditions."
"Compliance with the rights of legal immigrants in a Member State will also ensure the protection of the rights of all workers in that Member State and avoiding social dumping."
"(PL) Mr President, I venture to take the floor again as I saved a few seconds of the time allocated to me earlier."
"Commissioner, you referred to monopolies in negative terms."
"I would prefer us to speak of monopolistic practices as something we could overcome."
"I wonder, Commissioner, how you might react to what are known as natural monopolies in economic theory."
"Within the framework of our industrial policy, will we allow natural monopolies to remain in certain areas? After all, on the one hand we are in a position to control them, and on the other to ensure economies of scale."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in these last two minutes, I should like to try and outline how I expect things to develop in the period that lies ahead."
"We shall continue to have a strong European industrial base."
"There is no danger that industry will disappear from Europe."
"I am also quite certain that European industry will continue to generate growth and create jobs, though not necessarily in Europe."
"That is the problem."
"We are already seeing more and more large European companies achieve their growth and their profits outside Europe, and they are also creating their new jobs outside Europe."
"That is resulting in a jobs problem here, and the only way to redress the balance and truly resolve this principal social issue of our time, namely how to create enough good jobs, is actually - as several speakers have said, and I fully support them - to focus initiatives more sharply on enterprise by placing greater emphasis on small and medium-sized businesses."
"The key to the long-term success of our economic strategy does not lie with the large industrial undertakings, which are well able to look after themselves."
"No, the key to success lies with the numerous small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe, whose potential is far from exhausted, and they are the focus of our policy."
"The other point is that the conditions in which European industries compete will change very rapidly."
"It is wrong to imagine that we can go on regarding competitors such as China as suppliers of cheap products for the masses and ourselves as the manufacturers of finer and more expensive goods."
"The Chinese are already producing and exporting high-quality and technologically complex goods."
"We shall very shortly be challenged in those areas in which we are still particularly strong today."
"This means that we must strive to become even better."
"For this reason, everything that has been said here about research, development, innovation, education and training is correct."
"The European economy, and European industry in particular, will be successful if it forges ahead resolutely with the transition to a knowledge-based economy."
"It will also be successful if it realises that the major environmental challenges of our time, especially those relating to energy and climate change, can actually create economic opportunities too, and that these opportunities must be grasped."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
", in writing. - (FI) There is an especially problematic point in the report, where it reads: 'Welcomes the Commission's proposals on consolidating the European market in defence equipment and improving the global competitiveness of the EU defence industry'."
"This means we are building a military-industrial complex on the US model for the Union, an organisation which is marketed in the name of peace."
"It is obvious that that will also include the Galileo satellite positioning system, which has come to be financed entirely by the Union."
"It is just as obvious, moreover, that the legal basis for the militarisation of the whole EU is the new constitution, i.e. the Lisbon Treaty."
"The people are not being told about the way military matters are being fiddled about with; instead, the Union is marketed as a peace project for civilians, which it no longer is."
"The Union will have functional and quasi-judicial powers to launch offensive operations, far beyond its borders, which are illegal under international law."
", in writing. - The European Union is the most important global actor and leading exporter of technology in the world today."
"Sustaining its leading position entails a series of challenges."
"Among these, attention should be given to the need to sustain European exporting industries in the global market by ensuring that unfair competition is challenged, while resisting the temptation of protectionism, and also the need to support small and medium-sized enterprises in the EU through the reduction of administrative and market access obstacles."
"Special attention needs to be directed by the EU institutions towards supporting the SME sectors of the economies of new Member States, so they can close the developmental gap with their peer SMEs in the EU."
"With regard to the opportunities presented by sustainable industrial policies, the EU has to take into account the potential presented by the industries of the new Member States."
"The urgent adoption of a comprehensive Small Business Act will contribute greatly to the development of the SME sectors in all Member States, thus also contributing to the reinforcement of the leading role of Europe in sustainable and technology-oriented industrial production."
"REACH (Draft Test Methods Regulation) (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question by Mr Sacconi, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, to the Commission: Draft REACH Test Methods Regulation (B6-0158/2008)."
"author. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, you are well aware that, within a few days, ten to be precise, the first implementation phase of REACH will begin."
"This is the phase for the pre-registration of substances."
"In view of, shall we say, this solemn moment, we, as you know, were annoyed about the definition of testing in the REACH implementing regulation."
"This was because one of the objectives of REACH which we secured with no small difficulty in the course of the legislative process and inter-institutional negotiations was precisely the promotion of alternative methods to animal tests."
"When we saw that the draft implementing regulation did not include a series of tests scientifically validated by the ECVAM (European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods) because, firstly, they have not yet been approved for regulatory purposes, and secondly, some of them, three of the five, were referred back for validation to the OECD, we were, I repeat, very cross."
"It is only right that REACH should proceed as scheduled, but it is also right for it to set off on the right foot in terms of compliance with the spirit and purpose of this most important regulation."
"In the meantime, as you know, there have been talks between us and on 5 May Parliament received a letter, signed by Commissioner Dimas on your behalf and on behalf of the Commissioner for Research as well, which gave interesting and binding responses to our questions and to our notional opposition to this regulation."
"We must acknowledge that a solid way of accelerating, rationalising and where necessary, making these processes for validating alternative methods more transparent is envisaged"
"Our debate this evening will now become a touch more formal."
"I am sure that you will confirm these undertakings and thus make it possible for us to adopt our resolution tomorrow, as amended in the meantime."
"Upon so doing, in light of the commitment which I am asking you to confirm, there will cease to be any opposition to the regulation."
"Instead, note will be taken of those undertakings, but we will continue the call both for confirmation of those commitments as a matter of urgency and for the regulation to be amended as soon as possible so that it can, at the earliest opportunity, include the alternative tests, which will have been fully validated in the meantime."
"Thank you, I think I have even finished before time, allowing us to proceed more quickly with our work."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Sacconi has certainly put me in a slightly awkward situation."
"As you know, Mr Sacconi, what you criticised was not part of my own portfolio, since I share overall responsibility for the REACH project with Mr Dimas."
"That is why I thought it appropriate to be here this evening and to confirm the precise points you have raised."
"The Commission will provide the necessary procedural clarifications - and I stress the word 'necessary' - and I am extremely grateful to you for bringing these problems and issues to our attention and for your very personal and important contribution that has helped us to resolve these problems."
"So what are we going to do?"
"The Commission's internal procedures for the validation and regulatory acceptance of new alternative test methods will be significantly streamlined and speeded up."
"To this end, the Commission will begin by introducing a preliminary analysis of regulatory relevance, which will help us to focus the process of scientific validation on those test methods that are best suited as a basis for subsequent regulatory acceptance."
"Secondly, we shall reduce the number of procedural steps and introduce clear time-limits to simplify and accelerate the current process."
"This applies especially to the work of the advisory committees and to consultation with the Member States."
"Thirdly, all important procedural decisions to be taken by the Commission will be taken by the Directors-General themselves."
"Fourthly, we shall ensure that the new sequence of procedures is more transparent."
"A website that will be set up by the Joint Research Centre will constantly provide information on the current status of proposed alternative methods."
"Rejection decisions, in other words decisions to discontinue the analysis of a particular test method, will also be explained on the website."
"This will enable anyone to follow the progress of each method in detail."
"The Commission will also adopt measures to optimise the institutions involved in the process of validation and regulatory acceptance."
"First of all, this means improving the participation and interaction of agencies such as the European Chemicals Agency and the European Medicines Evaluation Agency, which we are currently trying to link into a network."
"Moreover, cooperation with the OECD can also be improved in many respects, and that is what we shall do."
"This includes not only the secondment of staff to work on the OECD Test Guidelines Programme but also the provision of funds for the TGP secretariat."
"The firm priority is, and will remain, regulatory acceptance of alternative test methods."
"At the same time, we shall monitor progress within the OECD framework with a view to conducting the process of regulatory acceptance within the Community in the event of undue delays at the international level."
"Mr Sacconi, you will know from our joint work on REACH how much importance I personally attach to very rapid progress on the alternative methods."
"Indeed, we were both in agreement that the world's most advanced legislation on chemicals which we adopted in the REACH regulation must not lead to such a sharp increase in the number of animals used for experimental purposes."
"You may therefore count on my continued personal commitment in this matter."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Sacconi, ladies and gentlemen, my Group supports the motion for a resolution."
"At the same time, I would like to thank Mr Sacconi for his work."
"REACH, as you have just said, is intended to be the world's best, most dynamic and most advanced chemicals legislation; that is precisely how we envisage it in our Lisbon Process."
"That is why it is also important now that implementation should proceed with the same dynamism and at the same pace."
"We can also help to eliminate a great deal of red tape by streamlining structures and speeding up procedures."
"It is the wish of all parties that animal experiments remain a last resort and that the number of animal experiments be sharply reduced."
"Vertebrates and primates enjoy special protection."
"It is imperative that the validation of alternative and non-animal tests be speeded up and simplified."
"In order to save time, there must be scope for decisions on individual cases, for example."
"Accordingly, implementation must involve the pre-selection of test methods, ranked by quality; in other words, the method that seems to have the greatest likelihood of success would be validated first. It is important that phase-in periods be shortened and that the number of stages in the phase-in process be reduced, that Directors-General be involved in the decision-making process, that our agencies be more closely interlinked, that procedures be transparent and that information, including information to Parliament, be imparted without delay."
"I am very hopeful at the present time, partly because of the content of the letter you wrote to us, Mr Verheugen, along with Commissioners Dimas and Potočnik, that we can make rapid progress in this matter and that REACH really will prove in practice to be the world's most dynamic chemicals legislation."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FI) Mr President, a big thank you goes to Mr Sacconi for having achieved a good result from negotiations on this subject as rapporteur appointed by the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"When the EU's new legislation on chemicals, REACH, was being discussed, one of the greatest public concerns was that it would lead to more tests on animals."
"There was complete consensus among the political groups in the European Parliament on the legislation being established in such a way that everything would be done to minimise the number of animal tests, including the introduction of other, alternative test methods, as much as that was possible."
"We were delighted when there was news from the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) that a number of methods proposed as an alternative to animal experiments had been scientifically validated."
"We were therefore bewildered when the Commission was a long time giving its administrative approval to these same alternative test methods."
"In talks between the Committee on the Environment and the Commission it emerged that the Commission was going to wait for these tests to be approved by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development as a whole, where just one country could torpedo the decision."
"The Committee on the Environment made it very clear to the Commission that such a delay was not acceptable and that we were prepared to exercise our right of veto under the new comitology procedure."
"I am very pleased that the talks that followed between the Committee's appointed rapporteur, Mr Sacconi, and the Commission led to a happy outcome and that the Commission is now committed to speeding up introduction of the alternative methods so as to reduce the number of tests on animals and the suffering that goes with them. This letter by the Commission, signed by Commissioners Dimas, Verheugen and Potočnik, has now also been incorporated into the decision proposal which Parliament is to adopt tomorrow."
"It is very important that the EU is prepared to take decisions itself if the OECD delays the processes."
"Although we might encounter difficulties the end result will be a happy one."
"Mr President, I should just like to add that Mr Sacconi has earned a reputation of trust, efficiency and respect in everything to do with REACH."
"He therefore deserves, and will have, our full support in the present draft REACH test method regulation as well."
"I wish to thank him for all the hard work he has been doing in this field."
"I have received one motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"Animal health strategy 2007-2013 (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Wojciechowski, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on a new Animal Health Strategy for the European Union (2007-2013)."
"rapporteur. ?"
"(PL) The main idea on which the Animal Health Strategy is based is that prevention is better than cure, which is obviously the case."
"I am sure we all recall the problems related to BSE and avian influenza, when it proved necessary to cull millions of animals."
"That was a most unpleasant experience, and I am sure none of us ever wish to see it repeated."
"It did, however, indicate to us that we should improve cooperation at European level in order to improve protection of animal health. The latter is very closely linked to human health, owing to the possibility of direct or indirect transmission of certain diseases from animals to human beings."
"I should like to single out several points in my report for particular attention."
"Firstly, the promotion of better standards for animal health care."
"The report strongly emphasises the close link between the two. It is to be hoped that both will be prominent in future policy."
"The second issue I wish to highlight is fair competition."
"European producers are required to comply with a great many veterinary standards, and with provisions relating to animal health and welfare. The same requirements are not imposed on importers, however."
"This is emphasised very strongly in the report."
"Our producers and those exporting animal products to the European market should all be subject to the same requirements."
"This represents a major challenge to our negotiators in the framework of negotiations at the World Trade Organization."
"My third point relates to strong support for the vaccination programme."
"We believe it is an important instrument with which to reduce the number of cases of disease."
"A new approach is required too. Products originating from vaccinated animals should not be discriminated against on the market."
"A number of paragraphs in the report have been devoted to this matter."
"My fourth point concerns the damages and compensation system."
"Firstly, this should encourage efforts to reduce the risk of disease."
"Secondly, it should cover not only losses directly related to eliminating the sources of disease but also indirect losses related to market crises."
"The fifth point is better control on the Union's external borders. This should not be limited to controlling documents."
"It should involve thorough checks to effectively prevent the illegal entry of animals of unknown origin onto Union territory."
"The sixth point relates to the time of implementation of the strategy."
"I believe we cannot expect to have all these legislative arrangements in place as early as 2013."
"A longer time period is needed."
"The seventh point concerns financing the strategy's aims."
"The draft report criticises the fact that the funding for these ambitious plans is inadequate."
"The plans should be properly financed from the Union's budget."
"In conclusion, Mr President, I should like to say a few words in English, so that I can be faithful to the quotation I shall now refer to."
"(The speaker continued in English)"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I very much welcome the positive and supportive reaction of Parliament to the new Animal Health Strategy."
"We all recognise that animal disease outbreaks can have devastating consequences: they can pose a serious risk to public health; they can damage public confidence in farming in general and in animal products in particular; they can trigger heavy economic costs - just remember that in 2001 the foot-and-mouth crisis cost over EUR 13 billion in the UK alone - and animal disease outbreaks can also lead to animal welfare and environmental problems."
"The strategy responds to a range of challenges taking into account feedback from our extensive stakeholder consultations."
"The European Union of today - with its 27 Member States - looks very different to the embryonic Community of many years ago, when our current animal health framework was taking shape."
"New challenges have arisen, such as avian influenza and the spread of vector-borne diseases like bluetongue, and more are likely to emerge in the years to come."
"Trading conditions have changed greatly, with a massive increase in the volume of trade in and imports of animals and animal products."
"The new strategy recognises and reflects the broad social and economic impacts that animal-related threats can cause - in other words, it is not just about the control of certain communicable animal diseases."
"It features a strong focus on animal-health-related aspects of public health, food safety, animal welfare, agriculture, trade, sustainable development and research."
"The key principle of the strategy is prevention is better than cure."
"Recent experiences have shown the value and effectiveness of a pre-emptive or preventative approach."
"We need to invest more in effective measures to prevent outbreaks, thus minimising the subsequent spread of diseases and hence eliminating or at least reducing their impacts."
"Biosecurity on farms needs to be improved and financially supported; disease eradication and surveillance need to be stepped up; disease awareness and emergency preparedness need to be reinforced."
"There should be a stronger emphasis on vaccination and discriminatory testing."
"The strategy envisages a new legislative framework in the form of a general animal health law to be supplemented by implementing acts of a primarily technical nature."
"Taking a broad holistic view, our legislation needs to be upgraded or developed in a more strategic and coherent manner: clarifying roles and responsibilities; aligning as far as possible with international standards; drawing strongly on scientific advice and the precautionary principle where appropriate."
"The Commission is currently reflecting on the best methodology to define EU priority animal diseases in terms of their impact on human health, society and the economy."
"A study will be launched this year on the development of an EU harmonised responsibility and cost-sharing scheme to be considered in the context of a review of the currently available financial instruments."
"We must also work to stimulate innovation through research and development, through sufficiently funded public-private partnerships."
"Finally, I should mention the Seventh Research Framework Programme, which runs parallel to new strategy."
"This will be important in supporting research into animal health and welfare issues."
"The Commission will in the next few weeks finalise an action plan which will take into account the recommendations and opinions of Parliament as well as those of the Council and the Economic and Social Committee."
"The Commission would be happy to receive further input from Parliament in this regard, notably in the context of the mid-term budget review of 2009."
"Thank you once again for the interest and enthusiasm you have shown for this initiative."
"I look forward to meeting many of the Members of Parliament at the Veterinary Week, an event the Commission is organising with your support as an early step to turn the strategy from words into action."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, perhaps we can be a bit more generous with these two minutes since my predecessor is dropping out."
"I want to thank the Commission for its statement and the rapporteur for his report."
"The big challenge now will be to translate the ambitions in the statement and the report into concrete measures."
"I should like to mention in particular a couple of points that should be considered as far as we are concerned."
"Of course we agree with the Commission that prevention is better than cure when combating animal diseases."
"However, if an animal disease does nevertheless break out, as you have already said, vaccination needs to be a central element of the fight against it."
"We want to prevent situations such as the one in my Member State where there were 26 cases of MCD (Mad Cow Disease) in 2001 and 285 000 animals had to be slaughtered."
"Since there is no difference between products from vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals, the sale of such products needs to be guaranteed, both inside and outside the European Union."
"I would urge the European Commission to keep an eye on this, because it has sometimes gone wrong in the past."
"Obviously supermarkets, processors and consumers need to fulfil their responsibilities in this respect."
"We are also calling on the Commission to make it clear what role the European Union, the Member States and the sector itself need to play in financing the prevention of animal disease, certainly now that this subject is actually part of the debate on the common agricultural policy health check."
"The Member States still have very different arrangements for financing and that might also have an impact on competitive positions."
"We are therefore asking for clarification of those points."
"Obviously exporting countries have to comply with the same requirements as our European producers, for instance on the identification and prevention of animal diseases."
"Finally, I should like to ask the European Commission when it expects to present its analysis of the current transport regulations and how we can restrict the potential spread of animal diseases as much as possible in that area."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, the truth of the matter, Commissioner, is that all of us on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development gave a hearty welcome to the new Animal Health Strategy that you submitted to us, as demonstrated by the many contributions to this report."
"It must be said that this is the largest and most ambitious programme ever submitted in relation to this issue, and I must congratulate you here. However, to tell the truth, I must voice my surprise that the mighty ambition of the arguments has not been accompanied by the required budget planning, for it is obvious that the current veterinary funds will not be sufficient to deal with the new and extremely necessary prevention policies."
"Commissioner, we have just received Mrs Fischer Boel's proposal in relation to the CAP health check, and neither health nor animal welfare are recipients of the funds to be allocated to rural development to deal with the new challenges, contrary to what the services were apparently expecting, or so I was told."
"In other words, the policy we are discussing will not have extra funds, or at least not agriculture funds - as I think you said - until the new financial perspective."
"Commissioner: a budget with no policy is of no use, but a policy with no budget can prove totally sterile."
"If we wish to meet our current objectives, the budget debate must include future application of this strategy."
"Moreover, it is obviously going to be extremely difficult to meet the communication's 2007-2013 schedule."
"Thus I want to ask you whether you can state when the action plan will be ready, and when you think the initial regulations will be adopted."
"As regards amendments, my Group has slightly amended paragraph 29."
"When the right measures are not applied, problems arise regardless of the livestock production system operating in each Member State."
"What is important is that things are done properly."
"We agree with the development of legislative measures to control pets, but we feel finance ought to be earmarked for farm animals."
"Nor do we intend to support the PPE-DE Group's Amendment 29, the objective of which is to rehash a debate that has no place here."
"It was, in fact, the Council that postponed a decision four years ago on animal transportation until 2011, in favour of an agreement on some extremely important matters."
"This is also a controversial issue that requires impact surveys and a solid scientific basis, and I thus wish to reiterate that the amendment is totally at odds with this issue, and my Group will certainly vote against it."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) I should also like to thank the rapporteur for the enthusiasm he has put into his work."
"I think that, with increasing globalisation, we shall need to take more account of outbreaks of infectious animal diseases."
"People travel more and carry products that they are not supposed to and that can cause outbreaks."
"Everyone has already said that better border controls are needed, because prevention is better than cure."
"It always strikes me, when I arrive in the United States or Australia for example, that the border controls there are much stricter than in Europe."
"I wonder why the European Union does not have a similar system to the United States, with everyone being asked to state whether or not they are carrying animal products."
"Only then can we check properly."
"What should happen when infectious animal diseases break out?"
"I think everyone at the moment is already convinced that mass slaughter, as has happened in the past, is no longer acceptable."
"We are going to have to vaccinate and then it has to be possible for the products from vaccinated animals to be sold on the European market and also outside it."
"That is where the problem lies."
"I am not impressed by the attempts the Commission is making to convince supermarkets, consumer organisations and so on that products from vaccinated animals are just as good as those from non-vaccinated animals."
"Products from animals vaccinated against foot-and-mouth disease still have to be marked so that consumers know."
"That seems to be completely unnecessary."
"Therefore an active stand by the Commission is needed."
"Every year up to now, and again this year, we have been used to having a large surplus in the agriculture budget."
"So far we have been able to meet the cost of all outbreaks of infectious animal diseases from the agriculture budget."
"In future the situation could very well be different."
"The new countries are being phased in and the margin in the agriculture budget is steadily becoming smaller."
"Even so, an outbreak will have to be paid for."
"Under European law, that has to be done."
"I therefore think that as soon as possible there must be a scheme for European animal insurance, animal health funds for each country or at European level, and so on. I got a pilot project on that in the budget in 2004."
"All the plans are ready and the Commission must set to work and do something about it as quickly as possible."
"My final point is the transport of animals."
"I am not one of those people who say 'if you transport the animal for so many hours, that is by definition good'."
"Being transported for two hours might be worse than for nine."
"What matters is the conditions in which animals are transported and the Commission must take account of the conditions and not just of the length of time."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I too wish to congratulate our rapporteur."
"I was pleased to support this report in committee and I am pleased to support it now, along with my group."
"I also welcome what the Commissioner has said, and am pleased she is in the Chamber this evening as there is a great deal of common ground between the Commission and Parliament on animal health issues."
"I look forward to working with her and her services in the months ahead, as this dossier moves forward."
"I am pleased the Commissioner highlighted why it is we need a common EU animal health strategy."
"It is quite clear that, in a globalised world, bluetongue does not respect borders or our policies or the differences between countries within the European Union, or indeed the EU's external borders."
"Avian flu and many other diseases can travel around the planet very, very quickly in a globalised world."
"We need to act together in order to deal with them and work out a strategy for remedying them."
"We are exporting our animals - and perhaps their health problems too - and it is clear that we are all in this together."
"I look forward to the rolling-out of the health action plan, which the Commissioner said will be coming in the next few weeks."
"I would refer the House in particular to paragraph 46 of Parliament's report, which acknowledges that the EU is already a beacon of best practice for the world as regards animal welfare and refers in particular to the WTO negotiations."
"I would urge the Commissioner to talk with Commissioner Mandelson to ensure that the WTO negotiations do not water down or compromise the EU's standards, particularly in relation to what are, frankly, substandard imports into the European Union."
"We had many misadventures in the committee over the issue of Brazilian beef imports, for which I am not sure that the system worked as well as it could have done."
"I hope we will not be replicating that situation with the US poultry issue."
"One other animal welfare issue I wish to raise is that of sheep tagging."
"We are supportive of the broad thrust of this measure, but frankly believe that the Commission is going in the wrong direction and is not acting in a proportionate manner to what is actually needed on the ground in order to ensure everything that it requires."
"This is particularly true in the case of the British Isles, where Scotland, England, Northern Ireland and Wales already have a system that works pretty well and effectively protects Europe's animals and their welfare."
"I would be grateful for the Commissioner's thoughts on that, but otherwise broadly support this report and her efforts."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, as I take the floor on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group in the debate on the European Union's Animal Health Strategy, I should like to highlight two issues that I consider to be important."
"Firstly, all the proposals on animal health protection contained in the report by Mr Wojciechowski deserve our support."
"It should be borne in mind, however, that they will result in higher production costs, thus causing European producers to become less competitive."
"Consequently, it is essential for the European Union to require producers from outside the Union wishing to place their products on the Union's market to comply with similar requirements. The European Union should insist on this in talks within the WTO framework and when negotiating bilaterally with third countries."
"Secondly, where animal health is concerned, the common agricultural policy is one of the most integrated areas of European Union policy. That is why I believe it should be a priority when allocating funding from the Community's budget."
"Unfortunately, although the European Commission agrees with most of the provisions contained in the report, it does not want to fund them from the Union's budget."
"In our view, it is essential to guarantee additional financial resources to ensure that the proposals contained in the report can be funded from the European Union's budget."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) I would almost say: how unusual, an animal health strategy from the Commission with the emphasis on prevention."
"That is really terrific, but what a disappointment that animal welfare is only a by-product of the Commission strategy."
"A well-known song in the Netherlands starts with the words, 'An animal is more than a piece of meat and a person is more than a consumer'."
"Unfortunately the Commission is not really singing along with that."
"It is still far too inclined to see animals chiefly as producers of meat, hide, hair, eggs, milk and manure."
"The economic view is still much too dominant and so in my opinion the strategy is too one-sided."
"Fortunately, and I am grateful to the rapporteur for this, his report is already rather better, simply because, unlike the Commission proposal, it does actually contain some real welfare points."
"I shall mention two that I think are very important."
"The recognition that intensive livestock breeding seriously increases the risk of outbreaks and epidemics."
"With the enormous size of the European bioindustry, it is not a question of whether another animal disease will break out, but when."
"It is rightly mentioned briefly that animal transport presents a considerable risk for the spread of animal diseases."
"We therefore have to avoid transporting animals as much as possible, shortening and improving the transport, also because of the enormous distress it causes to the animals."
"This report is not geared as much to animal welfare as I would have wished, but any improvement is something and I shall therefore wholeheartedly support it."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I am very grateful that there is a growing recognition of the need to handle and care for animals properly."
"Good animal husbandry is something that Irish farm families have as a rule practised and I commend them for this."
"However, I would like to stress the necessity for animals and animal products coming into the EU to abide by similar welfare standards to those that the EU requires."
"It is not fair that animal products which may have been produced in the most cheap and cruel ways come into the EU and compete with our own animal products produced in accordance with standards which are strictly regulated; this kind of competition is not only economically unfair, it puts our animals and even our people at danger of the spread of disease."
"A measure discussed in this House which is unrealistic for Irish farmers is the set limit for animal transport."
"While a nine-hour limit between breaks may be reasonable for land transport, it is virtually impossible to abide by this limit for sea transport from Ireland - remember Ireland is an island."
"We depend on sea transport of animals and such a limit would ultimately prevent Irish horse breeders and farmers from shipping animals."
"Thus I would like to propose that we focus more on the quality of travel accommodation of these animals, instead of on the time on board, so that we do not hinder the transportation of animals to and from Ireland."
"Finally, while I was glad to see the new animal health strategy open to all animals within the EU, I would have liked to see more specific mention of the procurement and handling of pet animals."
"I think that many of them suffer in our countries."
"Pet owners are amateurs in many cases and are less likely to know how to handle and maintain their pets, which often leads to an increase in animal cruelty, often unintentional."
"So while we have paid very close attention to the regulation of animals coming into the EU, animal transport etc., we have neglected to look at the plight of pets and strays, an issue often mentioned by my constituents who point out the common occurrence of abuse."
"(BG) Mr. President, I think the rapporteur has produced a very objective and interesting report."
"I would like to draw your attention to several important aspects."
"The first one is this."
"Madam Commissioner, you yourself noted that this policy has been evolving in the EU for quite some time."
"This generates particular problems in the new Member States."
"In Bulgaria, for example, production is fragmented, with many small agricultural producers, small farms operating in difficult conditions."
"People are not well informed, they do not get a clear understanding of their rights and obligations, nor of the existing opportunities."
"In this case, again, there is a kind of discrimination against new Member States which have the obligation, the opportunity to catch up in areas that have been developing for years through constructive efforts within the European Union."
"These specific cases should be treated with special tolerance, so that the things we are discussing, the legislation being made, can take effect in tangible terms, and to ensure that the things written down in statutory provisions can indeed happen."
"People should not be left in the dark about these issues."
"In this context, the issue the rapporteur raises concerning the codification of the legal basis is very important since ordinary people find it hard to delve into complicated statutory acts."
"Codified, consolidated versions of directives and regulations should enable them to gain a good understanding of what they are expected to do with respect to animals."
"Another issue raised was that of financing."
"In the difficult economic situation Bulgaria is in, I have my doubts as to whether many of the farmers will be able to implement the directives successfully unless they receive massive support from the Commission."
"I do not want to repeat what has been said many times in this House, so the Commission should take a close look at these matters because there is the impression that by posing high standards we discriminate against our own farmers."
"The Commission should seriously consider standards to be applied as regards imports."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Wojciechowski very much for his report, and to welcome the Commissioner."
"I also wish to congratulate Mrs De Lange for the hard work that she has put in as shadow rapporteur."
"We are all very conscious that we need a very strong animal health strategy and animal welfare strategy, which is what consumers in Europe are actually demanding."
"However, we must also be careful that imported meat and meat products from outside the European Union also meet our high standards."
"For instance, we would like to see a much higher welfare standard in the poultry industry."
"We want there to be more space for our poultry, especially broilers, and can help to produce broilers in a much more welfare-friendly manner, but at the same time we must be careful that we are not importing products of an inferior nature."
"Also in the case of the poultry industry, there is the banning of crates for poultry and of battery cages, and of course we also import a lot of egg products in powdered and liquid form - nearly 70% of egg products are imported in that form."
"Those products too can be from animals that were not kept in accordance with good animal welfare standards, so we must also be careful on that point."
"I also agree with my Scottish colleague that if we are to bring in traceability and look towards an electronic system, then we must ensure that system is up and running, is cost effective and can actually be properly implemented by farmers without huge costs."
"So while I broadly accept what is a good report, I think we must be careful, as we make progress on standards in Europe, that we also have the same standards for imports."
"(HU) Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Wojciechowski, on his outstanding report."
"It really is a very big problem that the animal health system is not functioning properly with regard to third countries."
"In the WTO we should be endeavouring to ensure that third countries too comply with our high standards of animal health and welfare."
"This is in the interests of Europe's consumers and producers."
"We must protect the health of European Union consumers from imported goods produced according to lower standards."
"EU producers meanwhile face higher costs, putting them at an unfair competitive disadvantage."
"It is therefore especially important that the European Commission's Food and Veterinary Office, the FVO, should conduct an increasing proportion of its on-site inspections in third countries."
"In 2008 the figure was only 30%."
"Food safety is a priority issue."
"The food safety regime within the European Union too faces serious problems at present, while the challenges and the risk of epidemics are greater than before."
"In many places there are not enough suitably qualified veterinarians to monitor compliance with the regulations effectively and regularly enough."
"The tools at their disposal are outdated, often still based on 19th century systems."
"In many Member States, professional training and education are inadequate and recent scandals, such as the 'M.E.G.A. Trade' scandal in my country, Hungary, also demonstrate that multinationals are not being properly monitored with regard to food safety."
"The aforementioned deficits must be remedied."
"I agree with the Commission's strategic ideas and fully support the report. Thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, congratulations to the rapporteur for an excellent report."
"Animal health is important, not just because it is closely linked to human health and environmental biodiversity balance but also because it has a huge farming trade and economic significance, not to mention the social and sports importance of animals, so it would not be an exaggeration to say that animal health is almost synonymous with human health and well-being."
"With this in mind, it is not surprising that a new Animal Health Strategy for the European Union for 2007-2013 is very much needed."
"The report before us tonight is well thought out and balanced in my view and will form a good but rather synoptic basis on which to build our future legislative and non-legislative directives relating to this important matter."
"Let me just take this opportunity to point to a couple of important areas where the Commission needs to clear things up somewhat."
"The report strongly supports vaccination as a fundamental means of preventing disease."
"This is, as far as I know, contrary to current practice with respect to at least one major animal illness, foot-and-mouth disease."
"In the case of foot-and-mouth disease, vaccination in the EU Member States is prohibited as a preventive measure because of the consequent difficulty in identifying infected animals from vaccinated animals when using screening tests for the presence of disease antibodies."
"Is the Commission intending to change its vaccination policy for foot-and-mouth disease in the near future?"
"Furthermore, what is the position of the Commission with respect to the fact that in most third countries animal vaccination against foot-and-mouth disease is not only allowed but encouraged?"
"Will importation of animals from such countries be prohibited if the vaccination policy for foot-and-mouth disease in the EU is not changed?"
"The second area is the lack of necessary implementation of adequate health checks in the increasing international trade of live birds, especially parrots from third countries."
"This is an area which needs tidying up."
"(PT) Any new animal health strategy must pay particular attention to disease prevention, animal feedstuffs, border controls and animal transport."
"All prevention, testing, vaccination and other measures which may allow new outbreaks of animal diseases to be avoided are important in terms of preventing serious damage such as that already suffered due to BSE, foot-and-mouth disease, bluetongue virus and other diseases, because it is food safety and also public health that are at stake."
"It is therefore also important that these principles are taken into account in relation to imported animals, as has already been mentioned today."
"We are hoping that the new action plan just announced by the Commissioner will be implemented as soon as possible in order to improve existing mechanisms by extending technical and human support, guaranteeing financial support and increasing planned budgetary resources."
"This issue must in fact be clarified today."
"(NL) 'Prevention is better than cure' is the motto of the European Commission."
"I fully agree with that."
"Its strategy therefore deserves my support."
"The 'cooperation' and 'communication' principles appeal to me."
"I also think it is a good idea to work on simplifying and clarifying the legislation."
"In particular I want to mention vaccination. I am entirely behind that."
"The mass preventive deaths of healthy animals have to be avoided as far as possible."
"Dutch farmers have had experience of the impact of such measures in the past."
"I emphasise the call in the Wojciechowski report to adopt measures to prevent the erection of trade barriers in that connection."
"Uncertainty about sales outlets for products from vaccinated animals really has to be avoided."
"It is therefore very important for governments to communicate clearly the message that the products are harmless."
"After all, a good vaccination policy stands or falls on the willingness of livestock farmers to take part in these vaccination programmes."
"Animal health and animal welfare are important issues for European citizens, and rightly so."
"I should therefore like to urge that that also be put on the WTO agenda."
"A good strategy cannot be allowed to be undermined by imports from countries that do not have the same animal health and welfare requirements as in the European Union."
"That damages consumer confidence and is bad for support amongst livestock farmers and others directly involved."
"With those comments, I can agree with the proposed strategy and I thank the rapporteur sincerely for his report."
"Mr President, my thanks to the Commissioner and to the rapporteur for the work done."
"Can I just say, on the issue of food imports from third countries which has been mentioned in practically every contribution, that there is a real belief among EU producers that a blind eye is turned to the standards of food produced outside our borders."
"I really believe that unless we have the confidence of our farmers and producers that we are looking after their interests, we will not get their full commitment for measures that we take within the European Union."
"This is a most fundamental point."
"It has already been addressed."
"Take the issue of caged egg production: we will shift it outside of Europe unless we can incorporate standards in the WTO negotiations and at this point we have not achieved our objectives in that regard."
"Moving onto the issues in this report, we know that human health is affected by animal health: 60% of human infections originate from animals and a vast number of the emerging diseases originate in animals."
"It is hard to predict but we do need to address and have a coherent animal health strategy across the European Union."
"The issue of biosecurity is very important and farmers must be involved in preventing disease."
"But can I give you an example: badgers are a protected species under the Berne Convention, so how does a farmer protect himself and his herd against a badger with TB, and who should carry the cost when there is a problem?"
"I worry about moving from cost-sharing to cost-shifting if our concern is the budget we have to spend."
"So we do need to look at these particular issues: in bluetongue, in avian influenza, in foot-and-mouth diseases, we do need stringent border controls and appropriate vaccination programmes."
"And we need to really look at those measures very seriously because the problems are increasing."
"On animal transport, let us base all our measures on science - good science - so that we do not cause problems."
"Let us not react to the emotional part of this debate, but use science as our barometer."
"I do not accept that large is worse than small or small is better than large; I think all animals, whether they are groups of 10 or 100, must be looked after."
"(ES) Mr President, the Commission's new Animal Health Strategy seeks to simplify legislation by implementing a general law to cover all diseases."
"Simplification is always a good thing, provided it does not hinder effectiveness."
"However, since the Commission is suggesting that all sectors involved share the veterinary costs and that the Community cofinancing system for veterinary measures be reviewed, with a hierarchy of diseases in order of gravity, it appears to be more concerned with saving money on the Community budget than with introducing genuine improvements in terms of the eradication of animal diseases."
"The Commission ought to concern itself with implementing proper border controls and making adequate provision for the veterinary fund because animal health, as recent events have shown, is a genuine problem wreaking economic havoc on countries and stockbreeders."
"As regards the welfare of animals in transit, I feel the really important issue is how vehicles are equipped, rather than journey times."
"Here Community regulations already impose a number of requirements concerning ventilation, temperature, maximum density and rest times, among others, to ensure proper conditions of transportation, thereby reducing animal stress to a minimum."
"In any case, however, on the subject of transit times and conditions, we must take account of all the animals, not only those due to be slaughtered at the end of the journey, and apply the same regulations to all of them."
"Finally, I wish to state that I disagree with cloning animals to obtain meat."
"Cloning is a practice which at the present time ought to be restricted to research and experimentation."
"Mr President, the Commission communication states and I quote, 'The concept of animal health covers not only the absence of disease in animals, but also the critical relationship between the health of animals and their welfare.'"
"As rapporteur for the legislation on the maximum residue level of veterinary medicines in food I would like to emphasise that the key to this critical relationship is the adequate availability of authorised veterinary medicines, particularly for what in Europe we call Minor Use and Minor Species (MUMS)."
"And the Commission needs to address this issue urgently."
"The availability of an adequate range of veterinary medicines to treat the wide variety of animal species in the European Community has been a growing challenge over the last two decades."
"During this period considerable efforts have been made by various stakeholders to address the problems of medicines availability."
"Despite these efforts, the situation has continued to deteriorate."
"The lack of authorised medicines poses a real threat to animal health and welfare and the safety of consumers."
"It also poses significant problems for animal owners, farmers, veterinarians and governments."
"These effects include animal health and welfare problems if animals are untreated or treated with unauthorised or an unsuitable product, and zoonotic disease implications from untreated or inappropriately treated animals for animal owners and consumers."
"There are also financial, legal and trade implications for the various stakeholders involved, whilst the lack of medicines may have negative effects on rural communities and agriculture generally."
"Moreover, the current availability problem in the EU not only has implications for the health and welfare of our animals, the security of the Community's food supply, and public health, it also undermines the ability of the EU to meet the Lisbon Agenda and to reap the enormous benefits for European agriculture and aquaculture."
"I therefore call on the Commissioner to commit to incorporating an urgent review of the Veterinary Medicines Directive and address the issue of medicines' availability in the strategy on animal health."
"We should not wait until emerging diseases reach a crisis state; we must amend our veterinary medicine legislation swiftly as the consequences and cost of a major outbreak of a high-impact disease in the EU would far exceed the cost of action now to develop appropriate and adequately available..."
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner Vassiliou, ladies and gentlemen, besides implementing the Lisbon Agenda, one of our objectives is, of course, to live long and healthy lives, which means having a healthy diet."
"To this end we need healthy animals so that we all have the necessary basis for a long and healthy life."
"For this reason, I believe it is very important that we reflect on how we can establish new principles for the food industry which quite simply guarantee food safety, prioritise sustainable production and ensure consumer-friendly prices."
"Europe, as we know, has benefited greatly from international trade."
"The average family in Europe saves EUR 5 000 a year because of international trade."
"We should certainly take that benefit into account."
"(PL) Mr President, the proposed European Union Animal Health Strategy contains well-devised plans."
"This is a sound document, and the reference to the principle that prevention is better than cure is very apt indeed."
"The strategy identifies a number of important issues. These include ensuring a high level of public health and food safety, promoting animal health by preventing the outbreak of animal diseases, and reducing their incidence."
"Other issues dealt with are the promotion of animal husbandry and welfare practices that reduce the risks related to animal health and minimise harmful effects on the environment. In addition, there are references to increasing economic growth, cohesion and competitiveness by ensuring free movement of goods and appropriate animal movements."
"The transport of animals is also covered, as is the increasing risk of disease and the role of vaccines as one of the fundamental methods of preventing disease, which has rightly been emphasised."
"Mr President, I have three quick points to make."
"Firstly, I must express some concern about the creation of a legal framework for a cost-sharing scheme with regard to major disease."
"It would have been far better and more equitable to use some of our traditional under-spend in the budget for a good cause like that."
"I also confess that part of my concern is that a legal framework would be likely to give considerable discretion to Member States as to how much cost-sharing they require of local farmers."
"My fear is that, on the basis of past practice, this would mean it being punitive for farmers within the United Kingdom."
"My second point is that I agree with the call for assistance for farmers to purchase new electronic ID equipment, and I look forward to that being possible under the rural development programme."
"Thirdly, I welcome the focus in the report on EU standards being undermined by imports from third countries."
"That concern, Commissioner, has never been greater than when witnessing Commissioner Mandelson's reckless push for a WTO deal at any price, with scant regard for the future of our indigenous agrifood industry."
"(PL) Mr President, within the European Union we attach great importance to ensuring that food is of an appropriate quality."
"Our quality standards are very high, and rightly so, as the health of human beings is at stake."
"Europe has a highly developed quality control system that mainly relates to the state of animal health."
"Animal breeders from outside the Union frequently fail to meet the animal welfare standards we impose on European farmers."
"A large proportion of imported food is produced in conditions where these standards are not complied with."
"This affects competitiveness and European farmers often lose out."
"I share the rapporteur's view that the animal health protection strategy should be more long term, and that appropriate funding should be ensured."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me thank you all for your very interesting recommendations and your input."
"With the very limited time I have available I will not be able reply to all of them, but let me comment on some of the issues."
"First of all, the time constraints."
"A Member noted that we have time constraints, but let me point out that the first proposal - the general animal health law - that will come into force is scheduled for 2010, not 2013 as was mentioned."
"Another point that was made by several speakers was welfare during transport."
"As I have committed myself already, we are conducting an impact assessment which hopefully will be ready in a couple of months and then, depending on the outcome of the impact assessment, we shall decide how to proceed regarding welfare of animals during transport."
"Now let me turn to budgets."
"Following the recommendation of the European Parliament, the Commission is expected to prepare a detailed budget on the expenditure involved in different programmes of actions."
"This cannot be done in the frame of this action plan as it must follow the relevant budgetary procures."
"The intention is to reflect on proposals during the 2009 budget mid-term review and the Commission will explore the possibility of widening the current veterinary fund and making use of other related funds to finance actions that will have a positive impact on animal health."
"Vaccination is extensively carried out and financed by the Union in many Member States at present, both for bluetongue and for rabies, but I must make it clear regarding foot-and-mouth disease, Mr Matsakis, that we are not in favour of preventive vaccination, though in emergency cases we will of course vaccinate."
"Finally, in answer to Mrs Doyle I would say that the problem of minor use for minor species is taken into account in the Animal Health Action Plan through the Technology Platform project, which comes under the Seventh Research Framework Programme."
"I really heard a lot of interesting comments from all of you and we will have the opportunity to discuss these points more extensively in the near future. Thank you very much for your support."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to thank all those who have taken the floor for their comments and for welcoming this report."
"I now wish to refer to two particular issues."
"The first of these was raised in most of the speeches made. It concerns requiring those exporting animal products to the European market to comply with the same standards and introduce the same requirements as are imposed on European producers."
"This stands to reason."
"As many as nine of the 80 paragraphs in the report are devoted to this matter."
"It certainly represents a major challenge and every possible effort should be brought to bear upon it."
"Today's debate makes that quite clear."
"The Union should give priority to resolving the matter within the framework of the WTO."
"I support everything said in the House today. We cannot condone double standards."
"That is simply unacceptable."
"The second issue I wish to refer to was also raised in some of the speeches made. It relates to transport and is particularly relevant as we are due to vote on Mrs De Lange's amendment tomorrow."
"I should like to say that, as rapporteur, I fully support Mrs De Lange's amendment which proposes limiting the transport of live animals to abattoirs for slaughter to nine hours. This issue has long been the subject of debate in the House."
"I support the limit for humanitarian reasons."
"There are many dramatic reports of what goes on during transport of this nature. There are also financial considerations to take into account."
"After all, someone has to pay for those long journeys."
"If animals are being transported over long distances, from Poland to Italy or from Lithuania to Italy, for example, of course the consumer pays."
"The farmer usually pays too, because for it to be profitable to transport the animals so far, they have to be bought cheaply from the farmer."
"Farmers should not therefore fear this limit, because it will oblige the processing industry to locate itself nearer the places where the animals have been reared."
"I believe it would be in their interest to do so."
"We are debating the increase in food prices."
"These very expensive journeys are one of the factors contributing to the rise in food prices."
"All this merits very careful consideration."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should again like to offer my sincere thanks to you and to all those who took the floor during the debate on this report."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (DE) I very warmly welcome the initiative of the European Parliament to deliver a detailed opinion on the Commission's Animal Health Strategy for the period from 2007 to 2013."
"Clear expectations are important in the context of both human and animal health."
"The motto of the Animal Health Strategy is 'Prevention is better than cure', and preventive inoculation is the best contribution to animal welfare."
"For this reason we strongly urge that sufficient provision be made in future for protective vaccination and for adequate inspections when outbreaks of disease occur."
"In order to guarantee the prevention of animal diseases, care must be taken to ensure that research, science and innovation receive support and that new findings are disseminated."
"The Animal Health Strategy must extend to all animals in the EU."
"For this reason, we need a common legal framework that is less complex, clearer and more transparent than the existing legislation."
"Lastly, biosecurity is an important subject in the context of the Animal Health Strategy; the need for biosecurity begins at the external borders of the EU and concerns all stakeholders."
"The risk of spreading pathogens by importing or bringing animals from other countries into the European Union must be minimised."
"Importers, holidaymakers and consumers must all be aware of their responsibility in this respect."
"The EU has the important task of conducting the requisite inspections so as to ensure that the risk to animal health, and hence to human health as well, is kept as low as possible."
"in writing. - (PL) There is a close link between animal and human health owing to the possibility of transmission of certain diseases."
"Animals are living sentient beings and their protection and proper treatment is one of the most serious challenges facing European countries."
"Animal health is an important issue because an epidemic of animal diseases can cause problems, particularly in rural areas."
"Coordinated action at European and global level is required if the various problems affecting this sector are to be resolved."
"Global warming, increased demand for food, mobility of human beings, trade and the opening of borders all contribute to increasing the threat to animal health."
"Veterinarians have a very important role to play."
"They should become experts in the provision of specialist services such as animal health planning."
"Ensuring biological security on farms, vaccination and scientific research are further steps along the road to tightening up animal welfare standards."
"Another important issue worth emphasising is the impact of undertakings concerned with the slaughter of animals, their transport and also with feed production, because such undertakings have a direct impact on the health and dignified treatment of animals."
"A new strategy and policy should be devised, based on the European Union's single legal framework on animal health and incorporating the standards and guidelines laid down by the World Organisation for Animal Health."
"A key role in the monitoring and promotion of animal health is, however, played by farmers, breeders and animal owners."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"Today's debate is very important because it concerns not only animal health but also, and most importantly, human health."
"The problem has become increasingly serious of late, due to the ongoing rise in imports of meat from third countries."
"It is no secret that the general standards of animal care and feeding in those countries differ significantly from those in Europe."
"The contemporary consumer is entitled to know whether the animals he or she consumes were fed genetically modified plants or not."
"Meat should be clearly labelled accordingly."
"The best way to protect against the spread of dangerous diseases amongst animals is to ensure self-sufficiency in animal breeding within the European Union and to limit farm size."
"Breeding should essentially be an agricultural activity, not an industrial one."
"I congratulate Mr Wojciechowski on his report."
"Strategy for the third meeting of the Parties to the Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (debate)"
"The next item is the oral question by Mr Ouzký, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, to the Commission: Commission's strategy for the third meeting of the Parties to the Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (B6-0157/2008)."
"I would ask all of you present here whether there is any sense in having this debate."
"I think that without the rapporteur present we cannot continue the debate, so I am asking you to give me permission to close the debate today."
"Are there any objections?"
"Mr President, I just want some clarification."
"Do we have a reason why these people are not here, why the rapporteur is not here?"
"Do you have an excuse or some information?"
"The reason is that they are not here with us, and this is the only reason I can recognise."
"We have no idea; we have no secret agents."
"(FI) Mr President, we all know that Mr Wojciechowski, as Chairman of the Committee, is only the formal author of the question."
"I myself have been rapporteur for the Aarhus Convention for many years."
"I have come here from a fantastic asparagus reception specifically to speak on this subject, and I would like to have my say."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"With respect for your fantastic asparagus reception, without the author of the question we cannot proceed."
"I do not know what secret relations you have with the author of the question, but unfortunately we cannot continue."
"I am very sorry, Madam Commissioner."
"(ES) Mr President, I fail to see which Rule of Procedure prevents us from discussing the issue."
"The Commissioner is here, and she certainly deserves our respect."
"I think that all the Members present are ready and willing to debate this matter."
"I fully understand Mr Ouzký's preferences and priorities, and have the utmost respect for them, but at the present time, unless the Rules of Procedure explicitly prevent us from debating the issue, I feel that out of respect for the Commissioner and our fellow Members, we ought to be able to do so."
"I think we are taking this very seriously."
"How can we have a debate without the question, and without the author of the question?"
"With respect for Mr Ouzký's other obligations, he is not with us and he is not presenting the question."
"Although I have a very good imagination, I cannot imagine the answer to the question without the substance of the question, despite the presence of the Commissioner and two main speakers, two distinguished Members of the European Parliament from the PPE-DE and the PSE Groups."
"So if we want to behave in a serious manner, I think we should stop this debate."
"If you want to continue answering the question without the question, that is fine with me."
"So I suggest we close the sitting."
"We will have the opportunity to continue."
"I should like to inform the House that the sitting will now be closed as the author of the question is absent."
"A written reply to the question will be provided."
"Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes"

"European Training Foundation (recast) (debate)"
"The next item is the report (Α6-0131/2008) by Mr Lehideux, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a European Training Foundation (recast) - C6-0243/2007 -."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I want to salute Parliament's work on the proposal to recast the regulation establishing the European Training Foundation and, in particular, thank the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and its rapporteur, Mr Lehideux."
"As you know, the European Training Foundation was created in 1990 to support implementation of the PHARE external assistance programme in the field of vocational training."
"Currently its scope covers the countries of the previous TACIS, CARDS and MEDA programmes."
"The European Union's policies in the education & training and external relations fields have developed and the ETF regulation therefore needs to be updated to take account of those developments."
"The result is the Commission proposal on which you have been working."
"Our proposal does not provide for any new ETF activities."
"Rather, its aim is to define its tasks more clearly on the basis of a broader thematic remit that includes the concept of human resources development, particularly education and training with a view to lifelong learning."
"The proposal also expands the Foundation's geographical scope in line with the EU's new external relations instruments."
"In that new context, the ETF's tasks therefore need to be adjusted, while remaining guided by the clearly established priorities."
"I am grateful to the European Parliament for addressing the Commission proposal in a positive manner."
"Thanks to good cooperation between the three institutions, we have managed to find solutions that satisfy all three of them, including on such sensitive issues as the composition of the Governing Board and the way in which the European Parliament can contribute its specific expertise."
"The Commission therefore accepts without hesitation the consolidated text resulting from last week's constructive trilogue."
"Let me conclude, on behalf of my colleague Jan Figel, by stressing how important it is for our cooperation to be successful, since that will allow the European Training Foundation to benefit from its new legal basis in due time and therefore provide more effective assistance to the beneficiary countries, which is, after all, obviously the purpose of this exercise."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when I was in Turin I was able to appreciate the excellent work done by the Foundation, which is a vital and highly effective instrument to promote the development of vocational training systems in EU partner countries."
"The Commission proposal updates the ETF's tasks and governance to ensure that its activities are founded on a solid legal basis."
"In my view, the compromise reached with the Council offers progress in two essential directions."
"First, the new regulation will enable the Foundation to operate in all the EU's partner countries, including those outside the framework of the Neighbourhood Policy and the pre-accession programmes."
"That is a crucial point."
"For example, the Union takes decisions that have a direct impact on its ACP partners' economy."
"I need not remind Commissioner Michel that this happened recently in the case of the reform of the COM in sugar, which forced those countries radically to diversify their industrial activities."
"The ETF could have made a useful contribution to that development and can do so in future in similar cases."
"The second benefit of the compromise, to which I attach special importance, is that it genuinely involves MEPs in reviewing the Foundation's activities."
"That question, however, goes beyond the framework of this agency."
"Parliament has only one opportunity, often very brief, to look at the way the agencies operate, during the budget and budget discharge votes."
"In my view, it is no longer possible, especially with the forthcoming entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, for Parliament not to be more seriously involved in the matters with which the agencies deal. That is why, in the specific case of this Foundation, Parliament will henceforth nominate three representatives, without the right to vote, true, but three representatives on the Governing Board, provided they are particularly skilled in the Foundation's areas of activity."
"Parliament is free to appoint either external figures or MEPs."
"It will be up to it to take a responsible decision as to the choice of level of representation on the Governing Board."
"The main point at this stage is that henceforth the choice is available and that the debate on Parliament's involvement is launched."
"Given the growing number of agencies, it is imperative for all the European institutions to take a close look at the means of monitoring their activities."
"In that context, I am convinced that we must create a real link between Parliament and the agencies."
"Similarly, the new regulation aims to formalise the hearings of the Director of the Foundation before the parliamentary committees."
"For several years now, that Director has appeared before Parliament once a year at the invitation of the Committee on Employment, but that invitation was not formalised in the past."
"Lastly, the Governing Board will appoint the Director for a period of five years, on the basis of a list of at least three candidates submitted by the Commission; before being appointed the candidate selected by the Governing Board will have to make a statement before the European Parliament's competent committees and answer questions put by members of those committees."
"Let us be honest."
"On the subject of Parliament's involvement the compromise we have reached is rather less than what I would have hoped."
"But we have to look things in the face."
"As the debate stands now, people are not yet ready to go any further."
"So it is reasonable to support the negotiated package so that the Foundation can function as soon as possible on solid bases."
"I therefore ask Members to adopt Compromise Amendment No 11, which is the result of the trilogue Commissioner Michel mentioned a moment ago, to adopt it in its entirety and not give in to the temptation of an amendment that would upset the balance we have achieved."
"I thank the Slovenian Presidency and the Commission for the quality of our dialogue on these matters and, of course, I thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their support."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by expressing my thanks for the constructive negotiations with the Council and the Commission, with the greatest debt of gratitude, of course, being owed to our rapporteur, Mr Lehideux."
"In committee and in the trialogue we reached a compromise for the Foundation in Turin, which is to be put on an entirely new footing by virtue of the new regulation."
"Our main objective in refocusing the Turin-based agency is to strengthen relations between the Foundation and the European Parliament and to improve the overall operational efficiency of the Foundation."
"This Parliament attaches high priority to the promotion of vocational training in Europe, and we believe that we should no longer merely assess the work of the Foundation on an ex post basis, as a kind of auditing body, but that we should have a specific upstream part to play in the process of determining the content and shape of its programmes and that we should be able to contribute our opinions."
"For this reason, we attach great importance to two points."
"The first of these is the composition of the Governing Board, and the second is the procedure for appointing the Director of the Foundation."
"On the latter point we arrived at a sound solution in committee on the basis of a PPE-DE proposal."
"As the rapporteur said, under Article 10 of the new regulation, the Director will be appointed from a shortlist of at least three candidates submitted by the Commission."
"Before being appointed, the candidates are to appear before the competent committee or committees of the European Parliament to make a statement and answer questions."
"A more difficult issue, and one which has not been resolved to the satisfaction of my group in the present compromise, concerns the composition of the Governing Board."
"The arrangement set out in the proposed Article 7, whereby Parliament can appoint three non-voting representatives, is inexpedient."
"We want the chance to be efficient players in the Board's decision-making processes and not mere embellishments."
"We therefore consider it essential that Parliament should be able to send three specialised representatives to serve on the Board, and it goes without saying that they must have the same voting rights as all the other Board members."
"In order to ensure that the Governing Board operates efficiently, we believe it is essential to limit the number of its members."
"We do not see any compelling need for every Member State of the EU to send a representative."
"Instead, we should make do with representatives from two thirds of the Member States, applying the rotation rules prescribed by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"With three representatives each from the Commission, Parliament and the partner countries, the Member States would still be preponderant."
"After all, a governing board is not a meeting of shareholders but is supposed to represent the body of shareholders in day-to-day decision-making and to take rapid decisions."
"May I therefore appeal once again to the Council - whose representative, unfortunately, is not in attendance - to reconsider its position."
"For the sake of operational efficiency, I ask the House to support our Amendment 10."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Lehideux, for his cooperation and work on the report on the European Training Foundation in Torino."
"I have been shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and we have been through some tough negotiations with the Council, but I believe that we have arrived at a good compromise proposal."
"Although the work of this foundation is aimed at countries that are not members of the EU and have therefore not adopted the Lisbon objectives, it is nonetheless meaningful to talk about the objectives in this context."
"After all, the Lisbon objectives are in reality just a way of achieving progress and growth, and one does not need to be a member of the EU to wish for that."
"Education is one of the factors underpinning growth and development within the EU."
"Investing in better education can help to ensure that we in the EU achieve the Lisbon objectives and together make Europe a better place in which to live."
"Another important tool for achieving the Lisbon objectives is flexicurity in the labour market, and education and flexicurity are very closely linked."
"Through education a better and more competitive workforce is created, which in turn enables stronger growth to be achieved."
"It is important that we consider the future of the EU from a long-term aspect."
"Therefore, the European Training Foundation is an extremely important agency."
"The EU must not be a closed club."
"It is important that we help potential new Member States as much as we can."
"We must of course require new Member States to meet certain requirements and standards, but we must also help them to do this."
"I believe that the new structure that we have introduced for the Foundation in Torino is a major advantage for future challenges and I believe that the Foundation can help potential new Member States to join the EU."
"I am also very pleased that the Foundation's new structure reinforces the link between the European Parliament and the Foundation."
"We are gaining the opportunity to appoint three experts to the board."
"This shows that the Council has begun to accept that the European Parliament must also have more influence in this area."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Lehideux for his report."
"I fully share his opinion concerning the extended geographical mandate of the European Training Foundation (ETF)."
"That agency, which works as an instrument of EU external policy, has the potential to respond fully to challenges addressed by territories like Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific."
"The rich experience that the ETF has acquired over the years could now be channelled towards areas that desperately need vocational training in order to improve access to learning and social inclusion."
"Most of the countries in the ACP area are currently facing remarkable economic reforms, and in order to be successful need human resources."
"The ETF should have the mandate and the resources to respond to such demands."
"I would go even further and say that when enlarging the mandate of the ETF, we should plan to have temporary liaison offices in areas where the activities of the agencies are concentrated."
"Such offices would allow the ETF to better organise its activities and would give more visibility to its actions in third countries."
"I fully agree with the proposal of the rapporteur that more transparency is needed, and I fully share his suggestion to add MEPs to the governing board of the agency."
"To conclude, I consider that when it comes to human resources, the European Union should take a broader approach."
"We want to set up the 'blue card' procedure that allows skilled workers from abroad to work legally in Europe, with the EU probably contributing to the training of those skilled workers."
"However, as I have already said, skilled workers are also badly needed in their own countries if there is to be a genuine development of those regions."
"The role of the European Training Foundation will therefore be essential."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by commending the European Training Foundation in Turin for the valuable work it has been performing since 1994."
"The work of the agencies and foundations is often regarded as nothing more than a cost factor."
"I firmly believe that what our Foundation in Turin is doing constitutes very useful neighbourhood aid, whether it be in the Balkans, in Eastern Europe or in North Africa."
"The practical assistance that the ETF gives our partner countries in the development and creation of high-quality training systems can scarcely be prized highly enough."
"May I therefore express my thanks and appreciation to its senior management."
"I must address some frank words of criticism to the Council, whose negotiating tactics, following the achievement of consensus in the first round, involved topping up the Council representation to 27 and then initially failing to understand why we in Parliament also wished to be represented on the Board and then, finally, agreeing to three specialised representatives, but as non-voting members."
"The Council's attitude was simply incomprehensible."
"I can only repeat that the uptight, defensive attitude of the Council Presidency is beyond me."
"It is further proof of the difficulties encountered by the governments of our Member States when it comes to gauging the importance they should attach to the European Parliament, the only democratically elected institution of the Union."
"My thanks go the rapporteur."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, once again the Commission is getting ahead of legislation."
"The EU has no competence over education, at least not until the Lisbon Treaty is ratified, and that depends on the Irish referendum."
"Is the result of that a foregone conclusion, or will a 'no' vote there be just swept aside like the French and Dutch referendums?"
"In any case, what kind of structure will this training foundation have?"
"I see that our proposal is for it to be run variously by six representatives from Member States, plus six from the Commission and only three from Parliament, or that plus representatives from partner countries appointed by the Commission."
"In the latter case, responsibility will partly be in the hands of countries which are not Member States, giving the unelected Commission a major say."
"Hardly democratic."
"Amendment 7 suggests that the Commission would submit candidates for the directorship of the ETF, and this causes concern in many quarters."
"It has resulted in further suggestions as to the make-up of the ETF board, right up to an unworkable one representative for each Member State."
"To have so many counter-suggestions for the composition of the board of the ETF is not exactly the best of starts, but that begs the question: Why does anyone think we need such a foundation?"
"I would argue that a training foundation is not only unnecessary, it will be counterproductive."
"If you care to look round the countries of Europe as opposed to the EU, you will find training programmes of all sorts scattered around."
"There are different standards but, between them, they develop many skills, which is why Europe has such a rich heritage."
"You see, each country has always produced its artists, composers, authors and so on. Even the small countries come up with, for example, composers of world renown."
"Each country produces its leaders and experts, its technicians, bankers, sportsmen and women and all the rest of the range of skills that are enhanced by training."
"So there is a multiplicity of skills, with each country contributing in its own way."
"If we try to put all that together in a European Training Foundation it would drain the life out of the training schemes in many countries."
"A single ETF will not have the intrinsic qualities of national flavour."
"We need variety, not a harmonised one-track theme."
"In short, we will lose more than we gain with such a scheme."
"Please forget it and let the countries of Europe make their contributions to the whole."
"That might even generate enthusiasm for the EU project, for that is sadly lacking, judging by the 'no' votes of two founding states and the continuous efforts being made to sell the EU to its peoples."
"(SV) Thank you, Madam President."
"Let me begin by thanking Bernard Lehideux for his excellent work, for excellent contacts with the President and coordinators during the process and for enabling us to achieve a settlement on first reading."
"I also want to thank the representatives of the European Training Foundation for their input, an important contribution providing many further links."
"Education, vocational training and lifelong learning are increasingly important."
"They are important in the EU, but also in the partnership countries."
"There is a need for cooperation between Cedefop and the European Training Foundation."
"This proposal for a new Regulation contains some elements which make for improvements."
"To begin with, the remit is broadened to include lifelong learning instead of focusing solely on vocational training."
"This is a concept which we increasingly draw upon and which is important in our policy."
"Secondly, the number of countries is increasing, as Mr Lehideux said."
"They include all the partnership countries, not just those included in the neighbourhood and pre-accession programmes, but all partnership countries."
"Thirdly, relations with Parliament are strengthened."
"We have enjoyed good cooperation which can now be developed through the new Regulation."
"I think that we have arrived at a good settlement, both as regards the way we appoint the Director of the Foundation but also as regards the fact that we can appoint three experts without voting rights on the Governing Board."
"We did not get all we wanted, but it is still a good compromise which bodes well for the future."
"It is a good basic position."
"We can develop lifelong learning as a cooperative process between Parliament and the foundations working on these matters."
"That is important."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, first I want to say thank you and to welcome the various statements made here, all of which are in support of Mr Lehideux's report."
"Obviously I also support it because I believe it really is a big step forward."
"I can already see and envisage new prospects that - whatever some may say - are opening here and I am therefore delighted that we will no doubt achieve a broad consensus on this proposal."
"Let me reply to two objections that were put forward."
"First, Amendment 10 to Article 7: I would just remind Mrs Stauner that there is a risk of conflict of interest, since Parliament is the authority that gives the budget discharge."
"Legally, at least, there would clearly be a conflict of interests."
"Secondly, I think it is sensible to separate the powers."
"I was a parliamentarian for many years and I never claimed any responsibilities beyond those due to parliamentarians."
"The fundamental role of a parliamentarian is not to govern, I am sorry to say."
"The fundamental role of a parliamentarian is to scrutinise and to make laws, and of course to monitor governments or executives."
"I do not, therefore, understand that shift in emphasis that some people seem to find normal."
"I am speaking for myself, but we are holding a parliamentary debate and I believe for Parliament to confuse its monitoring task with a governing task, which is incompatible with its role, would detract from its fundamental task."
"That is how a parliament can be destroyed."
"For a parliament to want to become a kind of governing assembly would not be compatible with the high principle of democracy."
"I am saying that because I do believe the separation of powers is important."
"I am convinced that the compromise reached is the most effective one, primarily because it ensures Parliament's independence in carrying out its monitoring function."
"I admit I am often taken aback by some of the views expressed, but then that is what we are here for."
"I believe it was Mr Clark who said the Commission was exceeding its competences and that the European Training Foundation could be counterproductive."
"That is quite contrary to reality, experience and totally independent evaluations of the remarkable work done by the Foundation."
"As Commissioner responsible for development, I can already foresee - thanks to the main amendment, which will no doubt be adopted - the prospects of effectiveness, the positive prospects that will be offered, especially, as some speakers suggested, in countries within my remit where vocational training is a crucial factor."
"I am thinking, for example, of the centre for migration management and information in Mali, a pilot project we will soon be starting up."
"I can imagine what a useful role the Foundation could play there."
"So I can only welcome the outcome, and I totally reject the criticism that it is counterproductive."
"Clearly, people cannot change their nature: those who do not like Europe say exaggerated things and that - let me say with all due respect to the Member concerned - is exaggerated; it is therefore totally meaningless."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, I believe all or nearly all of us take the same view on the substance of the matter and I thank the Commissioner for what he has just said about the future prospects of the Foundation."
"One point obviously remains to be settled and I want to make an observation about it: it is the EPP's Amendment 10."
"Dialogue between the European institutions is absolutely vital."
"That dialogue took place."
"My colleague Mr Kusstatscher says that the Council's attitude during that dialogue was not exactly what we might have expected."
"He is right, but in the end we had the trilogue, we had several meetings, and at the end of those meetings we signalled our agreement."
"I do not believe dialogue between our institutions is possible if, after giving our agreement, we take it back a few days later by tabling an amendment."
"So, we debated, we were not entirely in agreement about everything, everyone took a step towards rapprochement with others and we ended up by achieving a compromise text."
"I am asking the groups, all the groups, to accept the idea that we show solidarity in the decision we have taken, in the agreement we gave to the Council and the Commission at the end of the trilogue and I ask them to reflect that solidarity in their votes."
"When one asks for change one must also know how far one can go."
"I said a while ago that I would have preferred to go a bit further, but that I did not believe everybody was ready for that yet in their minds."
"As rapporteur for this document, having obtained a great deal and been supported in my work by my colleagues, I would ask them to continue to show solidarity regarding our compromise agreement until it is time to vote."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"Statement by the President"
"In response to a proposal from the Working Group on the Middle East, the Conference of Presidents has asked me to make a statement on Lebanon."
"The European Parliament has been following with deep concern the latest political developments in Lebanon, where progress seemed to have stalled and violence and bloodshed had become increasingly rife."
"It is therefore with a great sense of relief and optimism that we welcome the comprehensive and fundamental agreement which has been concluded in Doha by the Lebanese political leaders at a time when the European Parliament is in the process of adopting a resolution on Lebanon."
"There is a compromise text, which will shortly be put to the vote, with Mr Onesta presiding."
"This significant political breakthrough, which was achieved through the skilful and effective mediation of the Arab League, and especially of the Government of Qatar, paves the way for the election of General Michel Suleiman as President of the Republic of Lebanon in the coming days, the creation of a government of national unity and the adoption of an improved electoral law."
"In view of the favourable reaction of neighbouring states and other interested countries, the European Parliament calls on all parties to implement the agreement in full."
"We re-emphasise our unfailing support for the legitimate constitutionally established political institutions in Lebanon and the Lebanese armed forces and for their efforts to guarantee the stability, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon."
"We look forward to resuming normal interparliamentary relations with our Lebanese counterparts, with a Lebanese Parliament that meets regularly, exercises its democratic rights and discharges its democratic obligations."

"The report on China starts with a sentence that says that Parliament 'expresses its sincere condolences and solidarity to the people of China and to the numerous victims; expresses sorrow to all those who are suffering the consequences of the earthquake', but, in the report on Burma, there are only political considerations."
"(The President cut the speaker off.)"

"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"(PL) Mr President, the cost of food is increasing and will continue to increase and there will be increasing problems with food supply."
"There are a number of reasons for the fact that there will be food shortages and that there will be more people needing food, and even starving."
"The first reason is, primarily, the increased population growth in third countries."
"The second is insufficient production of food and poor distribution."
"The third is that various interest groups are playing the markets."
"The fourth is the Common Agricultural Policy, which has resulted in significant reductions in food production in new Member States."
"Until this policy is changed, until we free food production and our reserves, then this, too, will contribute to food shortages and higher prices."
"The fifth reason relates to the various natural disasters over which we have no control, but which, unfortunately, result in great losses and complications."
"There is a single conclusion: the problem of food is the most important problem, as, after all, it affects biological survival."
"It requires full solidarity, not just in the European Union, but also in the entire world."
"For this reason it has my support."
"Mr President, I supported the new paragraph to be added after paragraph 12, which calls on the Commission and Member States 'to acknowledge the EU's dependence on imports of vegetable proteins from third countries', with the very important result of establishing, first, 'workable import rules based on GM thresholds' and, secondly, of reducing 'unnecessary delays in the EU GM approval system'."
"(PL) Recently we have seen a worrying increase in food prices in world markets."
"When food prices rise and, in addition, there is a significant increase in energy prices, this causes increased inflation."
"Politicians and economists are trying to analyse this situation and identify the causes."
"The following seem to be the main factors: changes in the global economy, including higher energy prices, reduced harvests and the production of biofuels."
"Increased demand for food and increased affluence of the inhabitants in fast-growing countries such as India or China have also had an impact on rising food prices."
"Higher food prices affect both producers and consumers."
"Changes in global food markets force us to think seriously about our food security strategy, or perhaps even rethink it entirely."
"What is most important, however, is to undertake steps aimed at improving the situation on food markets, not just by ad hoc activities, but actions that will lead to long-term stability."
"Too little attention has been given to stability in production levels and to maintaining appropriate quantities of reserves, which would limit the effects of fluctuations in production levels caused by climate change or other factors."
"(PL) Mr President, as regards the report on the increase in food prices in the European Union, I voted in favour of amendment 21 and against amendment 28."
"Unfortunately, the voting machine did not react at that point."
"I would, however, like to draw attention to the fact that, in a Europe where children are going hungry, it is unacceptable to have production limits and quotas on food production and I would ask the European Commission to consider this issue again."
"During the parliamentary work there is a report prepared by Mrs Zimmer on poverty in Europe, particularly as regards child poverty, including malnutrition among European children."
"We should not allow this to happen."
"(SK) In 2001 the Council exempted US citizens from the visa requirement."
"Unfortunately, a comparable exemption does not apply to all EU citizens."
"The US still maintains the visa requirement for nationals of some Member States (currently Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania and Slovakia)."
"More than 10% of visa applications are rejected."
"According to the applicants, the process is often based on non-transparent criteria."
"On the one hand, there is the rule that since the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty in 1999 the Council has been responsible for establishing the rules on EU visa policy."
"On the other hand, there is the rule that the US conducts only bilateral negotiations for including countries in the visa waiver programme, since this is in accordance with its national legislation and only individual countries - not international communities - may enter this programme."
"I welcome the European Parliament's resolution on negotiations between the European Union and the United States, which is the result of intense debates in the European Parliament."
"I trust that the resolution will banish all doubts about the legitimate efforts of the new Member States to eliminate the differences between the old and new Member States of the European Union."
"(PL) Mr President, the principles of solidarity, cooperation and non-discrimination as regards nationality are fundamental to the European Union."
"The visa policy of the USA and the accompanying requirements have, however, somewhat shaken these principles."
"Member States are forced into separate negotiations concerning issues that, in large part, fall within the competence of the Community."
"The issue of visa restrictions particularly affects the new Member States which, although they themselves do not apply restrictions or other requirements as regards the United States, cannot, as can be seen, count on reciprocity from that country."
"This issue is not one that can be resolved individually by each country acting for itself."
"What is needed here are detailed regulations covering all EU countries."
"I should point out that if the visa policy of the United States does not change, this will certainly affect transatlantic relations."
"(PL) Mr President, the problem of animal disease is growing and there are several reasons for this."
"The first of these is the increase in the size of farms and the associated concentrations of animals."
"The second is a lack of measures to combat animal diseases effectively."
"We could resolve the first problem by restricting breeding in large farms and herds using legal and administrative means and by introducing a support system for smaller farms, especially family-run farms."
"The second undoubtedly depends on the necessary funds being made available from the European Union budget for combating animal diseases."
"Obviously there are also other very important causes that should not be underestimated, such as: animal transport, unsatisfactory early warning systems, insufficient preventative measures being taken, which includes inoculation."
"Mr Wojciechowski's report speaks of these problems and, for this reason, I voted in favour."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Wojciechowski both on his report and on the outcome of today's vote."
"The Commission's initiative regarding a change in the approach to animal health and the previous strategy have shown unequivocally that it is vital to work on improving regulations in this area, to improve coherence with other policies and to increase legislative effectiveness."
"The new approach proposed in the strategy will make it possible to minimise the risk of infectious diseases breaking out in animals."
"I know this problem very well, also in my capacity as a veterinarian."
"It will also promote growth in the economy, make European farmers and companies more competitive and provide new access to export markets."
"What is more, appropriate standards of animal health and safety are a guarantee of proper trade policy within the Community."
"This policy, which has changed under the influence of a series of severe crises and disease outbreaks that took place over the last few years, has shown that a careful analysis needs to be made of the measures taken to date."
"I believe that, thanks to this proposal, the European Union will promote science, innovation and research to ensure the provision of better measures for combating animal diseases."
"(PL) Mr President, I am sorry to note that, as regards the report of Mr Wojciechowski, the amendment concerning conditions for animal transport did not get through by just ten votes."
"This shows a lack of sensitivity on our part."
"I hope that, in the future, this type of document will be corrected."
"Written explanations of vote"
"in writing. - (PT) Due to the delay in implementing the new structural programmes and subsequently the operational programmes presented by Member States, appropriations totalling EUR 3 525 million from the 2007 EU budget for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) have not been used."
"Part of this amount has already been carried forward to the 2008 budget, but EUR 2 034 million have yet to be used."
"This draft amending budget proposes inter alia to carry part of that unused amount forward to the budget currently in force (EUR 772 million), and to carry the remainder forward to subsequent years."
"Such delays have serious repercussions in implementing programmes, and it is obviously micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and small-scale and family farms, among other examples, that suffer the consequences most, taking into account furthermore the deterioration in the financial and socioeconomic crisis resulting from neoliberal policies."
"What is more, in view of rising food and fuel prices and the downward revision of economic growth in various EU countries, these sums should be used to promote public investment in order to stimulate the economy and bring about an urgent improvement in workers' incomes."
"in writing. - (PL) The second amendment that was introduced into the budget for 2008 contains, as usual, several elements that have no logical connection with each other."
"This is often a characteristic of amending budgets and it makes it more difficult to assess the proposal."
"The basic issue, however, is the quality of the justification provided as well as the proposal's procedural compliance with the Financial Regulations."
"It is completely justifiable to include in the 2008 budget unused ERDF, EAFRD and EFF structural funds (totalling EUR 771.6 million), which corresponds with both the wording and the spirit of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 2006, when we anticipated delays in the implementation of the new Financial Perspective."
"When voting for this budget amendment we can note with some satisfaction that over 500 out of 580 operational programmes for 2007-2013 have already been approved, which means we are passing into the realisation phase in this current seven-year period."
"The Parliament rapporteur also agrees with the modifications to the framework plans of two agencies, namely the European Medicines Agency and the European Maritime Safety Agency, in accordance with the submission from the European Commission, which constitutes a supplementary part of the initial budget amendment proposal no 2/2008."
"This kind of supplement is accepted more readily than the tendency to multiply the EU's executive and regulatory agencies."
"in writing. - (IT) The strategic attempt to revive European competitiveness, proposed in the Lisbon strategy and reiterated recently at the Competitiveness Council of November 2007, has led the EU to intensify its efforts to enhance European potential for innovation and growth in the face of world competition."
"SMEs are the key to a genuine revival of research and development activity because by their very nature they are spurred on towards innovation in their struggle to survive in the marketplace."
"However, access to R&D activities can sometimes be particularly burdensome in economic and bureaucratic terms."
"I therefore endorse this report, which emphasises the need for the EU to apply the 'think small first' principle and to boost the potential for innovation and originality of SMEs, which are still one of the main drivers of the European economy."
"I think that a policy to promote small enterprise should incorporate subsidies and essential aid for research: examples of this are the 'Best' programme, which has facilitated an exchange of best practices between SMEs, the CIP and the 7-initiative policy framework."
"However, I also think it is essential to adopt a series of measures aimed at promoting entrepreneurship, such as reduction of barriers to the internal market, elimination of bureaucratic obstacles and facilitation of bank loans to SMEs."
"in writing. - The Fine Gael Delegation in the EPP-ED welcomes Ms Jordan-Cizeli's report on a mid-term review of industrial policy."
"With regard to paragraph 7 of the report, we acknowledge the right of those Member States who wish to consolidate the European market in defence equipment and improve the global competitiveness of the EU defence industry, on the strict understanding that Ireland's military neutrality (as outlined explicitly in a declaration to the Treaties) is fully respected."
"in writing. - (PT) The European Parliament report, following the communication from the European Commission, moreover, overlooks the enormous social impact of existing industries and perpetuates a neoliberal approach that may guarantee high profits for large enterprises but does not ensure employment with rights and improvements in people's quality of life."
"While it is true that industry in the EU is responsible for over 80% of private sector R&D expenditure and that its innovative products represent some 73% of EU exports, the report in fact advocates the creation of an open and competitive internal market in services and industry."
"This is in the interests only of the large economic groups, since it may jeopardise micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and a high percentage of jobs."
"This in turn may affect the income of workers and many small-scale business people, and therefore their activity as consumers."
"Finally, we also disagree with the strengthening of the role of the EU defence sector, even if this may have an impact on expanding the arms industry."
"Our proposal for progress and social development is consistent with peace rather than war."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of this report because of the importance it attaches to issues that I consider to be fundamental, i.e. the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the European Union."
"Since they represent over 90% of European business, SMEs not only have an economic role within the Union but also a social role because of their significant contribution to jobs and growth."
"Initiatives such as the European Commission's effort to cut the unnecessary bureaucracy faced by these companies by 25% and the promotion of investment in the quality of human resources and in research are therefore to be welcomed."
"The industrial sector in the EU still has great potential for improvement, both in the delivery of research and innovation in business opportunities and in anticipating such opportunities to ensure more rapid adaptation to changes in the market."
"Improving the regulatory framework, particularly as regards patents, so as to facilitate access to the internal market and to foster European entrepreneurship are key factors for increasing our industrial competitiveness."
"In this context it seems to me that the promotion of regional clusters is also very positive."
"A prosperous European industry is obviously crucial for achieving the Lisbon goals."
"in writing. - (PL) Industrial policy is of considerable importance for the realisation of the objectives of the Lisbon strategy."
"It should create the framework for the growth of companies, industrial investment, innovation and the creation of new jobs."
"I am happy that, in this context, special attention has been paid to the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises, which, after all, constitute 99.8% of the companies in Europe."
"It is just these companies that most feel the effects of excessive bureaucracy."
"Calculated on a per capita basis, small companies incur, on average, costs that are ten times higher than those of large companies as regards the responsibilities imposed by legal regulations."
"In addition, SMEs can experience greater difficulties than large companies in accessing markets."
"Let us not forget that it is SMEs, through their innovation and flexibility, that provide a significant boost to economic growth and improvements in the competitiveness of European business."
"For this reason it is extremely important to develop solutions that will help to reduce administrative burdens, increase SME access to the internal market and public tenders and help them respond to new challenges."
"The Small Business Charter that has been announced by the Commission is to include these kinds of proposals."
"I agree with the rapporteur's view that an improvement in regulatory conditions at European level must be combined with commitment from Member States."
"Without national steps to reduce the administrative burden it will not be possible to achieve measurable economic benefits."
"in writing. - (PL) I have decided to vote against report."
"This is yet another document that has signed up to the tendency to create institutions that have no sense to them and which take money from the Community's budget."
"Despite the existence of four structural funds, seven coherence funds, a framework programme and dozens of EU agencies whose only job is to milk the EU's funds, here is another organisation that would most certainly cost the European taxpayer money but, as regards real measures against unemployment or making the lives of employers easier (or at least not making them more difficult), nothing like that is mentioned here."
"in writing. - (PT) What happened today in the vote in plenary session was regrettable."
"The PPE-DE proposed an amendment that questioned and sought to improve the operation of the agreement already reached with the Council and promote knowledge and analysis of national and local labour markets."
"In terms of the Council's interaction with the European Parliament, the amendment sought to ensure that Parliament would be more closely involved in the operation and control of the agreement."
"The approval of the PPE-DE proposal, albeit by a narrow margin, undermined the whole basis of the consensus obtained."
"Contrary to expectations, therefore, a second reading will be required, which means that the report will be discussed again in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, since this is a legislative area subject to the codecision procedure."
"Hence our final vote to abstain."
"in writing. - The European Training Foundation plays a valuable role in the development of vocational training systems in third countries."
"I believe that this Parliament should play a full part in the ETF's functioning and have accordingly been able to support the rapporteur's position."
"in writing. - (SV) Junilistan sympathises with many parts of the report."
"We welcome the development of a peaceful and democratic Lebanon and are keen to see the EU Member States contributing actively to the peace process."
"However, we think that this action should take place within the framework of the independent foreign policies of each Member State, particularly as the political situation in the Lebanon concerns sensitive matters on which the Member State governments extensively disagree."
"The EU should leave it to the United Nations to deal with matters such as these, instead of trying to compete and develop its own foreign policy."
"The United Nations is the international organisation which is best equipped to bring about a lasting settlement of the conflict in the Middle East and to deal with the political situation."
"in writing. - (PT) Recent developments in the situation in Lebanon cannot be analysed in isolation from the deterioration of the situation in the Middle East, where interference, intervention and military occupation by the United States and its allies are escalating with the aim of establishing control over this strategic region."
"Besides whitewashing the Lebanese Government's role in the recent deterioration in the situation in Lebanon, this resolution - whose original proposal was superseded by events - also whitewashes the interference, attempted blockade and pressure exerted by Israel and the USA in this country's internal affairs, examples of which include Israeli military manoeuvres, the stationing of the US Sixth Fleet in the region and the proposed boycott of the Damascus Summit."
"It should also be noted that at the same time as it glosses over the role of the USA and its allies in the region, the EP majority once again points its finger at Syria and Iran."
"The resolution also focuses on political positions whose objective is to meddle in Lebanon's internal affairs, disregarding the fact that the deterioration in the situation in the Middle East is due primarily to Israel's military occupation of Palestinian, Syrian and even Lebanese territory."
"in writing. - The situation in Lebanon is preoccupying."
"The agreement in Doha between the government and opposition leaders has provided the country with an opportunity to hopefully move towards relative peace and stability."
"While the vote is yet to be made on the nomination of General Michel Sleiman as president, signs that all sides are prepared to negotiate are encouraging."
"I believe that the EU should continue to support measures to ensure that we no longer witness the violence and political upheaval suffered by the Lebanese people."
"I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution."
"in writing. - (SV) We have chosen to vote for the resolution, since rising food prices are a problem for the supply of food around the world."
"However, we regret that Parliament turns a blind eye to the fact that the EU's protectionist agricultural policy is contributing to a situation in which large parts of the world do not have a viable food production system."
"in writing. - (FR) The world food crisis (83% price rise), which is currently reflected in hunger riots in the developing countries, and the fall in the most modest European consumers' purchasing power are, in my view, connected with the following:"
"the unprecedented stock market speculation on basic food prices, which is exploiting the tensions and the highly volatile agricultural markets in an unacceptable fashion;"
"the growth in the cultivation of crops for energy purposes, at the expense of essential food crops;"
"the weaknesses of European development policy;"
"the fact that export crops have been supported in the developing countries at the expense of food crops and food self-sufficiency, and"
"the current world trade rules that generate conditions that are particularly unfair to small and medium farmers, especially in the developing countries."
"Over and above emergency measures, when we report on the health of the CAP we must redefine the way we intervene on the world markets (infrastructure, intervention stocks, risk management, prospects and economic modelling of price changes, etc.), reconsider the decoupling of aid and globally rethink our agricultural production models to ensure that they are productive and enduring."
"in writing. - (PT) I must point out a contradiction between this European Parliament resolution and the proposed revision of the common agricultural policy that the Commissioner responsible for agriculture presented here this week."
"It was particularly shocking that the Commissioner should totally disregard the social drama and strong impact of the soaring food prices recorded in recent months - exacerbated by abandonment of the land and the disappearance of many thousands of farms - and push for a cut in the meagre support received by around 70 000 Portuguese smallholders by proposing a minimum threshold while forgetting to indicate a maximum one."
"The negative effect of the last CAP reform is well known, particularly the untying of aid from production."
"It is therefore particularly serious that in the prevailing circumstances the total withdrawal of payments associated with production that still exists has been announced (with the sole exception of suckler cows, goats and sheep)."
"These payments have been transferred to the single payment scheme, at the same time as progress is being made in the gradual dismantling of significant common market organisations and in dismantling the milk quota system, and in withdrawing intervention in areas such as durum wheat, rice and pigmeat, further promoting the abandonment of the land and farming."
"in writing. - I voted for this resolution to support particularly paragraphs 16 and 35 that call for the developed world to clamp down on agricultural subsidies."
"The call by French agriculture minister, Michel Barnier, for Europe to establish a food security plan and resist further cuts in Europe's agriculture budget is ill-thought out."
"After serving on the Parliament's Budget Committee for eight years, where I became well-versed in the anomalies of the CAP, I believe such a move would be counterproductive."
"It would raise world food prices at a time of crisis and do nothing for the long-term health of European agriculture."
"France will soon take over the EU Presidency, and a review of the EU budget is overdue."
"President Sarkozy must grasp the opportunity to begin real reform of the agricultural subsidies within the CAP and allow the EU to fulfil its responsibilities to the developing world."
"The UK Government, on the other hand, was right to call for a trade deal to allow poorer countries greater access to developed world markets."
"This could help the world's 100 million people in poor countries who would otherwise be pushed deeper into poverty."
"However, more must still be done at EU level."
"in writing. - (PT) World economic growth and biofuels policy have created a paradox."
"Given the level of affluence attained worldwide, it is obscene that many families struggle to get enough to eat."
"The market is conditioned by unprecedented concentrations of people in urban areas, abandonment of agriculture for the tertiary sector and the use of basic food products in other complex elements of the food chain, such as livestock."
"Biofuels have introduced a thief into the countryside and an unexpected guest at the table."
"Competition between sources of energy and food is orchestrating their prices."
"We are facing scarcity, sustainability, safety and ecological problems."
"Self-sufficiency policies are adopted in response to the disappearance of strategic reserves and wars are feared."
"Given the restrictions announced on the sale of grain, the size of harvests this year will be crucial."
"Speculation is such that central banks are drawing attention to the underlying risk of inflation, while in India the negotiation of futures contracts on foodstuffs has been banned."
"It is urgent to reverse the situation in favour of farmers, who still do not know what they will harvest, especially the smallest, who are victims of perverse and inconsistent agricultural policies."
"The technology and the science that previously diverged thus have a new opportunity that we will all benefit from."
"in writing. - (PT) Due to pressure from the intensifying worldwide capitalist crisis, the resolution adopted, albeit with limitations, nevertheless represents a condemnation of the consequences of EU agricultural policies, revealing the real and unacceptable objectives of the CAP and of WTO agreements."
"The resolution, however, does not attribute responsibility for the extremely serious current situation, and does not draw the proper conclusions from its diagnosis since it does not call into question the policies underlying it, the following being some examples:"
"It does not make food sovereignty a central issue for ensuring the right to food;"
"It does not see raising small-scale and family farming incomes as an essential prerequisite for the preservation of agriculture, the rural world and food safety;"
"It does not seek to ensure that agriculture is withdrawn from the WTO and that agricultural food products cease to be treated as a simple commodity, and does not seek to have the Blair House agreement reviewed;"
"It does not demand termination of the CAP, no further untying of aid from production, the application of a true ceiling and differentiation in favour of small-scale and family farming, and a fair redistribution between countries and products, promoting the full development of each country's arable and livestock farming."
"in writing. - We have entered into a period characterised by food insecurity."
"Prices have risen dramatically and the demand for food is rising faster than supply."
"A combination of climatic factors (such as prolonged droughts) and the use of grain in the production of biofuels has further aggravated the situation."
"This current state of affairs is particularly worrying in the context of the developing world."
"In poorer countries such as Haiti, food shortages have already led to incidents of riots and civil unrest."
"As this resolution points out, the priority of the international community should be to ensure food autonomy and self sufficiency for developing countries."
"However, rising food prices do not only affect poorer nations."
"The EU must now take action in order to stabilise this situation."
"First and foremost, we should be encouraging our farmers to produce more."
"Moreover, a more sensible balance regarding the use of grain for food supply and energy production needs to be achieved."
"A review of the CAP Health Check would be an ideal forum in which to address these issues."
"in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of the resolution on rising food prices in the European Union and in developing countries."
"This is a problem that affects the whole world."
"There are many causes for this situation."
"They include increased demand for food, rising fuel prices, natural disasters (especially droughts), reduced acreage devoted to plants for human or animal consumption (the price of increasing the area of land designated for so-called energy agriculture) and so on. For this reason I would support the UN's proposal for a moratorium on biofuels."
"What can also be seen is financial speculation on food markets."
"Another contributing factor is the issue of the erroneous and unnecessary quotas that restrict agricultural production, for example the milk quotas that place limits on the production of milk and milk products in Poland."
"Tragic consequences in the poorest countries result in food from our surpluses being given away for free or sold at token prices."
"This kind of aid is only helpful in times of catastrophes and disasters."
"Otherwise it completely destroys their farmers, since it is not worth their while either to grow crops or to keep animals."
"Fast-rising food prices combined with unemployment could also lead to social instability in these countries."
"We recently heard of a dramatic event in Afghanistan, where someone sold their daughter in order to be able to keep the rest of their family with the money."
"We should remember the inflationary effects of rising food prices."
"Let us hope that they do not set in motion a spiralling and sudden increase in all prices."
"in writing. - 850 million people across the world go hungry everyday."
"This crisis requires swift and effective action from the EU and its Member States."
"I join the calls for an impact assessment of the role of retailers in the food chain and the Commission and Member States to analyse discrepancies in prices charged by farmers for their produce and those charged by major retailers."
"Indeed, this crisis is of a global scale and much needs to be done in developing countries."
"We should therefore be focusing on helping developing countries in areas such as agriculture, rural development and agribusiness."
"I voted in favour of the resolution."
"in writing. - (FR) At a time of extremely worrying food price surges it is more necessary than ever for the European Parliament to adopt a resolution."
"Firstly, the food shortage that is rife in many countries in the world is quite rightly unacceptable."
"We need to propose emergency measures to bring an end to the famine that is at this very moment afflicting the most vulnerable people in the developing countries."
"In addition to those emergency measures, which cannot resolve the problem in the long term, the EU must formulate a strategy, in agreement with international organisations such as the World Bank, the IMF, the FAO and the WTO."
"It must be a basic strategy that tackles all the causes of the crisis: changing food habits in Asia, the rapid rise in the cultivation of biofuels, etc."
"Secondly, the worrying rise in the price of the consumer's shopping basket suggests that we should think deeply about reforming the common agricultural policy."
"At a time when we are taking stock of the health of the CAP, we must put forward concrete proposals on means of halting the inflation we are seeing even within the internal market, as also of ensuring that the EU is self-sufficient in food."
"in writing. - When I participated in the election observation mission in Nigeria last April, I came across the shocking fact that Nigeria, once an exporter of agricultural products, had become an importer of food."
"The demographic situation in the developing countries has increased the demand for food drastically, but ongoing military conflicts, the fight against deadly diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis as well as ineffective administration have distracted the governments of developing countries from responding to this need."
"I supported the European Parliament resolution on rising food prices in the European Union and developing countries and hope that the European Union will continue improving its development policies and engage further in fair international trade."
"in writing. - (SV) The resolution on rising food prices in the world could have been a valuable contribution to the current debate on the EU's agricultural policy and its consequences."
"Yet the result was a disappointment."
"In the first part it is noted that the trend is towards increased regulation and renewed stockpiling - despite the fact that the high food prices have for the first time in years made agriculture a truly lucrative sector."
"The second part talks about 'the right to food' in the Third World and the importance of prioritising food over fuel production."
"At the same time, the final result of the voting was scattered on all sides as regards the advantages and disadvantages of biofuels!"
"Politics consists of conflicts over objectives and the main task of a politician is to strike a balance and rank them in order of priority."
"This resolution did not achieve that."
"I therefore abstained."
"in writing. - (DE) The rise in food prices absolutely must be halted, otherwise we are heading for serious difficulties."
"We need multilayered strategies which reinvigorate food production on the one hand by means of measures such as the temporary suspension of set-aside premiums and permit better coordination and distribution of food supplies on the other."
"The poor countries that are hardest hit by rising prices must be given help to overcome the crisis as quickly as possible in a well-organised and, above all, sustainable manner."
"Major exporters of agricultural products, such as Argentina and the United States, must act globally in this respect and must not focus solely on their own well-being."
"In the debate on biofuels, it must not be forgotten that their production in Europe, where fuel crops are grown on two per cent of all arable land, has an extremely minimal effect on food prices."
"Biofuels must not be produced at the expense of food, which is why we must make strenuous efforts to promote the production of a second generation of biofuels, based on biomass, which is essentially organic waste that is virtually unusable for any other purpose."
"in writing. - (PT) Following the implementation of the US legislative reform that reinforced security requirements under the visa waiver programme, the USA decided to propose separate memoranda of understanding to each Member State in an attempt to divide and rule."
"These agreements are unacceptable, not only because they do not respect Community competence in this area, but also because they undermine the principle of fair competition and give rise to unequal treatment between nationals of various Member States where visas are concerned."
"I applaud the granting of a mandate to the Commission (under Community competence) to negotiate an agreement between the EU and the USA ensuring uniform treatment and applying the same conditions regarding visa exemption to all EU nationals who wish to enter US territory (as the Union in fact already applies in relation to all US citizens who wish to enter the EU)."
"These negotiations must be conducted rapidly and in a spirit of European unity, so that in 2009 all Member States will be able to participate in the USA's reformed Visa Waiver Programme."
"I believe that the conditions for this to happen, however, will only exist if the bilateral agreements meanwhile entered into are annulled."
"I therefore await the opinion of the EP legal department, which I hope will confirm this position."
"in writing. - The adoption of the 'Motion for a resolution on negotiations between the European Union and the United States with regard to visa exemptions' is welcomed by the EPP-ED."
"It marks an important step in coordinating activities of Member States and the European Commission in their negotiations with the United States."
"It recognises that discrimination of a large group of EU citizens is unacceptable and shows solidarity on the part of those Member States already in the programme with those who still face inconvenient and sometimes demeaning visa application procedures."
"It draws attention to the fact that reasons for visa refusal are non-transparent."
"A rapid fall in the rate of refusal in some countries and not others creates suspicions that countries outside visa waiver are not treated on the same terms by the United States."
"Representing Poland, a country outside the visa waiver regime, I trust that the resolution will lead to a speedy and satisfactory conclusion of an agreement allowing all EU citizens to travel to the US on the same terms."
"The EU and Member States have made a concerted effort to resolve the problem."
"We are hopeful that the United States will meet this initiative with an open and positive response."
"in writing. - (PT) We understand from this resolution:"
"That although the EU has signed reciprocity agreements with several third countries but not with the US - which is why in 2006 the Commission proposed the temporary restoration of the visa requirement for holders of diplomatic and duty/official passports in order to expedite progress towards reciprocity with that country - the Council did not follow up that proposal, which the resolution describes as symbolic."
"That the situation became legally complicated when the US reformed its visa waiver regime, based on the so-called war on terror, adding security enhancements (including access to data and information on citizens from third countries) to require other countries wishing to be part of the visa waiver programme to sign a bilateral Memorandum of Understanding and its binding implementing rules."
"And that, in the light of the USA's demands, the various EU Member States were divided, ultimately bearing witness to their priorities."
"The resolution is part of a damage limitation effort, though in our opinion it does not safeguard principles that we consider to be fundamental, such as State sovereignty and citizens' rights, freedoms and guarantees."
"in writing. - (PL) I support the European Parliament resolution concerning visa negotiations with the USA."
"These should be on behalf of all EU Members."
"The US government and the governments of those countries that have already embarked on bilateral negotiations should take into account the position of the EU and its competence to sign treaties."
"What is needed are clear guidelines for bilateral discussions about travel to the United States without visas, but there are issues that are in the EU's power."
"What is required here is mutuality."
"Unfortunately, as regards Poland, which unilaterally removed visa requirements for US citizens as long ago as 15 April 1991, the asymmetry is glaring."
"I am not convinced by the argument that this is due to the rather high level of refusals to grant visas."
"In my opinion these refusals are often the result of arbitrary decisions taken by officials in the American consular service who assume - often it is not clear on what basis - that someone would illegally extend their visit to the USA."
"Such assumptions are hardly objective and sometimes simply insulting."
"Also, the exchange rate of the dollar against the zloty no longer supports the argument about illegal work."
"Today what is important to people are tourist visits, business trips and visits to friends and family."
"I believe that the United States also lose out with this policy, closing their frontiers to their allies but letting in potential terrorists."
"How can you develop transatlantic cooperation if there is no trust in your allies?"
"This is not just a rhetorical question."
"Many of my constituents have mentioned this issue."
"in writing. - Europe's citizens have come together to enjoy the benefits of a European Union which can express itself not only in Europe but without."
"Nowhere is this more obvious than in the treatment of its citizens when travelling abroad."
"Visas are already not asked for by the USA for many EU countries."
"Whilst I understand the legitimate right of the USA to make up its own mind on the issue, I feel there is a rational argument in favour of extending this right to all of the EU's citizens."
"I feel that a properly negotiated agreement with the USA should reflect the non-discrimination approach required by the Parliament."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted for the European Parliament resolution on negotiations between the European Union and the United States with regard to the Visa Waiver Program."
"I voted for the oral amendment proposed by the socialist Member of Parliament Lambrinidis, because he requests the exclusion of any form of direct or indirect discrimination among European citizens, including based on nationality."
"Thus, attention is called on the consequences of the lack of coordination between the Community institutions and Member States, in international negotiations."
"I also voted for amendment 8, orally amended by our colleague Gacek."
"The new text expresses the European Parliament's dissatisfaction with the existent situation in which only the citizens of 12 Member States, such as Romania, are not exempted from visa for the United States of America."
"I voted for amendment 1 submitted by the Group of European Socialists, which requests the Commission to guarantee, under the principle of loyal cooperation, equal treatment for all Member States citizens as regards the visa waiver."
"I voted for amendment 2 submitted by the Group of European Socialists because it states that, at the meeting of 13 March 2008 of the Ministerial Troika on Justice and Home Affairs, the US admitted the Community's competence to negotiate an international agreement on visa policy."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted for the joint motion for a resolution on Burma because the dramatic situation in the country makes it essential to restore democracy and ensure respect for human rights as a matter of urgency."
"I regret the Burmese authorities' conduct in response to the cyclone that devastated the country, causing thousands of deaths and displacements, and I strongly condemn the response to this tragedy by the Burmese regime, which has prevented humanitarian aid teams from getting in and has refused assistance for victims."
"in writing. - (SV) The humanitarian disaster which has occurred in Burma is an enormous tragedy, and Junilistan agrees that the handling of the situation by the Burmese Government has been beneath all criticism."
"Aid must reach the hundreds of thousands of stricken people."
"That is priority number one."
"We therefore strongly sympathise with the resolution in its criticism of the Burmese Government, which has put its own power above the survival of the country's people."
"On the other hand, it is not the job of the EU to condemn and exhort other countries to put pressure on Burma to open its borders."
"It is also not up to the EU to call on the International Criminal Court to prosecute the Government of Burma."
"It is the international community which should deal with these crucial questions of international law through the United Nations."
"Unfortunately there is a tendency in the EU to exploit disasters in order to advance its own position in the foreign policy area."
"in writing. - (PT) We would like to express our sincere condolences to the victims of the cyclone on 2 and 3 May that affected various regions of Myanmar (Burma)."
"We firmly believe that every diplomatic effort must be made, particularly within the framework of the UN Agencies, to provide urgent help and support to the victims, to try to minimise the number of deaths, to respond to the problems faced by the people and to begin reconstruction work on the enormous amount of infrastructure that has been destroyed, in cooperation with the Burmese authorities, as the resolution in fact stresses."
"However, we disagree with initiatives which, based on so-called humanitarian intervention, will continue to obstruct and call into question the effort currently being made by the UN Agencies, by ASEAN and by various countries in the region to find solutions to help to overcome the current obstacles and to minimise the suffering of the people affected."
"These initiatives, which unacceptably exploit the dramatic situation of thousands and thousands of human beings, seek primarily to use the humanitarian catastrophe for political purposes and as an opportunity to achieve geostrategic objectives, ultimately compromising the pressing humanitarian aid which they claim is so urgent and necessary."
"In essence, this fosters situations that may add the tragedy of war to the natural tragedy."
"in writing. - I fully support the resolution dealing with the tragic situation in Burma."
"The original natural disaster of the cyclone has now been overtaken by the man-made disaster created by the Burmese Government's response."
"The Burmese Government has a moral and legal duty towards its citizens and must allow international aid in to prevent the situation becoming even more serious."
"in writing. - The tragic situation in Burma demands urgent attention."
"In so far rejecting international aid, the Burmese regime has proven their disregard for the seriousness of the situation at hand."
"For the victims of Cyclone Nargis, this is not an issue of politics, but of survival."
"I join my colleagues in urging the military regime to accept offers of assistance from the international community."
"Indeed, our Asian partners also have a role to play in putting pressure on the regime in Rangoon."
"I reiterate my view that, in encouraging other ASEAN countries to reconsider Burma's membership, Rangoon would encounter strong pressure to finally acknowledge the rights and freedoms that its population have been, and are still, crying out for."
"I join my colleagues in voting in favour of this motion."
"in writing. - (IT) Mr President, I would like to acknowledge the Commission's swift response to the emergency following the earthquake on 12 May."
"According to the newspapers, factories, schools and houses collapsed, in certain areas the earthquake destroyed 80% of buildings, in some towns school buildings collapsed, burying the students inside, and, unfortunately, chemical factories have dispersed tonnes of pollutants into the ground."
"This time we are managing to follow this devastation, in all its harsh reality, in the press and through the statements of the Chinese authorities - who appear to be holding nothing back."
"It is noteworthy that on this occasion, in marked contrast to the madness of the nearby Burmese regime, China is showing an openness to assistance and international aid."
"As the Commissioner has stated on several occasions, Europe must pursue its humanitarian action in the devastated province of Sichuan."
"in writing. - (SV) Aid and money for the people in China who have been hit by this natural disaster are a must in dealing with this tragic situation."
"But the Member States themselves can offer such aid directly to the stricken region."
"Aid does not have to go via the EU."
"Other international organisations are better equipped to coordinate humanitarian aid."
"The United Nations, with its long experience and global reach, is an obvious example of such organisations."
"We consider that this resolution is yet another attempt by the EU to pursue foreign policy and to make use of a disaster in order to take a further step towards a federal state which engages in foreign policy."
"in writing. - (PT) We express our sincere condolences to the victims of the earthquake that struck various provinces and autonomous regions of the People's Republic of China on 12 May, and our solidarity with the people of China, who have shown such courage and mutual support in this time of suffering."
"As has been pointed out, the Chinese authorities have very quickly and efficiently begun the urgent task of providing relief and support to the victims, seeking to minimise the number of deaths, respond to the problems faced by the people and begin rebuilding the huge amount of infrastructure that has been destroyed."
"Hence the need for the various Member States and the EU rapidly to provide resources and emergency aid that will contribute towards the Chinese authorities' huge effort to help the people affected by the earthquake."
"in writing. - I join my colleagues in saluting China's efforts in helping its people following the earthquake in Sichuan province."
"What we are seeing with China is an example to other states in the region faced with the massive destruction caused by such natural disasters."
"I also agree that the EU should be actively helping China with reconstruction efforts."
"I voted in support of the resolution."
"I voted in favour of the European Parliament's resolution on the natural disaster in China."
"Earthquakes are catastrophic events that claim very many lives and cause huge damage to property."
"The Chinese earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.8, has shocked people all over the world."
"This devastating quake has claimed a large number of victims and has created extremely difficult conditions for those who have been affected by it, especially in Sichuan Province."
"I would like to express my deepest sympathy and solidarity with the Chinese people and with the great many victims of this tragedy."
"We welcome the fact that the Chinese authorities reacted swiftly to the disaster by providing emergency relief measures."
"It should be noted that China was also willing to accept offers of aid from external sources."
"Moreover, it is gratifying to see that the Chinese and foreign media were allowed to transmit detailed and accurate information on the disaster."
"According to my estimates, the EU has already provided more than EUR 10 million in aid."
"However, China needs the practical experience of Europeans in this field even more than it needs financial aid."
"The emergency relief measures provided for the civilian population must therefore include tried and tested practices for reducing the impact of events of this kind."
"The EU has to make available the knowledge it has acquired from seismology research so as to help identify the reasons for the inadequate structural stability of buildings."
"The earthquake region of Sichuan must be converted into an open-air laboratory where potential solutions can be tested out and the findings used for the reconstruction of that province."
"in writing. - (SV) A ban on this type of weapon must be implemented on a global basis, through the United Nations, and at the instigation of nation states, not by the European Parliament."
"We are opposed to a common European security policy which will lead to a United States of Europe."
"We have therefore voted against the resolution."
"in writing. - (PT) Being fully aware of the retrospective nature of the resolution, we voted in favour, mainly because of the content of paragraphs 7 and 8, which:"
"Reiterate the call for all EU Member States and NATO countries to impose a ban on the use of depleted uranium, to redouble efforts to achieve a complete ban and systematically to halt production and procurement of this type of weaponry;"
"Call on the Member States and the Council to take the lead in working towards an international treaty to establish a ban on the development, production, stockpiling, transfer, testing and use of uranium weapons as well as the destruction or recycling of existing stocks (even though the EP has unacceptably set conditions on that requirement)."
"However, we must stress that the majority in the EP has avoided attributing responsibility for the use of depleted uranium for military purposes."
"In other words, it seeks to whitewash the crimes committed by NATO and the USA and its allies in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq (where furthermore, besides depleted uranium weapons, fragmentation or white phosphorus bombs have also been used)."
"in writing. - I fully support calls for the establishment of an international treaty to ban depleted uranium weapons."
"The use of these weapons causes fatal diseases amongst both military personnel and the civilian population."
"The EU has a moral duty to take a lead on this issue and work towards the total elimination of these weapons."
"in writing. - EU Member States and the Council must take the lead in negotiating an international treaty aimed at introducing a ban on the development, production, stockpiling, transfer, testing and use of uranium weapons."
"Indeed, I feel that the treaty must not stop there."
"States must not be given the opportunity to continue using old stocks of these weapons whose impact on health and the environment remains, in my view, uncertain."
"Existing stocks must be destroyed or recycled."
"I voted in favour of this resolution."
"in writing. - (PT) This resolution gives continuity to the REACH process, which we abstained from because we felt that it did not meet the legitimate rights and concerns of consumers and of small and medium-sized enterprises, and did not protect workers or the environment."
"We believe that the necessary balance between protecting workers' health, protecting the environment and developing industry was not completely struck because consumer rights were not properly guaranteed, since workers' rights to information and health were restricted."
"Neither did it take proper account of micro and SMEs - since it inevitably increased the cost of registering substances without providing appropriate support - or even of the large enterprises that have now expressed their wish to replace hazardous chemicals."
"Reference is now made to the measures to streamline and speed up the Commission's internal procedures for the validation and regulatory acceptance of new alternative test methods, in which the Commission will provide for a more transparent process involving consultation of all stakeholders in the run-up to any proposal for an Adaptation to Technical Progress of the Test Methods Regulation."
"We maintained the same position, in the expectation that there would in effect be more transparency."
"in writing. - (FR) I supported the Wojciechowski report on a new animal health strategy."
"As an elected Member from the Massif central-Centre district, I am especially worried about the current spread of the epizootic disease of ovine catarrhal fever, which is very serious in terms of duration, propagation, the spread of the various serotypes of the disease in areas that had until then been disease-free and the serious socio-economic effects of restricting animal movements and trade."
"I think the Commission should formulate an animal health action plan to improve its ability to react to such serious animal epizootic diseases by financing research, compensating for losses, giving advances on payments, etc."
"I voted against Amendment 12, concerning the fact that transporting live animals over long distances is likely to increase the risks and that animals intended for slaughter should not be transported for more than nine hours."
"Conversely, I voted for Amendment 3, to the effect that the quality of transport is more important to animal well-being than its duration."
"There is a stringent, specific regulation on this matter and we would be well advised to monitor its implementation."
"in writing. - (PT) We believe the report presents a range of positive measures that must be built upon and which the Commission should take forward, in particular:"
"the need for a substantial Community contribution in respect of major diseases in order to ensure equal treatment and opportunities where these are beyond the resources of the countries and producers concerned;"
"acknowledgement that EU producers face higher costs due to the higher EU standards in place and that they must be protected from imported animal products produced subject to lower standards;"
"the need for the Commission to help farmers cope with the high costs incurred through the procurement of the equipment required to register animals."
"We still have some criticisms, particularly in the area of public funding, which must be stepped up to avoid the establishment of private insurance to remedy losses due to disease eradication."
"We cannot agree with the possibility of farmers being given total responsibility for eradicating diseases by paying for private insurance."
"in writing. - (PT) I support the animal health strategy for 2007-2013, proposed by the European Commission, since I believe the debate among European institutions must be initiated rapidly with a view to drafting future legislative proposals."
"Action at European level must be prioritised, a modern animal health framework must be created, and prevention, monitoring and scientific research must be enhanced."
"I therefore approve the Wojciechowski report, though I must stress as regards restrictions on the transport of animals for slaughter that I am against any type of additional imposition, since existing legislation already contains sufficient provisions to minimise animal suffering."
"in writing. - (SV) This report deals with a very important issue."
"But, as usual, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development proposes increased appropriations from the EU for agriculture in various contexts."
"We are therefore obliged to vote against the report as a whole, although in principle we are in favour of measures to promote better animal health in the Union."
"in writing. - I voted against paragraph 52 of the Wojciechowski report which gives support for the principle of electronic tagging."
"Proposals in this area have not been proportionate and the Commission must rethink its strategy."
"Sheep farming plays a vital role in many parts of rural Scotland and the EU must act in such a way as to protect these rural economies, not impose additional burdens on sheep farmers."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report on a new Animal Health Strategy for the EU because I am strongly in favour of sustainable agriculture and I can only endorse any policy measure or practice that seeks to promote it."
"The health and wellbeing of farm animals are essential in order to ensure public health through the production of healthy food."
"Animal health is closely linked to human health, owing to the possibility of direct or indirect transmission of certain diseases."
"Extremely high stocking densities in intensive farming systems may increase the risk of disease spread and hamper disease control."
"Although I agree that we must promote measures to ensure biological security on farms, we must also ensure that we do not gold-plate the eco-conditionality criteria."
"Nevertheless, I deplore the fact that the Commission Communication does not place greater value on veterinary experts, who, in my view, are the best placed to implement an effective strategy for the protection of animal health."
"in writing. - I welcome Janus Wojciechowski's report."
"The report incorporates measures aimed at improving food safety as well as animal health."
"There have been some calls from our SNP and Conservative colleagues to vote against the mandatory introduction of electronic and DNA-based genetic identification and registration of animals at EU-Level."
"In a time when the threat of outbreaks of new and existing animal diseases is acute and expected to be more so due to climate change, it appears sensible to have a secure and robust animal movement system with such identification and registration methods."
"These views are reflected in the way I voted."
"in writing. - (FR) After heated debate and a large number of amendments tabled in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the Wojciechowski report, as adopted, proposes substantial changes to the Commission's proposals."
"These changes imbue the report with a strong sense of balance and provide an opportunity effectively to amend and improve the legal framework for animal health in the European Union."
"Concerning the issue of high stocking densities in intensive farming systems, the Agriculture Committee's vote has moderated the rapporteur's initial position by recognising that these may prove problematic where inadequate disease control measures are practised."
"In addition, the amendment tabled in plenary on behalf of the PPE-DE concerning long-distance animal transport should enable the EU to limit the unnecessary suffering of animals intended for slaughter, whilst maintaining excellent sanitary conditions."
"The remaining measures proposed in the report, particularly to promote the use of emergency vaccination, to give farmers a greater sense of responsibility and to shed light on the role of all the players in the funding of the future strategy, are a step in the right direction and are an appropriate means of strengthening EU legislation on animal health."
"in writing. - I welcome this report, which highlights the needs for high animal health status in the EU, which can only be achieved by an EU action plan."
"In relation to animal transport, we must only make legislation in this area based on scientific findings."
"Attempts to specify journey times are narrow and ill-focused."
"Attention must be paid to ensuring compliance with existing transport regulations."
"Quality of transportation, not duration is critical."
"This is why I welcome the exclusion from this report of a specific journey time."
"Lastly, the EU must insist that our animal health and welfare standards are accepted internationally and that these concerns are taken into account at the WTO."
"in writing. - This issue is of vital concern for many millions of Europe's citizens, particularly in the south-east of England."
"The most controversial issue has been the transportation of animals which is a function of this report."
"I welcome any impetus which can be given to improving animal welfare during the process of transportation."
"Of course, an element of this is that veterinary surgeons are properly resourced in carrying out checks and can be certain of an enhanced Veterinary Fund to rely on for this activity."
"Similarly, those farmers who deal with livestock transportation should benefit from insurance instruments which protect them for indirect losses."
"in writing. - (PT) The implementation of the Aarhus Convention has been discussed since its entry into force on 30 October 2001."
"Since most of the 35 parties to the Convention are European Union Member States, they have special responsibilities in establishing the mechanisms necessary to implement it."
"It is just as important to guarantee specific provisions - like rights already provided for in the Convention - that improve regional and global public participation in other conventions and treaties that address environment-related issues."
"Parliament and the Council have now adopted three legislative instruments to implement the Aarhus Convention, but difficulties remain."
"Thus although some aspects of the EP resolution are not very clear, in general we support it because we believe it is important to contribute to the creation of universal conditions for access to justice and to processes involving environmental issues."
"We therefore hope that some positive steps will be made in the process in this third session of the Meeting of the Parties, to be held in Riga, Latvia, from 11 to 13 June 2008."
"in writing. - (SV) Junilistan supports the Aarhus Convention, but we think that the national parliaments should determine their various positions on their own account during the conference on the Aarhus Convention in Riga."
"The Member States which have not ratified the Aarhus Convention must of course decide for themselves whether they want to ratify or not."
"In our view it is not for the European Parliament to make recommendations on the matter."
"in writing. - (FI) I have been actively involved in the Aarhus Convention since 2000, when we discussed its first pillar, the right of citizens to information on the environment, and soon after that the second pillar, opportunities for public participation in decision-making."
"When I met local environment activists in Kazakhstan, what seemed obvious in the West took on a new dimension from my standpoint."
"The Aarhus Convention is a major achievement in the aim to improve public participation and access to information rights and is a component in any successful system of democracy, and that is why I well understand Parliament's position in which also the missing element, the right of the public to appeal, should be restored."
"I can sympathise, however, with the Council when it says it fears that citizens' rights could be abused when it comes to lodging an appeal in order to slow down projects or establish a level playing field for fund-raising campaigns staged by organisations."
"The Council is right to be worried about this exploitation of democracy."
"It is important, however, that the issue should be raised once again: the world and our society are changing all the time, and political decisions must stand up to present-day scrutiny."
"It is for this very reason that I like the paragraph in our resolution in preparation for the meeting which states that there is a desire to extend the Aarhus Convention to apply to all the principles of sustainable development."
"This way the criteria for sustainable development are met thanks to the Convention's principles regarding openness, the chance for participation, and accountability."
"This is actually the idea behind the Aarhus Convention: it will generate a wide-ranging and proactive way of thinking about the environment, especially amongst the public, so creating new opportunities for improving existing practices."
"The Riga meeting will be a splendid opportunity for an interim evaluation of the Convention, and I am convinced that this is the way to go."
"in writing. - (IT) Mr President, the Aarhus Convention recognises that every person has the right to live in an environment adequate to his or her health and wellbeing and has a duty to protect the environment, also that in pursuance of that right and in order to fulfil that duty citizens must have access to information, be able to participate in decision-making, and have access to justice in environmental matters."
"Article l of the Convention states that each Party to the Convention shall guarantee the rights of access to information and public participation in decision-making."
"Greater involvement in this process on the part of national and European institutions which represent citizens is of vital importance, both in order to obtain full access to information on environmental matters and, in particular, so as to be able to ensure that the information provided is above all correct."
"Contradictory theories abound, with greater or lesser scientific foundation."
"It is necessary to lay down rules to prevent alarmist and sometimes exaggerated pronouncements and to make environmental protection a duty for everyone, both citizens and institutions."
"On behalf of the UEN Group, which will vote in favour of the resolution, I would like to underline the need for the European Union delegation attending the Meeting of the Parties to the Convention, scheduled for 11 to 13 June 2008, to have as broad a representation as possible from this Parliament."
"in writing. - (PT) Some aspects of the resolution are more important than others."
"Due to their structural importance, some policies condition all the others."
"The following is an example."
"By not calling the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) into question, merely referring to the need not to make development aid available only to countries that accept greater liberalisation of their markets, every positive aspect that might arise out of such aid has been abandoned."
"EPAs set conditions on the sovereignty of countries, impose a model that favours EU multinationals, and make the production of countries conditional not on the many particular needs of their people but, on the contrary, on the requirements of an increasingly liberalised market."
"Therefore, considering it positive that military expenditure should be excluded from the scope of development aid, that effective resources should be devoted to developing and improving public services, that the diversion of aid towards objectives that have nothing at all to do with development should be ceased once and for all, these measures will only be effective if at the same time we reject the liberalisation of trade and the instruments of domination and interference set out in the EPAs."
"Only by overcoming this contradiction will it be possible to establish aid that expresses true solidarity and that respects national sovereignty."
"in writing. - I believe that much can still be done in order to enhance the effectiveness of aid from the EU and its member states, and the report by Johan van Hecke encompasses important insights."
"However, I would like to underline that I do not support the phrasing in paragraph 1 stating that the EU should speak with one voice and more harmonisation is necessary."
"in writing. - (ES) I voted in favour of the report on effectiveness although I do not agree with all of it."
"First, because Member States do not keep their word, which means that all the work carried out by European institutions ends up being worthless."
"Moreover, the report does not show clearly how Member States commit themselves to one role (supporters of partner countries in the implementation of aid) but really perform another (funding only those initiatives that are priorities for their own economies), without paying attention to the social and economic development of the partner countries (orphans)."
"Second, because more effectiveness and transparency is requested when discussing the funding of projects."
"Of course we want effectiveness."
"However, transparency means more audits, more consultations, more controls - in brief, more waste of time and money on bureaucracy, and this slows down rather than facilitates the work of MANY people."
"Transparency therefore reduces effectiveness."
"I would like to see transparency being used as a tool to achieve effectiveness and that the latter always prevails."
"in writing. - I welcome Mr Van Hecke's follow-up to the Paris Declaration of 2005 on Aid Effectiveness."
"The aid system must remain true to its primary goal of reducing poverty."
"Indeed, for aid to be effective it must make use of local systems and fully engage with the recipient."
"I also support the call for the Commission and EU Member States to make significant efforts in meeting the objective outlined in the Millennium Development Goals to devote 0.7% of Europe's GNP to public development aid by 2015."
"I believe that the report reflects these views and I voted in favour."
"in writing. - (PL) The Paris Declaration of 2005 established an international aid effectiveness programme based, primarily, on eliminating poverty."
"The document contains specific obligations that are aimed at increasing aid effectiveness on the basis of international cooperation."
"It would appear that this will be effective aid in the full meaning of these words and that those who require this aid will receive it and will not have to pay for it."
"Unfortunately it does happen that persons receiving 'aid' have to pay for it."
"In many cases this is an instrument to make the weak economically dependent on the strong, and the poor dependent on the rich."
"At the beginning of the sixties an Indian who saw the 'aid' being provided by developed countries to his own country said at a meeting of the World Food Organisation 'for the love of God, stop helping us'."
"I believe that this time things will be different."
"Mr President, I would do almost anything to serve this Parliament, but even I have limits."
"I almost reached my limit yesterday evening when I put the Aarhus Convention debate ahead of asparagus consumption on the famous asparagus evening."
"I 'deserted before dessert', only to find the debate had been cancelled."
"My question is, are we allowed to attach our unused speeches to the minutes of the session, since the answer from the Commissioner is there anyway?"
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"(The sitting was suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"1."
"Sudan and the International Criminal Court (ICC) (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Sudan and the International Criminal Court."
"author. - Madam President, once again we are returning to the topic of Sudan and what can be done to call the Government there to account for the suffering of the people of that country, and indeed for the effects on neighbouring states."
"This afternoon's resolution particularly concerns the International Criminal Court, and the fact that, over a year ago now, two arrest warrants were issued by that Court for Ahmad Haroun, the Minister of the Interior at the time, who is now the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs - which I think many of us find deeply shocking - and also for one of the former Janjaweed militia leaders, Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman."
"We have seen absolutely no cooperation from the Sudanese Government in handing these people over to the International Criminal Court, although that Government is well aware that membership of the United Nations carries with it obligations."
"We are seeing an ongoing culture of impunity, where nobody is ever brought to account, it seems, for the most appalling crimes."
"We consider that all governments should be taking a strong stance on this, and the resolution says that we should be calling on the General Affairs and External Relations Council in June to adopt targeted EU punitive measures against a clearly identified group of Sudanese officials who bear responsibility for this non-cooperation, with that action including clear financial sanctions - it appears that when the cries of people do not work, maybe stopping the flow of money will."
"My group commends this resolution to the House."
"We look forward to firm action and hopefully seeing these men, and others, brought to justice."
"author. - (NL) Madam President, a year ago we also had an urgent debate about Sudan."
"Since then the situation has become worse, not better."
"The agreement between the Islamic north and the non-Islamic south, reached after a long internal war, is under pressure."
"The temporary cooperation in a transitional government and preparation of the referendum on independence for the south in 2011 are under pressure because the borders of those areas have not been finally demarcated."
"Control of the oil-rich middle area is now the cause of further violence."
"Also, the peace settlement does not apply to west Darfur, since Arab nomads and solders have driven out most of the black population to neighbouring Chad."
"This is a conflict not between supporters of Islam and Christianity, but between nomads and the settled agricultural population for control of arid land that produces very little."
"Because of population growth and desertification, the people are losing their traditional sources of livelihood and turning against each other."
"The government is also responsible for driving out the originally non-Arab population."
"There is now fighting from Darfur back as far as the capital, Khartoum."
"Even when what is now Sudan was known as Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, it was debatable whether this huge area with widely differing populations should become independent as a single state."
"A unified state would mainly be the state of the Arab populations in the north, east and centre."
"It would be difficult for the black Islamic population in the west and the black Christians and animists in the south to gain an equal position."
"The regions that were at the time much less developed were far from the sea and were given very little international attention."
"Ultimately no one took any notice of them and we are now seeing the results of colonial shortsightedness."
"The state is responsible for many crimes, but at the same time it is largely an instrument for one of the warring parties."
"That makes it difficult for it to cooperate with punitive measures."
"Obviously we are trying to keep the prospect of that open in the resolution, but in the current situation there is little cause for optimism."
"author. - (PL) It is really shocking that the Sudanese government has appointed Mr Haroun (the former interior minister responsible for Darfur during 2003-2004) as the minister for humanitarian affairs."
"It is a sick joke that he has been given responsibility for the lives and security of the inhabitants of Darfur, when it was the same person who had persecuted them earlier, and that decisions concerning the largest humanitarian operation run by the UNAMID international peace mission are in his hands."
"Let us not forget that the purpose of this mission is to protect civilians from crimes, that is, just the kind of actions that Mr Haroun was involved in."
"The international community, the European Union, the African Union, the UN, the Arab League, all these organisations should put maximum pressure on the Sudanese government so that these people should finally answer to the International Criminal Court."
"author. - (PL) Madam President, Sudan is an enormous country covering an area of 2.5 million square kilometres, with a population of about 42 million people, that has been destroyed by two civil wars that claimed millions of victims and resulted in disability, degradation, and the destruction of property for many more millions of its inhabitants."
"One issue that was at the basis of the fratricidal conflicts was ethnic differences - 52% of the population are African, 39% Arab - and religious differences - 70% are Sunni, 30% are animist."
"During these wars the population experienced all possible atrocities at the hands of those with armaments and power, including murder, torture, rape, robbery and eviction, crimes that are prosecuted and punished by the International Criminal Court."
"Unfortunately the ICC does not have the means to bring the perpetrators to justice."
"The resolution presents the European view as regards the current situation and I support it."
"I do think, however, that in these circumstances it would be worth considering the use of a more radical approach, for example, using UN special forces to take the accused to the ICC, and then imprisoning those found guilty and interning them for life, with no right of return, on some distant island with some telling name such as Evildoers' Island."
"I think that this would help."
"author. - Madam President, the UN estimates that the conflict in Sudan has resulted in about 300 000 deaths and has left approximately 2.5 million refugees."
"Reports of untold acts of barbarism taking place in the region have abounded in recent years."
"The suffering of the innocent civilian population has been extreme."
"Those that allegedly were responsible for instigating or carrying out war crimes or crimes against humanity should face the law and, if found guilty, must be punished accordingly."
"This is not just necessary as a matter of natural justice but also in order to make sure that such individuals are prevented from repeating their crimes and that adequate example is given to other potential criminals to prevent them from carrying out similar crimes."
"The International Criminal Court was formed in order to make sure that those that commit war crimes and crimes against humanity do not go unpunished."
"Sudan has signed the Rome Statute which created the International Criminal Court but has not yet ratified it."
"This is no excuse for not offering this court its full cooperation in according with UN Security Council Resolution 1593."
"The International Criminal Court issued two arrest warrants against Sudan's former Minister of the Interior, Mr Ahmad Haroun, and against the militia leader Ali Mohammed Ali Abd-al-Rahman."
"The warrants relate to 51 counts of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity."
"For more than a year now the Sudanese authorities have refused to hand over these individuals and are thus obstructing the work of the International Court."
"This is absolutely and utterly unacceptable."
"Such behaviour makes the Sudanese Government an accomplice of these alleged criminals."
"We call on Sudan to think again, and think fast, about the grave position they have placed themselves in by protecting these alleged mass killers from the arm of international law."
"We hope they will come to their senses and abide by the request of the International Court immediately."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) It is pretty scandalous when a country that is a member of the United Nations fails to respect calls addressed to it by the Security Council of that organisation for assistance to be provided to the International Criminal Court."
"What can the international community do when the foreign minister in Sudan refuses to provide such help and also declares that the Court has no right to judge any Sudanese citizen and that the Sudanese government will not allow any Sudanese citizen to be tried and sentenced outside of its national courts?"
"We are in quite a difficult situation, since, to a certain degree, Sudan is not dependent on aid either from the European Union or the United States or the other western democracies, but has based its development on assistance from China."
"China, a country that, unfortunately, does not concern itself with human rights, even within its own borders."
"The only reaction that is possible from our side is to ask for the assets of the Sudanese leaders to be frozen."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Since 2003 the conflict in Sudan has claimed 300 000 victims."
"Two and a half million people have left their homes to escape from the violence."
"Despite the partial stabilisation in the country, there are constant clashes between government forces and the rebels, which makes it difficult to use UN peacekeeping forces and to provide humanitarian aid."
"No lasting resolution of the Sudanese conflict will be possible without the involvement of the UN and without the UN increasing the number of soldiers in the region."
"The recruitment of children into the army and acts of violence against the civilian population, particularly against women, are clear breaches of international standards and human rights."
"What is particularly worrying is the failure of the government to cooperate with the International Criminal Court as well as maintaining war criminals in power, who - and this sounds like some sick joke - are now in charge, among other things, of distributing humanitarian aid as well as contacts with the peacekeepers."
"A call should be made to Sudan to start cooperating immediately with the Court in order to deal with the war crimes, since this is a necessary condition for the creation of democracy and the rule of law."
"All attempts to disrupt the peace agreement and the military assistance coming from third countries, for both sides of the conflict, should be condemned."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, since 2003 Sudan has been a battleground due to religious and ethnic differences."
"The conflict in Darfur resulted in the exodus of over two and half million people."
"Civilian victims of this conflict have been murdered, beaten and raped."
"There is widespread hunger and there is a lack of basic hygiene."
"Children, orphaned, lost, have no possibility of education or a decent future."
"Ever more restrictions are placed on humanitarian missions."
"The Sudanese conflict has resulted in a breakdown of civilisation in Darfur and Chad."
"The Sudanese government has refused to cooperate with the International Criminal Court, derides the ICC, which issued arrest warrants for war criminals and is unable, or just does not want to, remedy the situation."
"Following the attack on Omdurman on 10 and 11 May, another 200 people lost their lives."
"We call on the authorities in Sudan to start cooperating immediately with the International Criminal Court."
"We expect the Council of Europe to take decisive steps to block access to European Union banks to those identified as financing conflict in Darfur and to freeze their assets."
"(CS) Having been a participant in the European Parliament's fact-finding mission to Darfur and Chad in 2004, I am a responsible political traveller."
"I was present when a twelve-year old raped mother, when asked her child's name, answered: 'I do not know; the child has no name'."
"Therefore, we call on Sudan to ratify the Rome Statute, to cooperate without delay in accordance with Resolution 1593 and to immediately hand over Ali Kushayb and Ahmad Harun."
"Most of all, though, we are asking Europeans to demand in their negotiations with the League of Arab States, and in particular with China, that China and the League of Arab States apply strict policies in relations with Sudan."
"These are the partners who can help us."
"We would call on the Council and the Commission to keep us informed of their negotiations."
"(ET) Colleagues, Sudan is a country which has exercised its right to be different."
"A country where violence, terror and rape on a large scale are everyday, non-punishable events."
"A country based on values other than human rights."
"The situation is critical: over the five years since the start of the Darfur conflict more than 200 000 people have lost their lives."
"Individuals who have committed crimes against humanity and war crimes live in freedom; some of them have respectable posts in Sudan."
"The judicial system in Sudan is unable and unwilling to tackle the situation in Darfur."
"Reform is needed; the system must be based on internationally recognised human rights norms."
"Impunity must be brought to an end."
"Cooperation on the part of the Sudanese government with the International Criminal Court is desperately needed."
"It must ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and bring war criminals to justice."
"The situation must not change now, it must change right now."
"(PL) Today, as on many such occasions when we have discussed killing and breaches of human rights in the world, we talk about who is responsible over there, on the spot."
"However, it would seem to me that the situation requires deeper analysis since, behind these conflicts, there is always the trade in arms and oil."
"This trade in arms and oil is not organised exclusively by people in those locations, whom we often treat as being worse people, but it is organised by people in the group of nations that have a more developed sense of responsibility and should have a more developed sense of responsibility for others."
"If it were not for the interests of these people then it is very likely that the crimes that we usually discuss on Thursday afternoons, just as today we are discussing Sudan, would not exist."
"Madam President, repeatedly on Thursday afternoons we discuss Sudan because the atrocities against human rights continue: murder, rape, abduction, child abduction and confiscation of property."
"Poor security continues to be a problem for the men, women and children of Sudan, but also for people working in the humanitarian field."
"This disregard of the jurisdiction of the ICC has led to criminals being allowed to walk free, particularly high-profile people like the former Minister for the Interior and a former Janjaweed military leader."
"We must urge Sudan, with all the powers we can, to ratify the Rome Statute."
"I once again adamantly call on the EU and the rest of the international community to exercise moral and social responsibility by taking decisive steps - which include confronting China with the part that it plays in Sudan and the arms trade that keeps this situation going - to protect the people of Sudan and the refugees in neighbouring Chad, and to end this conflict."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, in 2004, the European Union called on the United Nations to set up a Committee of Inquiry into the atrocities and crimes committed in Darfur."
"On the basis of the recommendations made by this Committee, the European Union asked the UN Security Council to refer the situation in Darfur to the International Criminal Court, which the Council did by adopting Resolution 1593 in 2005."
"Over the past few months, the European Union has repeatedly called on the Sudanese Government to cooperate unconditionally with the ICC."
"On 31 March 2008, the anniversary of the Security Council's referral of the situation in Darfur to the ICC, the EU Presidency adopted a Declaration on behalf of the European Union expressing its outrage at the Sudanese Government's failure to cooperate with the Court."
"The European Union also expressed its willingness to support the adoption of new appropriate measures against those persons who bear responsibility for Sudan's non-cooperation with the ICC, should the Sudanese Government still fail to comply with the UN Resolution."
"On 6 May 2008, I attended a meeting between donors and the Sudanese Government - the Sudan Consortium - which was held in Oslo."
"At this meeting, I reminded my Sudanese interlocutors, while addressing the conference, that our development aid is intended to support development in Sudan subject to a genuine democratic transformation taking place in the country, as provided for in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement."
"I emphasised that the principles underlying the CPA must likewise apply to Darfur and that there was an urgent need to restore security, deploy the United Nations Mission and facilitate humanitarian access."
"The recent outbreak of violence in Abyei, a region fraught with complex problems that represent one of the major challenges in the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in Sudan, emphasises the importance of implementing in full the CPA."
"I have just published a press release calling on both parties to comply with all CPA provisions, including the establishment of an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of other armed factions from the town of Abyei."
"The Sudanese Government must know that the international community as a whole will remain faithful to the vision set out in the CPA of a peaceful, stable and democratic Sudan that demonstrates respect for the rule of law and for human rights."
"This message is not directed solely at the Sudanese Government - it must also be understood by the various armed rebel movements whose political cause, whatever it may be, does not justify committing crimes."
"The Court has issued a number of arrest warrants, including one against Ali Kushayb, a Janjaweed militia leader."
"The meeting of the UN Security Council, which will take place on 5 June in the presence of the ICC Prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, may be an important opportunity for the international community to present a united front and to send a strong signal in support of the Court's work."
"The External Relations Council scheduled for late June will most probably address the issue."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - I want to join in condemning Sudan's persistent failure to cooperate with the International Criminal Court (ICC) and to hand over to the ICC Ahmad Harun and Ali Kushayb."
"To date the conflict in Sudan has claimed 300 000 victims and created two and a half million internally displaced persons."
"Yet we continue to deliver aid via Ahmad Harun's Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs."
"I ask the Commission and Member States to cease such deliveries via this ministry, to press the Government of Sudan to remove him from office and to immediately arrest and hand him over to the ICC."
"It is all very well to lecture China on its failure to act over Darfur, but in this case the EU is as weak-willed as the rest."
"2."
"The arrest of political opponents in Belarus (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the arrest of political prisoners in Belarus."
"author. - (PL) Today we are once again discussing breaches of fundamental human rights in Belarus."
"As usual in such cases, we note what it is that dictators do."
"Obviously dictators always battle with organised religion, because, very often, this is the biggest voice that the population has."
"They also always battle with the trade unions."
"As it happens the trade unions in Belarus are rather weak, so, from this point of view, Lukashenko could seem quite a positive figure, as he does not have anyone to fight against, since they have not yet managed to create trades unions there."
"In addition, dictators always fight against the opposition that wants to have democracy."
"However, there is one thing we should also bear in mind: we should remember that Belarus is an important neighbour for the European Union in the East and should be treated as such."
"We have a certain tendency to treat Russia as the only neighbour to the East and forget about the fact that Belarus should also be a partner for the EU in the East, as it is a large country with great promise."
"author. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Lukashenko's regime in Belarus deserves to be criticised for using repressive methods, arresting political opponents, using authoritarian governing methods, censorship and isolation of the country."
"In addition to that, the refusal to grant entry visas prevents Members of the European Parliament and of national parliaments from seeing the situation for themselves."
"All this is highlighted in my Group's motion."
"However, I think that our criticism of breaches of human rights must be measured by absolute criteria, rather than following a political scale of who in the world plays first fiddle at the moment."
"That is not right."
"We keep running around in circles; we have not been able to take a step towards objectivity for millennia."
"The Romans were always right and their chroniclers painted it as a wrongdoing when an attacked opponent was bold enough to defend himself."
"Let me get back to Belarus, however."
"Lukashenko's regime is first and foremost an attempt to disrespect the direction in which the Euro-Atlantic initiatives are going."
"Mr Lukashenko plays in his own narrow field, ignoring the fact that moderate-sized countries cannot behave like that since supranational capital will not allow it."
"If you do not obey, you will be isolated and the international community will support the opposition within the country."
"That is how it works and we all know it."
"Sooner or later Mr Lukashenko and his party machine will pay dearly for acting in this manner."
"Belarus is located in an area that is strategically important for the Unites States and for NATO."
"The present US Administration and the governments of some other countries would very much like Belarus to join NATO, together with Ukraine and Georgia, thereby causing damage to Russia."
"Our worries about human rights in Belarus would not be so intense if, in fact, the real issue was not Russia."
"The question is, however, whether attempts to weaken Russia help the issue of world security."
"I am rather afraid that such attempts may unleash powers that no one will be able to control."
"Russia has been suppressing them for several millennia."
"author. - (PL) Madam President, Commissioner, the Members of the European Parliament who are concerned with the issue of Belarus and who are monitoring the situation in Belarus are faced with contradictory information."
"On the one hand there is the desire that has been publicly and officially declared to normalise relations with the European Union."
"The opening of the representative office of the European Commission in Minsk is a symbol of this desire."
"On the other hand, in the same month, the police brutally attacked demonstrators who wanted to celebrate the nineteenth anniversary of the country's independence."
"The following day the authorities sent KGB special forces to independent journalists."
"A month later the activists were handed down long sentences and this is not even the opposition, just people who dared to demonstrate in defence of citizens' rights and the rights of small businesses, such as Andrei Kim or Sergei Parsukiewicz."
"We have also recently heard that Alexander Milinkiewicz was arrested and fined just for meeting Belarus citizens and for discussing public issues with them."
"Alexander Kazulin, the most important political prisoner, a prisoner of conscience in contemporary Europe, is still in prison."
"Speaking as the chairman of the Belarus delegation I would like to see the day when we can put forward a Resolution to the European Parliament that notes with satisfaction that changes have taken place in Belarus to make that country part of the civilised European Community."
"Unfortunately this will not happen today."
"Without any guarantees for the fundamental rights of free and democratic elections, to express one's political opinions, freedom of the press and freedom to practise one's religion, there is no possibility that the European Union should ever recognise the regime in Belarus as a country with which it is worth cooperating, or as a country that it is worth helping."
"We shall never support the policies that are practised by Alexander Lukashenko."
"We shall, however, support independent citizens' groups and individual citizens from Belarus in their contacts with the European Union in the hope that one day the country will return to normality."
"author. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, the use of force against non-governmental organisations, opposition activists and independent journalists in Minsk and other Belarusian cities at the end of March represents a drastic deterioration of the political situation in a country that is already in the grip of an authoritarian and dictatorial regime."
"The only German political foundation that had been allowed to function in Minsk has had to close."
"Newspaper offices are raided to intimidate critical voices in the press."
"Free elections and freedom of assembly and expression are being severely restricted."
"Opposition politicians are being systematically prosecuted and given lengthy prison sentences."
"The authorities are taking repressive measures against movements within civil society, either by invoking obscure laws on NGOs or anti-extremist legislation or by using force to break up peaceful gatherings."
"We, too, must move to promote the culture of political pluralism in Belarus."
"Encounters with democratic structures, especially for young people, are particularly important for the future of the country."
"The reopening of the European Humanities University in Vilnius, a Belarusian university-in-exile that offers a place of refuge for students who are victims of political persecution, was a wise move."
"The next step must be visa facilitation, for which this House has called on several occasions."
"It is not right that the EU should further restrict people's freedom of movement by charging a fee of EUR 60 to issue a visa."
"That is almost a third of a monthly income in Belarus and is therefore unaffordable for many people."
"What we have managed with Ukraine, Moldova and Russia we should also be able to do with Belarus."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FI) Madam President, Belarus is the only European country which still has a totalitarian administration and where the death penalty is still in existence."
"President Lukashenko continues to keep a watchful eye on civil society and is unwilling to release his tight grip on the country."
"Despite everything, the country's government has said it wants to establish closer relations with the European Union."
"Once again it is time for us clearly to explain to Belarus the terms of cooperation."
"As the resolution states, the basic preconditions for close cooperation in terms of the European Neighbourhood Policy are the abolition of capital punishment, a free media, freedom of speech and assembly, freedom of religion, a respect for democratic values, and the immediate release of political prisoners."
"This resolution calling for the immediate release of the members of the opposition who have been arrested is at the same time a show of support and solidarity for all those who are suffering under the current Belarusian regime."
"Next week members of Belarus's political opposition will come here to Parliament to ask the EU to support a petition rejected by Lukashenko to amend the law restricting freedom of religion which took effect in 2002."
"I hope that this important resolution and next week's joint debate will persuade the Belarusian Government that it is in its own interests and that of the country's citizens."
"on behalf of the PSE. - (ET) Colleagues, on Human Rights Day, 10 December, the television broadcasting station Belsat began operating in Poland with the aim of broadcasting independent information on what is happening in Belarus, Europe and elsewhere in the world to Belarusians."
"The channel, which broadcasts mainly in Belarusian, now reaches some 10% of Belarusians via satellite."
"The station is working under constant pressure."
"At the end of March KGB and police in Belarus carried out a raid to apprehend Belsat's local reporters."
"Their basic tools, i.e. laptop computers and broadcasting technology, were seized."
"Independent reporters live in constant fear of interrogation and arrest."
"The situation in Belarus, an immediate neighbour of the European Union, is as harsh as it was behind the iron curtain."
"As the Chair of the Moldova delegation and an Estonian, I state here that the citizens of Belarus, which was also part of the Soviet Union, today need independent information as much as they need oxygen."
"Belsat is an excellent start, but good television does not come cheap."
"The journalists working for Belsat Belarus are fighting for democracy; they visited us in the European Parliament in March and they need our comprehensive support."
"I call upon the European Commission and all our Member States to support Belsat financially and morally."
"Let us not forget that a free press is the cornerstone of democracy."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (PL) A few months ago Mr Lukashenko freed all political prisoners with the exception of Mr Kazulin, who was offered the possibility of leaving the country."
"This is reminiscent of the methods used by the Communist authorities against the opposition in Poland."
"It seemed that, as a result, the situation could be changing for the better, but, as the hero of Ilia Ehrenburg's well-known story said: 'If they are releasing, it means that they will be putting new ones in'."
"Today the prisons are once again full of prisoners that are in prison because of their political convictions, which they expressed in various demonstrations."
"I believe that there is only one correct response to this, which is to extend the list of persons that are banned from entering European Union countries."
"This list already exists, but the fact that Mr Lukashenko himself cannot come to the European Union is not very convincing."
"We should make the list considerably longer."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, once again we are talking about the situation in Belarus."
"Mr Kazulin, Mr Lukashenko's competitor for the post of President of Belarus, is still in prison, despite being ill."
"The demonstrators who wanted to celebrate the nineteenth anniversary of Belarus's brief independence and were arrested on 25 March 2008, are still under arrest."
"Repression is used against the opposition, and journalists have their property confiscated, they get beaten and exiled."
"Recently Mr Lukashenko expressed the desire to stand again for the Presidency."
"In addition, for the first time, he tried to blackmail the European Union by reminding us that 50% of the oil, 50% of the oil products and 30% of the gas coming to the European Union passes through Belarus."
"This is a reference to the Yamal-Europe natural gas pipeline and the 'Friendship' oil pipeline."
"Despite this, and in fact specifically because of this, the European Union cannot stop acting to defend human rights."
"We should provide support to the developing civilian society in Belarus and this includes material support and access to independent information."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Madam President, in the seventeen years since the changes that took place during the break-up of the Soviet Union and the separation of free independent states, Belarus remains a relic as the last dictatorship in Central and Eastern Europe."
"In this country respect for human rights seems to be very far off."
"Falsification of election results, elimination of political opposition, arrests, beatings, restrictions on freedom of speech and freedom of the press, restrictions on meetings, and, above all, mass surveillance of the population by a highly developed security apparatus - this is the everyday reality faced by the citizens of Belarus."
"I would also like to draw attention to a deterioration in the situation of many people living near the borders, including the representatives of Polish minorities living there, who, after Poland joined the Schengen Area, have found it very difficult to contact their families living in Poland, especially with the high visa costs."
"This situation, which is continuing to be a problem, requires decisive measures to be taken by European countries."
"Consideration should also be given as regards the best methods to be used to provide real assistance to those most in need."
"Madam President, the Belarus regime shows its continued disregard for all the institutional guarantees that are central to a democracy."
"It curtails the freedom to form and join political parties, the freedom of expression, the right to alternative sources of information and the right to free and fair elections."
"The arrest of political opponents in Belarus violates all these basic freedoms."
"The 19th century British politician Benjamin Disraeli once said: 'No government can be long secure without a formidable opposition'."
"As Lukashenko stifles all opposition, let us hope that Disraeli's words prove to be a prophesy for the Belarus regime and that the suppression of the opposition will be the cause of its ultimate downfall."
"(Applause)"
"(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, here in the European Parliament we keep coming back to the problem of Belarus, a country that, in fact, lies in the centre of Europe, looked at geographically, bordering the European Union."
"It is an exceptional country by European standards in that it does not have a liberal democracy or rule of law and it has censorship."
"Today's debate takes place on the anniversary of the Prague Spring in 1968, an anniversary of the moment when, in Europe, people finally said 'enough' to censorship and press controls."
"Today I wanted to devote my speech to just this issue in Belarus."
"We had a very strange hacker attack on independent internet media: on Charter 97, Radio Liberty and the Belarus Partisan."
"What was strange was the hacker attack began the day before the opposition demonstration that was to take place on the anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster."
"The internet media in Belarus are really the only independent media as the majority of the media are completely under the control of the Belarus regime."
"Charter 97 are visited by about 9 000 surfers daily and, in Belarus, over 3 000 000 families are connected to the internet, over 30% of the total population."
"This shows the dynamism and vitality of society in Belarus."
"Commissioner, the European Union must seriously consider what measures to take in order to help the ordinary people in Belarus."
"(LT) When Alexander Lukashenko started to feel the pressure from Vladimir Putin over gas, he declared his desire for closer ties with the EU."
"However, today we can see that this was just empty rhetoric, which was not followed up with respect for human rights, freedom of the press and other European values."
"There was no reaction to the non-paper 'What the EU could bring to Belarus'."
"Political arrests and repressions are continuing."
"The EU should send its experts without delay to observe the preparations for the autumn parliamentary elections, to see how election laws are amended and whether the opposition is given a chance to act."
"We cannot limit it to election observation only."
"That would be a huge mistake."
"Of course, first of all we need to ensure that EU diplomats and parliamentarians are freely allowed to enter Belarus."
"The European Commission and the EU Member States should do everything in their power to achieve this."
"(PL) Madam President, Belarus, being a neighbour of ours, is particularly close to us, especially as many Poles live there."
"It is important for us Poles, as well as for the inhabitants of other neighbouring countries, that there be a stable political and economic situation in the region as this provides the basis for development and improvements in quality of life for our inhabitants."
"We must also remember that, like Poland, Belarus was forgotten about and handed over to Soviet domination after World War II and could not count on any outside assistance."
"However, this country managed to become independent and now can boast of a GDP growth of over 8%, and even 9.9% in the years 2003-2006."
"We do not deny to President Lukashenko the right to choose the political direction that his country takes."
"However, what does concern us is that one hears ever more frequently about breaches of human rights in Belarus, which means infringements of democracy."
"This affects not just Belarus nationals, but also others, which includes Poles."
"For this reason this resolution is a sensible one and has the backing of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group."
"Madam President, we in Europe have come closer to some of the former Soviet States on our eastern border."
"However, Belarus has resisted any attempts at dialogue."
"Because Belarus is a dictatorship, the views of citizens who would like a more open and even westward-looking dialogue have no legal way of being heard."
"When people call for democracy or highlight abuses by the regime, they are faced with imprisonment."
"We must continue to urge the Belarus regime to release the iron grip it has on its citizens."
"One way to do this is to keep the cause of political, social and religious prisoners in the public eye."
"When history looks back, it is those prisoners who will be the heroes of Belarus's freedom when it is finally achieved."
"(DE) Madam President, I believe this is already the ninth time we have dealt with Belarus, and we shall have to keep doing so until Members representing Belarus are sitting with us here in the European Parliament in Strasbourg."
"We urgently need three crucial advances."
"Firstly, we strongly urge the Government of Belarus to release its political prisoners at long last - not only the political prisoners who have already being detained for some time, like Mr Kazulin, but also the many new ones who have recently been jailed for exercising elementary fundamental rights such as freedom to practise their profession as journalists, freedom of expression or the right to demonstrate."
"Secondly, we call for amendment of the Religion Act and for absolute freedom of religion."
"There are European Christians who are being repressed here in the heart of Europe, and we in the European Parliament cannot tolerate that."
"We must therefore resist this with all our might."
"Thirdly, there is an urgent need for us to ensure that Belarus finally opens up to us as Members of the European Parliament and European citizens, that the wall of isolation is breached with which the Belarusian regime has systematically enclosed its people, that we can be present there and discuss matters and that we can help to foster something like a Belarusian Spring, 40 years after the Prague Spring."
"Madam President, our message to Mr Lukashenko but also to the international community is that the European Parliament is and will be persistently concerned about the situation in Belarus, the last dictatorship of Europe."
"This applies especially to the arrests of peaceful citizens on political grounds."
"The regime in Minsk has indicated recently that it would like to improve relations with the European Union."
"However, engaging in any meaningful dialogue has a very normal precondition: releasing all political prisoners, abstaining from arbitrary arrests, ensuring the freedom of expression and independence of the judiciary and allowing normal participation by the opposition in political life."
"Finally, I would like to join the appeal of Ms Mikko in appealing to the EU to expand its political and especially material support for the operations of the independent television station, Belsat."
"This is the real channel to changing the situation in Belarus, not necessarily our resolutions."
"(SK) Dear colleagues, it saddens me very much that the situation concerning democracy, human rights and the rule of law has not been improving in Belarus."
"Alexander Lukashenko's arrogance of power knows no limits."
"The declaration by the Government of Belarus of its intention to improve relations with the European Union is the like totally scorning the democratic world."
"I believe that the symbolic date 25 March 2008, when Mr Lukashenko sent police to fight peaceful citizens of Belarus, will mark the beginning of the end of the totalitarian regime in Belarus, very much like the historic candle manifestation on 25 March 1988 in Slovakia."
"I would like to express my solidarity with the united democratic opposition in Belarus and with all the citizens of Belarus."
"I call on the Council and on the Commission to review the possibilities of lowering Schengen visa fees for citizens of Belarus."
"This is the only way to prevent the citizens of Belarus from becoming increasingly isolated."
"(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, to bring about democratisation and economic transformation, the authorities in Belarus have to enter into dialogue with all political forces including the opposition, and organise free elections."
"The countries of Central and Eastern Europe, among them Poland, can serve as an example."
"In order to transform the awareness of people in Belarus and to show them the principles of democracy and the free market, it is vital to simplify and increase contact between Belarusian society and EU countries."
"This requires considerable simplification and liberalisation in the visa procedure, with reductions in visa payments for the citizens of Belarus."
"European Union countries should open their universities and other institutions of higher learning to students from Belarus and provide them with grants from EU, national, local and private funds."
"The EU should open itself to Belarus, even if the present authorities do not want this."
"(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to add one point to these political and economic concerns."
"As Commissioner Michel understands the importance of education both within Europe and beyond its borders, and I personally deal with students from Belarus, as we educate many of them at the Catholic University in Lublin, I would like to say the following: Commissioner, as much as it is possible, I would recommend increasing both financial and other assistance for this purpose, because investment in the education of Belarusian students will help Belarus itself, and will prove an investment for Europe."
"(PL) Madam President, Belarus, the Belarus of 2008, is a blot on the conscience of all of us."
"It is shameful that, at the beginning of the 21st century, there is a totalitarian state in Europe."
"During our Thursday meetings in Strasbourg we discuss breaches of human rights throughout the world."
"Belarus, however, is the European Union's closest neighbour."
"I have the impression that, up to 1989, western democracies did everything they could to liberate many oppressed countries from Soviet occupation."
"Today, Belarus remains as it was."
"I have the impression that, although there are no longer many countries, but just one, we are doing less."
"We are certainly not doing enough."
"It is clear that we cannot have a direct political and economic influence on what happens in Belarus but we can have an influence on whether independent information, which will stimulate people in Belarus to fight for independence, will be broadcast there."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the positive momentum generated in Belarus by the release of five of the six political prisoners appears to have stalled."
"Regrettably, renewed pressure on civil society and a number of particularly harsh and disproportionate sentences have ruined this positive atmosphere."
"We continue to condemn the political arrests and the way in which civil society and the independent media are being treated."
"At the same time, we must make Belarus understand that we mean what we say when we propose a partnership subject to progress being made with regard to respect for democracy, human rights and the rule of law."
"However, in order to make such progress, Belarus needs to take a number of measures that, for us, are essential."
"These include the unconditional release of all political prisoners, including Alexander Kazulin."
"They also include the holding of parliamentary elections, scheduled for September, which must comply with democratic principles."
"In this regard, we ask that the international OSCE/ODIHR observers be granted unhampered access."
"The Belarusian authorities have informed us of their intention to admit both short-term and long-term observers; we will be sure to hold them to their word."
"Naturally, the presence of observers from the European Parliament would be an additional source of valuable expertise."
"It is also vital that opposition parties participate fairly in these elections."
"We will take into account any suggestions made by Parliament in this regard."
"However, irrefutable evidence that progress has been made would be the presence of opposition in this Parliament, which is not currently the case."
"In that event, the European Union would be ready to respond positively, as it confirmed only last month in a statement relating to sanctions and to the progress that would encourage us to ease these sanctions."
"I shall now address an issue that we feel most strongly about: contacts with the people of Belarus."
"However regrettable the situation in Belarus may be, we must expand our contacts."
"Naturally, restrictions on ministerial-level contacts with the Belarusian authorities are still being maintained."
"Nevertheless, I think that it is necessary to draw a distinction between political and technical levels."
"Accordingly, the Commission is holding meetings to discuss technical issues such as energy, transport and the environment with experts from the Belarusian administration."
"These contacts are obviously a means of getting across various messages on matters about which we feel very strongly."
"The fact that we currently have a delegation in Minsk will also enable us to forge closer links both with the Belarusian administration and with civil society, local NGOs, independent media and students, all of whom we have a duty to assist, as you have rightly pointed out in your report and as several speakers have said."
"In addition, aid is being provided to the European Humanities University, which is currently in exile in Vilnius and will continue its activities there for as long as the University is unable to return to Belarus."
"Finally, I should like to broach a subject that comes up time and time again: visas."
"As you and I are aware, we are unable, as things stand, to open negotiations on the easing of visa restrictions with Belarus - this has been determined by the Council - but this does not prevent us from taking advantage of the discretion enjoyed by the Member States under the Schengen rules as part of their consular prerogatives."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
", in writing. - (IT) Thank you Madam President. We have been here before, unfortunately, with indiscriminate arrests of anyone opposing the ruling regime."
"Too often this Parliament has debated Belarus: so many words, so little meaningful action."
"We should take note of the fact that the Lukashenko regime is openly hostile to the European Union and that our demands in terms of human rights and democratisation in Belarus are falling on completely deaf ears."
"We are stepping up our contacts with civil society and with the internal movements in search of change: the Sakharov prize was the first concrete evidence of this."
"However, there needs to be further progress along these lines."
"I went to Belarus recently and noticed an increased awareness spreading among its citizens in favour of change, a change which guarantees freedom, justice, equity and democracy."
"I call on the Commission to focus particular attention on Belarus, a country which is located in a strategic position for ensuring the peace and security of the entire European continent."

"Rising tension in Burundi (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the rising tension in Burundi."
"author. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, initially, we did not wish Parliament to consider right now the situation in Burundi, for, as you know, the Burundian authorities are currently negotiating with the FNL, the National Liberation Forces; they have reached a critical stage which is finally presenting a positive outlook and which should, we hope, lead to the practical implementation of the agreements entered into in Dar es Salaam that aim to put an end to the fighting, violence and insecurity affecting the country."
"As we now know, the beating of a butterfly's wings in Strasbourg may sometimes unleash a hurricane thousands of miles away."
"On the other hand, not to speak of the situation of this small country that has been orphaned in terms of its development, having been stripped of its natural resources of the kind that often attract donors, would have been unthinkable."
"Therefore, in agreement with the other political groups, we wanted to make this resolution into a call for positive action with regard to this associated country situated in the troubled Great Lakes Region."
"We wanted to reiterate the EU's determination, and especially that of Parliament and of yourself, Commissioner, to seek new solutions for development aid that are more effective in those countries that are weakened by situations of conflict - in this instance, civil war - countries where issues such as the process of democratic reconstruction, the restoration of destroyed public services and the relaunch of policies on matters as fundamental as health and education might be addressed and supported more effectively and more rapidly."
"We wanted this resolution to form part of the action plan that the Netherlands has been asked to develop for Burundi, which has been selected - and we are delighted that it has been so selected - as one of three pilot countries under this new approach."
"Therefore, we have made our wishes clear."
"We want Burundi to become a model of development and, in order to achieve this, we want the authorities of this small country to be provided with the financial resources and support required for civil, political and economic reconstruction."
"Parliament will monitor developments very closely, but it also wishes to call on Burundian MPs from all political groupings to seek, as a matter of urgency, ways and means of bringing their institutions back into operation, after having been prevented from carrying out their work for months, with a view to holding debates and voting, as well as allowing the Burundian Government to implement projects aimed at reconstruction such as the long-awaited reform of the judiciary and that of the healthcare system, among other areas requiring urgent action."
"Finally, we should like to point out that Burundi, one of the world's poorest countries, receives proportionately the least amount of development aid per capita."
"This cannot continue."
"We should like to request that additional financial resources be released quickly to finance priority development programmes and, in particular, the rebuilding of shattered infrastructure."
"Along with the EU, only five Member States are represented in Burundi, a country where everything remains to be done."
"We hope that these countries coordinate their efforts effectively prior to any decision-making in Europe's capital cities and that the delegations on the ground in Burundi entrusted with implementing development policies continue working together and that their staff numbers are increased."
"In conclusion, I should like to emphasise the paragraph in our resolution which refers to the maintenance of, and possible increase in, much-needed humanitarian aid, and I should also like to urge that arrangements for the withdrawal of this aid be made in close association with the stepping up of development policies whose implementation is more complex."
"In this connection, we wanted to make the point so as to ensure that the visibility of the measures taken locally by the Burundian authorities, with the backing of the European Union and the Member States, is properly acknowledged."
"Apart from the resolution of conflict with the FNL and the restoration of greater security, the Burundian people urgently need to see improvements in their country's development reflected in their troubled daily lives."
"author. - (ES) Madam President, the resumption of hostilities in Burundi represents a backward step in what is already a fragile process."
"Dozens of deaths and thousands more displaced people show that the efforts to build peace are, at least for the moment, clearly not enough."
"The responsibility for this state of affairs should be shared."
"It is clearly regrettable that the FNL has taken up arms again, but it has to be said that there have been many allegations of human rights violations by the Burundian Armed Forces and police force."
"It is also clear that instability in Burundi could have important and serious consequences for the region, especially in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda."
"I agree that greater stability has come to Burundi since the entry into force of a new constitution followed by general elections."
"However, this also strengthens the need for the establishment of a peace and reconciliation commission as a confidence-building measure."
"The European Union must support such an initiative financially and logistically."
"It is in this context, and especially considering, as has been said, that the European Union has chosen Burundi as a pilot country for the implementation of a priority Action Plan aimed at increasing the speed and efficiency of assistance, that I think this resolution deserves special consideration."
"Not only by the European Commission, but also, and fundamentally, by Member States, and especially two of its proposals."
"First, the proposal to increase the financial resources that the European Union grants to Burundi, notably on the occasion of the mid-term review of the tenth EDF."
"Second, that within the framework of the much-needed action plan, priority support should be given to programmes for better governance and democratic state management; health policies, through the creation of health centres and the renewal of the hospital network; the decision by the government of Burundi to provide free primary education; and the continuing efforts to renew the country's infrastructure."
"author. - (NL) Mr President, just like Sudan, which we were discussing earlier this afternoon, Burundi is an ethnically divided land, with long-standing disharmony between the various population groups."
"The resulting problems are much harder to solve in Burundi than in other African countries."
"It is difficult to draw a geographical border between areas that are typically the territory of different ethnic groups."
"It is more akin to the caste system that traditionally existed in India."
"Even before the German and Belgian colonisation, the Hutus were in the majority in Burundi and Rwanda and the Tutsis were in the minority."
"The Tutsis, who are also recognisably different in appearance from the Hutus, were the rulers."
"The Hutus were under their control."
"In the European colonial period attempts were made to change that situation, but not with a view to equality and equal rights for the Hutus."
"At the time the main aim was to play the two ethnic groups off against each other in order to make the Dutch or Belgian administration stronger."
"Even after independence, a lasting solution was never found to the old differences."
"Burundi was spared the massive campaign by the Hutu majority in neighbouring Rwanda to the north to wipe out the troublesome Tutsi minority."
"However, that might also be due to the fact that emancipation amongst the Hutus was less widespread"
"When we speak in the resolution about 14 years of civil war, peace negotiations, the opposition movement FNL, the disarming of rebels and the fighting that broke out again on 17 April, we have to be aware of the background and the unresolved problems."
"The main purpose of the resolution is that the violence should stop and that agreement must be reached."
"I agree with that, but on that point in particular I see little cause for optimism."
"The resolution also calls for European support for democratic government, education and health care."
"We can contribute to that ourselves."
"author. - (PL) Madam President, Commissioner, we are very pleased to hear of the reopening of negotiations and peace talks between the National Liberation Forces and the government in Burundi."
"This is not the first attempt by the rebels and the government to come to an agreement."
"We are hopeful that the agreement will bring an end to the bloody conflict."
"This conflict has not just resulted in innocent victims, but, first and foremost, is destabilising the delicate balance and is increasing tensions in the country, which saw positive results following the peace accord in 2003."
"After many years of conflict in Burundi, the country is trying to rebuild itself and to return to the international arena and has been achieving some success."
"What is even more of a paradox is the fact that the problem being experienced by Burundi at present is not caused by Hutu-Tutsi tribal conflict, but has been brought about by a single, very radical, Hutu-FNL wing, which did not accept the peace accord and is still trying to fight the coalition government, which also includes the Hutu."
"The international community should give its support to the peace agreement and bring about an end to the conflict."
"author. - (PL) We are once again discussing crimes committed in various countries around the world and we will continue these discussions endlessly, until the European Union has a common foreign policy."
"What is more, a joint foreign policy can only be effective if the European Union has a military force."
"The Lisbon Treaty, which creates something like a foreign ministry, will not resolve the problem, since there will be no military force."
"In his time, President Lech Kaczyński said that the European Union should have its own army."
"Recently, President Sarkozy also spoke about this."
"I believe that this issue should be on the agenda for public debate in the European Union."
"There should be specific proposals for political solutions and, consequently, legal solutions."
"Without military force there can be no foreign policy."
"If the integrity and the strength of the EU are important to us, then the European Union has to have its own army in order to be able to intervene in situations such as the one in Burundi."
"author. - Madam President, Burundi has been in a precarious state for a number of years."
"The scenes of barbarism that took place in the 1990s between the Hutus and the Tutsis will always remain deeply embedded in our minds and will always seriously disturb our conscience."
"Numerous attempts by the international community, as well as by regional players, have not yet resulted in the much desired long-lasting peace and stability in the area, although it has to be said that much progress has been achieved."
"The recent military confrontations between the national defence forces and the National Liberation Front have resulted in the loss of innocent lives and are most disturbing."
"Both sides must realise that they must resolve their differences at the negotiating table and not on the battlefields."
"Both must realise that violence will only bring more violence."
"The rebel group must denounce violence and lay down their arms, but at the same time the Government of Burundi must cease to provide impunity and to cover up for criminals within the security forces who carry out torture and illegal detention."
"Let us hope that common sense will prevail at last and that the main sides involved in this brutal internal fighting in Burundi will manage to resolve their differences peacefully for the sake of the safety and well-being of the people of their country."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, in my mind's eye I see a beautiful country."
"I see people struggling to emerge from the aftermath of the civil war atrocities."
"I see those memorials to the violence."
"I see poor people struggling to cope."
"I see Bujumbura closed at night, as one tries to get back in before the curfew because of the violence."
"I see the health problems, the malaria, the respiratory and hygiene problems."
"I see the refugee camps - people returning, not quite knowing where their homes were, people coming back from Tanzania and people coming across from Kivu in the Congo."
"And now again of course we see the violence, the FNL breaking their agreements."
"We again see the allegations of torture and rough treatment."
"Burundi needs our help."
"It also needs self-restraint if it is never again to slip down that slope of intolerance and inhumanity."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, we regret the recent clashes between the national defence forces and the National Liberation Front in Burundi."
"We call on both sides to respect the ceasefire of 7 September last year and particularly demand that the leader of the FNL, Agathon Rwasa, should fully engage in the peace process."
"We ask the Commission to provide resources to facilitate the reintegration of FNL troops into society, to help provide assistance to the refugees and in particular to demobilise child soldiers that we find in this country."
"We have to demand that the Government of Burundi respect the rule of law, end the climate of impunity and ensure that those guilty are swiftly brought to justice."
"That is what we expect from the Commission and the Government."
"(FI) Madam President, as we have heard, the war in Burundi, which has gone on for 14 years, has resulted in a huge number of refugees inside the country, food shortages and dreadful violence, even on the part of those who are supposed to be protecting the people."
"Although the latest armed clashes have once again frustrated the quest for harmony and made one wonder if there is sufficient faith and political will among both parties for peace talks, important steps in the right direction also appear to have been taken."
"As a result of long and hard negotiations among several parties, the rebel troops have agreed to release a considerable number of child soldiers by the beginning of May."
"Burundi urgently needs the help of the EU Member States regarding its humanitarian crisis, as called for in the resolution, and I therefore urge everyone to support it."
"(PL) Madam President, the heightened tension in Burundi, the civil war between ethnic groups and the violence there should immediately be stopped."
"Hundreds killed and injured is the price paid by unarmed civilians for this conflict."
"It is essential that the cease-fire be respected, it is essential that peacekeepers be involved."
"The financial support that the European Union is to give to Burundi must be carefully monitored and directed primarily for humanitarian purposes, particularly for healthcare, security and education for children."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen: firstly, the European Union called for the resumption of dialogue between the parties as the sole means of making progress towards peace and reconciliation, which is a fundamental expectation of the Burundian people."
"The European Commission is therefore delighted that, on 16 May 2008, a delegation from the Palipehutu-FNL - that is, the Party for the Liberation of the Hutu People-National Liberation Forces - returned to Bujumbura, and I hope that it will be possible for both sides to resume active talks."
"I prefer to leave to one side the reply that I had prepared, for I have listened to a number of comments, and I feel that it is my duty to state a few facts."
"I should like to say to you - to be brief and to avoid repeating the excellent speeches that I have heard, especially those made by Mr Hutchinson, Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Bowis - first of all, that the situation in Burundi today has nothing to do with ethnic problems and to suggest that it is an ethnic crisis is to look at it from a different and extremely dangerous perspective."
"Therefore, I am inclined to share Mr Hutchinson's view, although I do regret somewhat that this debate is taking place here and now."
"It comes at rather an inopportune moment, for I feel that we must now give political dialogue a chance."
"Speaking as you have done, Mr Meijer, of an ethnic cause, is extremely dangerous guesswork."
"Secondly, Mr Hutchinson pinpointed the following fact: the international community, caught up as we are, and this applies to the World Bank - I have spoken on the subject with Bob Zoellick - and to the Commission, caught up in our procedures that prevent us, when a country is plunged into formal democracy, from releasing funds to show that there is a dividend to peace; this is one of the reasons why Burundi is finding it difficult to get moving again, as is the case, for example, in Liberia, as is the case in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as is the case in any country that is categorised as a post-conflict country."
"We are caught up in our procedures, we have no flexibility and so we cannot offer a rapid response to these countries' reconstruction needs, for this is where the real problem lies for Burundi."
"I shall naturally refrain from commenting on the speech which called for the deployment of European military forces - I am not saying that this is a separate issue - but it is clearly an issue that is somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion."
"We continue actively to support Burundi, both politically and financially, in its peace-building and socio-economic recovery efforts."
"I should like to point out that our cooperation commitments for the period 2008-2013 currently amount to EUR 188 million, and it has been suggested that this funding might be further increased during the mid-term review."
"In this connection, I must tell you that the rule is that it will be possible to increase this level of funding only if Burundi has properly taken up all the funds allocated under the initial aid package."
"This is the rule, and I hope that the country will be in a position to benefit from this mid-term review."
"The strategy adopted for this new period involves an increase in our budgetary support and identifies two areas on which attention should be focused: firstly, rehabilitation and rural development, which is clearly crucial for ensuring the survival of the populace; and, secondly, the healthcare sector."
"Our efforts to assist this country in its socio-economic recovery seek to demonstrate to the Burundian people what they can expect from the peace dividends as a stimulus to improve their situation."
"Burundi has been selected as a pilot country with a view to implementing the Council conclusions of November 2007, this has been mentioned, and I am delighted that is has been so selected."
"We have also agreed, together with the United Nations World Food Programme, to implement a pilot operation in Burundi, particularly in the area of education and the provision of canteens for schoolchildren, for it is clear that when children are provided with free meals, they will naturally want to go back to school."
"We shall also carry out a pilot case study that will include Burundi."
"Moreover, I shall be visiting Burundi in the near future, as the Commission is very closely involved in all these mediation efforts."
"I should like to add that, when I was Foreign Minister, I participated directly in the Arusha negotiations with President Mandela, so it is a subject that I know rather well, and I can tell you, Mr Meijer, that the Burundian Constitution, the Burundian legislative system and the Burundian Parliament - the National Assembly and Senate - provide all the institutional solutions that are needed to bring the ethnic problem firmly under control."
"Therefore, it is not an ethnic issue, it is an issue of unease within the one ethnic group, rather than with the other group, and it is clearly a different problem from the one concerning the FNL."
"The FNL must now come to the negotiating table, turn itself into a genuine political party and participate in the country's recovery and reconstruction."

"My warmest congratulations!"

"2006 Annual report on the CFSP - Annual report on the implementation of the European Security Strategy and ESDP (debate)"
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I should like to comment and express the views of Parliament on foreign policy during this debate, which is more than just a routine annual debate on foreign policy and the state of play of foreign policy in the Union: the participation of Mr Solana with us is a testimony that it is a special debate."
"Thank you for coming, Mr Solana."
"First, we are at a very important juncture, if not a turning point, in terms of foreign policy because of the Lisbon Treaty innovations."
"We have to look back in order to evaluate as usual, but we also have to take a forward-looking approach."
"We have high and growing citizen support for foreign policy, for one which is genuine and robust."
"Member States' perceptions increasingly change, seeing that speaking with one voice and acting in common is the only way to have an effective Union foreign policy."
"Entering this new chapter of EU foreign policy, we are moving towards a qualitative change."
"The new foreign policy should draw its legitimacy not only from its intergovernmental source, but also from European Parliament scrutiny, hence, as we will see, the growing importance and role of the European Parliament in shaping this policy, as we called for in our report."
"We need an integrated and holistic approach to foreign policy, with cohesion, convergence and complementarity of all the institutions involved, including the Member States."
"The European Union should continue its role as peace-maker and mediator, a soft power helping to stabilise, reconstruct and reform, a supplier of assistance and humanitarian aid, as a normative power, value-projecting and promoting democracy, freedom and human rights, but at the same time we should complement the soft dimension with a harder one by developing the ESDP dimension and our military capabilities to be prepared for power projection also."
"We should complement our reactive policy to short- and medium-term challenges with a more long-term strategic approach and definition of European interests in the long term, by addressing the true causes and not only the effects of some changes around us like Darfur, which is both a climate and a conflict situation."
"We should continue being active on various geographical priorities, but also face new challenges and horizontal issues like climate security, energy security, space security, cyber-security, migration flows and many others."
"While aspiring to be a global power and a global actor, we should change the balance between being a payer, as we are and we want to be, and being a key player in the world arena."
"The new Treaty offers a huge potential for a coherent and effective foreign policy, but we all know that implementation will be crucial."
"We need collective will and cooperation, not only in the institutional triangle but also with Member States, and we have to avoid rivalries."
"We tried to table a constructive approach in this report."
"We are concerned by some failures of foreign policy, but we look more to the future."
"We recognise positive evolution, progress and successes."
"We recommend challenging the failures but building on achievements, and identifying room for further progress."
"The European Parliament's ambition is not only to scrutinise the foreign policy, to make recommendations on which to base solutions and choices for the executive branch, but also to invest in its own foreign policy-making, which I call 'parliamentary diplomacy', as it is run within our competence at parliamentary level."
"On priorities, we believe that we need a focused approach and a limited number of priorities."
"We underline the need for value-driven foreign policy, not because we are excessively idealistic or naive, but because a world around us which shares our own strong universal values will best serve our interests of security and prosperity."
"Parliament considers the foreign policy of the Union as a contribution to strengthened European identity and also as value added for EU citizens and as part of the European Commission's trajectory of a Europe of results."
"We consider foreign policy as a key EU policy to be equipped with a proper institutional set-up, which the Lisbon Treaty brings about, proper instruments, and adequate financing out of the EU budget."
"We need a set of instruments at our disposal, and that is something which lies ahead of us."
"Mr President, in our report, we wished to avoid repeating statements from previous reports on the European Security Strategy."
"Perhaps we have not entirely achieved this but I believe we can go further down this track in the future."
"For example, one point that was decided on in earlier reports and that we did not address again for precisely that reason, but that should be mentioned here, is the European Parliament's support for the European Security and Defence College."
"We would like this to become a real institution, not just a virtual one."
"Measured by European standards, time has passed very quickly since December 2003, when the European Security Strategy was adopted - perhaps not necessarily when measured by objective standards, but it can be said that the European Security Strategy has made significant practical progress during this time."
"There are some achievements to boast of, but I will not enumerate the different civilian and military missions here."
"However, what we can show, structurally, is that, for the last year or so we have had a civilian control and planning instrument on the Council side and that there is now a clear chain of command from the building over there right down to those who have to carry out operations on the ground."
"From the military perspective, we have strengthened operational capability beyond the use of NATO capabilities in accordance with the Berlin Plus Agreement."
"We have made the Battle Groups, which are supposed to work on rotation, operable."
"We have also carried out operations that we can declare successful, such as the missions in the area of the rule of law in Georgia and other similar missions."
"However, there are some tasks that still have to be undertaken and where, in my opinion, there are still deficits, and it does not make the Security Strategy any poorer if we list these points."
"When measured by the population figures for the EU Member States, there is an imbalance in the contributions to the missions, particularly in the civilian area."
"We therefore propose that the Member States be obliged - whether morally or by other means - to issue action plans detailing what staff capabilities they can make available to the European Union should it become necessary, including statements on the career prospects of people who return to their own country after serving on EU missions."
"In the long term, we cannot manage the agonising mechanism of providing troops for military actions such as Darfur and Chad, as we have done up to this point."
"We are therefore suggesting alternative options."
"We are also making several suggestions for dealing with the helicopter crisis and increasing the availability of helicopters."
"In the long term, it makes no sense for us in the European Union to be flying around in 24 different types of helicopter."
"In addition, there are new developments that we must consider as we reflect further on the Security Strategy."
"Terrorist activity has brought about a blurring of the boundaries between internal and external borders."
"Securing energy supply through diplomatic, economic and technical - and I am deliberately not saying military - means must be tackled."
"Securing sensitive infrastructures against electronic attacks is something we have become aware of."
"All these things need to be included in our consideration of aspects of the Security Strategy that may need to be expanded upon."
"Mr Solana, the EU High Representative, has a specific mandate from the Council to think about such things."
"We support him in that."
"We would hope to see the result of these deliberations towards the end of the year in the form of a White Paper so that there is a common reference point for European discussion, not only for discussion between Mr Solana and the governments, not only between him and us, not only in the national parliaments, but also in the interests of the European public, from Poland to Portugal."
"High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. - Mr President, let me start by thanking Parliament for inviting me to this important debate on the European Union's foreign policy, security and defence in the plenary sitting of the European Parliament."
"However, before entering into the substance, let me at once condemn the terrorist attack against the Danish Embassy in Islamabad on Monday and express my condolences to the Danes and Pakistanis and the families of the dead and injured."
"Let us remember them and in particular those who suffered there."
"I was in Islamabad not long ago and I would like to report on that trip, if the sitting allows me the time."
"I wish to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Saryusz-Wolski and Mr Kuhne, for their reports."
"I think that there are many excellent points in these reports on how we can strengthen the European Union's overall impact around the world, in line with our values, in line with our interests."
"I would like to congratulate them and reassure them, and all of you, that we will take as many of the remarks as possible into consideration because I think they are very constructive, very positive and because of that they will be considered by me."
"This is a very important session and I would like to address some of the issues which are in both reports."
"In the time allowed me I would like to talk about those issues that are more pertinent today on the international affairs agenda, to see how we can contribute to the resolution of the problems of today."
"I should like to say a couple of words about the Treaty that has been referred to by the rapporteurs."
"In both reports there are many references to the Treaty of Lisbon and it is very clear why."
"Those reports ask for more efficiency."
"The main point of the Treaty is to make the European Union's work more efficient, more visible, especially in foreign and security policy."
"I am convinced that the Treaty will solve many of the problems identified in the report in particular by Mr Kuhne."
"The first priority for all of us is to get the Treaty ratified."
"We all still have to work in that direction in the coming days."
"I would like to underline that the Slovenian Presidency was mandated by the December European Council to take forward the work on preparing for the smooth entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty."
"The work, as you know, has been guided by a few basic principles that we share."
"The starting point of all this discussion is the Treaty itself."
"It has to be respected in full."
"The second thing is that the overall aim is that the Treaty enters into force as previously agreed and that means on 1 January 2009 if things can go smoothly."
"Many aspects of the Treaty are of fundamental interest to you, to the European Parliament and - as we are talking about foreign and security policy - on that particular issue."
"Both the Presidency and the Commission and myself have had the opportunity to discuss many of these issues with some of you, and I would like to guarantee that I will continue to do so from my time here today until the moment the Treaty enters into force."
"It is vital to my mind that the three main institutions work together to ensure the smooth implementation of the Treaty."
"Let me say a word about the European External Action Service."
"As you know, I have a mandate as High Representative in Office from Declaration 15 of the Treaty to carry out preparatory work with the Commission and with the Member States."
"I am doing that. I am implementing this mandate with the clear objective of having the decision to establish the EAS adopted as soon as possible after the entry into force of the Treaty."
"Mr Kuhne mentioned the European Security Strategy."
"Let me make some comments on how I see the situation today."
"The mandate that I received, the mandate from the Council last December, asked me to produce another report by December 2008."
"I will follow up with discussions with you all in order to obtain the best modifications necessary."
"The strategy has proved very useful."
"That has been recognised by the rapporteur and I thank him for that."
"In the last four years I think it has been an instrument that has done good service."
"The document was short but at the same time it is a document which is readable and therefore I think it has complied with this purpose."
"I think that this strategy reflects our values, it reflects our principles, it reflects how we should come back to foreign and security policy."
"I think the task mandated by the European Council last December is not about changing the text; it is more about improving the text and complementing it wherever possible."
"It is important to reflect on the international situation at the moment it was written - remember it was 2003."
"Things have taken place in this period of time - probably not fundamental enough to change the content of the strategy - but they complement the issues from this period."
"Lessons have been learned and debates have taken place in Parliament and in the institutions."
"Therefore I consider the input from Parliament to be very valuable, also through the report of the rapporteur, Mr Kuhne, which is most welcome."
"I will report orally to the European Council in two weeks' time about this issue, how the work is being done."
"At that moment I will get something back from the Member States on the thinking about this issue and I will listen to you and all the comments you have made today."
"There will then be further discussion and an informal meeting of Foreign Ministers - the Gymnich - in the month of September and we will continue talking about these issues among ourselves here in Parliament."
"I think that the timing is very important."
"December 2008 will be the fifth anniversary of the ESS."
"Hopefully by then the Lisbon Treaty will be ratified, therefore improving the coherence of our action."
"On the key threats that the strategy contemplates, I think those identified in 2003 were the right ones."
"I think we would agree on that."
"Weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, organised crime, regional conflicts - basically those have not changed."
"It is still as relevant today, as I said, and we have to continue fighting actively along these lines."
"The strategy was based on an analysis of the major global challenges at that time, but today, as I said, some are more relevant than others five years ago, and we also have new ones."
"Remember - as has been mentioned already by the rapporteurs - climate change and its effects on international security, energy security - which now has to be contemplated in depth - were not contemplated in the strategy."
"The same applies to migration - illegal migration in particular - and information security."
"They were not contemplated, and should be now."
"We have to take those developments into account."
"Let me say a word also about the ESDP, which the rapporteur mentioned."
"I think we can say without exaggeration that it has been a success."
"It has been an important and very visible part of the CFSP."
"Over the last five years - and it is good to recognise that - we have deployed more than 15 missions - in fact 17."
"We now have 14 of them - civilian and military - in action on three continents: Europe - in the Balkans, Africa, and the Middle East and Asia."
"That is well recognised in the reports and I appreciate that very much."
"However, Mr Kuhne's report highlights some of the challenges and shortfalls we face in the ESDP and I agree with most of the things that have been said."
"We are working on it: we are taking into account the lessons learned from the missions; we are adapting our structures, both on the civilian and on the military side; we are trying to make it so that there is more civilian and military cooperation, i.e. to have a comprehensive approach, which I think is also the intention of the report."
"Good progress was made at last week's Council meeting with the Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministers."
"An important decision was taken."
"The rapporteur Mr Kuhne mentioned the key word 'helicopters', which, as you know, is one of the difficulties that the international community is facing now with regard to crisis management operations."
"The capabilities we need are not here and the capabilities we have are not ready or not the most suitable for the challenges of today."
"The decision for the Defence Agency to concentrate on that tactical issue of helicopters is operational from today and I hope very much that you will receive information from the military in the European Union."
"That is something that I hope will be tackled in a coherent manner."
"Let me say a few words about the situation in the world today: the hot spots and the things we are trying to resolve."
"Let me start with the Western Balkans."
"As you know there are still elements to be resolved in the Western Balkans."
"What happened at the elections on Sunday in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is something that should make us think."
"However, I should like to report to you that, since the last time we spoke, two important things have taken place in Serbia: the SAA has been signed with the Serbs and elections have taken place."
"I think the results of the elections have something to do with our behaviour and let us hope that we can have a government in Serbia that will look to the European perspective of Serbia."
"Let me say a word about Kosovo."
"In Kosovo, as you know, by 15 June the global package of laws, including the constitution that was promised from the day of the independence of Kosovo, will be operational."
"By that time we would like to have the situation on the ground moving in the right direction, i.e. EULEX moving in the right direction."
"We are in permanent contact with the Secretary-General of the United Nations to see how this can be done and I hope very much that in a few days I will be able to report to you that progress has been made."
"It is more than natural that I say a word about Georgia."
"I am going to Georgia tomorrow morning."
"I will be visiting Tbilisi and the authorities there."
"I will also visit Abkhazia."
"It is very important that we also visit Abkhazia to try to establish direct contact between the two sides in the framework of the Friends of the Secretary-General for the moment and see whether another, more active, format can be put in place."
"I do not think that we will be able to resolve everything this week, but I hope very much that we will make a positive and constructive contribution."
"I should report to you in addition on the situation in Lebanon, where important events have also recently taken place."
"I, together with the President of Parliament, had the privilege to be there that Sunday."
"It was a very moving moment when the agreement was reached."
"General Suleiman is now the President after 18 months of instability."
"The building where we were that afternoon had been closed and was now open."
"I hope that the decision that was reached in Doha in Qatar will allow the evolution of Lebanon towards peace and to an election in 2009."
"As you know, this agreement is not perfect: it has positive elements but it also has elements that are not so positive."
"Let us hope that our help and coherence in our actions in the months to come will help further the process, because, at the moment, it is still not complete."
"The Prime Minister has been reappointed."
"Mr Siniora is a dignified man, a man we should respect."
"He is in charge of the government now."
"Let us hope that he will be able to arrive safely to the election process in the middle of 2009."
"I would like to talk about many other things, but with this speech - and I think I have exceeded my time - I have given you at least an idea of the issues I will be tackling during the next few months."
"I would also like to tell you that I will be Tehran."
"I have not been there since June 2006."
"Since that time I have had many meetings with the leaders of Tehran. However, I have decided, together with the six countries involved in these negotiations, to go back to Tehran to meet its leaders."
"I will carry with me an upgraded offer from the one that we made in 2006."
"I do not expect miracles but I think it is important for us to continue extending a hand and to make it clear that we have a twin-track approach: negotiations to solve the basic issues, in particular the nuclear issue, but, at the same time, to continue using what the Security Council has to offer."
"(Applause)"
"We thank you, High Representative, for your speech and we wish you well for all your dangerous journeys."
"I think the safest place for you to be is the European Parliament."
"It must always be a pleasure for you to be here!"
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, Mr Solana, ladies and gentlemen, if, as we hope, the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force on 1 January 2009, this will mark the start of a new era for the Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"This policy was a gamble, but it is precisely this that allows the European Union to prove itself as a global player."
"Despite considerable progress, Europe still has a long way to go before, as an economic giant but a political dwarf, it can become a global political power punching at its economic weight."
"As Mr Saryusz-Wolski indicated in his excellent report, Europe's role in the world is still far from reaching its true potential."
"In Israel, Palestine and all over the world, our interlocutors are demanding to see more from Europe."
"We should listen to their demands."
"In order to be credible with these partners, the Union must not only speak with one voice, but also have the necessary instruments to make itself heard."
"Its foreign policy must have democratic legitimacy, which will be afforded by the parliamentary scrutiny introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we want a credible defence for Europe, not so that we can go to war, naturally, but so that we can ensure peace and more importantly help the world's poorest."
"Our common security is no longer limited to military protection against external attack."
"It also covers energy supply, climate change, migration management and the promotion of human rights and civil liberties."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is committed to ensuring that all aspects of this common security are taken into account."
"We are of the view that the EU's foreign policy must first of all focus on our closest neighbours."
"That is why we are asking the Commission and the Council to work towards strengthening the European Neighbourhood Policy and bringing stability to the situation in the Western Balkans."
"Specifically, it is imperative that we continue the dialogue with Serbia while continuing to support Kosovo."
"The collaboration between the Council and Parliament has not always been easy when it comes to these matters."
"The Council has not always been open and transparent enough for our liking, but our relations have progressed a great deal nonetheless."
"The Council Presidency and Mr Solana now recognise that the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy will be stronger and fairer if it has the backing of Parliament."
"On behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I would like to ask the Council to go further, to join Parliament in discussions on the appointment of the first High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission and to engage in proper consultation with them."
"We would also like Parliament to be consulted on how to establish a European External Action Service."
"In terms of the implementation of the European Security Strategy, our group calls on the High Representative to publish a White Paper in order to assess the strategy introduced in 2003."
"In the context of the future Treaty, we are calling for a reinforcement of the budgetary powers of Parliament in all areas of EU spending."
"We are also lobbying for instruments of parliamentary scrutiny and cooperation with the Council."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in a world where regional powers hold sway, the European Union must seize the unique opportunities represented by the new instruments of the Treaty to establish itself as a political power which is both more homogeneous, and therefore more able to make itself heard on the international stage, and firmer with its partners."
"Increased parliamentary scrutiny will make this policy even more effective, because it will be more democratic and more transparent."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate Mr Kuhne on his report, especially since it applies a very comprehensive definition of security and therefore defines a comprehensive range of security policy instruments which, naturally, includes the military, although it is not based exclusively on military measures."
"Mr Wiersma will go into this in more detail."
"I would also like to thank Mr Saryusz-Wolski very much for his effective cooperation, which we recently experienced in the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"I would like to mention two matters."
"The first - and we have already discussed it today in our group, as Mr Schulz has already mentioned - is the question of energy security and common energy policy."
"We are not interested in criticising bilateral agreements that were concluded in an era when there was no discussion about a common security policy."
"However, such agreements are still being concluded now, and especially for the future, it is important to make it clear that, when such agreements are concluded, they must be embedded in a common security policy and a common energy policy."
"Today I spoke with a prominent representative from Azerbaijan who is here in Parliament. He said, 'Friends, you present quite differently from China and Russia'."
"This is not acceptable!"
"We must appear united if we want to pursue common goals, and he was right to point this out."
"This brings me to my second matter, which we will deal with in more detail in the Brok report."
"There is a lot of talk now about the Union for the Mediterranean."
"As a group, we are calling for a Union for the Black Sea region too."
"This is also an important region, in which we must do a great deal, particularly in our own interests."
"I thank Mr Saryusz-Wolski for having addressed this matter."
"The proposal, as we have it from Poland and Sweden, is good."
"We support it, but it does not go far enough."
"We must go further if we really want to represent our political interests in this region in particular."
"Obviously, we support this, in connection with this report and will discuss it further in connection with the Brok report, so that our common neighbours in the east and the south become co-advisers, involved with us in managing and implementing the European goals."
"Finally, a remark on the diplomatic service - the High Representative, Mr Solana, also mentioned it."
"There is a lot of discussion about it and we will also produce a report on it, but let me make one thing clear: we need a diplomatic service that is viable and is acceptable to the Commission, the Council and the Member States, one that is efficient and can really take its political responsibility seriously, including its responsibility to this Parliament."
"For us, the critical thing is to make it clear that this service - however it is organised - is, of course, responsible to the European Parliament through the High Representative."
"A final remark on Iran: Mr Solana, I wish you good luck in Iran."
"Obviously we are taking the same approach, which is to be flexible, but to state clearly that we do not want any more atomic weapons, especially in that region."
"They would create further insecurity, not more security."
"All the best, then, in successfully establishing these fundamental principles."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Solana, the reports by Mr Saryusz-Wolski and Mr Kuhne are important pieces of work, and discussing every aspect of these within such a short period of time would be impossible."
"For that reason, I shall be focussing on three aspects."
"Firstly, the role of our Parliament in foreign and defence matters; secondly, the very great responsibility of all Member States to establish a coherent and effective foreign and security policy; and, finally, the need for us to continue combating the proliferation of nuclear weapons and working towards general arms control."
"The fact that we are holding this debate with these participants here this afternoon is excellent evidence of the degree to which we, the European Parliament, have succeeded in assuming a greater role in foreign and security policy, even though, according to the current treaties, that was not initially to be the case."
"It is our perseverance that has led to this, as well as the understanding which has been shown to us by both the Commission and the High Representative and which led to an interinstitutional agreement that makes debates such as this possible."
"We shall of course make use of every possibility offered by the Treaty of Lisbon in order to continue playing our role to the full."
"Incidentally, it is also due to the fact that we have never pushed too far, that we have taken care 'not to overplay our hand', as they say in English, that we have been able to fill this role."
"It is clear that, as Mr Swoboda emphasised, an effective foreign and security policy is only possible if all 27 Member States and the governments of these Member States, including the large ones, take concerted action."
"We can indeed deliver fine speeches here, everyone can deliver fine speeches here, but if Heads of State or Government, prime ministers or Ministers of Foreign Affairs go off and do things differently on the world stage then it is not possible, it will not succeed."
"The responsibility of our Member States is therefore particularly great, not only in the field I have mentioned, but also to ensure that their words are followed by action."
"We had painful experience of this when preparing for the intervention in Chad, for example."
"An affirmative decision was made and then it took weeks to gather the troops and all the material."
"Such things do great damage to our credibility, and I hope, therefore, that we shall all make huge efforts to ensure the least possible chance of this happening again in the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will not repeat all the congratulations or re-emphasise the points on which we actually agree: that is, the call for a coherent foreign and security policy, such as Mr Saryusz-Wolski has formulated for us, and of course the question of parliamentary scrutiny and transparency."
"When we return to our national Member States we notice in all our discussions that, the more the European Union becomes involved in foreign and security policy, the more we wish to and must promote these instruments for transparency and legitimacy amongst the population of our own country."
"I would like to address the contentious points that no one else has mentioned yet."
"Mr Verheugen, in the first debate we discussed the draft of Mr Kuhne's report with Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner. She, like my group, emphasised that it is beneficial that we keep on thinking about this, that we not only discuss reworking the European Security Strategy but also try to formulate a joint mission statement, namely the question of human security and the responsibility to protect."
"Anyone who has been following what has happened since then will have been aware of the strange coalition of the conservatives under Mr von Wogau and the communists under Mr Pflüger."
"The relevant passage has been deleted, with the support of both groups, and we will make a fresh request for it to be included, since if we do not meet this political challenge, we will lose our credibility with regard to the way we deal with this topic, that is, with conflict prevention, but also with the question of what we do about Darfur, Chad and other conflicts that we should be wary of."
"The second thing, which I find absurd, even though we have not yet reached consensus on it, is that the conservatives under Mr von Wogau are requesting that we take the US national security strategy into account in the future within the framework of the European Security Strategy and our reworking of it."
"That is completely absurd, because this policy has run aground and we know that the US Administration has failed with this escalation, this unilateralism, and that it has cost many lives."
"To then say that we should absorb this into our future European foreign policy - I find that more than absurd!"
"Thirdly, I would like to raise an extremely important matter: proliferation."
"Mr Solana, I also wish you every success."
"We need dialogue, including with Iran, but I would ask my fellow Members this: when we are talking about energy security which, after all, is part of wider security - is it the correct response when Mr Sarkozy, as the future President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union, announces that he wants to place nuclear technology on the world market without restriction and with no means of monitoring it?"
"What happens to our credibility then?"
"Firstly, we are not effecting nuclear disarmament, which we are supposed to be doing."
"Secondly, we are circulating this technology even though we know that it can always be abused from a military aspect."
"I believe we are making a mistake in this and therefore we will also be submitting an amendment."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (GA) Mr President, cooperation and coordination on the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) is important between EU Member States."
"There are new global threats and I believe that the Lisbon Treaty and the CFSP will move us closer to disabling those threats."
"The CFSP is more than policy implementation."
"It entails 27 Member States working together to ensure peace, human rights, the rule of law and democracy throughout the world."
"The Lisbon Treaty contains these same principle and they fully conform to Irish values."
"In congratulating both of the rapporteurs on their work in this particular area and taking into account our experience over the last number of years, it is particularly important that we are cognisant of the fact that too often Europe has spoken with great words but failed to live up to the expectation."
"That is why, as we look forward to the development of new policies, without in any way anticipating what the outcome of the referendum in Ireland will be - which I hope will be positive towards the adoption and ratification of the Lisbon Treaty - we must remember always that unless the Member States, acting collectively, can agree to common positions and to moving forward, fine words will be spoken but action will fail."
"The most recent example of that was what happened in Chad."
"Despite the horrors of what we saw with regard to the refugees on the Chad and Sudanese border, despite the desire of every Member State to be seen to do something, our failure to deliver the logistics of bringing the forces into Chad highlighted our shortcomings."
"When we speak about the future threats, future opportunities and, indeed, the future dangers, we must always be cognisant of the fact that Europe is the greatest peace project of all."
"The work that we do, and what we have achieved and built in the European Union since 1958, has proven that acting collectively, cooperating with tolerance and understanding of different points of view is a far greater power and tool than any weapons we can put at our disposal."
"But that is not to be naive and to say that we do not need to have resources at our disposal."
"However, we must keep in mind that all Member States must act in unanimity in finding new foreign and defence policies for the future, and that if one country says 'no', they cannot be diminished or demonised because of that."
"Mr President, the two reports we are discussing are a clear sign of the advanced stage the militarisation of the European Union has reached."
"I wish to address several aspects, for example the very close EU-NATO cooperation, which is absolutely fatal."
"NATO is also an alliance for waging war and we are opposed to this close cooperation between the European Union and NATO."
"Thank you again for clarifying that the Lisbon Treaty will bring fundamental changes in the military area."
"That is an essential reason why we are against the Lisbon Treaty and I would like to point out that it has not yet been ratified and that I am hoping for a 'no' in Ireland on 12 June."
"Part of the Lisbon Treaty - which also appears in Mr Kuhne's report - is that an independent EU military budget, known as the start-up fund, should be created."
"We think this creates a whole host of problems."
"Parliamentary scrutiny of ESDP missions is not guaranteed."
"EU Battle Groups are supposed to be able to be deployed within 5-30 days and the German Bundestag cannot be involved within that timeframe."
"It was not possible to achieve agreement on parliamentary scrutiny between all groups, partly because we demanded that all groups, including the smaller ones, should receive the appropriate information."
"Apparently this Parliament does not want that."
"The report calls for further armament projects."
"We believe that this is wrong."
"Previous EU missions must first be thoroughly evaluated."
"This is long overdue."
"French soldiers who were part of Operation Artemis in Congo used torture."
"The operation in Chad is a disaster and the EULEX mission in Kosovo - supposedly a rule of law mission - has no legal basis."
"The two reports are heading in completely in the wrong direction."
"Therefore, we as a group have put forward a minority opinion."
"It has now become evident what the French Presidency plans to do in the military realm."
"There will be a further push for militarisation; marine and air Battle Groups have already been mentioned."
"We do not want a military European Union."
"We do not want a military alliance."
"We want a civil European Union."
"For these reasons, we say a definite 'no' to these two reports."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, both of these reports assume that the Lisbon Treaty/European Constitution will be ratified, despite the fact that the result of the Irish referendum will not be known until 12 June."
"But of course this Parliament has already decided that it will ignore the Irish referendum if it results in a 'no' vote."
"The European Union does not want its foreign policy and military ambitions to be subject to the will of the people of Europe's nation states by means of referenda, because it knows very well that they will reject those ambitions if given a choice."
"And what ambitions they are."
"These reports show how the EU intends to build its military forces by such means as combining multinational forces, building common command and control structures, adopting common equipment and systems procurement policies, and implementing common communication systems."
"They envisage combining existing multinational forces and that there should be a standing force under EU command."
"And there we have the beginnings of a European standing army."
"These plans endanger NATO and undermine the nation states' positions within the United Nations - which the European Union seeks to usurp."
"I recently attended a security conference in Brussels in which someone posed the question: who fears the European Union?"
"Meaning, of course, that without the threat of military force, no-one will take the EU's foreign policy pretensions seriously."
"During the latter part of the Second World War, one of Stalin's staff said that the Pope disapproved of certain of his foreign policy actions."
"To which Stalin replied: 'and how many divisions does the Pope have?'"
"The European Union intends to have its divisions in order to enforce its will and make itself feared on the world stage."
"And if we want to know what that will look like, just imagine the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy repeated with guns, tanks and aeroplanes."
"The only people in Europe being allowed a say on this are the Irish in their referendum of 12 June."
"One of the key factors influencing the minds of the Irish will be to preserve their historical policy of neutrality."
"But do they realise that if Lisbon is ratified neutrality will end and they will become subject to the foreign policy and military ambitions of the European Union?"
"But they will not only lose their neutrality, they will find themselves helping to pay for soldiers and armaments to undertake military operations that they may not approve of."
"They should seriously consider these things before deciding which way to vote in their referendum."
"The British Government and Houses of Parliament have shamefully betrayed the British people by denying them a referendum on Lisbon."
"Irish neutrality is at stake, but so is the very ability of Britain to defend itself."
"(SK) Ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by saying that I welcome the 2006 annual report and the progress achieved in the structure of the report."
"The European Parliament must adopt a more resolute position and act as one in the issues concerned that the Council should deal with systematically."
"In this regard, I welcome the provisions concerning closer cooperation between the European Parliament and the national parliaments, as well as the increased responsibility of the national parliaments and Member State governments with regard to strategic decisions."
"I believe that representatives of the new Member States will find their place, too, in the new structure of the European diplomatic services."
"In my opinion, thanks to the Lisbon Treaty Europe will present a more united front in the area of external relations."
"It is important for the Member States to increase the frequency of consultations with their partners as well as with the EU High Representative, in particular with regard to adopting fundamental decisions."
"The single legal personality of the Union will make it possible for the European Union to conclude international agreements and join international organisations."
"When adopting these binding decisions, the European citizens' concerns and expectations regarding issues of an international nature should also be taken into account."
"Mr President, allow me to take my turn by briefly congratulating those who have spoken on behalf of the parliamentary groups."
"I think that in general terms, while there has not been unanimity, there has been a broad consensus on many of the matters that we have covered in the first part of the debate."
"(FR) I should first of all like to thank Mr Daul from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"You expressed yourself clearly on the objectives of the ESS revision and on the aims of the Treaty of Lisbon in general."
"I fully share your position and believe that it is crucial to strengthen the voice and human dimension of the Union."
"I honestly believe that Europe has a duty not only to its citizens, but to those outside Europe."
"The whole world is voicing its hope that Europe will adopt a clearer approach and take more effective action."
"I therefore fully share the comments of the PPE-DE Group and will make every effort to bring about effective cooperation with all of the institutions between now and the entry into force of the Treaty."
"This is the mandate that was given to me under Article 15 of the Treaty, and I will endeavour to fulfil this obligation."
"I would also like to reply to Mr Swoboda - not to disagree with him but, on the contrary, to say that many of the things he has said are very much to my way of thinking and to the way I would like to see things moving."
"I think the cooperation you mentioned between civilians and the military is fundamental."
"We are in the business of crisis management and not in any other business."
"In crisis management all the instruments should be at the disposal of the European Union to make the utmost of its capabilities."
"But, again, the most important thing is to have political will."
"We may have the capabilities, but if we do not have political will we have nothing."
"We may not have the capabilities in any case."
"Therefore, we have to work in both directions, with capabilities but also with political will."
"The construction of political will is something that everybody in this beautiful building has to work on, together with the other institutions of the European Union."
"Let me say a word about the report by Mr Saryusz-Wolski."
"There were paragraphs in the report with which I agree from A to Z. I would like to underline the paragraphs on Afghanistan for instance because Afghanistan is a very important issue on which we have responsibilities."
"I did not have the opportunity to mention in my introductory remarks that for me - and for us I hope - Afghanistan is one of the challenges that we have on the table and we have to be able to construct a resolution that has to be political."
"Therefore, what you said about the police mission in the report is very important."
"We need members of the police there."
"As you know, at the last European Foreign Affairs Council we agreed to double the number of people deployed."
"But I would also like to underline what you said about quality."
"It is true that when we talk about the rule of law, police and judges they are not at our disposal - they are working in their national Member States on other issues and therefore we have to see how we can go from here to the time when we will have at our disposal a European group of policemen, group of judges and group of social actors that could be deployed rapidly."
"That may be possible with the military because, fortunately, if they are not in a crisis-management operation, they may be available for deployment."
"We have to think about that and not only think but also find answers to those questions."
"I should like to say that, on the whole, the speeches have been very constructive."
"I should like to comment on the paragraph on human security."
"Mrs Beer, you know very well that I am very attached to that concept."
"Marie Colvin is one of my friends and I have written some of those pieces with her."
"I think that is a concept that illuminates much of our modern thinking as far as security is concerned."
"Therefore, it does not matter what we call it, the important thing is what we do."
"The name is important but what we do is more important than the name."
"I think that all the reports are illuminated by that belief: that security is something that goes beyond a classical concept."
"But, with respect, I have to disagree with some of the remarks, starting with the remark by the representative of the Commission."
"I really do not think that the security strategy has to be revised because it had a very narrow concept of security."
"I do not think this is a good statement."
"I think, concerning the security strategy written in 2003, that most of the limits there are the same elements, the same challenges, the same problems that we have today."
"We may have to complement and we may have to act, but I do not characterise the strategy as a narrow vision of security."
"On the contrary, it is the most open-minded approach that the European Union has ever had on this problem."
"For the sake of clarity, I think that what we have to do is not to write a new text but to maintain as much as possible of the core, i.e. the mandate we have, and try to add elements."
"For example many of you have mentioned the question of energy security - which is important - and the question of the consequences of climate change in all its dimensions, the question of how to tackle the responsibility that we have with disasters that are natural and not manmade, for which we have resources and capabilities that have been put in place to combat such dramatic events."
"Concerning proliferation: I have spoken about that on almost every occasion I have been given the opportunity - the risks and the importance that issue has for all of us."
"I think if we were to pick two horizontal issues we have to tackle, one would be climate change and the other would be proliferation and disarmament."
"Those are the two main issues that may put at risk much of what we value in life."
"Therefore, I agree with that."
"I would like to say a few words to my dear friend, Brian Crowley."
"I think the important thing is to deliver, and I agree with him."
"However, take the example of Chad."
"I do not know whether that was the best example you could have chosen."
"I was in Chad a couple of weeks ago."
"I went to the capital, to the second city and to Goz Beida, where the Irish Battalion is deployed with very high spirits and enormous professionalism."
"That is something that should make us proud."
"I feel proud of the work the Irish Battalion is doing in the middle of the savannah, trying to help the displaced people in the refugee camps, with tremendous generosity."
"I applaud the Irish soldiers who are there, who have a very generous attitude and are fully determined to make things better on the ground, which is the objective of the mission."
"I would like to thank you, Mr President, and all the parliamentary groups and I hope very much that in the time we have ahead of us, as we approach the end of the year 2008, we will be able to work constructively towards making the dream of so many citizens of the European Union a reality - the implementation of the Treaty in order to have a Europe that has a presence in the international community, in the world, that is proportional to our ideas, our principles, our capabilities and our standard of living."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Solana, I would first like to thank Mr Kuhne for his report and for the way he went about it, which meant that we were able to achieve unity on almost all points."
"Mr Solana, a few months ago, you attended Mr Polin's funeral in Bayonne."
"He was the first soldier to have lost his life in a European operation."
"For me, this was a very moving event, a very sad event, which caused me to think very carefully again about when we actually deploy soldiers and under what conditions."
"This is also, at the same time, my answer to Mrs Beer and the concept of human security."
"The concept of human security is certainly an interesting one - including for development aid."
"Without security, there is no development."
"However, I am not sure that this concept is appropriate for the European Union's security and defence policy, as it would be possible to take it to mean that we should intervene in every case, all over the world."
"That raises expectations that it may not be possible to fulfil."
"When people are in need, they do not look for the one who has the best intentions but for the one who can actually help them."
"This is the weakness in this concept, and nothing would be worse than raising false hopes here."
"My group will therefore be voting against mentioning this principle."
"The French Presidency is ahead of us and along with it, there will most probably also be some important decisions to make."
"I have mentioned this already: more and more soldiers are being sent on dangerous missions."
"We have a responsibility to ensure that that they also have the necessary equipment, the best possible equipment for these operations."
"That is not yet the case in many areas."
"We have shortcomings in telecommunications and - this is extremely important - in the civil area and in civil operations."
"We have deficits in reconnaissance and navigation."
"Here I expect concrete suggestions to be made so that, in the future, there will be closer cooperation and so that such projects and shortcomings will be solved together in the European way."
"The report in front of us demands that Eurocorps be permanently subject to the European Union. In my opinion, this would be a great step forward compared to Battle Groups, which are only ever made available to the European Union for a six-month period."
"I am calling for the European Security and Defence College that Mr Kuhne mentioned to become more than just a virtual college so that it is given the means with which to perform its task."
"(NL) Mr President, I should like to make a number of comments on the European Security Strategy in the report by my esteemed colleague Mr Kuhne."
"He worked on it of course with the full support of my group, and we believe the result is excellent."
"Nevertheless, I should also like to bring a number of observations to the attention of the High Representative."
"This Security Strategy is in place and was developed in 2003 as a major innovation."
"The essence of the Strategy of course remains in place."
"What we are discussing now are adaptations to a transformed international agenda."
"Effective multilateralism is an important principle."
"The combination of civil and military aspects is of major importance."
"Modern threat analysis is also important."
"There are many positive examples of how the European Union, under the direction of Mr Solana, has dealt with this in the past few years."
"It is actually the same approach, but a broader agenda is being applied."
"Everyone is saying that you cannot just talk about terrorism and about traditional security problems: you must also examine the way in which problems relating to energy security and climate threat are important to our security agenda."
"That is the broad agenda."
"I should nevertheless like to stand up for the narrow agenda."
"It is not just about the security of states; it is about the security of people also."
"I think it a good thing that Mr Kuhne has tried to spark this debate here in Parliament, just as we had a whole discussion on the 'responsibility to protect' in the UN, another discussion that concerns individuals."
"We must indeed examine how this can be incorporated into our concept, and I therefore think it a shame that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats does not wish to participate in shaping these ideas."
"When we talk about human security, we mean not that there should be automatic intervention in each situation in which there is a possible threat to human security, but rather that we want better account to be taken of this important element."
"With regard to this broad agenda, it is also important that, thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon - and let us hope and pray that, on 12 June, Ireland will vote in favour of this Treaty, which is what we are assuming - the European Union will be able to work with a broad agenda, because the new High Representative, who must be called as such because of my own country, will also be Vice-President of the European Commission and will therefore coordinate this broad agenda effectively."
"Finally, I have one further observation regarding the United States."
"There are to be elections, and we do not know who the two candidates will be."
"In any case, it is clear that with whomever it may be - and I hope of course that it is Barack Obama - it will be easier to cooperate on a number of security issues."
"A particular example is the issue of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons."
"John McCain has had interesting things to say on this subject."
"Perhaps, at the end of the year, it will be time to present further initiatives, new agreements: with regard to the multilateralisation of the nuclear fuel cycle, for example."
"I hope that the High Representative is willing to make efforts to achieve this."
"(HU) Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, firstly I would like to congratulate Mr Saryusz-Wolski and Mr Kuhne on their comprehensive reports; they have done some outstanding work."
"One of the most important findings of Mr Saryusz-Wolski's report is that the stability of the Western Balkans is the European Union's number-one priority today."
"I completely agree with this."
"In the case of Kosovo, what is at stake is no less than the credibility of the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"The antecedents are not too encouraging: although all the Member States have supported the Ahtisaari plan, they have still not agreed on whether to recognise Kosovo."
"But an even greater problem is the fact that there is also still no agreement on whether UNMIK's powers should be handed over to EULEX."
"But if this does not happen, the European Union cannot fulfil its own pledges, and this undermines its credibility."
"Very important tasks for the EULEX mission are the creation of constitutionality, the introduction of a functioning market economy, the reinforcement of Kosovo's multi-racial nature, and the building of trust between the peoples living there."
"The European Union cannot leave Kosovo to its own devices."
"Our policy for the Western Balkans must rest on three pillars."
"Firstly, we must offer those countries a credible European perspective, we must examine the conditions strictly and we must bear witness to consistency."
"It would be a great mistake if we momentarily failed to give the conditions political consideration or if we inconsistently offered concessions to countries that do not cooperate with us - concessions that we do not give to those that do cooperate."
"These things will certainly continue to threaten the credibility of the European Union."
"The European Union wants to play a global role, and rightly so, but this will just be wishful thinking until it is capable of guaranteeing the possibility of peace, stability and progress in its own immediate vicinity. Thank you."
"Welcome"
"We are pleased to welcome to the official gallery the parliamentary delegations from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, along with representatives of the democratic opposition in Belarus."
"The delegation from Georgia is led by the Speaker of Georgia's Parliament, Mrs Burjanadze."
"These delegations have come to Brussels to take part in the conference on the European Neighbourhood Policy to be held in the European Parliament today and tomorrow."
"We warmly welcome them and are delighted to welcome them to this joint debate."
"(Applause)"
"2006 Annual report on the CFSP - Annual report on the implementation of the European Security Strategy and ESDP (continuation of debate)"
"We will continue with the joint debate on the report by Jacek Saryusz-Wolski, on the 2006 annual report on the CFSP, and the report by Helmut Kuhne, on the implementation of the European Security Strategy and ESDP."
"(FR) Mr President, it is a pleasure for me to speak before these delegations since we have such close ties with them."
"It is precisely on the South Caucasus, would you believe, High Commissioner, that I would like to focus my intervention."
"We heard the good news that you will be going to Georgia for a couple of days tomorrow."
"It was high time that this happened and I thank you for that."
"You will also be going to Abkhazia and on that point, you explained that the weekend might not be enough time to resolve the issue."
"If you manage to do it in a weekend, I will be the first to congratulate you."
"This is a hard task, we know, but the most important thing is that the European Union is engaging in it."
"In my opinion, this is almost a test of the maturity of EU foreign policy."
"We know that Russia, which is one of our partners, is now involved in the conflict."
"According to the UN report, Georgia has agreed to suspend UAV flights over Abkhazia."
"However, yesterday we learnt that Russia has deployed its military forces to supposedly build railways."
"If that is the case, I think it is too early to talk about peacekeeping forces."
"This is therefore a difficult task."
"You said that you were going to support Georgia's peace plan, so my question to you, High Commissioner, is this: are you also going to support, as part of this peace plan, the introduction of an Abkhaz-Georgian civil police force supervised by the EU or the OSCE?"
"This would be a real step forward, and one that we have been waiting for from the EU for a long time in this conflict, since this is a neighbouring country."
"Therefore, the question that arises today, and which our fellow Members have just asked, is this: are we going to develop the Neighbourhood Policy as part of our foreign policy?"
"(PL) Mr President, may I remind you that in last year's report from the Council on the main aspects and basic choices of Common Foreign and Security Policy, Parliament expressed deep disquiet at the announcement by the then Russian President, Vladimir Putin, that Russia was withdrawing from further participation in the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe."
"Despite the express declaration by the European Parliament, the EU authorities took no serious action on this."
"In July 2007, however, the Russian State Duma unanimously passed an act suspending Russia's participation in this Treaty."
"There is no doubt that this fact is of fundamental importance for security in Europe, as Russia possesses the greatest conventional armed forces potential on our continent."
"This is why I believe that the matter of getting the Russian Federation to re-accede to this international agreement is an important priority."
"The authorities of the EU and its Member States should use all means available to them to bring this about, not least because in recent times Russian expenditure on arms has risen by 700%."
"(ES) Mr President, Mr El Baradei, who is not someone who can be accused of being radical, said at the last Munich Conference on Security Policy that a 1% reduction in arms expenditure could solve the hunger problems in the world."
"The contribution that the European Union is making to achieving this goal is to ask the Member States for military expenditure to be increased, and as a result this civilisation has reached the immoral situation of having the highest arms expenditure in the world in 2006, more than in the Cold War: 17 times more than we spend on international cooperation."
"I think that we are going along the wrong path."
"The militarisation of security has created a more unjust, more violent world."
"You might remember that we were told that the immorality of the invasion of Iraq was going to resolve the problem of the Middle East and reduce the price of oil."
"The evidence is conclusive."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I think that we are on the wrong track."
"We need to demilitarise security and go back to the old values of a Europe in which, in the midst of the Cold War, on foreign policy people like Willy Brandt and Olaf Palme were proposing the zero armament objective."
"With regard to our link to North American security, it depends which administration we are talking about."
"Or have our principles and values been the same as those of the Bush administration?"
"Do you recall the CIA flights, the torture in Guantanamo, the death penalty, and the systematic violation of human rights throughout the world?"
"No, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we need to move towards autonomous, denuclearised security, and a system that generates sufficient security to resolve the fundamental problems which, in addition to terrorism, are hunger, poverty and discrimination."
"(SV) Mr President, today's debate was a foretaste of what is to come if the Treaty of Lisbon is adopted."
"Increased militarisation, increased supranationality and increased costs for the EU at the expense of Member States' independence."
"The EU is now to represent us all."
"The wishes of 27 states will become as of one."
"I therefore look on in amazement as the European Parliament - which claims to be the champion of democracy - chooses a federalist course without respecting either Ireland's referendum or intergovernmental cooperation."
"The Treaty of Lisbon means a further step towards a common foreign minister, common military forces and a common intelligence service, in short, a common defence and foreign policy."
"Citizens of Ireland, you are the only ones who have been given the opportunity to halt this dangerous development."
"I urge to you to vote 'no' on 12 June, just as we should do in Parliament tomorrow."
"Mr President, I have a question for you."
"How is it that the High Representative, Mr Solana, can come to this House and tell us a direct untruth?"
"I sat here and heard him say that everyone wants a stronger European Union and a stronger CFSP."
"I represent 4.2 million people in the East Midlands of the United Kingdom."
"Not one of them has ever said that they want a stronger European Union or a stronger CFSP, though many have said to me they would like to see our country out of the European Union."
"If you believe this is what the European people want, why will you not let them vote on the European Constitution and the Lisbon Treaty which are designed to deliver it?"
"Have you forgotten that the French voted against it and the Dutch voted against it?"
"Do you not know that 80% of my constituents want a referendum and, if they were given it, at least 80% of them would vote 'no'?"
"The British people that I represent want trade and cooperation in Europe, but they are absolutely opposed to political union and a European army."
"(ES) Mr President, cooperation between Parliament and the Council has significantly improved in recent years, as recognised in Mr Saryusz-Wolski's report, in particular thanks to the establishment of flexible mechanisms and the appearances by the President-in-Office of the Council, the High Representative and the Special Representatives."
"However, the report also says, as the Chairman of my group, that this cooperation between Parliament and the Council could be improved, especially in terms of timing."
"The report by Mr Saryusz-Wolski, whom I would like to congratulate on his work, includes a specific initiative: establishing an interinstitutional agreement from the beginning of next year, so that, on the basis of the guidelines of the new Treaty, stable and dynamic criteria for cooperation can be established."
"High Representative, I would like to get an idea of your assessment of this proposal in the report."
"Secondly, I would also like to thank the other rapporteur, Mr Kuhne, for his report on the European Security Strategy."
"I think that what we need here is a long-term strategy that will enable us to deal with the new shape of the threats that we face, which can be revised when circumstances change, and in any case every five years, coinciding with Parliament's legislative periods."
"There have been some very remarkable speeches."
"I do not think that it is a question of spending more, but while we have 3 parallel satellite systems - Mr von Wogau already referred to this today - 5 telecommunications systems, 23 armoured vehicle systems and 87 different arms programmes, we will not be able to continue to make progress along the line that we want to follow."
"With the 27 Member States, the European Union has approximately 2 million soldiers, 10 000 tanks and 3 000 fighter planes."
"I think that this is a sufficiently large force for us to be able to take serious action."
"However, we have additional problems with sending a battalion to conflicts such as in Chad, where the aim is not to wage war but to provide protection in crisis situations and mediate in conflict situations."
"Therefore, Mr President, I think that we need to contribute and mobilise all of our resources so that the European Union, with all of the capacity that it has, does not continue to be utterly irrelevant on the international stage."
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to inform you that a delegation from the Japanese Parliament has arrived in the official gallery."
"We would like to extend a warm welcome to them."
"They are taking part in the 29th EP/Japan Interparliamentary Meeting that is being held in Brussels and Vienna from 2 to 6 June."
"The Japanese delegation is led by Mr Taro Nakayama, a great friend of Europe, and is made up of seven members of the House of Representatives and two members of the House of Councillors."
"This Interparliamentary Meeting has focused on climate change in order to promote a common approach based around the application of the Kyoto Protocol and what will come after it."
"We are very happy with this fruitful, stable and continued cooperation with Japan, a country with which we share the basic values of democracy, respect for human rights and the principle of multilateral cooperation."
"Therefore, welcome to our Japanese friends!"
"(Applause)"
"2006 Annual report on the CFSP - Annual report on the implementation of the European Security Strategy and ESDP (continuation of debate)"
"We will continue with the joint debate on the report by Jacek Saryusz-Wolski, on the 2006 annual report on the CFSP, and the report by Helmut Kuhne, on the implementation of the European Security Strategy and ESDP."
"(PT) I should like to congratulate Mr Kuhne on his excellent report and in particular for the insistence on introducing the Human Security concept in combination with the principle of the responsibility to protect - a concept which Mr Solana has also upheld here."
"These have to be the twin pillars behind a European approach to crisis management missions."
"On the one hand, deciding to intervene in a country under the ESDP must be based on an interpretation of the UN Charter that emphasises the responsibility to protect: the obligation to prevent genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity."
"On the other hand, if the Union finds itself involved in a crisis requiring the use of military means, it is essential for the use of force to be guided by the doctrine of human security."
"This would mean that European troops would have to focus their efforts on setting up safe havens for non-combatant civilian populations, much more than on destroying the enemy with a view to military victory."
"These two principles provide Europe with a coherent crisis management strategy at the beginning of the 21st century."
"Amendment 1 by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament therefore reflects the moral, legal and operational demands we are facing in Afghanistan, Chad and Lebanon and that we will face in the future."
"For these reasons, I find it regrettable that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left rejected this amendment."
"This reactionary alliance insists on turning a blind eye to the primacy of human rights - a concept that would reinforce the legitimacy of and popular support for ESDP missions."
"Mr President, there are, I fear, two problems with the debate this afternoon."
"The first is the claptrap that we hear from the far right about the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The second is that there is a certain complacency about all those, including myself, who strongly defend the Common Foreign, Security and Defence Policy."
"The purpose of a grand European security strategy is not to be admired, but to be followed, and too often the Council and the Member States have failed to follow their excellent strategy."
"The UK and France have failed to deliver the promises of the St Malo Agreement."
"Certain others have insisted on a miserly and self-defeating policy that military costs should lie where they fall."
"What is the point of such a policy when the objective is to spread the burden?"
"The fact is that only 20% of our armed forces can actually fight."
"Several of the ESDP missions are impoverished."
"The absence of a European HQ for the ESDP fragments commands and impairs the pooling of resources."
"The sad problem is that we too often fail to learn from our mistakes, and simply tweaking the security strategy will not make the difference."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have heard the CFSP programme, but it appears a little laughable coming from a Europe that cannot even manage to control its own external borders that are breached every day by thousands of illegal immigrants, traffickers and mafia members."
"A security policy without a basis - if there is one, Mr Solana, please tell us what this basis is!"
"The reports continually mention climate change, but the danger of the possibility of military attacks, terrorist attacks of a biological or even nuclear nature is ignored, even though this danger is far more serious and perhaps real, in view of the threats voiced by Islamist terrorists."
"Europe is weak in terms of political conclusions."
"Look at the Black Sea, for example, which is a kind of chess-board on which there is no European policy."
"This is despite the fact that upon this chess-board our energy future and our security future is decided."
"Where is Europe's political approach on this chess-board?"
"The Lisbon Treaty will not offer anything more than the little that has been achieved: the lack of perspectives of a Europe that has no geopolitical vision."
"Mr Solana, this is a void of 10 years of managing the foreign policy."
"Over those past 10 years all you have achieved is a void!"
"(EL) Mr President, the two reports clearly present the escalation of the EU's aggressiveness and imperialist plans."
"They set out a series of priorities for 2008, the goal of which is the economic, political and military advancement of European capital in the world."
"The EU also aims to plunder peoples and countries, either independently or, where that is not possible, with the assistance of the USA and ΝΑΤΟ."
"In the first report, one of the salient points is interference and starting wars under the statutory smokescreen of excuses such as the fight against terrorism and the 'protection of human rights and democracy'."
"Paragraph 15, Mr Solana, contains the typical, unacceptable and dangerous distinction between democracies and non-democracies."
"Now who has given you the right to describe peoples as democratic or undemocratic?"
"In this context you also use the new term 'human security' as a pretext for preventive wars."
"Furthermore, both reports, especially the second one, promote the EU's greater militarisation due to the new drive for Battle Groups and the creation of a permanent EU military force."
"This is being made possible through the development of Eurocorps, permanent structured cooperation, and adapting the armed forces of Member States to the EU's aggressive plans."
"This follows in the footsteps of ΝΑΤΟ by escalating the EU budget's contribution to weapons and military expenditure."
"Cooperation between the EU and ΝΑΤΟ is being stepped up under the guise of military missions, supposedly non-military police and legal forces."
"These are experts who in reality prepare and handle the EU's military campaigns."
"You vaunt the 17 military missions carried out and call for more."
"The EU you are building is a union of war, aggression and imperialism."
"For this reason, the people must go down the path of resistance, disobedience and insubordination."
"(PL) Mr President, we are talking today about a sphere of competence that has hitherto been reserved for sovereign European states."
"Today the apparition of EU foreign and security policy is becoming a reality as never before, especially following the introduction of the new Lisbon Euro-Constitution."
"As a Polish Member, I do not want and cannot agree to Brussels rather than Warsaw deciding on Polish foreign policy, while German generals at military HQ outside Berlin or Brussels take care of our security."
"Nor do I want Polish soldiers with an EU flag on their uniforms to be acting on behalf of foreign interests in various places in Europe and the world."
"Current trends and the now open structure of the single European state are unacceptable."
"Of course, you can trick your own peoples by not even asking them what they think about the construction of a super-EU, but sooner or later this project will crumble to dust."
"Mr President, today's message should be that the CFSP should more than ever be based on common European values."
"To the ever-increasing security challenges there is one convincing answer: solidarity and enhanced coordination of common foreign and security policies."
"Those value-based objectives should be seen as taking priority over bilateral relations and Javier Solana was right in telling us that what really matters is political will."
"As for energy security, I would like to call on the Commission and the Council to take serious account of Parliament's position from last September on foreign energy security, which also offers some institutional improvements."
"This report also calls on the Commission to concentrate all its efforts on successfully completing the Nabucco pipeline."
"I think it is not a question of one or the other: we should build our own pipeline in practical terms and effectively."
"Finally, it is high time to effectively address the new cyber-challenges, as the rapporteur, Mr Kuhne, mentioned."
"I would like to use the term 'cyber-terrorism'."
"A year ago, one million computers from all over the world were mobilised to block government institutions and banks in Estonia."
"I think the European Parliament too has to prepare a concise stand on how to respond to the threats of the newest technologies, which up to now seem to surpass the progress achieved by the Lisbon Strategy."
"Mr President, I want to address a matter of principle, namely the neo-conservative tendencies of this House on the EU Foreign and Security Policy."
"Seemingly some of us believe that the substance of any foreign policy is dependent on the nature of the political regime pursuing it; therefore it looks as though our main objective has become the export of our political model."
"Unfortunately, the European Union has neither the decision-making mechanisms nor the means to promote effectively an interventionist policy."
"We must change this approach, adopting realism as a base of our external action."
"This means: clearly defining the scope of our foreign policy in accordance with the common existential interests of European citizens; balancing the scope with the resources, while acknowledging that this world contains actors that are different from us and do not always necessarily share our values; learning to operate with them, and giving up narcissism to look for negotiations and cooperation with our opponents, and not only with our friends."
"Certainly we should try to make as many as possible of our foreign interlocutors into our friends, but before doing that and while doing that I believe we have to learn to operate with those who are not like us."
"I believe that we could be more appealing through our means, through our behaviour in promoting our goals rather than by our targets, thus eventually promoting our model in the world."
"(PL) Mr President, there are several aspects that we must consider while discussing the European Union's common foreign policy today."
"The reports by Mr Kuhne and Mr Saryusz-Wolski are really very good, but there are a few elements that are lacking."
"I would like to point out that we should devote greater attention to explaining European foreign policy, including its defence aspect, to the public."
"Our citizens, our public, are perfectly well aware of what comes from us, from the European Union - agricultural policy, policy on infrastructure - but they are never clear about European foreign and defence policy and what it is linked to. Let us not forget that at its inception the European Union was constituted around problems other than this."
"It is also important to consider the Treaty of Lisbon, which will, I trust, enter into force as soon as possible and be the foundation for new EU actions, and to ensure that one of its outcomes is a set of instruments that are as efficient as possible."
"Many of the speakers here have dwelt mostly on military matters."
"Certainly Battle Groups and everything related to the European defence identity are very important, but it is of no less importance to discuss the model of European diplomacy along the lines of how that diplomatic service is to operate."
"It is important that the report emphasises that EU foreign and defence policy is intertwined with a variety of very important areas of life in the European Union."
"It is important to emphasise that we are also introducing the ideas of a common energy policy and energy security as an element of our common European thought."
"To conclude, it is important that we think of foreign and security policy as an extension of the area of security, stability and democracy."
"In this context I note with great approval the strong accent placed on both the Balkans and Georgia."
"(PL) Mr President, the security of people living in Europe is one of the European Union's most important tasks."
"If we take a clear look at Community policy in recent years we see that, beyond political actions, we are militarily lightweight."
"Some European countries, in pursuing their own ambitions, are trying to compete politically and militarily with NATO, of which they are members."
"Concentrating on setting up common Battle Groups, particularly extended commands, rather than professionalising selected units in individual Member States is a mistake."
"It is also a mistake to under-utilise existing NATO structures."
"The Community's strength ought to lie in strong national armies."
"The European Union must resolve conflicts in Europe that are currently frozen, not only by means of declarations, but also through real political actions."
"The recent problems in Georgia have been provoked in part by EU support for Kosovo."
"(ES) Mr President, the Saryusz-Wolski report, which we will adopt tomorrow, is a very complete report that covers practically all the regions of the world affected by the European Union's foreign policy in a balanced way."
"As I have only two minutes I am just going to mention some of the horizontal aspects that the report rightly includes."
"Today foreign policy cannot be explained solely from a geographical point of view."
"There are issues that have a global, horizontal aspect, and they are of such great importance that the main actors in the Union's foreign policy should be involved in them."
"I am referring first of all to the fight against terrorism and organised crime."
"These are matters that the foreign and security policy should pay very particular attention to."
"Another question of great importance is that of migration and the fight against illegal immigration."
"We need to secure the cooperation of the countries of origin and transit countries, and the Union should be resolutely involved through its external action."
"In short, if we want to build an area of security, freedom and justice in the European Union, the external dimension is fundamental, as the Saryusz-Wolski report says."
"This is something that cannot only be the responsibility of the Home Affairs Ministers or of the Commissioner for Justice."
"Another priority horizontal aspect is energy security."
"Given the high level of external dependency of the Member States, we need to move towards a common foreign policy for the Union in the field of energy."
"In addition, due to the clearly global nature of climate change, we need external action by the Union in order to find an effective response to this threat."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I think it is essential to make progress on all these issues and for the Union's foreign policy to form part of this."
"They are issues that concern citizens, and citizens think that the European Union should help to promote them effectively, as State sovereignty is shared precisely in order to tackle the challenges that transcend the individual States and are therefore global challenges."
"Therefore, by making progress in these areas, the European Union will be able to better justify its existence and thus increase its legitimacy as far as public opinion and citizens are concerned."
"Mr President, I congratulate both rapporteurs, and I agree on the importance of the Lisbon Treaty assessments whilst evaluating the CFSP report."
"If we were to have had this discussion in ten days' time, after the decisive referendum - and my belief is that Ireland will say 'yes' - the debate would have been even more concrete and optimistic."
"Nowadays, when threats are on the rise and infiltrate from all sides, if the EU cannot speak with one voice, it is essential to speak at least in a coordinated and stronger manner."
"I agree completely with Mr Solana's assessment."
"It will not be easy to start negotiations on the EU-Russia agreement."
"After a delay of one and a half years there is a risk of losing a similar or even greater amount of time if we are not focused on the most fundamental issues."
"This is why 27 countries have to coordinate their interests, concentrating on those which are common and important for all."
"The alternative to the negotiations being delayed or failing is an amplification of Moscow's bilateral talks with Rome or Vilnius, Berlin or Budapest, Paris or Sofia."
"This is not an attractive option, especially for the new States."
"The response of the Commission and the Council was timely - given the threat of climate change - calling this a central issue."
"The European Parliament should continuously follow and scrutinise the way in which plans and measures are implemented to counter the threat."
"(FI) Mr President, this report stresses the importance of human and civil rights, which is good."
"Trends in energy security are also seen as crucially important."
"It also disapproves of the way that third parties, mainly Russia, use energy as a political tool and Member States sign bilateral energy agreements without EU coordination."
"The EU really needs to take a look in the mirror."
"Russia collaborates directly with EU Member States because the EU does not have any coherent or coordinated energy policy."
"It makes you wonder whether the Member States even want one."
"Russia's role as an important EU energy partner, perhaps its most important, has to be recognised."
"In energy cooperation between Russia and the EU we need to be aiming for a situation where both sides win."
"I believe it is also possible to reach this win-win situation based on political will and far less prejudice."
"An energy policy co-implemented by Russia and the EU should be based on cooperation, not confrontation."
"At present some circles, including a few in the EU, are trying to hamper cooperation by being confrontational."
"For a long time now Russia has wanted to be Europe's equal partner."
"May it be so."
"We certainly know that Russia is not easy to negotiate with."
"The EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy needs to have greater influence in international politics."
"I am very much in favour of Parliament putting pressure on the Council to promote the idea that the EU should have a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council."
"As long as the EU does not have such a seat, it will be difficult to speak with one voice."
"(SK) The document concerned is in essence based on the European Security Strategy adopted by the Council in December 2003, and on the May 2007 resolution on the common foreign and security policy."
"I appreciate the work done by the rapporteur, Mr Saryusz-Wolski, the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, who has given us a comprehensive and high-quality text on which to vote."
"I would like to stress several aspects of European foreign policy which cannot be implemented without strategic cooperation with our strongest ally, the United States."
"This is adequately expressed by the EU-US Transatlantic Partnership Agreement, in which also includes the aspect of economic relations."
"This issue is closely connected with military cooperation as well, not only with the US but also within the framework of NATO."
"Of course it is necessary to clarify and say once and for all whether the security umbrella created by the radar system in Poland and the Czech Republic will serve and protect effectively common European interests, or whether it is just a unilateral initiative designed to protect against threats from Asia."
"I have in mind the conduct of Iran in the Middle East region in particular."
"We all know that Iran provides military and financial support to Syria and in particular to the terrorist groups operating in the region, groups that pose a constant threat to stability and peace through Hezbollah operations in southern Lebanon and Syria."
"Iran makes no secret of its desire to achieve a hegemonic position and its military nuclear programme is meant to help it reach this goal."
"However, I must ask whether it is possible to refer in the external policy document under discussion today to the Lisbon Treaty, which occurs on a number of occasions, since the Treaty is not yet in force as the ratification process has not yet been completed by all the Member States."
"I have one more question: under what legal provision has the European Union sent the EULEX mission to Kosovo?"
"Was it not, in fact, an ante legem act?"
"I am sure that there is no UN resolution that would justify such a move."
"Mr President, the world in which the EU is called upon to further its integration towards a truly common foreign policy gets more complex every day."
"The prospect of economic recession, fuelled by the current financial crisis and increasing energy costs, the unsatisfactory status of transatlantic relations and the increasing assertiveness of Russia, which confront Europe more and more with old-style geopolitical challenges for which it is no longer equipped, are only a reflection of the current international environment."
"In this context, against the background of increasing EU dependence on Russian supplies, energy tends to become the litmus test for success or failure in achieving the aim of a common EU foreign policy, because it makes all the difference whether Europe agrees to create a single energy market and consequently approaches suppliers, primarily Russia, with one voice, or continues to preserve the current national divides and give priority to bilateral preferential supply contracts destined to satisfy its increasing energy needs."
"Today world politics is first and foremost about gas and oil."
"Mr President, I support the development of CFSP, including ESDP, and the changes introduced by the Lisbon Treaty to these policy areas."
"This is also the position of the Irish Government."
"These changes will enable the EU to develop its capabilities for conflict prevention and crisis management, while ensuring that any new arrangements are fully consistent with Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality."
"To the fellow travellers of Sinn Fein who are propagating misinformation on the Lisbon Treaty, I say to you that there is a triple lock system in Ireland on the deployment of troops: first of all, there must be a UN decision; secondly, there must be a government decision; and thirdly, it must be approved by Dáil Éireann, the national parliament."
"This is not going to change after Lisbon."
"The current UN-authorised EU mission in Chad, in which Ireland is playing a leading role, is a prime example of the EU's activities in this area."
"As someone who has recently visited Chad and the EU peacekeeping mission base in the east of this country, I am convinced that this mission will provide security for the provision of humanitarian relief to hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced persons, as well as protection for humanitarian personnel in the field."
"This ESDP mission to Chad is the first time that a peacekeeping operation has been launched by the EU in almost perfect harmony with all stakeholders."
"Other missions with Irish involvement have included police training in the Palestinian territories, monitoring of the peace process between rebels and government in Indonesia, and providing support to the police authorities in Bosnia."
"There have been more than 20 such missions since 2003."
"There are increasing requests to the EU to provide assistance and support in these areas."
"The key point regarding the totality of these initiatives is that their purpose is to make EU peacekeeping and crisis management activities more effective."
"From a national perspective, we retain a veto on any developments with which we disagree, and we retain the sovereign right to decide on participation in any crisis management mission in accordance with our own legislative requirements."
"This is one of the many reasons why Irish people should come out to vote 'yes' on 12 June."
"Before we move on, I should like to welcome all our visitors to the visitors' gallery, but especially a group from my own constituency in Yorkshire and the Humber."
"(FR) Mr President, High Commissioner, I am addressing you directly to ask about the persecution suffered by Christians in Algeria."
"What steps has the European Union taken with regard to the persecution of Christians in a State with which we have close links?"
"Religious freedom is enshrined in Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which also imposes an obligation on each State to ensure that these rights are respected."
"Algeria is a member of the United Nations, but it is ignoring this fundamental right."
"Christians are citizens in their own right; they have the same right to practise their religion as any other religious community."
"This is why I am imploring you, High Commissioner, to use all direct or indirect diplomatic channels to put an end to the persecution of Christians."
"The credibility of the European Union is also at stake here."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Solana, I believe that the debate has shown very clearly that the European Union can truly be a political union only under certain conditions."
"Firstly, only if the Treaty of Lisbon is ratified and, secondly, only if there is an actual European Security and Defence Policy worthy of the name, that is, when it develops into something better."
"Then the European Union will have the opportunity to move from being a global payer towards becoming a global player."
"There is no doubt that our initial efforts in Chad were not our finest hour, but it is a case study from which we as the European Union have been able to learn because, quite simply, the shortcomings became very obvious."
"This showed once again that the European Security and Defence Policy requires compatible systems and new and rapid mechanisms for making troops available."
"The time for debate is over; now is the time for us to act!"
"(HU) Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Kuhne on his excellent report."
"He is completely right that 2008 will be a defining year for the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"Not only because of the Lisbon Treaty, but also because Kosovo will be the greatest test of whether the EU will be ready to politicise Kosovo appropriately."
"Unfortunately, there is still no agreement between the UN and the EU, and unfortunately we have not prepared on an intellectual level either, since we have not learned the lessons from our presence in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"With regard to the second report, I consider the anti-Russian slant of Mr Saryusz-Wolski's report to be unfortunate."
"Russia may and must be criticised, but at the same time she is an unavoidable strategic partner, and the deepening of cooperation is a mutual interest."
"It is not because the Member States of the EU conclude bilateral agreements that there is no common energy policy, but because, since there is no common energy policy, there is nothing to which the interests of the Member States can be adjusted or with which they can be aligned, so the criticism of Mr Saryusz-Wolski's report is unacceptable. Thank you for your attention."
"(SK) Like others before me, I, too, want to express my thanks for the work done by Mr Saryusz-Wolski and Mr Kuhne, namely the balance they achieved between the social, legal and economic aspects in the report."
"I expect that in the future it will be very important for us to give more weight to, and be better prepared for, dealings with our two biggest partners: the United States and Russia."
"There is a new President in Russia."
"Soon there will be a new administration in the United States."
"Consequently, it will be quite right to focus precisely on these two countries in our common foreign policy."
"Regarding the economic dimension, priority must be given to the need to ensure energy security in the European Union in particular."
"I trust that progress will be made in the negotiations with the Russian Federation on this issue."
"Since we are discussing our two partners here, let me say that it would help if we acted as an equal, and equally competent, partner in our relations with both parties, be it the United States or the Russian Federation, and if the policies were balanced."
"Finally, Mr President, I would like to say that I welcome the references to the Lisbon Treaty."
"By referring to it in the report we show that Parliament envisages its ratification and is fully behind it."
"(CS) Thank you, Mr President."
"Mr Solana had not been seen among us for quite some time and I was worried about his health."
"Now I can see that he is healthy and well, that following the Kosovo event he did not hang himself as Judas Iscariot did."
"This means that I can ask him whether he knew that Hasim Thaci and his pals had been trafficking in human organs of Serbian captives."
"Did he know this or not?"
"(PL) Mr President, both rapporteurs have gained my full recognition."
"These are good documents."
"I would, however, like to draw attention to several matters linked to foreign and defence policy."
"I have in mind here our European potential in the following areas."
"Demography - this potential is diminishing."
"Economic potential is not bad, but financial crises threaten us."
"Military potential - disunited, scattered - we can see how it is."
"Energy potential, potential in access to water and to food."
"We have spoken of other threats, to which I would like to add epidemiological threats and information security, for example."
"Foreign policy today should, in my view, include union with countries that are close to us in terms of civilisation, cooperation with all who wish to cooperate and a firm position with regard to the rest."
"(HU) 88 years ago today, the European superpowers made some decisions on security policy, in the Treaty of Trianon that ended the First World War, that ignored the rights of national minorities, or only guaranteed them on paper."
"The Treaty of Paris after the Second World War did not solve the problems either."
"The question of security policy was reduced to a guarantee of the inviolability of borders."
"Many of the borders created then have ceased to be, and Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia do not exist."
"The question of minorities remains."
"We Hungarians have ended up in eight countries, of which thus far only Slovenia has been able to resolve the rights of the Hungarian community in a reassuring way."
"According to the report, progress must be made in harmony with European standards in the interests of ensuring real protection for the rights of minorities."
"But what sort of European standards?"
"It would be good to press for what we expect from the Western Balkans within the EU itself."
"According to the Latin proverb, 'If you want peace, prepare for war.'"
"Today, we want a secure Europe."
"The rights of minorities must be settled both within and outside the EU, using the instruments of regional and cultural autonomy that have been proven to work in the western half of Europe. Thank you."
"High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. - Mr President, I would like to answer the two or three questions that have been addressed directly to me."
"Firstly, that of Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra."
"(ES) Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, I will say yes to the two questions that you have asked me, but allow me to say that first of all we are going to see if the Treaty is adopted."
"Issues based on the ratification of the Treaty will have to wait and the agreements will probably have to come later."
"(FR) Mrs Záborská, we are looking into this matter."
"Since Mrs Záborská is not here, I will save my answer until later."
"At the Agency we are working very hard on interoperability: that is something that you asked about, and the answer is 'yes'."
"As regards the other questions, I answered them when I spoke earlier."
"I have taken careful note of all the speeches and I hope that, as time goes by - as we approach the moment of truth - after the ratification of the Treaty, we will be able together to put into practice some of the ideas that have been suggested here."
"Before they speak, I would again like to congratulate the two rapporteurs, as I said publicly before."
"Finally, I would like to say that I agree completely with what Commissioner Verheugen said in his last speech, and I will not add any more to that."
"Mr President, it is difficult to summarise this debate in a few words, but I am pleased with its content."
"The need for collaboration between Parliament, the Council, the Commission and the Member States is the most important conclusion we can draw from this."
"Secondly, the content enjoys fairly broad agreement."
"Thirdly, we recognise that many extremely valuable things have already been accomplished."
"Finally, we emphasise the need to redouble our efforts."
"Commissioner, Vice-President Verheugen quite rightly reminded us of the immense contribution of Community policies, as managed by the European Commission."
"I share his position, because integrated foreign policy would be incomplete without the results obtained with Community policies."
"For the first time, I think that this is a debate in preparation for the appointment of the future 'double-hatted' EU Foreign Minister."
"Which brings me to ask the question: what shall we do without this creative tension?"
"(FR) ... in future, when there is only one institution."
"I agree with the idea that we need a stronger foreign policy for the institutions in terms of content."
"Energy security is the most frequently raised subject."
"The country or geographical location which has been mentioned most often seems to be Afghanistan, as if it were a test for the European Union and for the entire international community."
"There were several points of divergence."
"Without these differences to fuel our debates, these might be a bit boring."
"I therefore hope that future debates will be as lively and as rich as this one."
"However, we have reached an agreement on the key principles, which looks very promising, and I hope that the Council, the High Representative and the Commission, with the very modest contribution of Parliament of course, are able in future to build a foreign policy for the Union which is even stronger, greater and more ambitious."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, this final chance to speak gives me the opportunity to do something I did not have time to do earlier on - to thank Commissioner Verheugen and Mr Solana for the excellent cooperation with their staff, who were available for discussions and from whom I learnt a great deal."
"This had a very positive effect on the report."
"I would also like to thank the all the committee members, particularly the committee chairman and rapporteur for the other report, Mr Saryusz-Wolski."
"We occasionally sent notes to each other, like schoolboys, when we had overlapping issues in our reports, in order to achieve the same wording."
"That also worked very well."
"I would like to add three points:"
"First in English, since some of the speakers addressed the question of the Irish referendum."
"On the legend of militarisation: my report contains a full list of arms control and disarmament proposals - a whole page of it."
"Secondly, the Lisbon Treaty retains the right of every Member State to stay away from EU missions, especially military missions."
"This right is not infringed by the Lisbon Treaty in any way."
"It was very interesting to hear self-proclaimed advocates of NATO expressing their fear for the independence of neutral Ireland as part of the ESDP."
"I think that was very interesting."
"A final point, which Mr Pflüger mentioned, relates to the issue of parliamentary scrutiny: I do not know whether this was a deliberate misunderstanding, but the text that occurs in both Mr Saryusz-Wolski's report and my own does not preclude groups having access to confidential information."
"The formulation is an open one."
"Here in Parliament, we must first do our homework in order to develop some kind of negotiating position in relation to the Council."
"What level of security clearance do we want to grant to how many Members?"
"It may well be that we say that all groups are granted a certain level, and some groups another level, and so on. We will have to develop that ourselves first, and neither of our proposals prevents the groups from participating in this."
"I do not know whether this was a deliberate misunderstanding, or if the text was so unintelligible - I do not think it was - but we should first sit down together here in Parliament and develop our own negotiating position in relation to the Council."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 5 June 2008."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"I would like to stress the significance of this report and to thank the rapporteur for having included all my suggestions in the final text."
"In the context of the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty and of the future competences of the European Parliament, it is necessary to sum-up the operations of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and to draft its priority objectives for 2008 and 2009."
"The reinforcement of the European Neighbourhood Policy must be a major objective for 2008."
"Regarding the quality of rapport on the Black Sea Region Cooperation issues, I would like to stress the importance of its development in the near future."
"If 2007 was the year of laying down EU policy regarding this space, 2008 must focus on the practical application of the Black Sea Synergy."
"It is also very important to mobilise all efforts for the successful and fastest possible implementation of the Nabucco energy project, as well as resolve the conflicts in the region."
"Finally, the West Balkan countries and their proximity to the EU must also be a priority in EU Foreign Policy."
"Out of the series of issues that must be thoroughly monitored in this region, I would like to underline the need for effectively protecting the rights of minorities, including the rights of Romanian speakers."
"in writing. - (PL) To begin with I would like to congratulate Mr Saryusz-Wolski on preparing a very good report."
"I would like to highlight a few of the ideas we encounter when reading this report."
"The most disturbing of these is the growing dependence of the EU on energy supplies from countries that are unstable and undemocratic."
"We find an absolute lack of coordination in the signing of bilateral energy agreements by Member States that threaten the interests of and place question marks over EU strategic projects."
"Actions of this type taken by certain Member States are significantly diluting the bargaining power of the European Union and its efforts to set up a common foreign policy."
"I would like once again to emphasise the strategic significance of the Nabucco pipeline for the EU's energy security, and to call on the European Commission and the Council to apply every effort to step up work on this project."
"With reference to the two-day conference devoted to European Neighbourhood Policy that I am co-organising during the current Parliamentary session, I would like to stress the importance of actions aimed at reinforcing this policy."
"The continuation of unresolved conflicts in countries covered by the ENP constitutes a serious challenge to EU security."
"To sum up, I feel that reinforcing an eastern neighbourhood policy and putting an end to the provocation of conflicts beyond our eastern border, along with ensuring energy security, should be the EU's foreign policy priority."
"in writing. - The report reflects correctly our opinions on the evolution of the CFSP in the future."
"The CFSP is a crucially important element in the EU's foreign policy."
"I would like to welcome the improvements brought by the Lisbon Treaty regarding external actions."
"Its implementation would make the CFSP more efficient and more coherent."
"The new posts created by the Treaty could give a greater visibility to the EU, but I believe it is essential to define the different roles in order to ensure that their different functions contribute to the coherence and efficiency of the CFSP."
"If we want the EU to be an active force for international peace and stability, we must have all the necessary tools and instruments at our disposal; but to achieve this, more political will from the Member States is needed."
"The EU presence in the globe is widening, and we can find EU missions all over the world."
"By helping to build security and stability in the wider world, the EU is also helping to make life safer for her own people."
"This is the best way to defend its security and promote its values."
"In my opinion these are steps in the right direction."
"I support the report that has been presented."
"In my view, it is a balanced and non-confrontational document."
"An evaluation of the EU's foreign policy is particularly necessary at present, especially in the context of the changes proposed in this area by the Lisbon Treaty."
"I have no doubt that this Treaty, by buttressing the role of the High Representative, will enable a more far-sighted and long-term strategy to be practised in EU foreign policy."
"The fact that the European Union as a whole is based on common values means that these same values must be reflected in its common foreign and security policy."
"This is the only approach that will give the EU credibility in the international arena."
"The CFSP demands, on the one hand, political unity among the Member States and, on the other hand, respect for the principles of solidarity, especially in the building of new EU political strategies."
"I therefore share the regret and concern expressed in the report at the lack of progress in building a common European energy policy."
"I am also unable to accept the fact that some Member States are concluding individual, bilateral agreements for energy supplies from Russia."
"This is significantly weakening the bargaining position of the European Union as a whole and its efforts to build a common energy policy."
"This is all the sadder inasmuch as not so very long ago these very States were criticising individual visa agreements with the United States, accusing Central European States that had concluded such agreements of weakening the common European visa policy."
"Mr President, the European Union is becoming a global player in the world arena, and the best proof of this is the geography of Community involvement."
"You only need to refer to the Council's operational decisions of 2007 and early 2008 mentioned in Mr Kuhne's report: the police mission in Afghanistan, the military operation in Chad, the reconfiguration of troops in Bosnia and the preparation for missions in Kosovo and Guinea-Bissau."
"Unfortunately, the world geography of involvement is not going hand in hand with the elimination of deficiencies that have been evident for some time now, in the form of a lack of a civil peace corps in the EU, transport shortages and uneven commitment by individual countries."
"In the light of information that has recently been received, a new dimension needs to be introduced into the debate on European security."
"I am talking about the security of European institutions in Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg."
"The unmasking of terrorist groups that have chosen EU institutions as the target for their attacks means that the issue of security has ceased to be a theoretical one."
"It forces us to re-evaluate our current principles."
"We are aware that the European Parliament is by nature easily accessible, and it is difficult to find a golden mean between the openness of this institution and heightened security demands."
"This is, however, becoming a necessity, which should be reflected in the budget for 2009."
"This matter is not as weighty as other problems covered by the report, but it does deserve attention."
"in writing. - (ET) Ladies and gentlemen, effective foreign and security policy cannot be made by Member States individually."
"A bilateral approach on energy and foreign policy issues has a destructive influence on how seriously we are taken."
"It is unacceptable that the weight of the European Union in international relations has hitherto often been less than that of certain Member States."
"The European Union must speak to the world's large countries, especially the Russian Federation, with one voice which proceeds from the common interest of all 27 Member States."
"Only then will we be viewed as an equal partner both in America and Asia."
"I welcome the fact that Mr Saryusz-Wolski's report highlights strengthening European Neighbourhood Policy as the main objective for 2008."
"The European Neighbourhood Policy East Conference which is being held in the European Parliament today and tomorrow shows that we take our own objective seriously."
"Action in the fields of democratising our neighbours and resolving conflict is urgently needed for European Union security."
"We must help Moldova resolve the Transnistria conflict."
"As the Chair of the Moldova delegation I must also note that the prospect of European Union membership is of great importance for both Moldova and Ukraine."
"That possibility is the driving force behind economic reforms and democratisation."
"It will of course take time to comply with the three Copenhagen criteria, although Moldova and Ukraine have shown themselves ready for European development."
"The fourth Copenhagen criterion, namely the EU's capacity to absorb, should not in any circumstances be a barrier to the accession of these two European countries to the European Union."
"There is no question that enlargement must continue."
"in writing. - (FI) My thanks go to the rapporteur for an excellent, comprehensive report."
"I agree with him that it is important for the Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy to focus over the years to come more steadily on the development of structures and procedures to enable the Union to react faster and more effectively to international crises."
"Civil crisis management, peacekeeping and the protection of human rights are the cornerstones of the CFSP."
"With the Treaty of Lisbon the EU's external policy will have a new leading figure in the shape of the High Representative of the Union."
"The changes the Treaty will bring with it will be an opportunity for shaping a more effective, more coherent foreign and security policy. The EU needs to speak and act more consistently in the world arenas."
"I hope, however, that in its future annual reports Parliament will adopt a firmer position on a more coherent, stronger role for the EU in the United Nations."
"The EU is an economic and political superpower."
"Over the years the Union has seen its importance grow internationally and its main mission now must be to build a global organisation which respects people and the environment."
"The EU must invest time and energy in the Mediterranean, Baltic and Black Sea regions to develop economic cooperation, political stability and democracy there."
"More resources in the future will be needed to implement the Baltic Strategy, increase cohesion in the region and solve its environmental problems."
"Support for, and closer integration with, the Black Sea region as part of the EU's Neighbourhood Policy will be a means of increasing political stability both in the EU and more widely in the Black Sea area."
"The Kuhne Report on the application of the European and PESA Security Strategy is well-structured, taking into account that it identifies real issues and offers possible solutions."
"I think that this kind of operational ""checklist” approach will facilitate the monitoring of the progress."
"In terms of content, I would like to make the following notes:"
"1."
"They should mention the European College of Security and Defence which plays an important role in the development of a common agreement of PESA by means of the training provided on a strategic level, especially in the context in which the chairperson of SEDE, von Wogau, sent a letter addressed to SG/HR Solana in which he showed support for the activity of ESDC."
"2."
"The declaration regarding EU-NATO relations could have comprised a stronger message, in light of the Declaration of Bucharest adopted at the NATO summit."
"3."
"They could have mentioned the importance of the strategic partnership between the EU and NATO."
"The statement according to which ""a stronger European Union will contribute to the common security” might be combined with the principle of indivisibility of the allies' security, which is thus extended upon the EU."
"in writing. - The report of Mr Saryusz-Wolski reaffirms the European Union's commitment to the UN Millennium Development Goals, but this phrase in itself has become a little shallow, as it is being used lavishly in the EU development policy discourse, when very little progress is actually made and the MDGs are still beyond our reach."
"Of all the Member States only Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Sweden are contributing more than 0.7% of their GDP to Official Development Assistance, although the 0.7% target was adopted as early as October 24, 1970 within the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade."
"I am convinced that ensuring the credibility of the EU as a global player should be a significant part of the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"Fulfilling the commitments that we have taken would be an excellent start."
"The EU and its Member States must transform the verbose declarations reaffirming their commitments into harmonised and collectively effective action."
"In my opinion this can only be achieved when pooling resources and establishing one single EU institution responsible for the accumulation, allocation and disbursement of the Official Development Assistance."
"in writing. - (FI) With the Treaty of Lisbon the EU will become militarised, as the Common Foreign and Security Policy will incorporate an extra component in the shape of a common security and defence policy."
"It will make it harder for non-aligned countries to retain their non-aligned status."
"That will be the case when the Member States place themselves under an obligation to increase their military expenditure."
"That will be the case when a new military hard core is created for the EU: permanent, structural cooperation."
"That is to get under way during this French Presidency."
"Mr Saryusz-Wolski's report is unfortunately in favour of the militarisation of the EU."
"The report's emphasis on energy security is also very aggressive from Poland's very one-sided view."
"EU-United States summit"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the next EU-United States summit."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, let me say something about the coming EU-US summit."
"I shall use my own language, if you will permit me."
"(SL) Although the relationship between the European Union and the United States of America is essentially bilateral, the results of this relationship have global effects."
"The transatlantic partnership ceased to be merely economic long ago."
"The European Union and the United States cooperate closely both bilaterally and within international organisations on settling unresolved issues, including the most pressing regional issues, such as Afghanistan, the Middle East, and the Western Balkans."
"As in all relationships, the European Union and the United States do, of course, sometimes have differences of opinion on certain issues, but we resolve them successfully with a constructive approach and mutual understanding."
"The European Union and the United States are an important, the most important, system which has a considerable effect on international relations."
"We have our differences but for the most part we work together as allies and friends."
"We have many common values and a historical link, throughout the twentieth century in fact, and in the end we stood together, side by side, during the end of the Cold War and the expansion of Euro-Atlantic links."
"Since the European Union finds it more difficult to reach consensus than the US, relations are, naturally, not straightforward."
"However, consensus cannot always be reached within the United States either."
"If we look at the reports from the election campaign we can see that consensus is difficult to reach even within the same party."
"The European Union is united in diversity and, I should say, proud of it."
"That is also the starting point of the Lisbon Treaty which, I hope, will enter into force at the beginning of next year."
"During our Presidency of the European Council Slovenia has devoted a great deal of attention to strengthening transatlantic relations, in particular the strategic dimension to them."
"I should point out that we have already held a large number of important meetings such as the troika meeting of EU and US foreign ministers, the meeting of political directors, and the EU-US ministerial troika meeting on justice and home affairs; and in May a meeting between European and American legislators was also held in Ljubljana."
"However, the most important event in connection with transatlantic relations will be the EU-US Summit which Slovenia will host in Brdo pri Kranju on 10 June."
"I am pleased to be able to say that we expect the event to be well prepared, and we have already done a great deal of work."
"At the summit we will also have an opportunity to explain the importance of the partnership between the European Union and the United States to the public at large and to demonstrate our common values, productive dialogue and compatible interests when dealing with urgent regional and global problems."
"The summit will be divided into four parts, namely the meeting of the heads of state, the plenary session, and lunch, which will be followed by a press conference."
"The heads of state will discuss the most pressing regional issues such as the Middle East, the Balkans, Central Asia and so forth, the Caucasus, and Iran, while other regional issues will be discussed at the plenary session and at lunch."
"The talks will also touch upon other global issues, such as climate change, energy, the negotiations within the World Trade Organisation, development, health and security, and free trade and the free movement of persons."
"At the plenary session, the summit will see the first presentation of the Progress Report of the Transatlantic Economic Council, which was established at the 2007 EU-US Summit in Washington and within which the European Parliament also plays an important role as an advisory body through the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue."
"The Progress Report of the Transatlantic Economic Council meeting held in Brussels on 13 May will be presented by the Council co-chairs, the Assistant to the US President for International Economic Affairs, Daniel Price, and the Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry and Vice President of the European Commission, Günter Verheugen, who is present here today."
"The press conference following the talks will be an important part of the summit since it will provide an opportunity to send a positive message to the European and world public about progress in transatlantic relations and planned joint projects."
"The document to be adopted at the summit has been the subject of many months of talks between the European Union and the United States."
"We are drawing up a declaration, to encompass the entire range of transatlantic cooperation."
"Among other matters, it will touch upon regional issues, global security, transatlantic economic partnership, and global challenges, including climate change and energy."
"Our intention and the Presidency's objective is to draw up a brief and concise document with a firm political message, and I hope that we will succeed in doing so."
"Even with regard to climate change, on which views differ, we have found, I hope, a compromise solution."
"The proposed brief and factual text on climate change retains the most important objectives of the European Union and at the same time takes account of the views of the United States - I will not repeat matters which are well known to this Parliament."
"The declaration is being adjusted in the Transatlantic Relations Working Party - COTRA - and the progress of the talks has also been presented at the Political and Security Committee on 20 May, at the meeting of the Permanent Representatives of the Member States to the European Union at COREPER on 21 May, and at the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) last week, on 26 May."
"We are endeavouring to set a the date for the signing of the Air Safety Agreement - adjustment of which is now in its final stage - and we would like to be able to sign it at least by the end of our Presidency, that is to say by the end of June."
"Furthermore, we support the earliest possible establishment of 'open skies', which will represent further liberalisation of transatlantic air transport and a new stage in relations between the European Union and the United States which will benefit people on both sides of the Atlantic."
"The Slovenian Presidency is aware of the fact that some Member States have still not been included in the Visa Waiver Programme, which enables visa-free travel to the United States."
"We have devoted a great deal of attention to this matter in all contacts with the United States and in our preparations for the summit."
"The Slovenian Presidency has reached a compromise whereby the Member States of the European Union will enter into bilateral arrangements other than where matters for which the Commission is responsible are involved."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I assure you that the Slovenian Presidency will invest a great deal of energy in its preparations for the summit and therefore I am convinced that we will be able to deem the summit in Slovenia a success."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is today an important, valued partner of many countries."
"In an increasingly multipolar world, we have entered into strategic partnerships with our most important partners."
"However, we have more in common with the United States than with all the European Union's other strategic partners."
"We share a major part of the responsibility for a fairer world, in which we all share in the prosperity and in which our security is solidly anchored politically, economically, socially, ecologically and also militarily."
"This partnership is as ambitious as it is hard work."
"It requires us Europeans to demonstrate more solidarity in the international arena, but it also requires a rethink on the part of our American friends, as it requires them to accept that the role of leadership in the world must be shared."
"The situation calls for an openness that amounts to more than simplistic pro-European or pro-American, anti-European or anti-American reactions."
"What we need is a broad awareness that there is not much that divides us, but a great deal more that connects us."
"A range of important issues will be discussed at the EU-US Summit."
"In the area of foreign policy, the discussion will focus on cooperation between the EU and the United States in the Western Balkans, especially Kosovo, and in the Middle East."
"Also on the agenda is a discussion on how we will work together to tackle climate change."
"This is a difficult topic on which the EU and the United States are still very far apart."
"Nevertheless, the political debate in the United States has changed considerably, and it is moving in our direction."
"Our European goal is to achieve an ambitious, substantial agreement for the period after 2012 within the framework of the global negotiation process under the umbrella of the United Nations."
"It should be an agreement on which we have the world's most important industrialised nation, the United States of America, on board."
"Energy policy is also on the agenda."
"We want to push ahead with cooperation in science and technology and at the same time, we need constructive, open dialogue with our traditional and potential energy suppliers."
"It would be sensible for us to exchange experiences in a transatlantic context."
"Our cooperation in the fight against international terrorism became a key joint concern on 11 September 2001, if not before."
"We want to improve the opportunities to exchange personal information for the purposes of tracing wanted persons."
"However, this presupposes that we develop and observe joint principles for data protection."
"It was inevitable that visa freedom would be a topic at this summit."
"Last year, the reform of the US visa waiver programme opened the way to finding a solution."
"The Member States and the Commission are working hand in hand on this - I am delighted to be able to say this - with the Commission concentrating on the Community competences."
"I must state quite clearly that, politically, it is incomprehensible that we Europeans, who are united under the Schengen system, are treated differently when we enter our most important partner country."
"Therefore, we will remind the President of the United States of the promise he made to lift the requirement for a visa."
"Let me now turn to economic relations, which the President-in-Office has commented on."
"The creation last year of the Transatlantic Economic Council, the TEC, brought into being a political instrument to drive forward transatlantic economic integration."
"This economic growth is the heart of the global economy."
"It is the centre of gravity for trade and investment worldwide and will remain so for many years to come."
"Therefore, we are determined to use the TEC to find solutions to questions that have remained open for years - some of them for 10, 15 or even 20 years - and which represent significant barriers to transatlantic trade."
"The 'report card' after the first year is good."
"We successfully tackled the first, difficult questions."
"Above all, we have managed to create a spirit of cooperation and mutual trust such as we have not known before."
"I am glad that we can count on the full support of the European Parliament, which is involved in every phase of this cooperation."
"We have good working relationships with all existing transatlantic dialogue partners and I am also thankful for the support of the Council, which will continue to be important in the future too."
"There are a number of tangible results: we have moved forward as regards the product safety of imported goods; we have gained acceptance of European financial reporting standards by the United States; we have a common point of view on the promotion of an open environment for global investment, on which the summit will also issue a statement."
"We are already cooperating more closely on proposed legislation and we want to pursue common European-US standards, so that we do not have to compete against each other with our standards on the world's markets."
"We are a significant step closer to mutual recognition of safety regulations for electric appliances, something we Europeans have been asking the Americans for for many years."
"The Americans have reopened that particular file, something we did not expect to happen so soon."
"We have started to coordinate our economic policy interests towards third countries and in the international context."
"As yet there is no breakthrough with regard to the 100% scanning of freight containers."
"This is very worrying."
"I would therefore ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to make good use of your contacts in Congress, because this was a decision by the US Congress, not the US Government, which is why my efforts to find a solution in talks with the US Government are not very promising."
"Congress must act; the Government cannot."
"I hope that your contacts in Congress will help us here."
"The Commission has presented two proposals in connection with the work of the Transatlantic Economic Council, relating to the import ban on American poultry."
"We propose lifting this ban on poultry imports."
"It is not legally or scientifically tenable."
"I realise that the debate about this has sometimes been very emotional, obviously without full knowledge of the background and circumstances."
"I would ask everyone who wants to say something about this topic to inform themselves fully first."
"Besides, it is a question that was arbitrarily withdrawn from parliamentary debate for many years, as I have discovered."
"We must not allow protectionism to put the case, nor should we take the arrogant position that our solutions are the only good ones for consumers and that the way other people do things is automatically bad."
"It may well be the case that something different is not worse than what we do."
"This has to be assessed on a case by case basis."
"Just because something is different does not mean that it is not as good."
"If we do not solve this problem, which is basically a very minor problem, but one that is deeply significant for the Americans, we will not have even the remotest chance - and I say this in all seriousness - of bringing the major agricultural policy topics we want to discuss with the Americans to the negotiating table."
"For example, we will get nowhere with the requests we want to make of the Americans in the area of agriculture."
"I am directing this remark to the European Agriculture Ministers, who thought it appropriate to say no to this initiative before they had even looked at it."
"They have caused themselves great harm."
"I have no illusions: all the issues that the Transatlantic Economic Council deals with are difficult and nothing will get done quickly."
"However, with the necessary wisdom and farsightedness, all these issues can be resolved on both sides."
"This instrument is too important, and too valuable, to squander."
"Furthermore, in the light of the stalled Doha negotiations, its value cannot be underestimated even though we have every interest in seeing the world trade round through to a successful conclusion, with a result that is beneficial to all involved."
"At the summit, we will achieve a speedy conclusion to negotiations on the second stage of the Air Transport Agreement, which will give the transatlantic economy an additional boost."
"Ladies and gentlemen, overall, the way relations between the EU and the Unites States are developing is very pleasing."
"Regardless of the opposing paths that inevitably occur, our relations are constructive and future-oriented."
"We hope that this summit will send a further strong signal that we are partners who are committed to taking responsibility for the transatlantic region and resolving global issues, regardless of the different legislative periods and different terms of office applicable to the Administration, the Council, Parliament and the Commission."
"I would be sincerely grateful if the European Parliament would continue to support and promote this process energetically."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, a few days ago we were with the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue in Ljubljana and we very much welcomed the Slovenian Presidency's warm reception there."
"The debates we had with our congressional colleagues showed just how broad an agenda has now developed between the US Congress and the European Parliament in this transatlantic framework: economic issues, which we heard the Commissioner talk about just now, political issues, which could also be economic, like climate change, but also difficult issues like Afghanistan and the broader security concept."
"Therefore, we welcome this debate before the EU-US summit next week."
"I have three short reflections to give to this debate."
"Firstly, when you have such a broad agenda of so many different issues, which is of quite a different nature from that of ten years ago, we surely need to begin to build some form of common approach to a security dimension, a security strategy."
"We had a debate just now on the European security strategy."
"We need to begin to match that up with US security strategy in the longer term so that we can then approach these problems on a broader base together."
"Secondly, there is a real absence of the legislators' dialogue in this debate."
"We are put to one side, as it were, in Ljubljana and then the summit meets in Ljubljana two weeks hence."
"It looks rather like a 19th century organisation, because there is no real contact between the administrations' and the legislators' dialogues."
"Surely, as this motion for a resolution indicates, we now need to plan for a transatlantic assembly where you can get the main legislators on both sides of the Atlantic to talk with each other and come to common initiatives together."
"My last point is a personal reflection: as we have the EU, US and NATO all coming to deal with these issues together, perhaps it would be an idea at the NATO summit in Kehl, to be held in the spring of 2009, for the EU-US summit to meet in the margins of the NATO summit to show that NATO, the EU and the US are handling these problems jointly."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group, I should like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their introductory speeches."
"I share the conclusion of Commissioner Verheugen that the atmosphere is positive, better that it was a few years ago."
"Of course, we expect even more improvement when a new government takes office early next year."
"I believe that both candidates want change, want greater investment on the part of the United States in international cooperation and multilateral institutions."
"That too offers prospects for even greater improvement in the relations between the European Union and the United States."
"You will forgive me for having a preference for one of the two candidates, of course, and today it has become clear who those candidates will be."
"There are a number of problems that do remain on the agenda, however."
"I shall not discuss economic cooperation, as Commissioner Verheugen has already touched upon that point and we had an extensive debate on the issue a few weeks ago."
"One point that I should like to raise once again, as I did in the previous debate, is the issue of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons."
"It is time for a new initiative."
"I believe that the United States should make a gesture, for example by signing the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty; however, there are new opportunities regarding the conclusion of agreements on the multilateralisation of the nuclear fuel cycle."
"I am happy with what has already been said by presidential candidate John McCain on the withdrawal of tactical nuclear weapons from Europe, an indication that he is taking this agenda seriously."
"The second point is the issue of the anti-missile defence system."
"My colleague Mr Rouček will say more on the topic, which continues to be important to us, as we believe that this cannot be unilaterally regulated in the bilateral negotiations under way with a number of NATO member states."
"It is a European problem; it affects the security situation in Europe."
"At the very least, it should have been discussed multilaterally within the competent European bodies."
"I share the criticism regarding the lack of agreement thus far in relation to visas and the Visa Waiver Program."
"We believe of course that all EU Member States, especially the states that form the Schengen area, should be fully incorporated into the programme."
"Now that the Commission is able to enter into negotiations itself, I hope that it will make headway in this regard."
"One further observation by way of conclusion: we continue to be dissatisfied with American responses to our complaints regarding the practices of the CIA in relation to extraordinary renditions and the continued existence of Guantánamo."
"For once, putting an end to these continues to form an important item on the agenda of the joint consultation."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, it is important to have an open discussion forum and cooperation between the United States of America and the European Union."
"Commissioner Verheugen also emphasised the importance of cooperation with Congress."
"I too had an opportunity about a week ago to attend a meeting of the Delegation of the European Commission to the United States."
"This sort of contact is important."
"There, as obviously elsewhere, there are open discussions on difficult questions and each side certainly tries to promote the issues which relate to its own part of the world."
"What is clearly evident from these talks is that when the United States tries to make a case for security issues, it is very often a case of economic and trade protectionism."
"I agree totally with Mr Wiersma and I too regret that the EU Member States have not been treated fairly and equally when it comes to the matter of visas."
"When the US administration changes, hopefully the EU might speak to the United States with one voice about this, and then the Member States might all be treated in exactly the same way."
"Personally and finally, I would like to say that we here in Europe and everyone the world over have been following the first round of the battle for the White House."
"In fact, it definitely gives an excellent picture of the US democratic machine."
"The EU could do well to take a look in the mirror here."
"We talk here about selections for top EU positions."
"There is no open forum, let alone any very democratic process, while these posts are being handed out prior to elections."
"Could you imagine the most important administrative and political posts being allocated in the United States before the elections, as goes on here in the EU?"
"In other words, we definitely have a lesson to learn from the United States in many areas, at least in issues of democracy."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we want good relations between the United States of America and the European Union."
"The prerequisite for this, however, is also that the European Union speaks with one voice."
"Challenges and crises in the Western Balkans, in the South Caucasus region, in the Middle East and in Afghanistan, the fight against terrorism now taking place in the media and the food crisis that is now apparent, issues of energy security, climate change, economic recession as well as issues of transparency and regulation on the financial markets - on all these issues we need one another and we must work together."
"However, we also want to reinforce the parliamentary dimension by involving the US Congress and the European Parliament."
"One point that is supremely important to our citizens is - and I say this in full awareness as someone who considers himself transatlantic - the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison and all the other secret prisons in the world."
"It is important that we explain to our American friends that the remaining prisoners must either be legitimately charged or else released and, if necessary, appropriately compensated."
"We too can make a contribution, however, by accepting the Uighur prisoners into the European Union, thereby also helping to end this scandal as quickly as possible."
"Another point that is important for the collective reputation of our common democratic values is that on the one hand we are in agreement that there is a terrorist threat, but that on the other hand we also have to highlight the fact that this debate is also taking place with constitutional funds."
"This is precisely not the case with the current practice of lists of terrorist organisations both in the European Union as well as in the United States."
"This issue must therefore also be put to the test as a matter of urgency."
"I would once again highlight the fact that terrorism and organised crime have to be tackled on the basis of fundamental rights and common constitutional principles."
"This also applies to the exchange of personal data between the United States and the European Union."
"Another important point is ultimately the issue of climate change, because many aspects are affected, from food security via energy to water supplies."
"This item therefore has to be given high priority at the summit."
"Both partners should agree on a common approach to containing climate change."
"It must be our aim to limit the increase in temperature to a maximum of two degrees with regard to pre-industrial values."
"We are demanding that the industrialised countries fulfil their responsibility."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank President-in-Office Dimitrij Rupel and Commissioner Verheugen for their introduction to this debate."
"In many ways what we see happening is a convergence of ideals and goals between the US and the European Union."
"Too often we focus on that which divides us."
"By geography we are divided by the Atlantic Ocean, but what unites us is what is within our hearts and minds, within our value systems and our beliefs as regards democratic control and the promoting of democratic institutions across the world."
"We need to really focus on the core elements of what kind of a vision the US and the European Union can give to the world in the 21st century."
"Obviously my colleagues have mentioned many of the challenges that face us, whether it be climate change, the development goals or whatever else. But first and foremost, we must focus on bringing about peace and stability within regions and within areas."
"That is why it is quite appropriate that the next summit between the EU and US will take place in Ljubljana, because in Ljubljana we can look to the west and we can see that there is stability and peace in the European Union."
"We can look to the south-east and see potential fracture and potential danger in the Western Balkans."
"We can look further east and see potential danger and potential fracture with what is happening in the Middle East."
"That is why I think it is important that, when we do meet and discuss issues, while of course the agendas are going to be wide-ranging, by necessity they must focus on key and core elements."
"Those key and core elements in my opinion should be based on: ensuring that the Quartet continues its work with regard to the Middle East peace process; ensuring that the agreement in Doha of the parties in Lebanon with regard to the Lebanese situation is encouraged and supported; guaranteeing that Kosovo and other areas within the Western Balkans are given the security guarantees that they require to develop their democracies into a stable and peaceful future."
"But most important of all is for us to come together to give leadership to the rest of the world, in particular in the area of climate change, energy and food."
"Because the most striking issue now facing so many countries around the world, not just developing countries but developed countries, is the price of food and the difficulties that will create."
"Collectively the US and the EU can maintain a strong position, but can also give great leadership for the future."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, will you set out the specific points on which you disagree?"
"The European Parliament is calling for Guantanamo to be closed and there have recently been revelations about prison ships, which quite possibly have called even at European harbours."
"Will you say something about this to the Americans or will you back the demands of US citizens on the issue?"
"Will you say something to them to stop them undermining the global agreement on climate change, to urge them to abandon their unilateral approach to biofuels and to make a slight compromise so as to tackle the present food crisis that is pushing up food prices?"
"Mr Verheugen, since you have played a leading role in lifting the ban on chlorinated chicken, which has been in place in the EU since 1997, let me tell you that all of us who disagree with you - and there are many of us - do so not through ignorance but because we consider protecting public health to be more important than commercial interests."
"Twenty-one of the 27 Member States disagree with you, as do a unanimous European Parliament and the relevant parliamentary committee; there are strong objections even within the Commission."
"This is not something to be taken lightly, Mr Verheugen; you must present some arguments."
"(NL) Mr President, the partnership between the European Union and the United States is a cornerstone of the EU's external policies, as the joint resolution rightly states."
"Such a partnership posits a number of self-evident agreements, such as the principle that we do not involve ourselves in the internal affairs of the other partner."
"I am sorry to say that, in latter years and recently also, our American partners have not always kept to this agreement."
"For example, the President and the State Department have repeatedly declared themselves openly in favour of Turkey's accession to the European Union and have exerted pressure to this end."
"Such behaviour is unacceptable."
"This is like the European Council or the European Commission making efforts to achieve Mexico's accession to or integration into the United States."
"Just because Turkey is a NATO member state does not mean that the country should also be able to join the European Union."
"NATO is important to the European Union, but it is not the same as the European Union."
"These are two different affairs, and the summit next week is a good opportunity to remind our partners of this in a friendly, yet resolute manner."
"(DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I believe that it is perfectly clear, and it has also been clearly stated in the various speeches, that the European Union and the United States of America can together contribute as nobody else can towards peace and freedom in the world on the basis of their values."
"We do, however, know that we sometimes have different views."
"If we also find American unilateralism very unpleasant at times, this unilateralism is also partly rooted in our own weakness."
"That is why a better European policy in relation to the United States, inner strength and one voice in foreign and security policy are conditions for creating a genuine partnership."
"With the Transatlantic Economic Council we now have an instrument for consolidating our common interests in a specific area."
"For this reason it makes me very sad that things are already threatening to collapse on the chicken issue, that the President of the United States is having to make telephone calls on account of the chicken issue and that we are not showing a certain willingness to compromise on this issue either."
"We have to consider whether or not a lot of things have been exaggerated here and we are therefore in a position to create a basis for the development of a transatlantic market, enabling us to determine our common interests in the world, implement standards and - as Mr Elles has rightly said - include the Parliaments in this."
"Commissioner Verheugen has already mentioned that legislation in many sectors is already affected, which is why the Parliaments on both sides have to be included pre-emptively in order to bring the situation under control and implement these standards together in the world."
"If we were to succeed in this and if we are able to maintain this momentum beyond this year's elections in the United States and next year's elections in the European Union, we will perhaps have created the basis for understanding that climate change, organised crime, migration and much else can only be tackled together in the interests of a better world."
"This is why we should be working more closely together with our American friends."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, in my speech I will mention one aspect of the relations between the European Union and the United States, and that is the US anti-missile shield system."
"In my home country, the Czech Republic, where a radar base is to be installed as part of this shield system, two thirds of citizens permanently oppose this plan."
"The Czech people are believe that the anti-missile shield does not concern only bilateral relations between the US and the Czech Republic or Poland but that the questions of the anti-missile shield and non-proliferation of weapons affect the security of Europe as a whole."
"I thus want to call on the Council once again to create, finally, a platform for the participation of all EU Member States in the debate on this issue."
"I also want to use this opportunity to call on the United States not to sign, at present, the treaties on the installation of their anti-missile shield elements in Europe."
"America and Europe are facing a number of far more pressing problems: the fight against terrorism, security of energy supply, global warming, Afghanistan and many others."
"Let us therefore work together (and I mean together, as partners) to find solutions to these problems."
"We can leave until later those issues that are not urgent and that currently divide us instead of uniting us."
"Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen has just made an appeal to the European Parliament to use its contacts with Congress on the issue of the 100% screening of containers."
"Very well, I think we are happy to oblige; but then, in return, I think this Parliament would like to be more closely involved in matters such as, for example, the framework for transatlantic data protection, because for the last year and a half that has been treated by civil servants behind closed doors, as if it were a mere technical matter rather than one relating to our civil liberties and our fundamental rights."
"This is not a matter for diplomats."
"It is time that the Commission and the Council brought this to the European Parliament."
"Another matter concerns something that was announced the other day by the United States authorities - the electronic travel authorisation scheme."
"I would like to hear whether the Council and the Commission intend to raise this at the summit with the US."
"I get the impression that, by now, we have a patchwork of security measures that affect travellers - the electronic travel authorisation, PNR, API, biometric passports, fingerprints, entry-exit systems, automatic targeting system, visa, visa waiver - and the EU is just blindly copying all this."
"It is time that, instead, we started talking about a coherent, effective and proportional framework of security measures."
"In this context, I would like to know whether the Commission and the Council intend to raise the following issues with the US authorities."
"They have announced that - I believe as of August - they will require air and vessel carriers to collect 10 fingerprints and facial scans of all travellers and to submit this information to the Department of Homeland Security within 24 hours."
"I will submit a parliamentary question on this, and I would like to know whether the Council and the Commission agree with me that carriers should not be carrying out law enforcement and security tasks, and whether they intend to intervene."
"Finally, with regard to the visa waiver, I would like to highlight a specific issue."
"We have asked this a number of times and never got an answer: do you intend to raise the issue of the unacceptable travel ban to the United States for HIV patients?"
"(PL) Mr President, not long ago the European Parliament adopted a resolution in which it called on the United States to abolish the visa requirement for citizens of all EU Member States and to respect the principles of reciprocity."
"Citizens of the United States may travel freely to all EU countries, but the only people who do not have to apply for US visas are citizens of a few of the richest countries of the European Union."
"This shows an imbalance in the treatment of certain fully-fledged EU Member States."
"Unfortunately, this issue has not received adequate attention to date from EU institutions that often display excessive zeal in other matters."
"We are witnessing an odd situation in which - by way of an example - Polish citizens are still being treated as potential economic migrants, even though it is ages since their goal was the United States."
"They can, after all, work in EU countries that have opened up their labour markets to them."
"There are no economic and certainly no political reasons why they should not travel without visas to the United States."
"We must hope that at the next EU-US Summit the EU countries will table this problem in a resolute manner and finally resolve it."
"(CS) Mr President, given that Commissioner Verheugen was emphatically talking about prosperity, I expect the summit to look, first and foremost, for a way to curb the rising food prices."
"I expect a politically correct response to the fact that tens of millions of people will die from hunger this year, and a further hundred million will slide deeper into poverty."
"At the same time, milk in Europe is being poured down the drains right now, and rapeseed and sugar cane, now blooming in the fields, will be poured into vehicles' fuel tanks."
"High subsidies and import tariffs make it more profitable to grow fuel rather than grain, although it is well known that the price of wheat would immediately fall by 10% and the price of corn by as much as 20% if the countries declared a moratorium on biofuels."
"Mr President, I believe that at the meeting in Ljubljana in a week's time it will become quite clear whether the European Union and the United States are going to face up to their global responsibilities or are just going to continue to talk about them in a populist manner."
"Given that they are facing the (literally) deadly results of the existing agricultural policies, they should abolish, as quickly as possible, the nonsensical agricultural subsidies, quotas and customs tariffs, and stop promoting biofuels."
"(PL) Mr President, we are talking to the European Union's most important partner; we have differences of opinion on many points, but the fact is that we are closer to the United States than we are to any other overseas country."
"At the same time, however, in global terms our approach to several key matters affecting our entire planet differs."
"The European Union has made the battle against global warming a banner for its activities - these are the preferences of all Presidencies, past and future."
"The United States agrees that above all it is human activities that are leading to changes in climate, but it does not want to take upon itself the burden of combating climate change."
"On the contrary, we, the European Union, have adopted a very fierce programme to limit emissions."
"This will be a programme of exceptional harshness for our economy."
"We have decided to do this because we want others to join us."
"This is our aim, because we cannot save the planet by ourselves."
"The United States is pretty much the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world."
"Persuading this largest emitter to take on common obligations may lead to a global understanding in Poznań and Copenhagen, and it is only when we succeed in reaching such an understanding that our programme to limit emissions will not have been squandered."
"I therefore think that discussion with the United States on this subject and the presentation of our projects, and persuading them to act jointly with us in the international arena during the next climate convention sessions, is one of the most important, perhaps the single most important point for the European Union today."
"(PT) The last EU-United States summit in the Bush era will take place on 10 June."
"That era has been forever tainted by the illegal invasion of Iraq and the ignominy of Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo and the secret prisons."
"We will breathe a sigh of relief after eight years of going backwards."
"Eight wasted years in terms of what could have been an effective fight against terrorism compatible with the values of democracy and human rights."
"Wasted years in terms of the quest for peace in the Middle East, wasted in terms of the fight against organised crime and in terms of disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation."
"Yet we know that Barack Obama will be the Democratic Party candidate and that hope is returning."
"Obama has pledged his support for strengthening the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has even upheld the objective of complete nuclear disarmament."
"This has already had a knock-on effect on his Republican opponent, Senator McCain, who has aligned his position with Obama's and who has added that he supports the withdrawal of tactical nuclear weapons from Europe."
"This proves that there is a critical mass in the United States that is ready for a change of strategy."
"Europe must approach the new Administration as early as possible with regard to drawing up joint strategies for the 2010 NPT Review Conference, and for all frameworks in which global security and, especially, non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are at stake, including negotiations with Iran."
"With this in mind, contacts between Members of the European Parliament and of the US Congress are of the utmost importance and should be stepped up right away."
"Mr President, the US leadership is no longer enough to combat today's threats and to prevent new ones in the future."
"It is, however, still indispensable."
"We are confident that President Obama - and I hope it is him - will be up to the challenge and that Europe will be able to use every opportunity to contribute towards a lasting strengthening of the multilateral system."
"(PL) Mr President, problems are increasing globally."
"One example is the deteriorating economic situation."
"A second is political utilisation of access to raw materials and the rise in their prices, including the rise in food prices."
"A third is terrorism."
"A fourth is local armed conflicts."
"No single State has the power to solve these problems, so dialogue and cooperation are necessary between the EU and the United States."
"There is another side to this coin, however, and that is economic and political rivalry between the European Union and the United States."
"Therefore, in the most important matters, what is needed is appropriate arrangements to prevent this rivalry from being divisive."
"Arrangements are needed particularly in economic matters."
"The world should not be hostage to speculative capital and raw material monopolies."
"Europe must not stand with Al Gore as a proponent of the idea of global warming at the cost of its own businesses."
"In view of the forthcoming change of President in the United States, Europe should make its own political priorities and the proposals it has for their resolution very clear."
"(BG) Being a representative of a new EU Member State and a member of the Delegation for relations with the United States of America, I would like to speak about the important role of the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue which covered the meeting held in Ljubljana only a few days ago."
"I would like to express my gratitude for the topics included on the agenda because they clearly showed that the challenges facing some new EU Member States were very much on the agenda of the European Union and its institutions, giving us a sense of security and protection of key interests."
"However, what I have in mind, first and foremost, is the issue related to the widely publicized security measures."
"They include the visa arrangements, as well as the requirements for 100-percent cargo scanning."
"On the one hand, these measures affect the free movement of the citizens of my country and primarily the opportunities for young people to have the same rights and chance which people of their age enjoy in other countries; on the other hand, they generate economic problems for countries like Bulgaria, which have relatively small ports and will have to shoulder the heavy financial burden of providing the new screening equipment."
"The measures will make these ports give up the handling of freight that will be channelled to larger port facilities."
"This will definitely impair the economic interests of regions like the one I come from, i.e. the City of Varna, and the other Black Sea regions."
"During the meetings held to discuss visa issues, I informed our U.S. colleagues from the U.S. Congress that the situation in Bulgaria was fundamentally different from what it used to be 10 or 15 years ago, when young people in large numbers went to the United States and, furthermore, rejection rates of visa applications were reduced."
"This is the reason for the beginning of a new dialogue between the two countries."
"Still, I do believe that Bulgaria needs to remain loyal to the common EU policy and to insist on the application of measures to protect all citizens of the European Union on the basis of reciprocity."
"At the same time, our U.S. colleagues should understand that we all face common security problems which we have to resolve by working together rather than by putting obstacles to one another."
"Therefore I support the resolution and the upcoming meeting."
"(DE) Mr President, a fundamentally positive relationship with the United States does not preclude differences in interests and opinions."
"I believe that a partnership on equal terms is possible only on such a basis."
"Only in this way can we also convincingly counteract anti-Americanism."
"For this reason we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are in favour of a direct dialogue on security policy with the United States on those issues in which the European Union has jurisdiction."
"I would put forward two examples of this: the credibility of Western values when combating terrorism and the subject of stabilisation and reconstruction."
"For precisely these reasons we are against the EU's open or hidden links to the US National Security Strategy, as we see them in one of the amendments put forward by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to the report on security strategy, on which we shall be voting tomorrow, because it is perfectly clear that no President of the United States will ever accept that a third party, whether or not it is the EU, becomes a cosignatory to this National Security Strategy."
"Why should we therefore tie ourselves to this same thing with a blank cheque?"
"This is not equal terms and we are therefore against positions such as these."
"(BG) Mr. President, I would like to voice my support for the proposed joint resolution and to touch upon two issues like in the course of the legislators' dialogue in Ljubljana: climate changes and energy, where both parties, i.e. the United States and Europe, should cooperate to a greater extent."
"I hope that more opportunities will emerge to this effect in the wake of the U.S. presidential elections."
"I particularly rely on the legislative activities at the U.S. Congress enabling the Copenhagen Conference to achieve global solutions."
"Otherwise, countries like Bulgaria would be seriously affected by the loss of competitiveness of their products and exports if we were the only ones to implement the European Commission's proposals on the climate change."
"As far as the energy sector is concerned, our cooperation should not be confined only to clean technologies and the related fund but it should also cover nuclear energy that is apparently increasing its importance in the world, especially in countries like China and India."
"We can be partners in this field only if the European Union could incorporate nuclear energy issues more openly in its policies."
"Mr President, I would like to focus on three points."
"Firstly, I agree with the emphasis of the Commissioner: let us follow up on the transatlantic Economic Council and the work that we can do there."
"We need to show that we can take certain issues very seriously and can make the changes necessary to bring about the lifting of any unfortunate barriers, which are basic harbours for national protection."
"This includes poultry, and it is sad to hear a reflection in the House that we should not have that ban lifted."
"Secondly, we need to promote the positive agenda as well as challenge each other over the difficult issues such as climate change."
"Finance is a very positive story to tell, and I hope that insurance will be added to the list of progress that has been made so far in this area."
"Finally, the recent transatlantic dialogue in Ljubljana just got better."
"More was discussed and more was agreed, and like my colleagues I can agree we need to raise this now to the agreed level of the 1997 Houston Joint Declaration."
"Mr President, I wish to mention a few issues that I hope will be on the agenda of the summit on 10 June."
"First, concerning Kosovo, it is obvious that it is in no one's interest to have a new failed state in the Balkans, and therefore Romania has been participating for years in the efforts to stabilise the region."
"Our concerns deal mainly with organised crime, prostitution and trafficking in human beings, drugs and weapons, and I believe the new Kosovar authorities must increase their efforts to control these practices."
"I also think it is very important to monitor closely how local culture is preserved, especially Orthodox monasteries in the area."
"Another issue I would like to raise concerns visas for all European citizens travelling to the United States."
"I would like to thank Commissioner Verheugen and Minister Rupel for raising this issue."
"As you have seen here, there is very strong solidarity, irrespective of our political colour."
"I must say that I was very surprised that during the meeting in Ljubljana our colleagues from the Congress put all the responsibility for this issue on the Department of State while, at the same time, President Bush used to say that it is the full responsibility of the Congress."
"I hope you will finally find an answer during this summit in Ljubljana."
"Finally, I should like to raise the issue of the price of food and poverty."
"(SK) Ladies and gentlemen, when the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection visited Washington in July 2007, I became aware of the importance of cooperation between the United States and the European Union."
"I believe that common EU and US policies in the areas of customs tariffs, intellectual property, mutual recognition, mutual understanding and harmonisation of standards can lead to the creation of a new transatlantic trade area to the benefit of both entrepreneurs and consumers, on both sides of the Atlantic."
"Since the toys directive is being debated in Parliament at present, it would be very useful to find a common policy in regard to toy safety as well."
"I am sure that Commissioner Verheugen, who represents the European Union in the transatlantic dialogue, can achieve a great deal in this matter."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that as a result of the forthcoming EU-US Summit the US visa-waiver programme will be extended to all EU citizens, including my home country, Slovakia."
"(RO) Mister President, I would like to thank Commissioner Verheugen for having introduced on the agenda of the EU-USA summit the visa issue that my country's citizens are concerned with, and I represent them here in the European Parliament."
"Furthermore, I insist that the USA join the European Union's efforts in responding to the challenges generated by climate change; otherwise, all European companies will be disadvantaged in terms of competition with the USA."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) Allow me to answer the three questions which I consider to be most important."
"Firstly, with regard to the question by Mr Rouček concerning the anti-missile shield."
"The question which Mr Rouček asks in some way goes beyond a European Union issue, since it concerns agreements between two individual European countries and the United States of America, and two countries in particular, the Czech Republic and Poland, which are concluding bilateral agreements with the United States."
"I personally would like these matters to be discussed within NATO or within the European Union, but at present that is not possible."
"As I said, it is a bilateral matter which, of course, falls within the competence of the countries that are concluding these agreements."
"As regards the Visa Waiver Programme, which has been the subject of a great deal of criticism and which has been discussed many times in this House, I would like to say the following: with regard to extending this programme, the Visa Waiver Programme, we hope that, in accordance with the agreement on a twin-track approach - the approach adopted at the EU-US Justice and Home Affairs Ministerial Meeting - progress will soon be made."
"To date it has been agreed that the United States will negotiate with the individual Member States on matters which fall within national competence and with the Commission on matters which fall within the European Union's competence."
"This I said earlier in my opening speech."
"Therefore, we expect the Visa Waiver Programme to be extended to include more Member States of the European Union by the end of 2008."
"At present eleven countries are still not covered by the programme."
"I would like to say a few words on climate change, Mr President, if I may."
"The question was whether we have done enough on this issue or problem."
"I am pleased that two important meetings on climate change and energy have been held during our Presidency, firstly the 'High Level Dialogue on Climate Change, Clean Energy and Sustainable Development' and secondly the 'Strategic Energy Review'."
"Nevertheless, we would like the United States to show greater commitment in this field, and we in the European Union will try to persuade our American friends of the importance of acting globally and in agreement between the Europeans and Americans."
"At present there are considerable differences between us."
"I should also say that the European Union is firmly of the view that the issue of combating climate change must be dealt with within the framework of the United Nations."
"That much I can contribute to the discussion for my part."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to address two issues briefly."
"First of all, cooperation on security issues, which Mrs in 't Veld has outlined very succinctly and which concerns how we find the right balance between the security requirements of our American friends and the demand that we ourselves are making on individual freedom and the individual rights of our citizens."
"I should like to say quite clearly to you, Mrs in 't Veld, that the Commission fully shares your concerns and I shall, of course, be informing the relevant colleague of the criticism you have expressed on the lack of transparency in the process and asking him to ensure greater transparency."
"We shall be talking to the Americans before we can accept anything regarding the principles that must lead us to cooperate on these issues."
"If there is no understanding on these principles, there can hardly be any understanding on individual issues."
"This is, of course, one of the subjects to be addressed at next week's meeting in Ljubljana."
"It gives me no pleasure to say anything more here about poultry, but the subject has been addressed by several speakers here."
"It is always good to know what we are actually talking about."
"It is therefore also important to know that we are not talking about a food safety issue here."
"For many years now the competent European Food Safety Authority has been explaining that there is not the slightest risk to consumer health from imported American poultry."
"We are not talking about a veterinary problem; we are talking about an issue of pure trade policy, which must be dealt with from the point of view: what are our interests and how do we best defend our interests?"
"I think I have said what I needed to say to you."
"Nor are there any differing opinions in the Commission."
"The Commission has from the outset been explaining - as I must say - how not to allow this somewhat bizarre dispute to become a burden and how to rid ourselves of the problem."
"I have received six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"As Vice-president of the ENVI Committee, I encourage the EU representatives participating in the meeting with the officials of the United States to analyse solutions concerning the issue of climate change."
"Climate change is a global challenge for which we should prepare a global response."
"Europe is taking steps in this regard."
"The same example is expected from our neighbours across the ocean."
"I am glad that the Unites States will join the efforts of the international community, after 2012, following the expiration of the Kyoto Protocol."
"I appreciate as well that, in the end, the US President has admitted that we need legislation with a view to reducing the level of greenhouse gas emissions."
"I encourage EU representatives to discuss a real reduction percentage for actually putting an end to global warming."
"We cannot accept that we need legislation in this regard, and when we reach the figures, we turn back."
"At the same time, future debates regarding the cooperation framework on climate change must be based upon real studies on renewable energy sources."
"I am mainly referring to first generation biofuels."
"It is necessary to maintain a low percentage of their use and a low grants level."
"In this way, we will protect biodiversity and avoid the price increase of food products generated by the reduction of land for agricultural activity."
"in writing. - (HU) The EU-USA summit that will take place in a few days' time is a good opportunity for us to examine the development of transatlantic relations in the most important areas."
"We feel that cooperation on energy policy must assume an important role on the agenda."
"Security of energy supply continues to be the primary objective on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean."
"It is common knowledge that most stocks are in countries that do not always meet the requirements of democracy."
"It is for precisely this reason that joint action and continued efforts are needed in the interests of promoting human rights and constitutionality."
"It is important for us to emphasise that spreading the principles of democracy will also mean greater security of energy supply."
"In addition to the above, future cooperation must focus on the fight against climate change with even more emphasis."
"It is a very welcome development that the United States have committed to creating the basis for the post-Kyoto regime."
"The Member States of the European Union and the United States must play a leading role, in the interests of having the most developed countries agree on the most important cornerstones of the international treaty before the end of the year."
"The package of measures relating to reducing emissions that was recently introduced into American legislation is the latest sign that Washington wants to assume an active role in the fight against climate change."
"Oil prices, which are bombarding levels that were previously unimaginable, draw our attention to the importance of joint international action in the area of energy policy."
"We are convinced that it is unavoidable for the United States and Europe to take responsibility in this area."
"in writing. - EU-US relations in many issues have been through substantial changes over the last years and are moving into a phase of consolidation for many items of cooperation."
"The recent case of the negotiations on lifting visa restrictions for travellers from the EU is an excellent example - in spite of the positive outcome - showing why, in order to ensure successful talks between the US and the EU, we ought to avoid mere bilateral agreements which actually undermine the negotiating powers of the EU as a whole."
"Having a package agreement encompassing the 27 Member States, based on the distribution of competences between the Union and the Member States, was indeed crucial in order to support the EU visa common policy."
"It is essential to ensure that, where Community competences apply, we secure EU-wide deals with our strategic partners such as the United States."
"In my opinion, it is in the interest of both partners."
"It is indeed the only way to ensure that the Visa Waiver Programme brings full reciprocal visa free travel and equal treatment for all our citizens as regards the status of their passports, just as for US citizens."
"in writing. - It is the moment to stress with all clarity and responsibility that the EU-US partnership is not only a cornerstone of the credible and efficient EU foreign actions but that only close cooperation and coordination between both partners would enable them to play key roles in the globalising world and to be guarantors of stability and democracy."
"The European Union has no other partner in the world with whom to share the basic values of freedom, the rule of law and defence of human rights."
"It is high time to fully restore normal cooperation and mutual trust after the damage that has followed the Iraqi invasion."
"The latter has dramatically split the EU itself."
"Therefore, I strongly call on both partners to complete without delays the work of the Transatlantic Economic Council."
"Also a joint approach to the problems of climate change will substantially enhance the chances of solving these problems."
"The same applies for Iran."
"Both the USA and EU need to agree on a common strategy on Iran to efficiently stop preparations to develop nuclear weapons there."
"Finally, we need a stronger redefined EU-NATO partnership which will also improve our cooperation in Afghanistan."
"in writing. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to raise two issues that the EU needs to focus attention on at the summit."
"Global challenges mean that the West above all has to show consistency and a sense of responsibility."
"Firstly, the Union should have a constructive debate on America's role in climate policy."
"The world has one and a half years to change course before Copenhagen."
"On the one hand, we have to encourage the United States to make essential plans for legislation on climate."
"We need to stress that the solution to the problem of global climate change is a worldwide low-carbon economy."
"This means that the carbon market mechanisms of different countries should be made compatible and in the course of time integrated with one another."
"America's regional emissions trading systems inspire hope."
"On the other hand, we need to recognise that our partner in the fight against climate change is better than its reputation."
"The EU should look for guidance from the United States and acknowledge its fruitful endeavours to develop clean technology."
"The Union has some way to go here."
"The United States is showing the way ahead by proposing to establish an international fund for environmentally friendly technology."
"Cooperation between the EU and the United States will also be very important in order to bring in measures to adapt to climate change."
"Secondly, the summit should highlight the basic values to which we are jointly committed: democracy, human rights and the rule of law."
"We have to venture to ask how our value base is implemented in the policies of the Western world."
"Do world leader's actions look good in the light of day, for example, in the fight against terrorism?"
"Because terrorism is a threat the EU and the United States share, the means of countering it needs to stand up to scrutiny."
"Sometimes global political rhetoric and the everyday world seem to forget the fact that our value base does not place an obligation on others in the first place, but on ourselves, whether we are talking about the Middle East, the Western Balkans, or Africa."
"in writing. - The forthcoming EU-US summit will give both transatlantic partners a chance to find common ground on issues relevant to both sides of the Atlantic."
"Our continents share a common civilisation and a past."
"We have to ensure that the knot of this relationship is as strong as possible so we can achieve the goals that are not only important for both sides but are global necessities."
"The growing and extreme need for energy by emerging economies, rising food prices, and conflicts around the world are just some of the issues that the EU-US partnership has to work on together for peace, sustainability, and to facilitate human dignity around the globe."
"One of the success stories of this relationship is NATO, an organisation we should all support and strengthen as it has secured peace in Europe and developed deeper ties between the EU and the US."
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"(EL) Mr President, there has recently been a growing clamour within the EU for the expansion of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, above all to meet Europe's energy demands."
"The problem is the unchecked rise in the price of oil, the increasing demand from a number of countries with rapidly growing economies, regional disturbances in oil-producing countries, as well as the fact that renewable sources of energy or natural gas will cover a mere fraction of Europe's energy needs."
"As a result, the construction of nuclear plants is being tabled for discussion."
"Many questions worry European citizens."
"Can the safe operation of nuclear power plants be guaranteed?"
"Do appropriate early warning systems exist to guarantee sufficient notice in the event of an operational problem?"
"Finally, how safe is the management of nuclear waste?"
"For all these reasons, I believe that on the initiative of the European Parliament and with the collaboration of the Commission, a dialogue could usefully be conducted leading to clear, unambiguous conclusions for European citizens."
"I call on the French Presidency to make this issue a real priority in its agenda."
"(BG) Mr. President, Dear colleagues, I would like to draw your attention to an issues that makes us responsible for the future of the European Union and the world at large."
"This is the trafficking in children."
"In the 21st century, the age of high technologies and progress, this problems persists and it is too inhumane and brutal to be ignored or confused with other problems."
"The trafficking in children does exist."
"It is an encroachment not only against human rights; it is an encroachment against the future, as well."
"The life of any child is a blessing and its destruction is a crime against mankind."
"The trafficking in children has atrocious consequences."
"It is called ""modern slavery”."
"What follows is physical and mental mistreatment, sexual exploitation, homicide."
"What we need is to join our efforts and cooperate in a common policy to reduce and minimize its existence."
"The European Commission should set up a separate programme and an action plan within the framework of the strategy for children and to undertake the measures needed for the establishment of common structures and policy."
"(RO) Mister President, dear colleagues, European dependence on hydrofuels import has increased, oil prices have reached an alarming level and the European Union is increasingly vulnerable to OPEC countries and Russia."
"There is a need to approach the foreign relations in the energy field with joint efforts."
"The bilateral agreements between the Member States and third countries must reinforce the common European approach and not weaken it."
"The agreements signed by Italy, Hungary and Bulgaria with Russia in terms of building the South STREAM, a pipeline designed to avoid a Member State, like Romania, without any economic reasons, seriously affects the cohesion of European energy policy and represents political strategies that must be avoided among Member States."
"I was expecting a firmer position by the European Commission in condemning this situation."
"With regard to the legislation on energy security that is to be adopted in the second half of this year, I believe we should show an ambition level comparable to the one in the case of the legislation ""Energy - Climate changes”."
"The speaking with one voice principle must become functional and the Commission should propose a mechanism regarding agreements with third countries, perhaps inspired from the nuclear energy field."
"If we want to be successful, we must act together."
"(DE) Mr President, last Sunday reactionary nationalists brutally beat up homosexuals at a peace rally in Moscow, thereby hammering the image of an unfree Russia into our consciousness once again."
"There is still discrimination against gays and lesbians on a massive scale."
"In recent years, the German Green politician Volker Beck has been beaten and arrested at rallies."
"It cannot be emphasised often enough how badly organised civil society is in Russia."
"At the end of June a new EU-Russia Agreement is finally to be negotiated in Siberia."
"We owe it to the people of Russia and of other autocratic regimes not to allow the issue of energy security to overshadow all other sectors."
"Human rights and basic democratic freedoms must form the basis of this new agreement."
"(PL) Mr President, the Polish shipyard industry is under threat of total closure because the European Commission is demanding the return of sums provided from public aid."
"The effect of this will be that thousands of employees on the Baltic will lose their jobs, and tens of thousands of employees at factories that work with the shipyards, both in Poland and in other EU countries, will likewise be out of work."
"The European Commission is hiding behind the slogan of free competition, not wanting to admit to itself that during a period of massive price rises on a global scale some sections of the economy need to be protected, as Asiatic countries are doing."
"The European Commission is unwilling to recall that the eastern Länder received more than one and a half billion marks in aid from the German Government, and that included shipyards located on the Baltic."
"I am asking whether the people and the place where the solidarity movement began - the fall of the Berlin Wall, the liberation of Europe - must fall victim to arbitrary decisions taken in Brussels in the interests of speculators who are looking to make their fortunes out of the rubble and soil of the shipyards."
"We are demanding that the European Commission take decisions that will enable the shipyard industry in Poland to be salvaged and developed."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I would like your support for a review of Commission Regulation (EC) No 318/2007, or for the return to the original material from 2005, because of requests by breeding organisations trading in exotic birds in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and the Czech Republic."
"The amendment basically relates to the ban on imports of exotic birds from the wild to the Union."
"Taking into account the practical situation for breeding small birds, the conditions imposed on their import are difficult to fulfil."
"It is obvious that the media hysteria surrounding bird flue was used to carry through the above-mentioned standard."
"The EU has a system of quarantine facilities whereby avian diseases that pose a threat to people are intercepted."
"On a number of occasions breeders have helped to return various animal species to the wild."
"They respect the law protecting the most endangered species listed in CITES."
"Banning only results in counter-pressures and attempts to bypass it."
"The black market will take off, smuggling will flourish and the prices of birds will rise."
"Health risks may also increase as a result."
"If the standard and tried and tested veterinary regulations are observed, including the Washington Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, there is no need to retain this Regulation."
"(PL) Mr President, I wish to use the forum of the European Parliament to protest against the unlawful termination by the National Fund for Environmental Protection, which is subordinate to the Polish Government, of its contract with the Lux Veritatis Foundation to implement a geothermal investment for Toruń, while at the same time announcing that there will be no refund of the vast sums that the Foundation has spent on this investment."
"The circumstances indicate that this decision has been dictated by political considerations, and it runs counter not only to domestic Polish law, but also to Community law, which proves that in the name of the battle against people perceived as political foes, the law is not being observed and support for renewable energy is not being permitted, which also breaches the fundamental EU principle of non-discrimination on political or religious grounds."
"The former authorities of the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management say that the application by the Lux Veritatis Foundation was checked very carefully and not found wanting in any way."
"(SK) Ladies and gentlemen, I want to inform you about an incident that happened in the United Kingdom recently."
"A Slovak citizen who was working there legally exceeded the deadline for re-registration of his vehicle by four days and for this offence the British police threatened to destroy his vehicle."
"While making their enquiries, the police behaved in a xenophobic and insulting manner, taking advantage of his passive knowledge of the English language."
"All his documents were confiscated for no good reason, he was given a newspaper scrap instead of an official certificate of vehicle confiscation and his documentation, such as his European car insurance (Green Card) or Slovak authorisation, was not accepted by the British authorities either."
"For this offence, and I mean just an offence, the British police and authorities threatened to scrap his vehicle."
"I want to express my gratitude to my fellow Member Mr Chris Davies for his help in investigating this unfortunate case as well as to the other British Members who have taken an interest in the case."
"I trust that such action by the British police is an isolated incident and that this attitude towards citizens working legally in the United Kingdom is the exception rather than the rule."
"The deadline for the return of the vehicle expired yesterday, and as yet we have no information as to whether the vehicle has or has not been destroyed."
"One way or another, our citizen does not have his vehicle even though the British authorities have received all the necessary documentation."
"(BG) Mr. President, Members of the European Parliament, In ten days, on 14 June 2008, Bulgaria will pay tribute to the memory and life work of Alexander Stamboliiski, statesman, reformer and leader of the agrarian movement in the country."
"He came to power in Bulgaria in 1919, after two national disasters, dedicating his efforts to the national cause, to the modernisation and democratic renewal of the country."
"He was overthrown through a coup d'etat in 1923."
"He was killed most brutally but he remained immortal with his ideas of free and independent Bulgaria on the way to construction and integration into Europe."
"Stamboliiski's lessons in statesmanship sound particularly relevant today, 85 years after his tragic death, when Bulgaria is a member of the European Union."
"The protection of national interests in the big European family, the preservation of the national identity side by side with the rapid adaptation to new realities should consolidate the efforts of all of us, citizens of unified Europe, for whom values are not just a hollow notion but a type of conduct, attitude and social response."
"(BG) Mr. President, the Bulgarian operational programmes within the framework of the EU funds were among the first to be approved by the Commission for the period from 2007 to 2013."
"WE must admit that, being a new Member State, we are confronted with various difficulties in their specific implementation."
"Problems range from insufficient information to irregularities, even abuse with resources from the EU funds - ""disorders” that do not spare any single EU Member State."
"The Bulgarian Government finds the absorption of funds to be a major task."
"This has brought about radical reforms in all institutions responsible for the EU funds."
"A Deputy Prime Minister has been appointed to ensure the overall coordination of the process."
"The unsatisfactory results of the absorption of funds so far become arguments in a vehement campaign of the domestic opposition that has repeatedly tried to discredit the country even here, in the plenary hall of the European Parliament."
"The references to anonymous sources predicting an apocalyptic report of the Commission for Bulgaria in July even before it has started writing it are suggestions for domestic political purposes only but they do not contribute to the resolution of problems."
"Regrettably, the only thing they achieve is undermining the good name of my country."
"I want to declare very clearly that the Bulgarian State undertakes radical measures in the respective spheres and has the firm will to overcome the existing problems."
"Mr President, you are probably aware that the buildings of the European Parliament in Strasbourg contain a more widespread presence of asbestos than was originally anticipated."
"Work for upgrading purposes and, more recently, for removal of the asbestos has been carried out since 2004 - apparently while the buildings have been in use."
"This is, in my view, unwise and hazardous behaviour, because any work on asbestos-containing structures inevitably releases carcinogenic fibres into the atmosphere."
"It is my opinion that the European Parliament in Strasbourg must not be used unless and until all asbestos is appropriately removed and the buildings have been thoroughly decontaminated."
"In the interest of public health and transparency, I request that the President of this House make a fully comprehensive statement on this matter of asbestos removal from the European Parliament in Strasbourg as soon as possible."
"(ES) Mr President, we are currently facing a major fisheries crisis in the whole of the European Union, which is going to demand a rapid response from the European institutions."
"I think that it is essential that we create a tripartite committee involving the public authorities, the unions and the shipowners."
"In order to tackle the crisis once and for all, we cannot paper over the cracks; we need to formulate a complete, structural proposal that covers every aspect of the crisis in the sector."
"We obviously advocate responsible fishing; we need to resolve the marketing of the product; we need to deal with the shortage of crew in the fleets and ensure fair employment relations and a way out of their precarious situation for the workers."
"I think that it is very important at the moment for the European Parliament to lend its support to finding a way out of this crisis, because it also affects quality employment, and we need to be able to deal with circumstances that arise."
"Mr President, my London constituent, Mr Budd Margolis informs me that his Lithuanian relative, Rachel Margolis, has published her memoirs recounting her experiences in the Second World War."
"She escaped from the Vilna Ghetto and then worked with the partisans fighting against the Nazis."
"The Lithuanian authorities are now using her memoirs as evidence to prosecute surviving Jewish partisans as war criminals."
"These include Yitzhak Arad, the former director of Israel's Holocaust Centre, and Fania Brancovskaja, the librarian at the Yiddish Institute at Vilnius University."
"Lithuania is under an obligation to prosecute surviving Second World War criminals but so far has not successfully prosecuted one."
"Jewish partisans who fought against the Germans and their collaborators are regarded by some as traitors to Lithuania."
"On behalf of many of my Jewish and non-Jewish constituents, I ask: where is the justice in persecuting Jewish partisans who fought against the Nazis, while the murderers of the Jews go unpunished?"
"Mr President, across Europe we have seen wholly justified protests by fishermen about the sky-high price of fuel."
"Some governments have faced up to their responsibilities; others, like my own, have not."
"We are supposed to have a common fisheries policy, but in many regions of Europe the approach is anything but common."
"In my constituency local, small-trawler owners are paying a fuel bill of over EUR 2 000 per day."
"Their plea for short-term aid has fallen on deaf ears, even though it lies within the power of the local minister to pay de minimis aid under state rules."
"She has shamefully refused to do so."
"Yet in France and Spain, government action has been taken."
"How can you have a viable common fisheries policy with such disparity on the basic commodity of fuel?"
"I condemn Minister Gildernew's indifference and call not just for short-term aid but a long-term fuel strategy for our fishing sector."
"(RO) In a short time, the reports of the European Commission will be published reflecting the progress that Romania and Bulgaria have made regarding the justice reform."
"Today, a year and a half after integration, more and more dissatisfied persons are speaking up on a European level, reaching the point that the progress achieved up to now is regarded as insignificant, compared to the assumed objectives."
"Even though in some experts support that Romania and Bulgaria, should have been accepted to the European Union much earlier, I consider that these two new Member States must be further assisted and supported by the Commission and the Parliament."
"Taking into account that next year the elections for the European Parliament will take place, I am convinced that the following months will be essential for Bulgaria and Romania to fully prove its European membership."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to raise an issue of linguistic discrimination within Parliament: the interface of MEPs' computers functions only in English."
"It is only possible to navigate our operating systems and access files using our computers if we have a command of the English language."
"This seems to me to be totally discriminatory as regards those MEPs who, although they do not know English, would like to manage their work directly on their own computers."
"This is a problem of linguistic authorisation which our friends in the Esperanto movement are trying to tackle at the United Nations, and I am not too sure what the francophony movement is dealing with if it is not also dealing with this issue."
"I hope, Mr President, that this problem can be remedied, and that a remedy can also be found for the technological discrimination I encountered when I tabled a written question on 2 June in an open format - the ODF format - different from the Microsoft format which is currently in use."
"The reply I received from the department responsible was that it was not possible to table questions in an open format."
"I hope that these forms of linguistic and technological discrimination may be promptly overcome."
"(EL) Mr President, the price increases of all mass-market consumer goods, transport and services combined with low wages and pensions, and drastic cuts in social welfare benefits have inflicted repeated damage on people's incomes while generating enormous profits for monopoly business groups."
"Prices have risen uncontrollably for ordinary working-class families in all Member States."
"Those who try to blame the high prices on a few bad speculators are deceiving the people."
"They are hiding the fact that high prices are fuelled by the profits of monopolies, and free market and competition policies, which are at the very basis of the EU itself and its policies that have been shaped and implemented by Member States and their governments."
"High prices start with the monopoly on production and trade, which is dominated by the business groups plundering people's incomes, and crushing thousands of small businesses and undertakings."
"We call on the workers to step up their struggle for real wage increases, pensions, social welfare benefits, and the abolition of VAT on common consumer goods, services of general interest and fuel, in a bid to reduce the prices of public utilities."
"(HU) On 15 May, a piece of legislation was created in the USA which is a milestone in the crisis surrounding illegal logging, which can be experienced worldwide."
"Congress was the first in the world to pass such an Act, which bans the import of illegally logged wood."
"In 2006, 10% of imports to the United States were produced from illegally logged wood."
"Following the adoption of the Act, analyses have emphasised that this Act is helping the competitiveness of American factories, protects jobs, and sends a clear message to which forestry communities will listen."
"My question is this: how long will the European Union wait, and what is it waiting for?"
"It is shameful and disgraceful that we are waiting with our arms folded."
"But we MEPs can do something: I recommend that everyone sign petition 23, which was presented a couple of months ago and the aim of which is for us to persuade the Commission to introduce legislation at last, after the United States, while we still have forests."
"Mr President, I want to draw your attention to the plight of one of my constituents, Alan Jones, from Knighton, a rural town in the West Midlands, who is a striking example of an entrepreneur in Europe who has been let down by the absence of high-speed broadband connection in rural areas."
"He wants to set up a small online company that will offer photo-framing services."
"He, as a person with a disability, working from home, would be ideal to start up a new business."
"However, there is only one Internet service provider who has a monopoly of broadband in the town and, although it is expanding, the connection is extremely slow and simply not conducive to running a business."
"The Commission has a plan to bridge the digital divide and expand broadband to rural areas, and it urgently needs to solve the problems of Internet service providers and ensure there are adequate resources, and that areas are not lagging behind in terms of quality and high speed and low cost."
"What I would like you to do, Mr President, is to make sure that the Commission ensures that entrepreneurs like Mr Jones are not prevented or frustrated from starting up businesses, which prevents the creation of much-needed jobs in rural areas."
"(LT) The European Commission and members of the WTO are rushing to finalise the Doha talks on agriculture and the opening of the market for industrial goods, NAMA."
"The significant influence of the current situation in the United States, the election, is evident."
"However, compared with the suspension of the round in 2006, the NAMA issue is obviously a step backwards."
"Highly developed countries are managing to maintain an almost unchanged environmental situation."
"EU textile and clothing tariffs will be down from 12 to 4%."
"The markets of emerging economies will not open, as it is not tariffs, but the obligations of maximum tariffs that are to be curtailed."
"Besides, an 18-year transitional period is to be applied to China, the country that flooded Europe and the rest of the world with low-quality goods."
"The tabled NAMA project is unacceptable to Lithuania and other EU countries, as it would jeopardise their competitiveness."
"There is an obvious balance between agriculture and NAMA."
"The EU should not race to complete the Doha talks merely on account of its economy."
"I would urge the Commission to take its time and represent the EU countries' interests fairly."
"(PT) Mr President, I should like to congratulate the fishermen from different countries of the European Union, and from Portugal in particular, on their fight to protect the strategic fisheries sector, as well as jobs, decent wages and living conditions for thousands of fishermen and their families."
"Faced with a common fisheries policy and a European Union that is indifferent to the longstanding socio-economic crisis this sector is undergoing, that has become all the more acute due to increases in the price of and financial speculation on fuel - diesel and petrol - fishermen have finally shown that there are solutions and measures that should have been taken a long time ago."
"Solutions and measures requiring the European Union to stop turning a deaf ear, adopting new policies that protect and promote the fisheries sector, not its slow agony and ruin."
"Fisheries have a future."
"I cannot conclude this brief intervention without acknowledging the thousands of workers who will be demonstrating in Lisbon tomorrow in defence of their achievements and labour rights."
"(CS) Mr President, the enlargement of the Schengen area was excellent news for the citizens of my country, a symbol of the equality of Czech citizens with the other countries of the Union."
"Sadly, today's newspapers are full of headlines about Czech drivers being hassled by German and Austrian police."
"Since April systematic and detailed checks on buses and private cars with Czech registration plates have been carried out in Germany and Austria."
"After just over a month of general checking, Austria announced its intention to carry out checks, starting in June, in connection with the European Football Championship."
"That is fair enough."
"However, I strongly object to general checks on Czech drivers in Germany."
"This is a one-sided decision that is difficult to explain and it is damaging neighbourly relations."
"I get letters from citizens asking for the Czech authorities to retaliate."
"This is not a good situation and it will also affect the political climate prior to the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty."
"I have already submitted an appeal and now I am asking my fellow German Members to look into this matter at home in Germany."
"(RO) Dear colleagues, I would like to welcome the shares program initiated by the Council of Europe, which aims to eliminate all forms of violence among children and I am convinced that in 2009 physical punishment will be forbidden all over the world."
"Yet, I would like to underline the need for a common campaign on a European level, by means of which children become aware of the fact that violence towards them is against the law and that they must confess any ill treatment they are subjected to."
"In some EU Member States, parents regard physical punishment as a normal method of education and children assume this as being normal."
"The future of the European Union depends on the way children's rights are observed, and during their education we must have in mind an approach that forbids any form of violence."
"(PT) Eurofound recently reported that 25% of redundancies in Portugal between 2003 and 2006 stemmed from company relocations."
"Records show that several multinationals have done so after having received millions of euros in community aid and after making millions in profit, which is unacceptable."
"There are cases of workers still not having received the compensation to which they are entitled, as is the case in Vila Nova de Gaia and Brax, whose workers went to the Courthouse door yesterday to call for the compensation money that they have been owed for five years."
"Unemployment is also acting as a justification for ever more precarious employment, to which the Government responds with more attempts to set back labour rights."
"I therefore welcome the day of action that the General Confederation of Portuguese Workers (CGTP) is holding tomorrow in Lisbon, Portugal."
"Mr President, I would just like to draw the attention of the House to the conference that is taking place in Rome on the global food crisis."
"We have expressed our concerns in this House about this issue in our recent resolution on food prices."
"One of the key issues is the under-investment in agriculture, both in the developed and the developing world."
"The extent of that problem was brought home to me at a conference in Ireland just last week, when a Missionary Sister of the Holy Rosary, Nora MacNamara, mentioned very clearly that, when she was involved in agriculture many years ago in Africa, there was investment."
"And then, she said, Africa - or rather agriculture - became a dirty word when looking for funds to support projects in this area."
"We need to go back to our roots in terms of investing in agriculture."
"Can I just say, in the debate on the Treaty of Lisbon in Ireland, that this Treaty will actually enhance the European Union's role in the developing world and, in my view, will assist us in meeting the food crisis which we are now facing not just in Europe, but globally."
"(HU) In February this year, Mr Erdogan, the Turkish Prime Minister, gave an extremely controversial speech in Cologne, in which he called assimilation a crime against humanity."
"From a position of freedom to choose one's identity, this statement is unacceptable; preserving cultural diversity is an important goal, but the decision cannot be taken away from the individual."
"The natural situation for Turks in Western Europe may be dual identity."
"Erdogan's requirement for a Turkish-language university in Germany is unrealistic, since in many countries of the Union the indigenous national minorities who have lived there for many hundreds of years do not have their own state university, like the Hungarians in Transylvania, where the Hungarian community was deprived of an independent state university during the Communist dictatorship."
"It is important that Turkey does not manipulate the migrant minorities living in Western Europe for interior policy aims."
"It would also be good if Prime Minister Erdogan put his own house in order in the areas of the situation of the Kurds, acknowledging the genocide of Armenians and equality of rights for women."
"(RO) Mister President, European socialists hope that Europe becomes an example for the whole world in terms of life quality."
"The 27 Member States are now building a new social Europe which will bring prosperity to all citizens of the European Union."
"From the Union's budget for 2008, almost 45% is allocated to growth, innovation, job creation and economic and social cohesion, and 42,6% is allocated to agriculture."
"Rural areas represent 90% of the European Union territory."
"Despite the EURO 41 million allocated to agriculture in 2008, the increase of costs for agricultural works and the increase in energy prices brought about an increase in prices of agricultural products and caused the economic situation to deteriorate."
"I consider that the grants policy for agriculture and adequate conditions for the promotion of investments in the field are the answer to part of the challenges the Union will encounter in the following years."
"A developed agriculture will allow all European citizens to have access to healthy food and sufficient quantities, at affordable prices."
"Healthy nutrition is a fundamental aspect of life quality."
"That concludes this item."
"Generalised tariff preferences for the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011 (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Helmuth Markov, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the proposal for a Council regulation applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences for the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011 and amending Regulations (EC) No 552/97, No 1933/2006 and Commission Regulations (EC) No 964/2007 and No 1100/2006 - C6-0051/2008 -."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me first apologise on behalf of Peter Mandelson, who is not able to be here to discuss with this House the regulation on the generalised system of preferences (GSP)."
"He has asked me to speak on his behalf."
"I thank you for your work and the valuable comments made on the proposal for a GSP regulation for 2009-2011."
"The Commission considered it important that Parliament should be able to express its opinion, and we really appreciate the effort you have made to examine the proposals and provide an opinion, even in a rather short timetable."
"We therefore welcome the opinion and the opportunity to engage with you and explain the Commission's position."
"The GSP scheme is an important pro-development instrument of EU trade policy."
"The Commission therefore appreciates the recognition in the opinion that the EU's GSP is the most important such scheme among the developed countries and that it continues to make an important contribution to the objective of promoting development and poverty reduction in the developing world."
"We share the objective expressed by Parliament that the scheme should continue to operate in a stable, transparent and predictable manner."
"These aspects are important for the beneficiary countries themselves, giving them and economic operators within the EU a firmer basis for their own decision-making on trade and investment opportunities."
"The Commission considers that all three components of the scheme - the standard GSP for all beneficiaries, the 'GSP Plus' for those countries that make specific commitments in terms of adherence to international standards for good governance and sustainable development, and the Everything But Arms initiative for the least-developed countries - are operating well and in line with the overall policy orientations put in place for the period 2006-2015."
"That is why the basic approach underpinning the proposed regulation for 2009-2011 is one of continuity in substance, combined with some technical updating."
"We are working actively with the Member States in the Council towards agreement on the final regulation."
"The Presidency has set the objective of achieving this before the end of June."
"That is something the Commission supports, since an early decision is important to ensure that beneficiary countries and all other interested parties, including business operators, have sufficient notice of the changes to be made next January."
"Another very important reason for an early decision is that all those countries that wish to apply for 'GSP Plus' treatment will have to do so by the end of October and need confirmation as soon as possible of the relevant criteria and the process they will have to follow."
"I would note that some of Parliament's comments and suggestions in fact relate to issues that go beyond the scope of this regulation, even if they are certainly issues of importance from a development perspective."
"Reform of the EC's preferential rules of origin, including for the purpose of the GSP, is being taken forward in a separate exercise headed by Commissioner Kovács."
"A number of comments also touch on the need to ensure that developing countries are able to access sufficient and good-quality aid for trade to help them build trade capacity and harness the potential of trade to drive their own economic growth and sustainable development."
"Here the European Union has already demonstrated its strong commitment and, in the EU Aid for Trade strategy of October 2007, has put in place a firm basis on which to make yet further improvements."
"In conclusion, let me repeat that we very much appreciate the interest shown by Parliament in these proposals."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, development cooperation and trade are usually the most important external forces able to contribute to a country's development."
"Non-reciprocal tariff preferences for developing countries are an important and internationally recognised instrument that the European Union has been using for many years."
"Three kinds of arrangements are currently in force."
"Firstly, the general arrangement that applies to all beneficiary countries."
"Secondly, the GSP+ incentive scheme, which provides additional benefits for countries implementing certain international standards in human and labour rights, environmental protection, the fight against drugs, and good governance."
"Thirdly, the special arrangement for the least-developed countries, which in theory offers them duty-free and quota-free access to the EU internal market for 'Everything But Arms'."
"My personal view here is that it is absolutely fatal that that there is still no legally binding regulation banning exports of arms from the European Union to these countries."
"All the trade preferences in the world are of no use if violent conflicts destroy the basis of a functioning national economy."
"The report before us contains improvements to the Commission proposal for the GSP system for the period from January 2009 to December 2011 under the following items:"
"Firstly, improvement in application and effectiveness."
"This also includes shortening the amendment and test deadlines from three-year to one-year periods."
"Secondly, developing rules for a reform process in which the beneficiaries are included as appropriate."
"Thirdly, coherence with the multilateral framework of the WTO and thereby, of course, with the objectives of the Doha Development Round."
"Ranking among these, along with the necessary impact assessment of the development capability of the EU's trade policy instruments, is, in first place, the fact that reform of the EU's rules of origin is taking place at the same time as the new GSP scheme comes into force, and secondly and above all, that rules on the requirements for beneficiary countries are being improved."
"I am therefore thinking, for example, of the possibility of inter-regional and cross-regional cumulation."
"This means that a product produced in a regional but cross-border production process does not fall short of GSP acceptance on the basis of meaningless country of origin rules."
"Fourthly, securing democratic and parliamentary control of the implementation and adaptation, if necessary, of the regulation currently in force."
"I should like to say here that I welcome the Commission's inclusion of Parliament in the consultation process at this point in time, but that Parliament will have to make joint decisions on these issues in future on a fairly regular basis."
"I assume from this that the Commission will take our amendments seriously this time instead of largely ignoring them, as in the case of the own-initiative report on reform two years ago."
"A comment on the GSP+ incentive scheme: I think it is extremely important when evaluating the human rights situation and good governance - not just in trade relations - that the various countries are not measured by different standards."
"At the same time it is perfectly clear, however, that a rash abandonment of trade preferences can have disastrous consequences for the population of a developing country and even for the human rights situation there, too."
"The decision on how well or badly the international agreements specified in the annex to the current regulation are actually implemented and whether preferences should be abandoned if necessary should therefore be tested extremely carefully."
"I should like to support Amendment 37 tabled here, which reminds us that every possibility should be checked so that the countries not among the least-developed and that have not signed any economic partnership agreement can enjoy a new framework for trade, which offers trade preferences that at least correspond to those of the Cotonou Agreement."
"In this connection I should like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and the Committee on Development - and Mr Kaczmarek over there - for their cooperation and willingness to compromise."
"The Committee on International Trade has been able to accept this report unanimously, including the contents of the opinion of the Committee on Development."
"There has been extensive agreement with the Council and the Commission - we also had regular debates on this - and I therefore hope that the regulation can enter into force as planned in good time and that there will be no disparities between the current and the new preference period."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. - (PL) Mr President, the international community recognises trade as a fundamental factor of development."
"More active inclusion of developing countries in multilateral relations is a very important stage on the road to eliminating world poverty."
"The generalised tariff preferences system does not, therefore, help the development of EU trade."
"It primarily serves to support developing countries, including the least developed ones."
"The main objectives of the system should consequently be to reduce poverty and to facilitate sustainable development and good governance in developing countries, as well as to implement the Millennium Goals."
"As draftsman for the Committee on Development I would like to emphasise that Mr Markov's report is a very good one, and I would like to thank both the rapporteur and the Committee on International Trade for accepting the opinion of the Committee on Development."
"These two committees have not always worked together in such harmony as has been evident in this case, so I would like to express my sincere thanks."
"Among the issues we recognised jointly as being the most important are: strengthening Parliament's role in the system decision-making process - to increase transparency, legal certainty and democratic control; to make it easier to establish the country of origin principle - in order to optimise the application of preferences, e.g. through inter-regional cumulation, which will at the same time promote regional cooperation in poorer countries; equal treatment for all countries as candidates for GSP+, regardless of when they meet the system's criteria; and last but not least, the most penetrative, complete and detailed analysis of the effect of the system before its next review for the years 2013-2014."
"Parliament would like to know the effects of the functioning of the system."
"Key to this is knowledge of the extent to which the tariff preferences system helps to limit poverty."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, the system under debate here serves to combat poverty and backwardness."
"Three points seem to me to be important here."
"First, since this is now the continuation: there should be flexibility both on entering the system and on leaving it, if parameters were to be changed in one state."
"In other words: must a state that was once a beneficiary always remain a beneficiary?"
"This does not appear to be the case to me."
"We should not forget that the EU also has a duty to its own citizens, workers and consumers."
"There must be a reciprocal advantage; it should not always be one-sided."
"Secondly, we welcome the fact that the European Parliament is to be informed during the next term."
"We would also like an assessment of this system, however."
"This assessment should provide a comparison with other preferential measures such as the EPA, for example."
"We would realistically state that statistically, a gap is continually opening up between rich and poor, despite the EU's diverse measures and despite the measures of the Member States."
"Are our certainly well-intentioned efforts still leading to the right results?"
"We ought to be asking ourselves this question quite deliberately."
"Thirdly, preferential measures such as, for example, the GSP system we are discussing here, should be linked to the following criteria."
"We need a certain strictness here."
"First, the promotion of democracy and the rule of law."
"Second, the construction of a minimum framework on social and environmental standards in the beneficiary states."
"We want to provide assistance with this, which is also clearly stated in the report."
"We should not be backing down, however, for the sake of our own credibility."
"My thanks at this point go to the rapporteur for his effective cooperation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when Parliament voiced its opinion on the application of the GSP for the 2005-2008 period, the Commission did not see fit to incorporate its proposals."
"We stand by these priorities today, particularly the fact that Parliament must be more involved in the allocation and monitoring of the various GSP schemes."
"The role of representatives of civil society, and social partners in particular, must also be strengthened."
"They represent a valuable source of information when checking that the main conventions governing the allocation of GSP+ have been implemented."
"On this point, I am pleased that the new regulation will be tougher on the respect for good governance provisions relating to workers' rights, human rights and the environment."
"The Union must have faith in its values and encourage its trading partners not only to ratify its conventions, but also to implement them concretely."
"This is why we are asking the Commission to incorporate one of our proposals which is essential for the GSP+ to continue acting as an incentive."
"At present, a country which is not eligible for GSP+ from 2009 will have to wait until the introduction of the next regulation in 2012 in order to reapply."
"We would like it to be possible to submit new applications every year so that developing countries have a real incentive to implement these conventions as soon as possible to benefit from the GSP+."
"Finally, I would like to remind everyone of the need to reform the rules of origin in order to have a global, simplified and harmonised system based on strengthening regional integration, which remains its primary vocation."
"Calculations of national added value must therefore take into account the particular situation of poor countries, which are not able to benefit if the rules of origin are too restrictive."
"With the GSP, the Union has a means of fostering not only the integration of developing countries within world trade, but also of spreading good governance."
"Parliament's proposals would allow progress on both counts."
"We hope that they will be incorporated by the Commission."
"Mr President, the EU gives the most in financial aid to the third world."
"However, third world countries are in need of more than just money."
"It is extremely important that those countries' economies are developed and strengthened."
"I very much support trade between Europe, and African, Caribbean and Pacific countries."
"I cannot agree with the World Trade talks in Geneva."
"The deal on offer will in no way benefit European agriculture; it will not help food security in Europe - or indeed, in Ireland."
"We are not the only ones, however, who are dissatisfied."
"America is also dissatisfied."
"And of the 152 countries involved in global trading it would appear that only two are satisfied."
"I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the decision made by the Farmers' Association in Ireland to accept and support the Lisbon Treaty."
"In about a week's time the referendum on the Treaty will take place in Ireland."
"I would also like to say that we would like the Treaty to be authorized and adopted so that we will be stronger and more unified in the process involving future world talks."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, on the face of it, I should be in favour of this report which seeks to help under-developed nations."
"After all, Britain's Commonwealth preference system was of enormous benefit to the less well-off members of the British Commonwealth, but then I do not suppose you want to hear how a wicked post-imperial power actually helped its poorer neighbours."
"The problem is that EU programmes always turn out to have the opposite effect to that intended."
"The CFP, intended to conserve fish stocks, is a disaster as a result of which the EU, by the votes of this House, has awarded licences to EU fishing fleets to raid the waters of one Third World country after another, bringing poverty and starvation where once there was at least subsistence level."
"Excess sugar production is dumped on the Third World, to which the answer evidently is to reduce European production, not put it to better use."
"Poor-quality EU tobacco grown with EUR 18 million of our taxpayers' money every year was dumped where it did most harm."
"Now we are told this money will go on anti-smoking propaganda, not Third World aid."
"EU aid programmes are a classic case of giving with one hand and taking back with the other."
"The CAP restricts imports, hampering developing nations while at the same time dumping its excess in the Third World."
"Poor local farmers are thus put out of business, pulling the rug from under the very countries that the GSP is meant to help."
"Food prices are spiralling so much that former Soviet Union leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, is warning of a food revolution."
"While all this is going on, the EU is promoting biofuel targets, which will impact on food production in the Third World more than anywhere."
"So this House can wax lyrical about how the EU's GSP programme will come to the aid of less-developed nations, but the truth is that EU policies will only help to ensure that the poor stay poor, the hungry stay hungry, and the less-developed nations stay undeveloped."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to reiterate the importance of the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) for the economic and trade development of the beneficiary countries."
"Parliament's amendments have largely improved the proposal for a regulation, which will cover the 2009-2011 period, and have focused on aspects that could improve the conditions for using the system by these beneficiary countries, such as provision of technical assistance by the European Union, which is a fundamental element for taking better advantage of the trade benefits of the GSP."
"It is also worth highlighting the possibility for some countries to apply for inclusion in the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development, GSP+, which is more advantageous, and moreover the fact that they can do so every year."
"I think, however, that some of the amendments adopted in the Committee on International Trade go too far."
"Amendment 8, regarding the possibility that countries that are not the final recipients of exports can benefit from the more favourable GSP+ and Everything But Arms arrangements, could be detrimental to some countries that really do deserve to be included in these arrangements."
"In general, it could create more confusion in the application of the GSP and of the rules of origin."
"This is an issue that should be left for the next review of the rules of origin."
"I think that there is also a need to highlight, as some of my colleagues have done, the importance of the European Commission presenting studies assessing the impact of the GSP in the beneficiary countries."
"I think, however, that this study should focus on the purely trade aspects and not cover other areas that do not fall under the scope of this regulation."
"Finally, I would like to point out, echoing the Chairman of the committee himself, Mr Markov, that our amendments strengthen the role of the European Parliament in the application of the regulation."
"What is being considered in the regulation is the future role of the European Parliament in trade policy once the Lisbon Treaty has been adopted, as I hope it will be."
"Mr President, I should just like to make one very brief point to the Commissioner."
"The Commissioner rightly mentioned that GSP+ is about sustainable development and it is connected, as the Chairman of the Committee on International Trade said, to the Millennium Goals."
"This is very important and I remember very well, when we discussed this kind of scheme for the first time, that we said we needed to evaluate and re-evaluate how valuable it is for the countries and for ourselves."
"There is one topic to which I would very much like to draw your attention, which might become a complicated and tricky one in the future, concerning those countries that are operating within the scheme but which have a complicated environment."
"For example, Sri Lanka, which would love to fulfil the goals, but because of many conditions - and I do not want to go into the details - might not be capable of doing so."
"I am not arguing that we should change our system."
"I would just ask the Commission - as my colleague Kader Arif has already done - to be very careful in evaluating each individual case."
"I would ask you to come back to our committee and to the Committee on Foreign Affairs when you have carried out the evaluation and then please come back to this House, and let us have an evaluation and a discussion on the topic I mentioned."
"(SV) Let me begin by saying that I think the Generalised System of Preferences is an extremely good instrument for development, because it binds together trade and development in a very clear manner and gives tariff concessions and hence access to European markets to those countries which make an effort."
"It is also important that we do use it as a development tool."
"Now this is a technical review, and it is important that we do not exacerbate matters for those who need development aid most but, on the contrary, strengthen the development dimension."
"I think that in many ways this review does that in an excellent way and it advances the tool in the right direction, but it does not really go the whole distance."
"I think for example of Vietnam."
"Vietnam is heavily dependent on a single product group, namely shoes."
"As you no doubt know, the GSP system has a threshold value which says that a country must achieve over 50% of the value of its exports in order to be guaranteed GSP status."
"At the moment Vietnam falls below 50%."
"That is because of us, because of Europe - we must be aware of that - and because we have penalised Vietnam with tariffs on shoe exports in particular."
"Regardless of this, they continue to be heavily dependent on their shoe exports, not least poor women in Vietnam."
"So I wonder: why can they not keep their preference?"
"It is after all only 3.5%."
"It is not the case that they lose, that they get entirely tariff-free access; they just get somewhat lower tariffs."
"Besides, in the future we shall have a free trade agreement with Vietnam."
"So I wonder: why throw them out now when we are about to take them in and absorb these exports through a free trade agreement?"
"I therefore hope that you will look at this during the next period of application, so that no country ends up in this situation, in this limbo into which I think we are putting Vietnam in the GSP system."
"(PT) The Generalised System of Preferences has proved to be a key trade policy instrument for promoting development and eradicating poverty in the world's most fragile countries and regions through their progressive integration into the international trading system."
"As has already been said here, the European Union has three types of arrangements aimed at promoting such development."
"For the most part, the mechanisms in force work well but they could, of course, be honed further and the European Parliament must actively participate to make sure that this fine-tuning does in fact occur."
"In the main, this report clearly aims at this."
"The proposals it contains on such important issues as reform and clarification of rules of origin appear to be very relevant, in terms of promoting the principle of regional aggregation, assessing the impact of the outcome of the current Doha Round negotiations and the call for more technical assistance for the least developed countries so that they can benefit fully from this aid."
"All these concerns point in one direction: making these instruments more useful to the poorest countries, thus contributing decisively to achieving their ultimate goal of fighting backwardness, poverty and the absolute injustice that are still brought about in the world by underdevelopment."
"Mr President, like many of my colleagues in the House today, I welcome the amendments that are intended to improve the Commission's proposals in line with the rapporteur's proposals."
"It is not often on the Committee on International Trade that we can say that, and that we have that sort of consensus across the parties."
"His proposal is to produce a more effective system that better responds to the interests of beneficiary countries, to develop rules for a better regulated reform process, to ensure that regulation is in line with democratic control and parliamentary scrutiny, to bring the GSP scheme into line with the WTO and the Doha Round, and also to improve the transparency of GSP."
"In this spirit, I would like to urge my colleagues to support a cross-party global campaign calling for real trade, of which I am the co-chairman with Abdi Abdirahman, the Speaker of the East African Legislative Assembly."
"We call for five things: let us abolish agricultural subsidies; let us abolish agricultural tariffs; let us liberalise rules of origin; let us stop supporting corrupt governments through direct budgetary support and place more emphasis on aid for trade, so that we can invest in things like infrastructure; and let us incentivise low-income countries to remove barriers between each other."
"However, we should also call on governments of poorer countries to consider doing the same for basic essentials."
"It is morally wrong for poor people to pay more for food and medicines because of government import tariffs."
"Yes, the EU should open up its markets, but this good work is often undermined if other governments restrict access and keep prices high purely for ideological reasons."
"So, we should all work together to fight trade tariffs that condemn the poor."
"We should end government subsidies that incentivise tyranny, and we should always be a friend of those who want to work their way out of poverty, because with our help they will end world hunger."
"(CS) Mr President, today we are debating a change in the preferential rates of customs duties for developing countries for the next three years."
"I fully support Mr Helmuth Markov's call for greater flexibility in his report."
"Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl's amendments are important."
"The European Commission must undertake a far more detailed analysis of the impact of generalised tariff preferences on the economies of developing countries, and examine their effect on the European economy and on consumer protection."
"It is not just the GSP but also non-tariff measures, humanitarian aid or - on the contrary - sanctions in respect of serious violations of human rights or international agreements that affect the development of the poorest countries."
"Consequently, we must insist on serious and in-depth analyses of the impact of all these measures on developing countries: only when we have the results should we modify the tariffs, in a more flexible manner than today."
"This should not be an isolated process."
"The modifications should go hand in hand with all the other measures."
"We should also improve the way in which our development policy is coordinated with the US and other countries."
"(PL) Mr President, if the objective of our actions is the reduction of poverty in third countries and economic integration, then the European Union's tariff preferences programme really is the right way to go about it."
"We must at the same time remember that it is essential to strive for maximum transparency in the customs system."
"This is why I believe it is necessary to monitor this process, and at the end of each stage it would be worth taking a look here in this House, in successive debates, at the results of the solutions currently being implemented."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am impressed by the intriguing questions of the honourable Members, especially the fact that nearly every one is critically constructive."
"All are involved in the whole procedure and doing their utmost to make it a good proposal."
"I can assure you that Peter Mandelson will pay attention to your input - there is no doubt about that - and that he will take the amendments seriously and not ignore them."
"I know Peter a bit better."
"He is not the kind of person who would ignore such proposals and such thoughts, but he would like to look at it from both sides - helping developing countries (especially the least developed, as Mr Kaczmarek mentioned) is what he has in mind."
"However, the aim is to be both objective and predictable."
"Regarding Mrs Mann's invitation to come back (and I am sure she is asking for Peter Mandelson to come back, although I would be delighted to come back), I am sure he will take up the invitation."
"Mr Ó Neachtain put it in a wider perspective, and I am pleased with the Geneva WTO discussions."
"Peter Mandelson will not be surprised at the views of the honourable Member."
"And Mr Kamall urged that we do our utmost and be a friend to those who want to work."
"I thank you again for all the proposals."
"The draft is in Council, where the Member States will reflect on Parliament's amendments to ensure that stability guidelines for the GSP are established for 2005-2015."
"What is the reason leading the Commission not to introduce significant changes?"
"After one year of operations it is too early to make conclusive observations, but this is something we will no doubt come back to."
"Concerning the questions by Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Audy: the ultimate objectives of the scheme are indeed education and the eradication of poverty."
"At the same time, the EU provides an incentive for sustainable development, good governance and human rights, as well as labour standards and child labour in particular."
"Concerning aid: the GSP tariff preferences provide market access to developed countries."
"Aid programmes are governed under the EU Joint Aid for Trade strategy which, among other objectives, claims to enable developing countries to benefit from the GSP."
"Mrs Mann and Mr Fjellner mentioned Sri Lanka."
"At the moment Sri Lanka benefits from the GSP+."
"There are no indications that it would stop benefiting from GSP arrangements in the future."
"Each and every country's situation is assessed carefully, transparently and following the provisions of the regulations."
"One question asked that the application process of the GSP+ scheme be more frequent than once every three years - I have already touched upon this - so let us make a deal that it should be flexible but we should not just stick to one year."
"Mrs Mann asked how the application for the GSP+ will be assessed."
"The monitoring and evaluation of compliance with the eligibility requirements of the GSP+ arrangement is based on the findings of the monitoring mechanisms established under the auspices of the relevant international organisation, such as the UN and ILO and other agencies, as well as on the monetary mechanism emphasised in the conventions themselves and made publicly available by these agencies."
"This provides for unambiguous and impartial review processes."
"I would like to answer Mr Arif's question on the situation of the Commission in GSP+ beneficiary countries in terms of the implementation of human rights conventions and the correlative standards."
"I can assure you that the Commission is following closely the developments of the current GSP+ beneficiaries in respect to their compliance with the GSP+ relevant international conventions."
"I shall just mention the example of El Salvador (which is a GSP+ beneficiary country, as you are aware), with regard to which the Commission, in consultation with EU Member States, has recently launched an investigation into its compliance with GSP+ obligations."
"I can assure you that the proper implementation of the EU trade arrangements is one of the Commission's priorities."
"We pay close attention to the GSP+ beneficiaries' compliance, and these issues are regularly raised in our bilateral contacts with those countries."
"Concerning the new GSP rules of origin and how they will contribute to the GSP objectives: they are currently being discussed in the context of a general broad reform of the rules of origin."
"The Taxation and Customs Union DG is chef de file, so that concerns my colleague Mr Kovács."
"The aim is to render them more development-friendly, and that process is governed in consultation with the developing countries."
"The last point concerns shoes in Vietnam, which was one of the examples."
"The exclusion - or graduation, for it is fair to use that word of Vietnamese products falling under section 12 (I am now talking about the footwear of the combined nomenclature from the benefits under the proposed GSP regulation for the years 2009-2011) - is being given full attention by all the relevant Commission services."
"The Commission has also been in close contact with Vietnam on this issue in order to provide all necessary assistance and expertise."
"Concerning the graduation of Vietnam in relation to Section 12, this results from the technical and objective application of the GSP provisions and reflects the fact that Vietnamese exports of these products are more competitive on the Community market."
"In addition, Vietnam has successfully diversified its export base."
"That is a positive point and means that footwear is no longer so dominant."
"That is another, significant sign of increasing competitiveness."
"So the COM proposal for the graduation of Vietnam is based on extensive objectives and statistical analyses applied in the same way to all GSP+ beneficiaries."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, we could say that there was major agreement in this House over the fact that the GSP+ system is a very positive one."
"I would, of course, have been happy to ask the Commission or Mr Mandelson, who is not here, however, how he would in fact be pressing the Andean countries, for example, two countries that very much want to retain GSP, to conclude free-trade agreements as part of the Partnership and Association Agreements."
"Ecuador and Bolivia want to retain this GSP+."
"We shall then be able to get involved with it."
"It will indeed get them somewhere."
"The second question is whether or not we should be considering developing the GSP+ system further into a GSP++."
"The challenges ahead of us are entirely new."
"We have climate change, we have rising food prices."
"We could perhaps consider whether to introduce new paragraphs and new assessment standards."
"I am very happy, Commissioner, that you have made some very clear statements on Sri Lanka, because this was also my Committee's concern, and Mrs Mann has carried this out with determination once again."
"Finally, my thanks once again to all those with whom I needed to work. We enjoyed good cooperation."
"I think that we are a small step further ahead and that this GSP+ system is very valuable and necessary as part of the European Union's trade agreement."
"I also think that we do not always have to concentrate solely on free-trade agreements."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"From its settlement, SGP was one of the main tools of EU trade and development policies."
"The main objective of the EU and SGP development policy is to contribute to poverty reduction, the promotion of sustainable development and good governance, principles that are recognised by international conventions and tools, such as the Millennium Declaration, Rio Declaration - 1992, OIM-1998 Declaration."
"With the application of SGP in 1971, the EU facilitated international trade with the developing countries and the less developed countries, providing them the necessary technical assistance for observing the international conventions and building the necessary institutional and regulation framework so as to take advantage of international trade and SGP."
"At the same time, following the verified notification, and after EP notification, the CE may apply the sanction of temporary withdrawal of the preferences of those countries that violate the inclusion criteria in the beneficiaries' list."
"The report underlines the importance of the public consultation process, the involvement of the target beneficiaries and the consolidation of the EP democratic control."
"Because both SGP and the list of beneficiary countries are revised every three years, the Council is asked not to delay their submission so that they might be approved by the EP, avoiding the gaps in international trade."
"I congratulate the rapporteur."
"The work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2007 (debate) (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Alain Hutchinson, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2007."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report I prepared for the Committee on Development reviews the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) in 2007."
"Those of you who are actively involved in this work or are simply interested in it know that it is not a purely formal or symbolic structure, indeed quite the reverse, since the Assembly increasingly functions as a true parliamentary assembly."
"Its members are increasingly engaged in it, influential figures sound it out and as a result it is acquiring growing political importance."
"This is the first point that I wanted to emphasise."
"The growing political importance of this Assembly also derives from the fact that apart from the fundamental issues relating to cooperation between ACP and EU countries, it also discusses issues which are topical both for Europeans and ACP countries."
"This is the case, for example, with the Economic Partnership Agreements negotiated between the Union and ACP countries."
"On this issue, the JPA has confirmed with the Kigali Declaration that the leaders concerned clearly want the European Commission to give ACP countries enough time to negotiate regional development agreements."
"Kigali is not only an opportunity to show that there is real resistance to these agreements, as they currently exist, but also that this resistance is founded on concerns which are entirely legitimate and which must now be properly taken into account."
"In the same way, it is only through participating in the work of the Assembly that many MPs in ACP countries have learnt of the existence of Country Strategy Papers that define areas of cooperation between the EU and their own countries."
"This serves as a reminder that, for many MPs in ACP countries, the Assembly is sometimes the only possible forum for democratic expression."
"I would also like to stress that in 2007 we witnessed the increasing engagement of civil society in ACP countries, with excellent meetings and initiatives being organised on the sidelines of each JPA session."
"In the fight for development by civil society in ACP countries, the Assembly also represents an extraordinary opportunity for exchange and encounter."
"In this respect, the Union must be able to support, technically and financially, the presence of these associations and NGOs in the work of the JPA."
"Finally, I would like to underline that in our report, we encourage the JPA to strengthen the role of its Committee on Political Affairs."
"The idea behind this is to make it a true forum for conflict prevention and settlement and to encourage close collaboration between the activities of ACP and EU parliamentarians as election observers within the framework of EU election observation."
"You should also know that in 2007 the Assembly met in Wiesbaden, and then in Kigali."
"Nine resolutions were adopted."
"The standing committees met four times: twice on the sidelines of the sessions and twice in between those sessions, in Brussels."
"These committees, which are in charge of following up the resolutions, have since 2007 organised the hearing of the responsible committee members in the corresponding areas."
"Apart from several reports, the Wiesbaden session adopted a resolution on the situation in Darfur."
"There was a very constructive urgent debate on the situation in Zimbabwe."
"The workshops on immigration, climate change and medicines for neglected diseases all attracted a great number of participants and great interest."
"The Kigali session adopted three resolutions contained in the reports by the Standing Committees, Committees and two urgent resolutions on natural disasters in the ACP countries and the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"Mr President, Commissioner, there you have it. I have briefly summarised a formal report that I wanted to give a political content, in order to help explain and more effectively support the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you very much, but I can assure you that I am really enjoying it here and I know that my dear colleague regrets very much that he cannot be here for this discussion."
"This exchange of views is very close to his heart, but I can assure you he is not wasting his time: he is travelling to an important meeting outside Brussels."
"The Joint Parliamentary Assembly is a unique institution."
"Mr Michel is my neighbour in the college meeting and this morning he explained everything to me about the functioning of the Assembly, so now I can claim to know a little bit about that."
"He mentioned that the JPA is where the spirit of partnership that lies at the heart of the Cotonou Agreement can be witnessed directly, as 156 elected representatives from the European Union and from African, Caribbean and Pacific countries discuss together the core issues of their cooperation."
"That is real North-South dialogue, a dialogue on the basis of equality and mutual respect, going beyond the traditional recipient-donor relationship."
"That is the parliamentary embodiment of ownership and control."
"Over the past years the Joint Parliamentary Assembly has become increasingly parliamentary in stature and in conduct, reflecting the maturity of the cooperation between the European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries."
"Those debates are more open and regional conflicts less frequent."
"That is indeed a worthwhile achievement."
"The Assembly has indeed become a framework for an open political dialogue, showing itself capable of discussing issues of great sensitivity and major political relevance such as good governance, access to healthcare and the impact of foreign direct investment, the migration of skilled workers and the Economic Partnership Agreements."
"The excellent report of Mr Hutchinson and the Committee on Development presents this evolution eloquently and on behalf of Mr Michel and myself I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work."
"It presents the achievements and the challenges and explores the possibilities of future development."
"One achievement was the leading role that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly played in the monitoring of the EPA negotiations, ensuring a two-way information flow thanks to the discussions with the chief negotiators and with my dear colleague Mr Michel on this matter during the year."
"Another important leap has been the transmission by the Commission to the Assembly of the Country and Regional Strategy Papers."
"That demonstrates the confidence in the capacity of the Assembly to play a more political role and provides an opportunity to show further signs of maturity."
"In order to enhance parliamentary scrutiny, Commissioner Michel asked the Commission Delegations to transmit these strategy papers also to the Speakers of the national parliaments via the National Authorising Officer of the EDF in the beneficiary countries."
"As you are aware, the Commission cannot transmit them directly since according to the Cotonou Agreement the NAO is our official contact point for all questions of programming and of EDF implementation."
"At the same time, the JPA secretariat has also been transmitting these documents to the representatives of the respective countries in the JPA."
"We thus have reason to believe that the national parliaments are informed and can take their part in the monitoring and control of development programmes."
"It is true that the capacity of national parliaments to play their role fully in the preparation and execution of the EDF is often limited."
"That is why the EDF finances institutional support in many ACP countries."
"Beyond the scrutiny of Country Strategy Papers, the best way to ensure parliamentary control of EDF funds is to put in place general or sectoral budget support programmes."
"In this way the external funds are completely integrated into the national budgetary procedure where national parliaments play a key role."
"That is one of the reasons for the Commission's decision to attribute about 45% of the 10th EDF to budget support programmed in 44 countries, compared to just 25 at the start of the 9th EDF, so there is an upward trend."
"Lastly, let me take this opportunity to add my congratulations to the Government and Parliament of Rwanda and to the German Presidency for their excellent organisation of last year's Assembly sessions."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Hutchinson and congratulate him on his report, which is very good."
"I share the rapporteur's opinions, observations and satisfaction concerning such issues as the deeper involvement of members of the Assembly in its work, the quality of debates and the more relevant nature of these debates."
"I agree that the greater involvement of non-governmental organisations in the work of the Assembly is a very positive phenomenon."
"Meanwhile, I cannot remain silent about a couple of sadder aspects arising from observation of the work of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly."
"I think it is a great shame that during the discussions, debates and negotiations on joint projects between the ACP side and representatives of the European Parliament, not all subject areas are tackled with an equally deep dialogue and desire to find a common position."
"My impression is that the ACP side concentrates more on economic matters, devoting less attention and involvement to political matters."
"In 2007 unusual enthusiasm and determination was displayed in discussions of an economic nature, primarily in negotiations relating to economic partnership agreements (EPAs), and of course there is nothing wrong with that."
"It is, however, hard to perceive an equally strong motivation to resolve difficult but important political problems."
"Mr Hutchinson recalled that we had debated the situation in Zimbabwe, yet there was no resolution."
"This trend of not adopting resolutions is still continuing, though."
"This year we held a debate on Chad; a compromise text of a resolution was adopted, but the resolution itself was thrown out by our ACP partners."
"It seems to me that our goal should be to achieve more of a balance between economic and political goals."
"I appreciate that it is sometimes easier to concentrate on economic matters, as they seem more significant and easier to develop politically."
"Our European side should, however, concentrate on showing that there can be no continuing development without peace, stabilisation, human rights, the rule of law and better management."
"Mr President, I should first of all like to congratulate Mr Hutchinson on his excellent report."
"In 2007 we had confirmation of both the rise and relevance of the role of the JPA on the principal challenges of the North-South dialogue."
"Regarding political crisis situations, for example, our urgent debates have allowed an in-depth constructive dialogue free from taboo on issues such as Haiti, Zimbabwe and Ethiopia."
"The introduction of the JPA regional meetings, the first of which may have been in Namibia, I believe, will help to further deepen this political dialogue."
"On the implementation of the EDF, Country and Regional Strategy Papers have been submitted to ACP governments since the end of 2007."
"The JPA must now adopt a strategy and a working method to guarantee the best follow-up and supervision of the use of these funds."
"On the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), through its discussions and meetings with economic leaders and members of civil society, through its open political dialogue with our parliamentary colleagues in the South, the JPA made EPAs a political priority in 2007."
"The Kigali Declaration, which Mr Hutchinson mentioned earlier, is an illustration of this."
"I am sorry that the European Parliament dismissed this declaration, despite it being negotiated and voted on unanimously by representatives of the various political groups there."
"It would seem that, for some, a position adopted in Africa is sometimes harder to implement when we get back to Europe."
"I am also sorry that the European Commission is ignoring the views of ACP MPs within the JPA and that it prefers a bulldozer approach by which it refuses to consider any renegotiation or reorientation of the EPAs."
"The proposal for the creation of a new parliamentary body under the Caribbean agreement simply adds to the confusion."
"Finally, I cannot get over the fact that in 2007 Official Development Assistance from the whole of the EU fell for the first time since 2000."
"It is my belief that in terms of international solidarity, what matters most is keeping our word, and several Member States - including mine - are not keeping theirs."
"In 2008, the JPA should vigilantly and resolutely continue the fight for EPAs, lobbying for a proper renegotiation of interim agreements - for those who want it - in accordance with the promise made by Commissioner Barroso, and for the 10th EDF, which is now entering its active implementation phase, but which risks seeing its appropriations diverted to finance EPAs."
"The JPA is a unique forum and a unique tool for North-South dialogue."
"It is an opportunity for fair, sustainable and joint development."
"My colleague Mr Hutchinson has already said all of this, and I would like to congratulate him once more."
"(ES) Mr President, I will begin by congratulating Mr Hutchinson on clearly setting out in his report the work done by the Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) in 2007."
"The Assembly is becoming the strongest pillar of cooperation between the European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries."
"I would like to point out that it is the only international assembly that regularly brings together the elected representatives of various countries in order to promote North-South interdependence."
"The JPA has led the way with economic partnership agreements, which are tools for the regional development and integration policy for the ACP countries and a means of progressively including them in the global economy in a sustainable way."
"However, economic partnership agreements (EPAs) cannot be negotiated simply as free trade agreements."
"My group insists on the possibility of renegotiating issues in these agreements such as services, intellectual property and the 'Singapore issues': investments, powers and public markets, as well as employment and social regulations and other issues relating to sustainable development."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my compliments to Mr Hutchinson on his work and on the report's political approach, which I can endorse."
"I welcome the choice of the path of dialogue and cooperation."
"I would like to stress one point."
"In order to respond to the needs of the people of the ACP countries and to achieve the ambitious millennium development goals, it is necessary for the negotiations on Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) on a national and regional basis to be increasingly open to democratic participation and monitoring."
"I therefore confirm that the commitments that we made in Kigali at the 14th session of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly are central to our actions."
"I also welcome the reference to the need, when negotiating and applying the new agreements, to take into due account the protection and defence of democratic bodies and human rights."
"Our efforts cannot and must not be reduced to mere economic aid."
"(PL) Mr President, I would also like to congratulate Mr Hutchinson on an excellent report."
"It seems to me important for us to look at the significance of contacts of this type between parliaments, between groups of parliaments and between the European Parliament and both the ACP countries and EuroLat in the context of world dialogue."
"I feel that this is the form that should predominate in our contacts."
"What is established between governments is of a rather different nature."
"The dialogue that takes place between parliaments is a much broader dialogue; it contains broader debates, and it seems to me that it better reflects the interests and concerns of the countries taking part in such dialogue, so this type of dialogue seems to me to be particularly valuable."
"Also important are the political aspects that we would like to maintain, namely the matter of keeping the peace, the observance of human rights and the functioning of a civil society."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I have listened with great interest to the speeches that have been made by the honourable Members."
"I do not think it is appropriate for the Commission to react to or interfere with your agenda and your priorities, so I shall not mention yet what the thoughts of our side are."
"It is up to you."
"On the issue of reopening negotiations, it must be quite clear that the interim agreements are the only way to preserve the trade flows after the deadline of 1 January 2008, and they cannot be reopened."
"However, the discussion, and hence the negotiation towards full EPA - regional and with full coverage - is ongoing."
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your answers and comments."
"I would just like to point out that effectively, the JPA is a matter for MPs, but that the Commission plays an important role ,of course, in development policies at European level, and on that basis it is my wish that the Commission should not consider - and I think that Commissioner Michel, in any case, is included here - the work of this Assembly as anecdotal work, that it should not consider this Assembly as a sort of safety valve where the tensions between us are discussed, but rather that it takes into account the opinions expressed there, since for many of our ACP colleagues, this is unfortunately the only forum where they are able to express themselves."
"In this respect, I would like to point out that so far you have observed that there has been no debate in ACP parliaments either on EPAs or Country Strategy Papers."
"Even though we are supporting the people's elected representatives - financing elections left right and centre, trying to export our democratic model - we do not have time to consult these elected parliaments, and some of your colleagues, as Mrs Carlotti said, are adopting a bulldozer approach to everything."
"I hope therefore that the Commission can really take account of this work and recognise how excellent it is."
"People have congratulated me on my report."
"I would like to thank my colleagues, and I would also like to congratulate Mrs Kinnock, who is not here because as Co-President of the Assembly, she is in fact somewhere in the Caribbean."
"I would like to congratulate her on the exceptional work that she does as Co-President of this Joint Assembly."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"A good relationship between the European Union and the ACP countries is very close to my heart and I am therefore delighted that the ACP/EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly continues to take on a more political form and quality."
"In negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreement and very generally in cooperation between the EU and ACP countries, subjects such as sustainable development, human rights, democracy and the creation of functioning constitutional systems must all definitely be on the agenda."
"On no account should we disregard environmental protection and specifically the fight against climate change."
"Even in the regions of the ACP countries, the effects of climate change could turn out to be disastrous."
"The EU must set a good example here and meet the aims and obligations of 2007."
"Only then can we expect this from the ACP countries as well."
"Another subject we definitely have to deal with is water."
"Water shortage and drought are a major problem in the ACP countries, for which solutions have to be found so that there is no environmentally induced migration."
"Competition: Sector inquiry on retail banking - Retail Financial Services in the Single Market (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"by Gianni Pittella, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on Competition: Sector inquiry on retail banking"
";"
"by Othmar Karas, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Green Paper on Retail Financial Services in the Single Market."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to the careful investigative work carried out by the European Commission, we have been able to put the rigidity that is characteristic of retail banking services under the spotlight."
"This investigative work is one to which we have dedicated ourselves, alongside Mr Karas, and so far it has enjoyed a very broad, and in fact nearly unanimous, consensus in the relevant committee."
"I would therefore like to take the opportunity to express my particular thanks to Commissioner Kroes for the way in which she has always been available for debate with Parliament on this delicate matter."
"The relationship between consumers and banks in Europe remains complicated because of the distortions that are a feature of the sector."
"This relationship is, however, of fundamental importance and we ought to put it right by pointing out inadequacies and inefficiencies, identifying the main problems and possible approaches for solving them."
"As my report and the report by Mr Karas state, actions of this type ought above all to be directed towards facilitating consumer mobility, so as to push the banks, indirectly, to operate at higher standards of efficiency."
"That is why, in my report, I ask for it to be made simple and inexpensive for consumers to change banks."
"Changing banks is still, in too many cases across Europe, a slow and difficult operation."
"We are also opposed to any sort of contractual tie that is not clearly necessary, that prevents or hinders customer mobility."
"We recommend that the European banking industry should improve the procedures for closing current accounts, and that only fully justifiable charges should be made, ensuring that this service takes place swiftly and that costs are not duplicated."
"We also call on the Commission to act to ensure that the banks supply information of a better quality that is more easily accessible to consumers, through an information pack set out under cost headings, in a format that enables comparisons to be made easily."
"I myself hold a current account at a bank, and when information packs arrive at my house I throw them away because they are not comprehensible; the same goes for millions of citizens like me."
"This can no longer be accepted."
"Mrs Kroes, Mr McCreevy, if the banks do not make moves in line with these suggestions I call upon the European Commission to put forward a legislative proposal on this point."
"I also ask for an assessment to be made of the feasibility of a European Internet search engine, enabling customers to compare the services offered by different bank sites."
"We need to be able to click on a computer, access the Internet and have an IT platform that enables us to say: here is a better choice for me."
"Today we do not have these options available."
"On the other hand, 'interchange fees' are another matter."
"With regard to the position taken by the European Commission on this debate, I have made a proposal: that once and for all criteria should be given to the operators, by means of some kind of guideline, for establishing the method for calculating interchange fees, in such a way that the proper and transparent operation of the sector can be guaranteed."
"I will end here, so as not to go over my four minutes."
"I hope that with regard to these proposals, that I hope Parliament will adopt tomorrow morning, the Commission will provide an immediate follow-up, that is, at least, speedy and specific."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioners, Mr Pittella, first of all I should like to emphasise once again that the Commission proposals, Members' aims and demands in the two reports and the effects of these reports on Europe's citizens deserved a better time for debate and a bigger audience."
"Secondly, with these reports and the debate with the Commission we are initiating the next stage in strengthening supply and demand in the financial services sector."
"I should like to thank Mr Pittella, Mr Schmidt and Mrs Starkevičiūtfor their effective cooperation."
"The broad majority in committee has shown that we have moved closer together yet have been making further demands."
"What do we want?"
"We want to continue developing the internal market for retail financial services and turn it into a domestic market for all consumers and small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"I say this even though I know that the retail market is and will remain more of a local business than a global business."
"Nevertheless, there is great potential, since only 1% of EU consumers purchase cross-border financial services via distance communication methods, while this figure is at least 26% inland."
"There are - as the reports by the Commission and Parliament state - unjustified obstacles, despite differing responsibilities, which does not mean that in the past nothing would have happened."
"I should like to point out that since 1988, the liberalisation of the movement of capital within Europe has continued."
"The introduction of the euro has brought benefits to the buying public and to the economy: the Financial Services Action Plan, the White Paper on Financial Services Policy 2005-2010 and SEPA, the Single European Payment Area - consumers and suppliers benefit from this political development."
"This is not the end, but we are moving purposefully along the path."
"Both of the Commission's reports - like ours too, perhaps - do of course have their weak points."
"One of these can be found in the Green Paper where it talks almost exclusively of consumers."
"This concerns the internal retail market as well as SMEs."
"Furthermore, consumer protection measures alone are still not able to encourage any suppliers - and we know this - to go beyond the borders."
"When you examine the sectors, the weak point without doubt is the fact that we draw only on a small amount of data."
"We suspect a potential market foreclosure based on prices alone."
"In our report we therefore ask the Commission to carry out a proper impact study, which must also include a component correctly ascertaining the original market conditions and assess the integration and competitiveness of the market and the impact of an initiative not just by means of one indicator but by the largest possible number of measurements."
"We do, however, also support the Commission in its aim only to pursue initiatives that demonstrably offer citizens tangible benefits, are soundly justified by thorough cost-benefit analysis and have been subject to proper impact studies."
"I could now highlight other weak points, but I should also like to limit myself to what we, too, have emphasised specifically in the reports."
"An important message from this Parliament is that we clearly recognise the decentralised sector."
"We need savings banks and cooperatives along with public limited companies."
"We need cross-border local champions, not just global champions."
"They are responsible for local service provision, economic development in the individual regions and security of supply."
"The second point is that we need a balance between supply and demand."
"Thirdly, we need harmonisation of the licensing and registration formalities."
"Insurance companies and banks working across borders are subject to supervision by several financial authorities."
"We should be harmonising here and creating equal entry requirements."
"We should be expanding e-commerce."
"Promoting the remote connection of businesses must drive forward the use of a safe electronic signature and there should be a reform of the Money Laundering Directive wherever it conflicts."
"Further points are addressed: agents and brokers are important for greater competition in the financial services sector."
"We need easier access to the credit data register and credit card registers and we need the block exemption regulation to be extended because we do not think cooperation distorts competition in this area if the conditions are clearly stipulated."
"I am asking the Commission and my fellow Members to examine this report in its entirety and to adopt and support the other considerations - the 44 clarifications and measures in my report."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, it is a real pleasure for me to join you here today to talk about the Commission's review of, and views on, the Pitella report."
"But first let me congratulate both Mr Pitella and Mr Karas on a wonderful job and thank Parliament for its interest in this issue."
"We share many views on this issue, and that is a good starting point."
"Along with my dear colleague Charlie McCreevy and the Internal Market and Services DG, my services and I have put much effort into being students of retail banking and, like you, we are asking ourselves what could be improved."
"It would of course be stupid to say that everything is perfect, so 'What could be better?' is our main line of approach to this issue."
"In our sector inquiry the EUR 1 350 billion a year card-payment-systems market gained much of our attention."
"That is not coffee money - EUR 1 350 billion on a yearly basis."
"We also looked at improving credit registers, helpful and unhelpful cooperation between banks, and bank fees."
"In response specifically to a key point in the Pittella report, I may conclude that we have many points of agreement and one point of difference."
"On customer mobility: the ball is now in the industry's court."
"It needs to develop a code of conduct, and it may face legislation if it does not take this opportunity and this challenge."
"On consumer information and transparency: price comparison and product disclosure information is critical for consumers."
"But industry heavily contests suggestions for change so I fear that there might not be any progress."
"My colleague Commissioner Kuneva is collecting evidence on retail banking fees as part of one of her Consumer Market Scoreboard follow-ups."
"She will certainly be able to assess the diversity and transparency of banking fees and the corresponding level of consumer awareness."
"This fact-gathering is the first step for change."
"On credit registers I have good news."
"The first meeting of the expert group on credit histories is planned in September 2008, which is not long now."
"Experts should present their recommendations to the Commission by 1 May 2009."
"Credit intermediaries, such as mortgage brokers, are a growth industry with many vulnerable customers, so the Commission's study of them will be of great interest."
"The results of that study are expected to be available in October 2008."
"Concerning cooperation between banks, the Competition DG is still doing further fact-finding for our sector inquiry, so it is too early for me to make detailed comments on this matter at this stage."
"SEPA is still new, and competition is needed for it to function fully: I particularly agree with Parliament on this."
"But I am confident it is working as well as we could expect at this point."
"The area where there seems to be disagreement - as mentioned earlier - is the request to the Commission to issue guidelines on Multilateral Interchange Fees (MIFs)."
"I have to be honest with you and say that I am not convinced that creating guidelines would be the right move at this stage and, based on our experience in this matter, I shall try to explain why."
"The call for guidelines and 'clarity' from the Commission - and I understand the question of the rapporteur and his team - is a predictable follow-on from our MasterCard case."
"However, that decision - the MasterCard decision - was based solely on the specific facts of that case."
"With only one case to base such guidelines on, we would risk making bad guidelines that undermine our efforts to help consumers (that is again something we have in common: we - Parliament and the Commission - want to help consumers)."
"One case is not the basis of a magic solution."
"Other reasons guidelines might not work are because there are payment card systems in the EU that operate with a MIF, and others without a MIF."
"Decisions about a card scheme's business model and financing mechanisms should be taken by the schemes themselves."
"Obviously, the Commission cannot prescribe specific business models."
"The assessment of the MIF of a developed system like MasterCard and the assessment of a MIF which new entrants in the market may wish to apply in order to start competing are not necessarily the same."
"At this stage the Commission has only assessed the MIF in systems like Visa and MasterCard."
"In the new framework laid down by Regulation (EC) No 1/2003, it is the responsibility of the parties to assess the legality of their behaviour under EC competition rules."
"A non-confidential version of the MasterCard decision is published on our website, so we are transparent and we are clear."
"The Commission's assessment of the MasterCard MIF can be used by other payment card systems as guidance, even if the assessment in the decision relates to MasterCard's MIF and not to all possible MIFs."
"But there is a suggestion I make to assist the market as this issue develops - that is a gesture from my side."
"My services stand ready to further discuss with market participants and all stakeholders, and indeed they are already in close contact with the payment industry on this matter."
"But allow me conclude in a positive way."
"The Commission very much welcomes Parliament's clear support for the need for measures to improve the level of efficiency and functioning of the retail banking sector, which remains fragmented along national lines."
"I am committed to working with you to address the issue of the MIFs."
"I hope that we can just conclude that the future is ours."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me congratulate the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and in particular Mr Karas and Mr Schmidt, for their excellent work in producing a thorough and consistent report."
"I wholeheartedly welcome your broad support for our strategy on retail financial services, as well as the significant contribution you have made towards deliberations on a wide range of issues."
"It is not possible in the time allotted to provide our views on all of the issues covered in this extensive report."
"I would therefore like to focus on two issues of particular importance in the retail area, our consideration of the framework for retail investment products, and our work on bank account mobility."
"Turning first to retail investment products."
"I am grateful for your support for our ongoing work to ensure that the regulatory framework for the sale of retail investment products delivers a consistently high level of investor protection."
"I am convinced that competition between retail investment products can deliver real benefits for consumers."
"However, we need to be confident that the sale of all investment products is accompanied by a high level of product disclosure and a point-of-sale discipline."
"Only this will ensure that consumers are treated fairly and can take decisions on an informed basis."
"I welcome the clear position you have taken in your report on these issues."
"However, as you well know, I am not one to make decisions without first being fully convinced of the need for change."
"Harmonisation or streamlining of disclosure and distribution rules would be a costly and disruptive process."
"There may be objective reasons why some differentiation is needed between product types or distribution channels."
"For these reasons, I believe it is far too early to conclude that there are deficiencies in existing investor protection regimes which call for new cross-cutting legislation."
"Later this year I will come forward with a communication consolidating the evidence gathered in our research."
"We will identify areas for further work, to examine, and address clearly, evidenced shortcomings in existing regulatory protections."
"Turning now to bank account mobility."
"Creating a competitive and efficient market for bank accounts is a core element in our retail financial services strategy."
"Many consumers regularly face obstacles in trying to switch from one provider to another."
"This situation cannot be allowed to continue and we are therefore pleased to receive your support on this point."
"I welcome your call for the financial services industry to work towards the aims of the Green Paper by self-regulation and thus reduce the need for binding legal acts."
"This reflects our commitment reiterated in the single market review to use, where appropriate or where they can deliver the desired outcome, self-regulatory measures rather than resort to legislation."
"In this context, in November last year we invited the European banking industry to develop a European Code of Conduct by mid-2008."
"This code should contain a fully-fledged domestic switching service which should be made available to customers when they switch bank."
"The banking industry does not need to start from scratch."
"Rather, they should draw on existing best practices in some Member States."
"Finally, delivery of a high quality code of conduct by the banking industry will be decisive in proving the merits of self-regulation."
"Let me be clear today."
"Should the code fail to meet the Commission's expectations, alternatives, such as a legislative proposal, would have to be considered."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (CS) Mr President, I welcome the report by my colleague Mr Karas, which deals with a very important subject, namely easy access to banking services for all citizens and businesses in the European Union."
"This will help to open up, or rather complete, our internal market."
"However, I would like to draw your attention to the very serious problem of high banking fees in many Member States."
"In some of these countries - and my own country, the Czech Republic, is one of the biggest culprits - these banking fees can be ridiculously high."
"This really calls for foreign competition."
"Only Poland fares worse than the Czech Republic."
"On the other hand, banking is cheaper in the Netherlands or in Austria, for example."
"The instruments that can rapidly change this situation (and this also relates to the incredibly high fees for issuing credit cards) are in the hands of the Commission and Parliament."
"The elimination of obstacles to cross-border electronic banking would improve the situation for consumers and business customers, who would benefit from sound economic competition."
"Apart from the need to reduce banking fees and make them more transparent, it will also be necessary to concentrate on enhancing the quality of banking services and improving the financial knowledge of consumers as well as small and medium-sized businesses."
"Last but not least, the European Union will have to pay attention to the regulation of the so-called microcredit, which can give a significant boost to electronic (through not only electronic) trading."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is in our hands."
"Mr President, Commissioner Kroes, Commissioner McCreevy, ladies and gentlemen, retail banking plays an essential role in the daily lives of families and of the vast majority of European businesses."
"It is of great economic importance, generates around 2% of the Community GDP, provides more than 3 million jobs and constitutes the largest banking sector, with gross revenue of more than 50% of the EU total."
"In order to grasp its importance we can consider that one of its characteristic services, mortgages, constitutes the main financial risk taken on by European citizens, with outstanding balances of around 50% of the EU GDP, and that the volume of investment funds in the Member States is between 4 and 24% of domestic economies."
"Despite the progress in the regulation of the sector and the improvements brought about by the introduction of the euro, the integration of the Community financial services markets and the promotion of competition in the sector do not appear to have achieved their full potential."
"Only 1% of consumers in the European Union purchase cross-border financial services; there are considerable variations in prices between entities; the opportunities for choice are limited; there are still structural barriers that make it difficult to provide services and for those services to operate properly between different countries."
"The levels of profitability of retail banking vary widely, and establishments in the Nordic countries, Spain and Ireland are above average."
"All of these issues are tackled in the reports in a reasonably balanced way."
"I congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Pittella and Mr Karas, and I would like to express my satisfaction at the ultimate inclusion of aspects such as the recognition of the role of retail banking in properly passing on monetary policy conditions to the market, the value that the plurality and diversity of models for trade with banks, cooperatives and savings banks brings to European retail banking, the existence of an environment of cooperation promoting competition between independent entities, the need for an appropriate framework for financial intermediaries and more comparability between financial products."
"Improving the functioning of this banking sector will provide more efficiency, will help to develop the potential inherent in all the European regions and will facilitate access to financial services, along with greater compliance with the coverage terms for our citizens."
"The main point of today's debate is the question of what is to be done to ensure that EU citizens are able to make full use of the advantages offered by the single market in the financial sector, the latter being exceedingly fragmented."
"How can we tackle this problem?"
"There are three possible ways."
"Firstly, by encouraging consumer mobility."
"How can this be achieved?"
"Firstly, information on all available products should be standardised and transparency in relation to the cost of these retail financial products ensured, thus enabling the consumer to choose by employing certain methods - perhaps, as Mr Pittella suggested, an Internet search engine."
"We are not prepared to agree on the necessity of standardising all the products, as they should reflect social and cultural differences in the various countries."
"Therefore, standardisation should be clearly defined."
"In addition, we would enable consumers to open accounts in other countries."
"Now we have the Schengen area, which allows everyone to move from country to country without any problems, data registering is no longer an issue."
"However, banks have a problem with opening accounts for citizens of other countries."
"I believe this is unacceptable in the age of modern technology."
"I do not think these problems could be resolved simply through self-coordination, given the number of retail banks and the difficulties they encounter in coordinating their activities."
"Can the Commission suggest any initiative in this direction?"
"Another way would be to encourage the mobility of suppliers, enabling them to render their services via the Internet or by means of text messages."
"At any rate, financial governance must be sorted out beforehand, clearly defining who is responsible for what in case something goes wrong."
"I would like to finish by saying to Commissioner Kroes that we expect transparency from the Commission."
"As regards payment card costs, new costs are currently being introduced, preceding your suggestion."
"Consumers in the shops might not even be aware of increased costs, as the banks are in the process of adapting to new requirements."
"Perhaps information on payment card costs should be publicised on a wider scale and more often, enabling consumers to compare them and be more empowered in dealing with the banks."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is certainly a will within Parliament to harmonise the European banking world."
"I think, however, that families and small and medium-sized enterprises are particularly concerned, especially in my country, Italy, about certain practices which at the moment are undergoing tough and comprehensive scrutiny by the public."
"I am talking, for example, about maximum overdraft fees and compound interest, which is interest on interest."
"These are practices which have entered into conflict with the constitutional court and the court of cassation."
"I do not understand, therefore, how people can talk of fee transparency or of clarity in the way in which fees are paid, when in a country such as Italy there are still such serious conflicts between banks and legal authorities."
"The same goes for the flexibility of loans."
"At the moment there is particular concern about the fact that thousands or hundreds of thousands of families are facing serious problems regarding loan flexibility."
"I therefore think that Parliament ought above all to place the national banking world in line concerning fairer criteria."
"(DE) Mr President, both the Karas report and the Pittella report demonstrate that there is still a great deal to do for consumers in the sector of retail financial services such as bank accounts, loans and insurance."
"Banks, whose market volumes are influenced by retail business by up to 50%, are no longer interested in customer mobility and unfortunately only to a limited extent in transparent benchmarking."
"Even this essentially good, but often wrongly interpreted relationship of trust between banks and their customers has less of a link and contributes less to customer mobility and the promotion of competition."
"Competition can itself therefore be adjusted primarily by enlightened and well-informed customers."
"In the end we have also included an EU budget line on financial market expertise in consumer and SME organisations. I simply wish to remind you of this."
"In addition, consumer protection levels should not be impaired by the dismantling of barriers."
"Moreover, the demand for collective legal aid in cross-border lawsuits relating to financial products agreed in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is the appropriate endorsement for fair market conditions."
"In general, however, new financial products have to be introduced objectively and correctly."
"The Commission is being asked to anchor regulatory requirements with regard to information, marketing and the organisation of comparable products for private customers in all the legal provisions of the financial market."
"The principles of the MiFID Directive on best advice should also be made to apply particularly, for example, to unit-linked life insurance and other long-term savings products."
"Helping the consumer, the customer, and thereby creating a flourishing market must be the principle by which we act."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to express my thanks to Mr Pitella and Mr Karas for their reports."
"I share their conclusion permeating the entire report that every citizen in the European Union should have access to banking services."
"Nevertheless, please allow me three comments."
"Firstly, with regard to customer mobility, yes, it is our aim in a growing, fully functioning internal market to make sure that every customer also has cross-border access to banking services."
"However, responsibilities are also bound up with this right."
"I am therefore somewhat cautious when the demand is made here that in the event that a customer informs his bank that he wishes to switch to another we leave the risk, if he does not have his new bank account details in time, with the present bank."
"This is not right!"
"Customers should assume responsibility for their own actions and must also assume this responsibility personally with the rights they have assumed."
"We should not be toying with those who bail customers out whenever they are to blame for ending up in this dilemma."
"Secondly, customer information."
"I can but agree here with the previous speaker, Mr Ettl."
"We still have to do this many times over in the case of comparable products in competition with each that do not have the same transparency because they are subject to different obligations to provide information."
"This is not right!"
"I am very much in favour of customers obtaining information but it is also true here that we should not be throwing the baby out with the bath water and not inundating customers with too much information."
"Customers need the necessary information to make responsible decisions themselves, but quality takes priority over quantity here."
"Finally, back to the banking structures."
"I agree with Mr Karas that we do in fact have different, historically developed banking structures in the individual Member States."
"In one country there are only private banks, in others there are also savings banks, credit unions, state banks and more of the same."
"It is not our job to reorganise the banking community."
"The Member States should be doing this - if they are not already doing so."
"Nor is it our job, however, to be carrying on traditions."
"I think the market should decide whether the structures remain as they are or whether they should be changed."
"Services, product ranges, services that individual market operators offer their customers - they should decide; we should not be making decisions centrally."
"Mr President, I just wish to comment briefly on some of the debate."
"The issue about educating the consumer is very important."
"We need consumers to understand financial services, and we need in particular to target young people who use credit cards like they were going out of fashion."
"But let me just say that those of us who thought they were educated have been prone to the odd financial accident."
"I mean, hands up those of us who fell for endowment mortgages?"
"I should put both hands up in that regard."
"Therefore, even with education and knowledge, mistakes are made and wrong products are sold to the consumer."
"I am not sure how long the Commission is going to test out the codes of conduct before it legislates."
"I am not a fan of legislation where none is required, but sometimes we need better legislation that is effective from a consumer point of view."
"We have a credit crunch now and, where in the Irish banking system they were handing out money and 100% mortgages were the norm, we now have quite the opposite with the curtailment of finance."
"This is an issue that affects all of us and I hope that this debate contributes to better financial services for the European consumer."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I should like to thank the honourable Members once again for their work on this issue."
"The point has been made that we need transparency and a clear overview of what is entailed for the consumer."
"Quality is more important than quantity, but sometimes you need a bit of quantity to get the quality."
"The Commission very much welcomes your clear support for the need for measures."
"We are aware that we have to improve the level of efficiency, and that we have to improve the functioning of the retail banking sector, which remains fragmented along national lines."
"That is not in line with the single market that we all believe in."
"Therefore, the retail banking sector - which is an open door - is of key importance to all of us, to all the consumers and to the economy as a whole."
"Parliament's report reflects the importance which you too attach to this area."
"Mrs Roithová talked about the situation in her country but mentioned that it was not only in her country that the high fees are often the result of a fragmented market with only a few players."
"The situation we found in the sector inquiry report, which I have already touched upon, is quite clear."
"We think, and we expect, that the introduction of SEPA will provide an answer to many of the problems, because it will facilitate cross-border competition, and that is what is needed."
"It is a pro-market approach and it should work."
"We are, therefore, very much behind this initiative and are working with the industry to help SEPA reach its goals."
"Mr Sánchez Presedo rightly said that promoting competition is key to this whole approach, because if there is no competition then we are all aware that the banks are trying to pull our legs."
"On the actual cost of payment cards, which Mrs Starkevičiūtasked about, we share the honourable Member's wish for more transparency in the market."
"Pro-competition means that we should be aware of what is going on in the market, and the fact that it was not clear why consumers benefited from this was one of the reasons for prohibiting MasterCard's interchange fees - that was clear-cut."
"Our aim is to see fees which have clear and verifiable benefits to consumers."
"Mr Klinz rightly talked about rights, and these are always combined with responsibilities: not only of the customers but also of all of us - the banks and all the players in the game."
"We need more transparency, we need to be clear what we are picking out."
"The changes to the market are hopefully leading in that direction."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, as I remarked earlier, the reports are excellent pieces of work."
"They are thorough and consistent and will provide a significant contribution to our ongoing work on retail and financial services."
"I appreciate that some people might wish us to move faster on some of the initiatives, but speed does not always equate to equality."
"We are committed to our better regulation principles, including thorough impact assessments."
"Some of our initiatives, such as bank accounts, have been underway for several years and should bear fruit this year."
"Others, such as our work on retail investment projects, are a little newer and will require more research before we can reach any firm conclusions."
"Mrs Roithová referred to bank changes and my colleague Neelie Kroes has dealt with that issue."
"I would just like to point out that we cannot regulate charges as such, but what we really need is real competition and the ability of consumers to easily switch from providers with which they are dissatisfied. Of course we want to make it easier for them to switch and to have a variety of players in the marketplace."
"That in itself will bring down prices."
"Mrs Margarita Starkevičiūtraised a number of issues."
"I have noted all her suggestions and we will act on them as far as possible."
"Mr Ettl spoke about the retail banks."
"The Green Paper that we published precisely addresses some of these real concerns."
"I usually agree with my friend Mr Wolf Klinz but, unless I misunderstood, I detected that he was not so anxious about the switching of bank accounts."
"What we are trying to do is allow consumers to switch bank accounts easily within Member States."
"I would just point out that it not rocket science."
"Other Member States have embarked upon codes of conduct and have done it quite easily."
"We have given the banking industry an opportunity to self-regulate in this particular area."
"I have met some of them."
"Some come up with all kinds of wonderful and wondrous excuses about why it cannot be done, but I can assure them that it is not astrophysics that we are dealing with."
"It is quite simple to operate and is an opportunity for them to prove that self-regulation is the better way."
"But, as I said in my earlier remarks, if we do not do this, there are other alternatives available to us."
"However, I do agree with Mr Klinz's second point about the bank structures in various Member States."
"These are entirely for each Member State to organise, and there are different banking structures in all of the Member States."
"A Member State itself can organise its structures in any way it wishes, but if it enters into the free market area, it must abide by the rules of the Treaty, and this could sometimes lead to conflict."
"However, the organisation of the banking structure in a Member State is solely a matter for the Member State concerned."
"I agree with Mrs McGuinness regarding the operation of codes of conduct."
"She referred to the great phase of endowment mortgages."
"I was a little reluctant ever to go down that road myself and resisted it for years, but at one time, with another person, I allowed myself to avail of one of those."
"I was one of the lucky ones."
"I turned out at the end of the period of time with a profit, which was a surprise to me and to everybody else, given my earlier reluctance in that area."
"However, I do not think that anybody could be blamed for the way endowment mortgages went."
"It was the fashion of the time."
"Everybody believed in doing it this particular way, and there was a fair amount of aggressive selling."
"But I think that, as long as the consumer is aware of many of the pitfalls, that is what codes of conduct or any type of consumer protection should do."
"I always say to people in business, whether they be in big or small businesses - and we should be aware as consumers - if a thing looks too good, it is too good."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would quickly like to thank all the Members who have spoken, and thanks once again to the Commissioners and to Mr Karas."
"I would like to say a swift word on interchange fees."
"My proposal for guidelines is based on the conviction - and of course here we may disagree, Mrs Kroes - that the interchange fee is useful for the development and the efficiency of the payment instrument."
"Also, in the absence of interchange fees there is a risk that the costs would be borne by consumers."
"Moving on to the issue of what is the best approach on the regulation of financial markets, I believe - and I have often said so to Commissioner McCreevy - that under-regulated and poorly regulated financial markets and the frequently ineffectual self-regulation carried out by the banking industry are elements whose negatives effects have been clearly demonstrated by the current financial crisis."
"I therefore believe that it would be wrong to think that the proper integration of the retail financial sector can be completed solely by means of self-regulation by the industry."
"The retail products financial market will only be able to call itself properly integrated once that degree of full harmonisation that the consumer protection rules aim to bring about has been achieved and guaranteed."
"This can best be done through a legislative initiative by the Commission."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to reiterate the thanks I expressed at the outset to all those involved, and to ask the Commission to include Parliament's proposals in full in its legislative deliberations."
"The second point is a tip. I should like to point out to my fellow Members that the report on consumer education - we have spoken a great deal about this today - in the financial services sector is being debated in the House and will be discussed in plenary in the autumn."
"Another point is that we should not forget that the different tax systems of the Member States are a major obstacle to the provision of cross-border financial services and that this also creates low interoperability, particularly where financial products are promoted for tax purposes."
"I also wish to appeal to the industry and the banks to carry out self-regulation in order to do the preliminary work for the objective of this Green Paper."
"On the issue of standardisation and product diversity, we also have to say yes to standardisation as long as it does not jeopardise product diversity."
"As regards bank charges, which Mrs Roithová has addressed, the Commission has already referred to SEPA."
"However, we also have many other obstacles, namely the obstacle that rights earned in one country often cannot be transferred to another country and the obstacle that an account can be opened if the domicile is given."
"Then there is the missing definition of e-commerce: cross-border money transfers are working, but there are barriers when opening an account and to other rights, which we must remove."
"We have enough work to do to get proposals onto the table."
"We should be seeing results and continuing to work consistently."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (SK) A well-functioning integrated financial market is a necessary precondition for the realisation of the Lisbon agenda."
"Banks play an essential role in passing on monetary policy conditions, particularly to small and medium-sized enterprises and consumers."
"Although many clients would be interested in using cross-border financial services, opening an account in a Member State bank is accompanied by so much bureaucracy that clients often get discouraged."
"The European banking industry should improve and simplify its account closing procedures."
"Statements of account are still very complicated and many consumers do not understand them."
"The complexity of financial products makes it difficult for consumers to make informed decisions."
"Consumers are also burdened with disproportionately high banking fees for services and for the issue of credit cards."
"I think that rather than regulating banking fees, the EU should ensure that the banking sector is competitive."
"Informed consumers are an essential component of economic competition among banks."
"I believe that consumer organisations play an important role because they are able to define which information they deem to be necessary to enable consumers to make appropriate choices when it comes to banking products."
"They can coordinate financial education programmes aimed at increasing the awareness of consumers as regards their money management options."
"They also help very vulnerable consumers."
"I believe that the time will come in the EU when consumer organisations will not be fighting for their survival."
"Once they become responsible for consumer policy, they will understand how important finances are."
"in writing. - The Commission offers three strategies in the Green Paper on retail financial services to promote integration of the retail markets in financial services - lower prices and more choice, empowering consumers and enhancing consumer protection."
"Firstly, I would like to focus on consumer empowerment and I would like to highlight the need to raise the level of financial literacy."
"At the recent consumer financial education hearing we saw a number of practical examples of consumer financial education programmes."
"Further efforts could be made to share best practices in this area across the Member States, bearing in mind the new Member States in particular."
"Regarding consumer choice, it is clear that consumers who wish to change financial services providers must be able to do so with a minimum of costs and legal barriers."
"As regards information given to the consumer, it is not enough to provide consumers with as much information as possible."
"Overloading the consumer with information will have the opposite effect."
"Nonetheless, sufficient information which helps the consumer to make informed choices has to be provided."
"Pursuant to the Pittella report, the sector audit analysed the competition situation regarding payment systems, including card systems, credit offices, cooperation between banks and price and bank settlement policies."
"The audit shows that there are significant differences between the commission paid for bank cards."
"Thus, it was detected that the majority of national debit cards networks settle inter-bank commissions on a significantly lower level than the international networks, and that, in most of the Member States, the majority of banks permit the grant of mortgage credits, of personal credits and of loans to SMEs with the opening of a current account."
"Usually, the client does not have the same negotiation power when initiating the contractual relation with the bank where he becomes a client."
"The client signs a contract that he does not always read and even if he does, he would like to suggest changes, which is not possible."
"From this viewpoint, I consider that the competent regulation authorities should supervise the form of the contracts offered by the banks so as to protect the interests of both the clients and the bank."
"I consider that it is compulsory that a client who opens an account to previously receive a brief presentation of the applicable costs for the entire period of its utilization."
"Community system against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Marie-Hélène Aubert, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing - C6-0454/2007 -."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all allow me to thank the rapporteur for her work on this report."
"I am pleased to note the strong support of the Committee on Fisheries on this important proposal to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing."
"As you know, IUU fishing constitutes a major threat to the sustainability of fish stocks and marine biodiversity, which undermines the very essence of the Common Fisheries Policy."
"I do not believe that it is necessary to expand any further on the disastrous global environmental and economic consequences of IUU fishing, as you are well aware of that."
"However, it is important to bear in mind that IUU fishing is a worldwide phenomenon, affecting in particular developing countries."
"This is why the proposal is a non-discriminatory instrument, applying to all Community trade of fishery products deriving from IUU fishing, in all waters, and to all Community nationals engaging in or supporting IUU fishing activities conducted under any flag."
"International cooperation is the key to the efficient elimination of IUU fishing."
"This is why the Commission has already commenced bilateral contacts with third countries."
"The Commission has also defined a working programme, in close cooperation with the Development DG and EuropeAid, to support developing countries, in order to assist them with a smooth and successful implementation of the regulation, in particular with regard to the catch certification scheme."
"This working programme includes seminars and workshops in a large number of third countries."
"The Commission can agree with nearly all amendments proposed, which are either covered by the proposal or which are incorporated in the Presidency compromise text."
"I am extremely happy that the report supports, in particular, the implementation of the regulation to all vessels, its catch certification scheme and the harmonisation of sanctions."
"The inclusion of Community vessels is an important feature which will ensure non-discrimination and consistency with WTO rules."
"It is also important that the Community demonstrates its seriousness in fighting IUU fishing activities, by including all vessels infringing conservation and management rules."
"The catch certification scheme is the instrument which will ensure the control of traceability of fishery products."
"Inspired by current practices in Regional Fisheries Management Organisations and customs regulations, it must apply to all fishery products, including processed products, in order to be efficient."
"Aquaculture products and products with marginal Community trade will, however, be excluded from its scope."
"We can do this during final negotiations in Council."
"Harmonised sanctions will strengthen the ability of Member States to take measures to prevent IUU activities and to ensure that any economic advantage will be more than offset by the fines imposed."
"The Commission strongly believes that a system of dissuasive, proportionate and harmonised sanctions and accompanying measures is the key to compliance with the regulation."
"I would once again like to thank Mrs Aubert for the report and the committee for its attention on this very important issue."
"This report is a significant contribution to a truly efficient fight against IUU fishing."
"Madam President, the events unfolding this very day in Brussels show us to what extent the future of European fisheries is under threat if the European Union is incapable of implementing the sustainable management of fish stocks and root-and-branch reform of its existing policies."
"The fight against IUU fishing is a major element of this more demanding and coherent policy."
"However, the globalisation of trade, the free movement of capital, and advances in transport and communication have all led to a significant increase in illegal fishing over recent years."
"Today the situation is no longer tenable. European fishermen, like all stakeholders, including NGOs, are unanimously calling for this phenomenon - which hastens the destruction of resources and results in unfair competition for those who play by the rules - to be tackled more effectively."
"However, that is not to say that Member States have not been able to monitor and sanction illegal practices, as they should have done."
"In this respect, the report of the Court of Auditors published a few months ago is damning."
"This is why the European Commission's ambitious proposal announced last October was particularly well received by the Committee on Fisheries, which had already adopted, by an overwhelming majority, an own-initiative report on the EU's February 2007 action plan to combat IUU fishing."
"In fact, we are delighted that the Commission's legislative proposal incorporates most of our recommendations."
"These include the publication of an IUU vessels list; reinforced port state controls; compulsory catch certificates for the flag state and therefore the refusal to import fisheries products obtained from IUU fishing into the EU; reinforced and harmonised sanctions, and a Community alert system. Therefore, there is not much missing from the Commission's proposal."
"However, as you know, three points have been the subject of a heated debate within the Council, particularly concerning the scope of the regulation."
"For my part, I am delighted that we have finally managed to secure the scope that you have proposed, which extends to both Community and third-country vessels."
"The catch certificate has also been considered too cumbersome or complex, and the level and nature of the sanctions have also been fiercely debated."
"These issues were also raised within our committee."
"However, our amendments have, I think, finally helped to clarify the text while preserving the ambition and major goals of the new regulation."
"The report was adopted by unanimous vote and I would like to thank my colleagues for their support, which helped to secure this outcome."
"With a sector in crisis, the European Parliament wants to send out a very strong signal today, aimed particularly at the Council, which has been too slow to shoulder its responsibilities in this area."
"Commissioner, the fight against IUU fishing is still only part of the wider policy including the Control Regulation and that of serious offences."
"This divide has not helped to clarify the proceedings, to say the least."
"We are still waiting for clarification from you on how these three new regulations are to be structured."
"Similarly, concerns over the complexity of the catch certificate are just an excuse to dilute or postpone the text."
"We need universally comprehensible procedures which can be operated by a sufficient number of reliable, efficient and competent staff, and are accessible to developing countries, who in any case are the main victims of IUU fishing."
"On this too we expect clarification and a commitment from you."
"Finally, we are counting, Commissioner, on your resolve - which we know is considerable - to put a swift end to illegal fishing, which affects bluefin tuna and cod most of all, highly prized species which are heavily overfished at present."
"This at least would give a concrete response to the serious problems currently faced by the fishing industry."
"There is still a great deal of work to be done, as you know, to ensure a sustainable future for European fisheries."
"However, an important step will be taken in the coming weeks, and I am as pleased about this as you are."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is taking place during the most serious crisis in the Community fisheries sector that we have ever known."
"There are various reasons why costs are not being covered in the sector and why it is currently not profitable to go out fishing."
"Fish imports and the entry of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing into the European Union are among those reasons."
"We therefore support the proposal and the report, but they are not sufficient."
"I would like to take this opportunity to speak out in the European Parliament to ask the Commission and the Council to do something urgently, and not to allow this sector to die, as if it continues as it is now, it is going to collapse."
"I ask the Commissioner and the Council to prepare and adopt a joint urgent emergency plan that also includes medium and long-term measures."
"France is leading this battle, and the imminent French Presidency is a golden opportunity to make it happen."
"The Commission needs to exercise its right of initiative more actively - with aid, compensation, restructuring, innovations - in order to mitigate the costs that the sector is suffering from and curb unfair competition in imports."
"Time is running out."
"We wanted the Committee on International Trade to be part of this debate, because there is little point in banning IUU fishing if the European Union then opens its markets to it."
"Is it too much to ask for only legal fish to be sold in the European Union?"
"We need more controls, more traceability and more and better labelling, in short more guarantees of what is entering the European Union."
"This needs to be done not only by the European Union but globally, through multilateral and bilateral channels."
"Partnership agreements should also be a tool for achieving this, with the corresponding technical assistance and training, in order to create not new barriers to trade, but rather measures that are effective for all the parties involved."
"On this rests the future of a whole economic sector, which in the European Union is very concentrated in regions that are highly dependent on it, and therefore it has huge social repercussions."
"On this also rests the sustainability of fisheries resources, which are a prime source of healthy food, at a time when there is a food crisis."
"Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, let me thank Mrs Aubert for her report."
"Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is one of the main problems in the sector, for, most importantly, it greatly damages the environment, and this is a major problem for the planet."
"It distorts competition. Those who carry out illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing are in a more advantageous position than legal fishing operators, whom it is our duty to protect."
"Unreported fishing means a loss of revenue for the state."
"One of the measures set out in the proposal for a regulation that we are voting on is the creation of a scheme of port state control that would prohibit access by third country vessels involved in illegal fishing activities."
"The proposal provides for a ban on the importation of fish from illegal fishing; the creation of a list of vessels that are involved in illegal and unreported fishing; the development of a Community Alert System when there is a suspicion that fish from illegal fishing have been detected; and a prohibition on importing fish from countries that have been identified as not cooperating with the EU scheme."
"There are some controversial points in the regulation, such as its scope of application."
"Some Member States are calling for it to be limited to the fisheries responsibilities of Community vessels outside Community waters, since there are already plenty of provisions to control fishing within Community waters."
"In addition, the revision of the basic regulation on the control of fishing is expected by the end of 2008."
"I believe that there will be duplication between the two regulations and that they will not facilitate the process of simplifying the common fisheries policy."
"In conclusion, let me say that this is indeed a serious subject and we should treat it as such."
"We must tackle it with discipline and determination, and always in cooperation with the fishermen, whose opinions and cooperation we crave."
"In any event, we support Mrs Aubert's report and thank her for her work."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Aubert report on illegal fishing was unanimously adopted in the Committee on Fisheries, as the rapporteur, whom I congratulate, has already mentioned."
"This alone probably sheds more light on the subject than anything I can say at this juncture."
"However, one can never repeat enough that illegal fishing is a crime against nature and against the economy, one that unfortunately often goes unpunished and against which we have to act with determination and courage."
"I therefore would like to thank Commissioner Borg and the Commission for the timely way in which they reacted to the concerns voiced by Parliament in February 2007, putting forward a proposal for a regulation that exceeded all expectations and that rightly deserves our applause."
"Nevertheless, however improved the regulatory framework may be, without the Member States' commitment and sufficient human resources and materials being made available, success will not come easily in a battle where progress is hampered by extremely difficult conditions."
"This is why we need to get the Member States on board too."
"In any event, with this report and the subsequent regulation, the European Union is taking a very important step and sets an example that ennobles us and fills us with pride."
"I am sure that the Commission will continue to welcome Parliament's contributions with a view to improving its proposal still further."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I apologise if I am now breaking with protocol, but I cannot pass up this opportunity to make a passionate plea."
"The fisheries sector is going through very difficult times due to fuel price increases."
"Everyone is suffering at the moment, but the most vulnerable especially so."
"I know that several Member States, including my own country, Portugal, intend to ask you, or have already done so, for your support to find solutions within the European framework, namely by using the European Fisheries Fund flexibly to adopt measures that may attenuate the social effects of the current crisis."
"I know that it is not needed, but let me appeal for your solidarity and the spirit of openness that you have always shown towards the sector's problems, to help find a satisfactory solution as quickly as possible."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, the ALDE Group wishes to express its full support for Mrs Aubert's excellent report."
"The amendments it proposes clarify and, in some cases, develop various aspects of the Commission's proposal, including some useful additions on force majeure subsidies and sanctions."
"The emphasis placed on the need for non-discrimination in application of the regulation too is particularly welcome, for there is no doubt that IUU fishing is something that needs to be tackled on a global basis and the EU measures are an important step in that direction."
"Last week I was fortunate to be on a delegation from the Committee on Fisheries to Norway."
"We were told that in the last three years, and particularly since the introduction of a port state control scheme for the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission in May 2007, there has been a huge reduction in IUU fishing in the area."
"That scheme covers all EU Member States, as well as Norway, Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Russia."
"Indeed, Norway's Minister for Fisheries and Coastal Affairs spoke highly of the EU's cooperation in this regard."
"But there is agreement too that localised measures can have the effect of displacing the problem rather than resolving it."
"That is why it is especially good to see Amendments 5, 6 and 54, which seek to do more to minimise any negative impacts on developing countries."
"I would add, too, that I believe we have a special responsibility to assist in the improvement of inspection and control systems in developing countries and to do so not only in the cases of those countries with which we have fisheries partnership agreements."
"Further, I hope that the Commission, Parliament and the Council alike will be active in promoting the adoption of a binding convention on port state control at United Nations level."
"Preparation has already begun in the FAO and, with the right will, could be adopted in March 2009."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I should like to thank my group colleague, Marie-Hélène Aubert for the amount of work she has put in successfully to this report."
"It is obviously in the interests of all fishing nations and fishing communities to eliminate illegal fisheries."
"After all, it is the fishing communities themselves who will benefit from the successful conservation of the resource."
"International cooperation is essential in successfully eliminating illegal fishing by the pirates and organised criminals worldwide who operate in the field."
"Within the common fisheries policy too much attention has been paid to the recent report of the Court of Auditors on control and enforcement."
"That report was based on data supposedly gathered from the six most important fishing Member States."
"However, that data that the Member States listed included the UK (England and Wales)."
"Scotland has some 70% of the UK's fisheries and was not included in that data."
"I would just like to make the point that there are distinct and separate quota and management and enforcement organisations within Scotland."
"We have made some progress in my fishing nation too in recent years on improving controls."
"We have the registration of buyers and sellers and we have designated ports of landing."
"Good enforcement is, of course, important, but equally important is a sensible management regime which provides incentives to conserve by guaranteeing that Scotland's fishermen, for example, are guaranteed to benefit in the long term from the conservation measures that they have to apply from time to time."
"The CFP has simply not provided that kind of guarantee."
"I was glad to hear you, Commissioner Borg, say recently that you favour root-and-branch reform of the CFP. I agree."
"I say: let us return day-to-day management and control of the resource to the fishing nations themselves, who have fishing entitlements in logical fishing areas such as the North Sea, and let us abandon the unworkable notion that we can have equal access to waters and resources."
"Notwithstanding some aspects on which we have reservations, we welcome the initiative to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and we agree with the general thrust of the report."
"Among other points, we stress the importance of the rules outlined in this initiative being applied to all vessels, whether from EU countries or from third countries."
"However, we would like to point out that making these proposals tally with a review of Community rules on control in the future must safeguard the competences of the Member States, namely in terms of procedures and carrying out inspections."
"Furthermore, we also believe that the whole gamut of questions regarding sanctions falls within the competence of each Member State."
"Lastly, I should just like to emphasise that if the Commission could be as quick to respond to the sector's just claims as it has been with this initiative, then the sector would not be faced with the constant worsening of its socio-economic situation."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Madam President, the Regulation being discussed today is both wide-ranging and complex, and I just want to emphasise a few points."
"Firstly, the proposal that fishermen caught fishing illegally should repay the subsidies they have received from the EU is a very good one."
"We cannot allow a situation in which taxpayers are forced to subsidise criminal activity."
"On the other hand, illegal fishing is carried on by all types of boats."
"The proposal should therefore cover all vessels, both EU vessels and third-country vessels."
"Secondly, the proposed catch certificate is positive."
"The certification process has a key role to play in combating illegal fishing."
"However, I have more misgivings about common maximum fines."
"The Member States should be allowed to act on their own responsibility by imposing deterrent charges."
"Finally, I think that the common European fisheries policy has proved to be a failure and must be reformed."
"In order really to combat illegal fishing we need to cooperate internationally, both with regional fishing organisations and with other international bodies."
"Madam President, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is indeed something to be stamped out."
"There is much, therefore, in this report with which I agree, but I do have to reject its attack on subsidiarity by demanding that the EU should be setting the criminal sanctions and the establishment of an EU core of inspectors."
"Likewise, I oppose the unnecessary additional bureaucracy of applying the regulation to EU-flagged vessels, because these are already subject to the stiff provisions of the common fisheries policy."
"We do not need more regulation on our own fishermen to deal with third countries which continue with their rogue activities."
"Having seen in recent months some punitive fines on local fishermen in the United Kingdom, I for one reject the suggestion that we need more and stiffer regulations and penalties on our own fleets."
"(ES) Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Aubert for her report."
"I think that it clearly expresses Parliament's political will to support whatever actions are necessary to eradicate illegal fishing in all contexts, and, starting with the context that affects us, to close the Community to imports of and trade in illegal fisheries products."
"We cannot, however, get around the responsibility that falls to the port State and the Commission itself under this proposal."
"We are talking about a regulation that is very ambitious in its wording, which will compel the Member States to be extremely vigilant and not to spare any material or human resources - one of the weak points of the whole control policy - to turn words into deeds."
"Unfortunately, this means once again that we need to bring other political wills into play in addition to our own."
"The damage that illegal fishing causes, not only to biological resources, but also to legal fishermen, has been considerable every day for years."
"Currently a large proportion of the sector is in a state of revolt in response to another massive drop in profitability, one of the most serious causes of which is of course the rise in diesel prices."
"There are, however, other factors that are adding to the losses, and among these the mass entry of imports at low prices and of dubious origin across our borders is, under these circumstances, especially scandalous."
"By way of example: in the last five months of this year alone, in Spain the price of diesel has risen by 38%, while the price of swordfish, which is an imported species par excellence, has dropped by 40%."
"There is no business in any sector that can survive this type of economic context, but nevertheless it is a proven fact that, when there has been the political will to monitor imports closely, as has occurred in the past - and I can bear witness to this - the prices paid to Community producers have immediately recovered."
"Commissioner, I therefore ask you and the Member States to be firm in implementing this regulation with the utmost possible urgency."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate her on her first-rate work in this report."
"As the European Union, we must finally realise that the more we allow this uncontrolled situation to develop, the more we are mortgaging the future of marine fishing and the global marine ecosystem."
"The EU should move forward immediately, acting not only as a union of regulations that are bureaucratic, complex and often not even implemented by its Member States, but should take a global initiative without being afraid of the major interests at stake or succumbing to international or other pressures."
"Thus the entire global community involved in fishing will be able to understand, accept and finally agree on the minimisation of illegal and unreported fishing."
"A prerequisite for such an initiative will, of course, be a globally accepted agreement on the maintenance of fisheries."
"I too should like to express my concern along with all my fellow MEPs on the major crisis being experienced by European fishermen."
"Commissioner, we must immediately examine these issues and deal with the problems."
"(PL) Madam President, the Council regulation is an interesting example of preventive legislation, of a regulation directed against illegal catches, a practice that threatens the maintenance of a sustainable level of fish stocks."
"The clarity of the proposed solutions is the main reason why this particular document has a chance of being effective - a precise definition of the legislator's intentions."
"The rapporteur has excellently grasped the specific nature of the regulation, providing unusually helpful interpretations that simply make it easier to decipher the most important provisions."
"Governments of countries of the southern and eastern Baltic have responded extensively to this important legal initiative."
"In expert circles, though, arguments about the criteria the Council has suggested for punishing fishermen who take illegal catches are still continuing."
"The question arises once more: does the idea of seeking a guarantee of effective punishment through its far-reaching formalisation take account of the differentiation in the catch potential of the European seas?"
"Should subsequent legislation not bear in mind the possibility of making the penalty level dependent on the fish stocks and binding catch quotas for species caught?"
"I believe that the recently declared modified ICS evaluation in respect of the Baltic ecosystem constitutes an announcement of a thaw in fisheries policy, in the process of adjustment of the revolutionary actions of the European Union aimed at protecting stocks."
"The European Parliament Committee on Fisheries had the foresight to complete a special amendment document that treats the first year of application of the regulation as a transition period, a period of adaptation, enabling Member States to take the necessary steps to come into line."
"Madam President, the world's fisheries are in crisis."
"The EU's fisheries are in crisis, compounded by a 30% increase in marine fuel prices in recent months."
"The fishermen are on our streets in Brussels and in our Member States."
"Your response, Commissioner, is urgently awaited."
"Moving now from unsustainable economic pressure to unsustainable environmental pressure, experts report that 75% of fisheries are significantly depleted and over-exploited."
"Illegal unreported unregulated fishing is a global problem that compounds the present fisheries crisis."
"According to the FAO, overall IUU fishing accounts for up to 30% of total captures of some important fisheries, and catches of particular species could be up to three times the permitted amount."
"IUU fishing undermines sustainable fisheries, harms and destroys marine habitats and threatens the livelihood of responsible fishermen and communities depending on fishing."
"Illegal fishing also jeopardises food security, particularly for those heavily dependent on fish as a source of animal protein."
"By-catch, due mainly to large-scale industrial bottom-trawling, often carried out unregulated, illegally and unreported by distant fishing fleets, has devastating effects on local fishermen and fish stocks."
"Over one third of the world's catch is simply discarded due to inappropriate fish sizes or simply due to unintended catch."
"Misguided EU fishery regulations have encouraged completely unsustainable practices, such as discarding on a massive scale, as it is - perversely - illegal to land by-catches, the examination of which would be invaluable to the scientists."
"The extreme vulnerability of most deep sea fish stocks to rapid depletion means that this fishery may no longer exist by the time regulations are implemented."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner whether he has looked at the possibilities for satellite tracking of vessels, electronic documentation systems for catches and on-board CCTV as possible measures to combat illegal fishing, as happens in other jurisdictions."
"Proper implementation of this regulation will require a high degree of integration at Community level of the services responsible for inspection and control."
"It will also require fishermen and other stakeholders to take responsibility and ownership of the policy."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has a duty and responsibility to play a significant role in combating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and it is doing so with a package of enforcement initiatives, strengthening controls, inspections and sanctions."
"The most ambitious objective, however, is preventive in nature: enabling and guaranteeing the traceability of products from catch to final destination."
"This is because, while the damage caused by such illegal activities in economic terms and in terms of protecting the marine environment is serious, the objectives to be achieved for consumer protection with a high-quality product and to safeguard fishermen's occupations are no less important."
"These occupations are more than ever at risk because of many factors, some of which are economic, but some of which are structural."
"It is these important social objectives that guide the European Union in preventing, discouraging and eliminating illegal fishing, which is the subject of this regulation, and which reinforce its commitment to ensure compliance with the provisions of the common fisheries policy in Community waters."
"The unanimous vote in favour of the Aubert report in committee is an important signal of the will to put the proposed measures into practice."
"(BG) Mme President, Members of the European Parliament, This report touches upon very important issues related to the protection of seas and the measures to combat illegal fishing."
"The need for change of the existing legal framework results from the increasing scope of this phenomenon which threatens ecosystems and fisheries in the Community."
"The rapporteur notes also the essential fact that Member States fail to follow the common fishing policy."
"Existing sanctions vary from one Member State to another, which discriminates some fishermen in the European Union."
"Therefore it is very important to improve the cooperation, coordination, and exchange of good practices among the European countries so that to prevent and deter illegal and unreported fishing."
"The establishment of a control system geared to the needs of the fishing sector is a substantial step forward."
"As well as damage to the environment, illegal fishing causes economic and social consequences that make legal fisheries suffer losses in the amount of billions of Euro."
"The ban on the importation of fish products of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing into the European Union, too, can affect the profits from illegal fishing."
"The control policy and the serious sanctions for violations provide grounds for better management of fish resources."
"Fishermen protest in Bulgaria, too, as they go through many difficulties."
"Therefore we need to make responsible decisions on the future of the sector."
"I support the report of Mme Aubert."
"Madam President, I should like to thank Mrs Aubert for this report."
"The one issue that needs to be stressed is the consumers' lack of awareness of the problem of unregulated, unreported and illegal fishing and that is something we need to speak more about."
"As others have said, the legal fishing sector is under severe threat and the impact of this illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is just part of the problem."
"Fuel costs are a major issue for them and we need some response from the Commission to the crisis which has seen fishermen give away fish in Member States and take to the streets in protest."
"Perhaps part of the problem we have with the illegal side of the fishing is over-regulation on the legal sector - but perhaps that is a debate for another issue."
"Yes, we need a global agreement on this, but we need to start at home and whatever we do, rather than just layer on bureaucracy, which we are very often accused of in this place, we need to make sure that the regulations we put in place are effective and tackle the problem at source, so that we do not destroy both the economics and the environment."
"(PT) Madam President, we do indeed have here an excellent report - congratulations to our rapporteur."
"The proposal, as has already been said by the Commission, is a good proposal, yet I should like to emphasise the message we were given by the draftsmen of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade, Daniel Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, namely that this is exactly the kind of instrument that can effectively respond to a crisis such as the one we are experiencing in the fisheries sector today."
"It is precisely because sustainability rules are not respected in fisheries that fishermen are faced with this crisis, and this is the fundamental lesson that I hope we will all be able to draw from this."
"The problem is that the clock is ticking and time does not stand still for our legislative process, and from this point of view, Commissioner, measures must be taken with the utmost urgency, as has already been said here, because otherwise we shall miss the boat in terms of responding to our challenges."
"Madam President, if five minutes of the catch-the-eye are not taken up, even people who have contributed to the debate can put a question to the Commissioner."
"I have done this several times since the catch-the-eye procedure came in."
"Therefore, with your permission, I should like to put a specific question to the Commissioner."
"I have been told that I am only allowed to take two speakers."
"I am willing to give you the floor."
"Madam President, I do not want preferential treatment but there are facilities for five minutes of catch-the-eye."
"Could Commissioner Borg comment on the application of subsidies on marine fuels in some Member States and not others and, indeed, on an even-handed approach to subsidies?"
"How can this be squared under the common fisheries policy - with an emphasis on common - and does it square with the competition policy rules?"
"We have to help the fishing community who, at the moment, are in a severe economic crisis, particularly with the 30% increase in marine fuel prices."
"Could you be sure to respond specifically to this, as requested by several speakers, in your reply?"
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all, the level of the debate on this important subject demonstrates that we share a strong commitment to address the issue of IUU in an effective and comprehensive manner."
"The truth of the matter is not only that IUU is an activity that threatens the sustainability of fish stocks, but it is also an activity that threatens the future of honest fishermen within and outside the European Union."
"In order for us to be successful in our efforts, we must ensure three crucial principles."
"The first is that the scope of the proposal remains comprehensive."
"Secondly, the certification scheme put in place must be effective yet ensure that there are no unnecessary burdens imposed as a result."
"And the sanctions scheme we proposed must be such that these can serve as effective punitive measures and, therefore, be dissuasive by their very nature."
"With regard to these three principles, I have heard confirmation that you have managed to sort out various issues with Member States concerning the scope, the certification scheme and the sanctions."
"You have done so without diluting or diminishing the effectiveness of the proposal."
"Specifically on the sanctions, let me say that one of the major problems with control is the fact that the range of sanctions applied by Member States is so diverse that it is the sector itself which has consistently and constantly called for a level playing field in this area."
"It is for this reason that, at the very least, we have proposed levels which should be applied in a proportionate and in an effective manner."
"On the wider issue regarding the reform of the common fisheries policy, I can confirm that we have started reflecting on this and will be having an orientation debate in Council in the coming months."
"In fact the idea is to have an informal ministerial meeting in September."
"We are also dealing with over-regulation, with a view to simplifying the regulatory regime that is in place."
"Let me also say that I cannot agree more with the comment made by Mrs Aubert that the fight against IUU, if effective, will help fishermen to better face up to the problems and the difficulties they are now facing, and this point was made by certain other Members who intervened."
"I also, however, agree that it is not sufficient."
"On the issue of developing countries, we are committed to addressing this issue effectively, as I said in my opening remarks."
"Taking measures to assist developing countries is key if we are to solve the problem and not simply to displace it."
"As regards control issues, let me assure the rapporteur that the Commission is coming up with a strong proposal during the third quarter of this year which will also be merged, or harmonised, with the IUU proposal that we have before us."
"In that way, both will be convergent and attain the same results."
"As regards the fuel crisis, we already have the possibility of medium- to long-term measures that are in place, and this would be in combination with the restructuring of the sector."
"We will be looking at the market measures in place - this point was raised by some Members who intervened - which work in such a way that increased costs are borne by the fishermen and are not passed on to the consumer, as happens in other sectors."
"We therefore need to look into this in order to find out why."
"There are systems in place which bring about a situation whereby it is the fisherman who ends up suffering, who ends up having to bear the increased costs himself, rather than those being passed on to the consumers."
"We also offer fishermen some possibilities for providing immediate assistance, if this is linked to restructuring in the form of rescue and restructuring aid."
"However, I need to say here that I am also looking at this and am discussing it with my colleagues, with a view to trying to identify other ways and means whereby we can help fishermen face up to this new reality in the very short term."
"But I need to underline that we can only do this if there is a firm and a fixed-term commitment to restructuring, because the problem is also that of over-capacity."
"Therefore, unless we tackle the problem of over-capacity, we will have a recurring problem for as long as fuel prices remain as they are, or - worse still - if they continue rising, as the indications suggest."
"This is what we have done with France, where agreement was reached between the Commission and France on a package of measures which are intended to help the French fisheries sector to restructure."
"I have to admit that this was not enough and did not satisfy the French fishermen."
"I need to underline that, for the Commission to respond, we also need the cooperation and active engagement of Member States."
"We cannot act on our own."
"In this regard I understand that this crisis will be raised and discussed at the forthcoming June Council, and I personally welcome it."
"On the question raised at the very end by Mrs Doyle concerning the application of subsidies by some Member States and not others, the information that the Commission has is that these subsidies that have been granted by different Member States either fall within the parameters of the de minimis (and any Member State can grant subsidies as long as they fall within the threshold of de minimis) or are under restructuring programmes to which I made reference before."
"There is the communication with regard to rescue and restructuring aid and, if agreement is reached - if the Commission gives the green light to a restructuring programme - then there are certain possibilities with regard to subsidies, with regard to state assistance, which would not otherwise be possible."
"Where we have had information with regard to other subsidies which are not covered either by de minimis or under restructuring programmes, we are investigating them."
"There has just been, for example, a notification to France that the amount which was paid in the form of an insurance scheme has to be re-collected."
"So we do take action in order to see to it that the European rules with regard to competition are properly observed."
"However, I would end by saying that the immediate crisis is such that we need to address it very carefully in order to find ways and means whereby we try to find solutions of an immediate nature but which would also have the conditionality that there is a firm commitment within the short term for the fisheries sector to restructure in order to bring about capacity levels to match what can sustainably be fished out of the seas."
"Madam President, I would first of all like to thank the Commissioner and everyone who took part in this debate."
"Obviously we have also covered the background to the serious crisis currently affecting the sector."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner for trying to give precise answers to the questions raised on this subject, even though it is clearly difficult to go into detail in some areas."
"In any case, it is unfortunate that the European Union - or Brussels - should be systematically blamed for everything."
"I actually believe that this would be a good opportunity to show that the European Union - Brussels - is not part of the problem, but part of the solution."
"Admittedly, when we see the resentment that exists towards the European Union, we realise to what extent Member States and a number of industry members have shirked their responsibilities over the years, prioritising short-term interests, thinking that they can profit from these for a while, but refusing to see that, by doing so, they led an entire sector to the brink of disaster."
"This is where we are now."
"How can we find instant solutions to a situation that has dragged on for years?"
"It is not easy."
"You have made a few suggestions."
"However, we will not succeed if we do not take strict and drastic measures, if we do not employ all of the necessary means, because these texts will not be enforced without financial and human resources, adopting much more dissuasive sanctions than those that currently exist with regard to illegal fishing."
"This at least will not be too hard, considering the low number of fines recently imposed."
"We also need to provide much more encouragement and reward for intelligent and sustainable behaviour and practices."
"Often, those fishermen and fishing enterprises who are adopting practices that are both extremely compliant and innovative in terms of sustainable fisheries management feel that they go unrecognised and unrewarded."
"I also believe that, both in terms of the fight against illegal fishing and other areas that have been covered, such as waste or resource management and quotas, we also need to come up with a much more rewarding strategy, one that is forward-looking and a step in the right direction, which does not currently seem to me to be the case."
"To conclude, I believe that this report is a chance for us to raise all of these issues."
"Clearly, having this discussion alone will not solve the problems."
"I imagine that this discussion will continue in the next report, although it is about time that we had a broad consultation and ended the top-down negotiations between the Commission, governments and industry representatives and had a much wider, more horizontal, cross-disciplinary consultation."
"This would provide us with answers and the European Union and Parliament would again be allowed to fulfil their role and embrace their duty to find solutions for this sector in crisis."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 5 June 2008."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"The European Parliament has delivered a further blow to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, which is a real international problem."
"The adopted measures effectively complement the existing mechanism."
"I am specifically referring to the introduction of a scheme of port state control for vessels entering the port, where a catch certificate would be issued, and the ban on the entry of IUU vessels."
"I also welcome the ban on the importation of IUU fish and the publication of a list of vessels involved in IUU fishing."
"The added value of these new European rules also stems from the development of a Community alert system when there is a suspicion that IUU fishing has been detected."
"The system of sanctions has also been strengthened, including the ban on access to public aid or subsidies by IUU vessels and the repayment of public aid or subsidies received, where necessary."
"More importantly, I successfully lobbied the European Parliament to focus on outermost regions in the fight against illegal fishing, due to the exceptional fragility of their ecosystems."
"This sends out a strong signal to unscrupulous fleets, which will help clamp down on the unfair competition which is slowly but surely putting our fishermen out of business."
"Protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Duarte Freitas, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems in the high seas from the adverse impacts of bottom fishing gears - C6-0453/2007 -."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, Mr Freitas' report deals with a proposal that opens the way to the introduction of the principle of environmental impact assessments in the fisheries field."
"I cannot overstate how important this is in terms of a regime shift and an alignment of fisheries regulation with many other maritime activities."
"In addition, this principle responds to a very specific objective - that of preventing damage to vulnerable marine ecosystems."
"The proposal fully embodies the ecosystem approach, which the Commission is committed to implementing under the Common Fisheries Policy."
"Through this proposal, we respond to the calls made in 2006 by the United Nations General Assembly to take effective action to prevent vulnerable marine ecosystems in the high seas from being destroyed or significantly damaged by bottom fishing activities."
"In relation to vessels that operate in areas for which no international conservation and management regime is in place, it is up to the flag State to regulate the activities of its vessels to ensure this protection."
"Since the European Union exerts the regulatory competence of the flag State under international law, we must adopt appropriate measures to respond to this UN call by the end of this year."
"The regulation, as proposed, will thus apply to EU flagged vessels operating in non-RFMO areas of the high seas."
"We currently have a sizeable fleet operating in the South West Atlantic, which is one such area."
"The text has been designed to established result obligations by flag Member States, namely to ensure that no fishing permits are to be given to fish with bottom gears unless an assessment of potential impacts clearly demonstrates low risk for vulnerable marine ecosystems."
"What this means is that the Commission does not go into the detail as to how Member States are to conduct such assessments, but rather we fix the minimum standards relating to scientific information and then leave it up to Member States to see how to achieve the required results."
"Our proposal stipulates that bottom gears cannot be deployed below a depth of 1 000 metres."
"The argument that the proposed rule has no scientific basis cannot be sustained."
"On the one hand, we are still developing our knowledge of the deep oceans and face so much uncertainty that the full application of the precautionary approach is warranted."
"The proposed depth limit is a reasonable choice, as it does not impinge on current EU fleet activities, which are much shallower."
"On the other hand, this rule seeks to ensure that we give ourselves time to test how this new regulatory approach works before we allow our fishers to expand into deeper waters."
"This is about keeping the present state of our activities in place until we know enough to be more confident about expanding them safely."
"The Commission is ready to come back to this specific point in two years' time, when we submit a report to the Council and to this Assembly on the regulation's implementation and effectiveness."
"It is for these reasons that the Commission cannot accept the deletion of this rule as proposed in the report."
"Secondly, Mr Freitas' report proposes to amend the provision whereby the regulation would impose full observer coverage in the fleets, and stipulate instead a sampling system."
"The Commission also has difficulty in accepting this amendment since, with the absence of observers, only VMS remains as a control tool for monitoring compliance by each vessel with its approved fishing plans."
"This is not enough, and it is probably unrealistic to expect national fisheries monitoring centres to ensure real-time, individual monitoring of each unit in the fleet."
"In addition, without an observer on board, the very important 'move away rule' in case the vessel accidentally encounters an uncharted ecosystem will simply be inoperative as it is impossible to monitor compliance with this rule by VMS."
"As in the previous case, this requirement can be reviewed in two years' time to assess its effectiveness."
"Most of the remaining proposed amendments are acceptable to the Commission, and many have indeed already been brought forward on similar lines during the Council discussions."
"I would like to thank Parliament for the support it has expressed to the Commission in our efforts to provide an effective response on this issue."
"rapporteur. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly like to congratulate the Commission on the initiative of this proposal, and this for two reasons."
"Firstly, because it is in keeping with and follows on from the European Union's initiative and proactive stance on this matter in the UN General Assembly and, secondly, because it is based on a very important principle, which is assessing the impact of fisheries even before authorisation is given to carry out this activity."
"This is because we are talking about areas where there is currently no regional fisheries organisation."
"The truth of the matter is that in coastal areas it is the responsibility of the states to adopt measures to protect vulnerable ecosystems from bottom fishing."
"In international waters, the protection of the marine environment is generally laid down by regional marine conventions, where these exist, while the adoption of measures for the protection and management of marine living resources and the regulation of the impact of fishing on vulnerable ecosystems comes under the responsibility of Regional Fisheries Management Organisations."
"However, there are high-sea areas that are not covered by any fisheries organisation, which is tantamount to an encouragement to engage in destructive fishery activities."
"It was with this reality in mind that the UN General Assembly, as you would expect, with the EU playing a leading role, made progress towards a notion of the need to do something to protect the seabed, where there is currently no control whatsoever."
"This is indeed positive action, which we should highlight and welcome, as we should the Commission's own proposal, yet this is also a proposal that we can call generous, as we shall force ships flying the flag of our Member States to respect a set of rules that we will have to ensure, via diplomatic channels, that other third countries fishing in these areas we are talking about - the deep seabed - also follow suit."
"Otherwise there is little point in the European Union having to lead the way and oblige its ships to conduct these studies and fulfil a set of requirements if other ships under other flags then engage in destructive fishing practices in the very area that we wish to protect."
"There is, therefore, one area in this generous proposal for which we have to congratulate the Commission, that must have a consequence as regards diplomatic efforts, based also on the agreement reached with the UN General Assembly, so that we can really take a step forward in this matter."
"As regards some of this issues mentioned here - the 1 000 metre issue - Commissioner, in the Committee on Fisheries we were able to hold a hearing with specialists, and I was able to listen to a number of specialists, and their consensus of opinion is that the 1 000 metres, or 800, or 500, or 1 200, are not a technical measure but merely a policy choice."
"Yet, if with this proposal we are already forcing those who wish to fish in a certain area to study the seabeds beforehand and the risk in these seabeds, it is my belief that this study will encompass all depths from 800 to 1 100, or to 1 500, and, therefore, there would be no need to set a clear definition of 1 000 metres, as this is already protected in another way."
"However, we are still waiting for some further justification, possibly of a technical nature, that the specialists we heard were not able to pin point, but I think that what the Commissioner has said up to now does not present sufficient grounds for us to suppose that the 1 000 metre proposal would be valid."
"Nevertheless, we shall keep on waiting and we do in fact hope that the European Parliament's proposal may be taken into consideration following tomorrow's vote."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - Madam President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report."
"Many marine ecosystems in the high seas are unique and vulnerable and - most definitely and appropriately - need protection from the sometimes devastatingly catastrophic effects of bottom fishing gears."
"The proposed regulation is undoubtedly a good step in the right direction, but much more may need to be done in the future as more knowledge and experience is gathered on deep-sea marine biology."
"The application of the precautionary principle, as a basis for formulating some of the parameters of this regulation, is judged to be both necessary and wise."
"As always, the success of any regulation depends to a large extent on the degree of its proper implementation, and on-board observers will help in this respect."
"It is very much hoped that, despite some inevitable inherent weaknesses in this respect, this regulation will turn out to be a success both in theory and in practice."
"Madam President, we are obviously all in favour of protecting vulnerable marine ecosystems from destructive fishing practices."
"In fact, I am so much in favour of it that I would even advocate protecting them against all destructive practices, including non-fishing practices."
"Ultimately, however, we already know that in these cases it is up to the fisheries sector to lead the way and set an example."
"As I have already said in relation to the report by Mrs Miguélez on deep-sea fish stocks, I think that our main concern should be to protect all vulnerable ecosystems that have been identified as such, wherever they are, not just those that are lucky enough to be below a depth of 1 000 metres."
"As Mr Freitas has already said, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has ruled out the depth criterion as being arbitrary and non-scientific, and the Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs), including the North Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO), have even ruled out the 2 000 metre rule, without even considering a 1 000 metre limit, as in their opinion the limit would serve no purpose, so they have removed it."
"However, my question, Commissioner, is as follows: you have said that this is going to be applied to the fleets that fish on the Patagonian shelf."
"Recently representatives of the Ocean Institute were here presenting assessment studies in which they did not detect any vulnerable marine ecosystems in that area."
"I would therefore like to ask you whether you are going to continue to insist on applying this proposal to the Community fleet that fishes in that area."
"Finally I would like to discuss the subject of observers, regarding which I think that the report by Mr Freitas has provided a considerable dose of reason."
"I think, and I am in agreement with the report, that it is important to have observers who are scientists, as they have to evaluate vulnerable marine ecosystems, which cannot be done by just any observer."
"As has been said by the scientists themselves, however, it seems absurd to have one per boat, because as well as emptying our oceanography institutes, there would be no point in having one per boat, as it is much more important to consider planned and organised sampling programmes that are maintained over time, which is what is going to give us a good monitoring overview of these fisheries."
"I would therefore be grateful, Commissioner, if you could answer my questions, and I call for support for the report by Mr Freitas."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur for this excellent report and by reiterating that what we are dealing with here is the protection of the seabed, inter alia deep-water coral reefs, seamounts, hydrothermal vents and deep-water sponges, which are priceless treasures of our ecosystems."
"I should also like to recall that protection of these ecosystems had long been assured in the Autonomous Region of the Azores and it was only in 2003 that it was jeopardised by the European institutions, when they decided to open up fishing in this region indiscriminately, without any consideration for the need to protect these ecosystems."
"Above all, the most important issue seems to me to be for us to have totally consistent legislation and the problem with the 1 000 metres is that it does not make any sense to say that one cannot fish below 1 000 metres outside European waters, and yet one can fish below 1 000 metres in European waters - this does not make any sense from the point of view of the legislation's environmental soundness."
"What concerns me most of all is that this UN Resolution - the key Resolution 61/105 of 8 December 2006 - concerns several other measures, namely those related to protecting sea turtles that live on the surface and that, unfortunately, the European Commission, instead of transposing this decision in its entirety, decided to start point by point, sector by sector, several years later."
"This does not seem to me to be the best legislative modus operandi."
"It would be better if the entire UN decision were transposed at Community level and this would then simplify things immensely and make the legislation much more operable both within and outside Community waters."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we all agree that there is a need to adopt measures to eliminate destructive fishing practices that threaten vulnerable marine ecosystems."
"With this in mind we agree with the idea that Union vessels that operate in deep-sea areas that are not subject to any regional fisheries organisation or agreement should be subject to Community regulations governing the conditions that they must fulfil in order to obtain the relevant special permits at these depths, and specifying the subsequent conduct that they must observe, the information they must provide, etc."
"We do not, however, agree with the restrictions that the Commission was proposing in Article 6, setting as a reasonable option a maximum depth of 1 000 metres for the deployment of bottom gears, as it considers that this limit offers an appropriate level of protection, because there is no established data to back this up."
"There are no scientific studies that show whether vulnerable ecosystems are below or above those 1 000 metre levels."
"We think that we need to move forward and better document the seabed in each area, identifying where the vulnerabilities are, before indicating any maximum depth for deployment."
"We think that it would be a good idea that, if a vessel happened to come across a possible vulnerable marine ecosystem, it should be obliged to stop fishing and inform the appropriate authorities."
"With this in mind, we agree with the proposal that a representative sample of the vessels to which each Member State has issued a special fishing permit should take a scientific observer on board, ensuring a suitable rotation among all vessels for successive fishing trips."
"Finally, we also agree that, in the event of a technical problem with the satellite positioning device that each vessel must carry, the captain should communicate the vessel's geographical location at 2-hour intervals and that, when it returns to port, it should not be able to return to sea until it can be verified that the positioning system is functioning correctly."
"All of this is being proposed not only with the aim of greater sustainability of the marine environment, but also in order to safeguard the fishing activities that are necessary in order to provide us with food."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Freitas on his excellent report."
"A central part of maritime management is the protection of vulnerable ecosystems."
"Significant efforts have been made over the last few years to achieve this."
"I am delighted that the European Union is undertaking this pioneering work to protect the environment - it will benefit each and every one of us."
"The Ecosystem Policy is internationally accepted and it is now up to us to implement it as extensively as possible."
"A system made up of small steps is suitable for the implementation of this policy."
"We can learn from each small step before moving on to the next one - evolution and not revolution is the key."
"The protection of vulnerable ecosystems is complicated."
"There is a wonderful example of this in Ireland."
"Deep-water coral can be found off the west coast of the country."
"It was announced in the NATURA 2000 that this coastal region had four sites and there is a limit imposed on fishing there in order to protect the deep-water coral."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) Whilst broadly supporting the proposals in the report that aim to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems in the high seas, we would like to stress the need for the measures adopted in this field to be taken based on scientific fisheries research and in an appropriate fashion, that is to say, in the light of the diversity of existing situations."
"This need is immediately apparent in terms of the definition of a vulnerable marine ecosystem, which, as a matter of fact, as the report highlights, pointing out the need to find a definition according to the best scientific information."
"Similarly, we need to distinguish between the different consequences of using the different gear, assessing their potential impacts on marine resources and the seabed through scientific fisheries research."
"Lastly, we should like to state once again that we believe the area of questions related to inspections or observation omissions falls within the competence of each Member State."
"Madam President, scientists in the fishing industry now know that the deep and high seas are teeming with life, most of which remains undiscovered."
"In fact, about 50% of the animals or flora collected from areas deeper than 3 000 metres are a new species."
"Scientists have speculated that as many as 10 million species may inhabit the deep sea, biodiversity comparable to the world's richest tropical rain forests."
"They are slowly discovering ecosystems which are extraordinary in nature, often hosting species found nowhere else on the planet."
"I therefore welcome the Commission's proposals to require high-seas fishing activities with bottom gears to be subject to a permit, and that the responsible authority will determine that there are no significant adverse impacts on ecosystems in the high seas before issuing the permits."
"Action is long overdue in this area and I would like to thank Duarte Freitas for his report."
"Bottom trawling is causing unprecedented damage to the deep-sea coral and sponge communities."
"Unregulated bottom gear can also reach submerged mountains or seamounts, bulldozing their way across the ocean floor and destroying all life in their path."
"Species may become extinct before scientists even have a chance to identify them."
"Unfortunately, the European Union is at the epicentre of deep-sea bottom trawling."
"In 2001, Member States, including our new Baltic States, took approximately 60% of the high-seas bottom-trawl catch and in the same year Spain alone accounted for approximately two-thirds of the reported EU catch and 40% of the reported global catch in high-seas bottom-trawl fisheries."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the Commission must use the powers it has beyond the fisheries sector to promote concerted action to protect vulnerable ecosystems and our approach must be guided by two key principles: the precautionary approach, which requires us to act when there is a lack of scientific information or uncertainty, and, above all else, ecosystem-based management."
"Commissioner, is the 1 000 metre figure an arbitrary figure?"
"I think it is a question of whether vulnerable ecosystems exist above this figure and not just below it, as some colleagues have questioned."
"ALDE). - Madam President, several speakers have claimed that there is no scientific evidence - or no evidence at all - to support the choice of the depth limit of 1000 metres."
"This is not so. In fact, to give you an example, there is scientific evidence from fishing operations at 840 to 1300 metres in the west of Ireland."
"Carbon-14 dating revealed that the cold-water coral matrix taken as by-catch in this fishery was at least 4550 years old."
"So there are vulnerable ecosystems - as shown by scientific evidence - at that depth."
"In addition to using the precautionary principle, I think it is wise to choose to have such a limit."
"(PL) Madam President, the European Union is an active participant in the search for global solutions to the question of the use of bottom trawling gear."
"Instead of instituting a complete ban on their use, it is in favour of imposing strict restrictions governing their application."
"The Regulation under discussion is a sort of modus vivendi."
"The legislative effects obtained are not always based on a clear and convincing provision, however."
"Smaller fishing environments deprived of the potential for regular and detailed studies are simply worried that they may not be in a position to meet the requirements for drafting a corresponding catch plan together with the requirement to specify the depth at which the trawling gear will be used, or - which is of particular concern to the poorer areas - the configuration of the sea bed."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I welcome the number of points and comments that have been made, which underline the importance you attach to the issue of dealing with destructive fishing practices."
"As I said earlier, our proposal responds to a call by the international community and we must show our determination to meet that call."
"On the issue of the proposed 1 000-metre depth limit, I wish to say that it is crucial that we adopt a precautionary approach, and this chosen limit was designed in a way that provides us with an assurance that we do not have a sudden development of fisheries in a particular area."
"At the same time, it does not, at this juncture, actually affect current fisheries, and if this is the case I do not understand why there is such resistance to the 1 000-metre limit."
"But I will look into it again and I am hopeful that this issue can be resolved satisfactorily in the Council in June."
"However, I would also say that I do not agree that we should allow unlimited bottom fishing until we have identified vulnerable ecosystems, because once the harm is done, it is done, and then it is too late."
"This is why we insist on the precautionary approach."
"On the issue of observers, let me say that this is a crucial point if we are to show that we are serious about the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems in the high seas."
"Having full coverage is a key point for the Commission."
"I am confident that we can find a solution to this issue too in the Council in June without abandoning the principle of full observer coverage."
"rapporteur. - (PT) It is with regret that I would first of all like to say that the Commissioner has not heeded what virtually all Members have said and what the report states with regard to the 1 000 metres."
"There is no, I repeat, no scientific evidence that the figure of 1 000 metres is appropriate."
"Why 1 000?"
"Why not 800 or 1 200?"
"There is no scientific evidence and we held a hearing with specialists and we were able to have with us the head of the Department of Oceanography and Fisheries of the Azores who has conducted many good, internationally-recognised studies of the seabed, along with other people with whom I spoke, other technical experts: there is no scientific evidence that the 1 000 metre figure is reasonable."
"As a matter of fact, the 1 000 metres may well have been lifted from the discussions relating to the Mediterranean, yet we are not dealing with the same area, in fact we are talking about completely different areas!"
"So let us wait and see, my friends: if we are rightly obliging the European Union to take the lead in these processes of protecting the deep seabed, which is a good thing, and hopefully bringing others along behind us, we have this environmental responsibility, but we also have to be a little objective and reasonable."
"If, to be able to fish in these areas we are talking about, we require fleets to submit scientific studies for which the Commission has been unable to put a figure on costs, nor tell us whether the Member States will be in a position to assess the quality and respond to these scientific studies, yet if we require fleets to submit such studies to ascertain if the seabed is vulnerable or not, let us then be reasonable ourselves!"
"Let us not then talk about 1 000 metres."
"If there are vulnerable deep-sea ecosystems, they may lie at 800 or 1 200 metres, but the studies we are making fleets submit in order to obtain fishing licences will show this: it is as simple as that and therefore I believe that it is a question of being reasonable on this matter."
"To conclude, just one last reference to the importance of this matter: it is said that we know more about the surface of the moon than we know about the deep seabed and for that reason here in this Chamber we shall be pushing ourselves as individuals to help in discovering more about the deep seabed."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 5 June 2008."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"The strengths of the regulation proposal are the introduction of the precaution principle and the issuing of a fishing permit, with the application of an assessment from certifying that these activities do not have negative effects upon marine ecosystems."
"As a fictional rapporteur, I considered it necessary that these assessments be based upon aligned criteria at the level of the Community, which are revised by the Commission in order to provide a uniform evaluation by all member states."
"Furthermore, I proposed the creation of an electronic mapping system with a view to the creation of a database of the vulnerable marine ecosystems which shall reduce the costs and efforts regarding the assessment and issuing of the fishing permit."
"In other words, the proposed elements have been introduced to improve system efficiency and to ensure the optimal protection of marine biodiversity."
"It is also essential that, by the end of 2008, the Commission set out a list of the areas that are to be closed, indicating the confirmed sites, as well as the ones in which the presence of vulnerable marine ecosystems is likely."
"Yet, we must not forget the role that the Member States have in the protection of marine fauna by means of the implementation of the obligations arising from the Directive on habitats and the nominalization of marine ecosystems in the national legislation of the Natura 2000 network."
"Implementing trade policy through efficient import and export rules and procedures (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Jean-Pierre Audy, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on implementing trade policy through efficient import and export rules and procedures."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the customs union, which celebrates its 40th anniversary in 2008, was one of the first stages of European integration."
"It has led to the abolition of all import and export customs duties between EU Member States and to the adoption of a common foreign tariff."
"It is a vital aspect of the proper functioning of the internal market and the correct application of the Union's trade agreements."
"Within the customs union, the efficiency of import and export procedures is vital for the Union's competitiveness and for the protection of its citizens."
"Commissioner, you recently published the customs figures for 2007, which show, and I quote, 'new and alarming tendencies'."
"You said that counterfeiting continues to endanger our health, our safety and our economy."
"In terms of consumer protection, there are numerous concerns and my report contains proposals regarding compliance with European standards, particularly in terms of health and safety."
"Another example is the issue of cigarette smuggling, which was raised in Parliament last September and for which I was rapporteur for my political group."
"This highlighted the scale of the problem and revealed weaknesses in our Community transit system."
"This is why the Committee on International Trade questions the quality of our customs system and its ability to cope with the challenges inherent in trade globalisation in a context where our citizens expect the Union to protect them."
"This at least is what is proposed by the Treaty of Lisbon, currently undergoing ratification by the Member States, which states in Article 1(4) that in its relations with the wider world, the Union shall contribute to the protection of its citizens."
"At international level, the main uncertainty is the outcome of the Doha Round negotiations conducted by the World Trade Organization, where any agreement seems a far-off prospect."
"We all know that if the multilateral trade negotiations break down, we will end up with bilateral competition - which as we are all aware is governed by the law of survival of the fittest - and we will need a strong and effective customs union."
"Even within the World Customs Organization, we are seeing less progress in terms of efficiency and global harmonisation of customs procedures, following the security concerns that emerged in the United States in the wake of 9/11."
"Nevertheless, in terms of international trade, the report points out that if import and export rules and procedures are too strict, this can represent a non-tariff barrier to trade."
"I invite the Commission to focus particularly on small and medium-sized enterprises, which consider excessively burdensome customs rules and procedures as one of the key obstacles to international trade."
"The customs system must be used to facilitate trade, and the report proposes that this issue be the subject of an international agreement, to be dealt with separately from the Doha Agenda."
"The report also examines the numerous issues linked with the tariff classification, value and origin - both preferential and non-preferential - of goods, in the hope that the Commission will heed the demands of the industrial sectors concerned."
"Finally, I would like to stress that the ongoing lack of harmonisation seems to me to be a clear cause of the weakening of the European customs system."
"I understand, Commissioner, that the reform of the Customs Code is a priority for the Commission and that it is already a sufficiently complex task without being combined with institutional reform."
"However, I wish to open up a debate by proposing that consideration be given to the possible creation of integrated and coordinated national customs administrations, with a view to moving towards a Community administration in charge of the customs union."
"Indeed, the increasingly pro-harmonisation nature of the customs rules means that the role of customs is de facto becoming identical throughout the Union."
"In view of the long periods of time required for developments to take place in the Community, especially those which affect the prerogatives of the Member States, I believe that the time has come to lay this issue on the table."
"It is an issue which is both symbolic, in that it is the crowning achievement of 40 years of increasingly advanced customs integration, and pragmatic, in that it reflects the need for a more efficient customs organisation in an increasingly complex, fast-moving world which will not wait for us."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I am pleased that you allow me to react to the report prepared by Jean-Pierre Audy and unanimously adopted by the Committee on International Trade on 6 May."
"I congratulate the rapporteur, who perfectly highlighted the essential contribution of customs legislation and customs services to an effective implementation of our common trade policy, and also identified the important challenges that the Union is facing in this matter."
"My services are doing their best to ensure that regulations or agreements on international trade take fully into account the contribution, but also the necessary constraints, of customs concepts and procedures."
"They also actively defend the Community interests in international organisations dealing with customs matters, in particular the World Customs Organisation and the World Trade Organisation."
"That is particularly the case concerning the rules of origin, both non-preferential and preferential."
"On 27 May, the Committee on International Trade was informed of the state of play of the reform of these rules for the Generalised System of Preferences."
"I am confident that, based on the various contributions received, the Commission will be in a position to find support from the Member States to complete this reform."
"That is also true concerning the WTO negotiations on trade facilitation."
"The Commission is still convinced at this stage that a trade facilitation agreement should remain one of the pillars of the conclusion of the Doha Round, and should not be removed from it."
"Of course, the results of the negotiations on trade facilitation achieved so far should in any case not be lost."
"Important steps have been taken to respond to the threats posed by counterfeited, pirated and dangerous products."
"New procedures have been introduced into customs legislation for the purpose of guaranteeing security and safety."
"The modernised Community Customs Code, published today, and the decision on the electronic customs published in January represent major milestones in the constant but dynamic contribution of customs legislation to both the protection of European citizens and the competitiveness of our economy by facilitating legitimate trade."
"They constitute examples of good interinstitutional cooperation."
"The report also legitimately insists on the need for further harmonisation and uniformity in the implementation of the customs legislation, and for further improving the organisation and working methods of our customs administrations."
"In my view, further harmonisation in implementing customs legislation can be achieved through the following initiatives: the current work on the implementation of the modernised Customs Code and the e-Customs Decision; a new programme for targeted monitoring of the correct and uniform application of customs legislation, and an assessment, in partnership with the Member States, of the needs and possibilities to approximate customs offences and penalties."
"The 'Customs 2013' Programme also represents an important tool in that respect."
"To conclude, I would like to react to the points of the report concerning the US 100% scanning initiative."
"The Commission is using all possible channels to make the US authorities understand that they have chosen the wrong way to secure the supply chain."
"The Commission provided the US Government in April with a solid report, prepared with the contribution of Member States, which stresses the negative impact of this measure on the European ports, international trade and maritime traffic."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (CS) Madam President, I welcome the own-initiative report by my colleague Mr Audy, which looks at the importance of rigorously implementing customs procedures for the proper functioning of the internal market."
"Sadly, our market is more and more distorted by illegal imports of goods from third countries."
"This concerns not just smuggling, counterfeiting and evading customs duties: our market is also flooded with goods that do not meet the European safety standards, although many of them bear the compliance mark."
"Unfortunately, customs authorities do not have enough resources to carry out sufficient border controls."
"Our committee was able to witness in Antwerp how only one half of one percent of containers are checked each day."
"All of this undermines trust in the internal market and hurts consumers as well as European producers who cannot cope with such unfair competition on their own."
"Although our customs union has been around for 40 years, the Member States still do not apply customs regulations in a sufficiently uniform manner."
"For example, there are significant differences in the rules on tariff classification, value and origin - preferential and non-preferential - of goods."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the situation would benefit from greater harmonisation."
"The Commission should also respond to the justified objections with regard to the uniform application of the value-added criterion, such as the objections raised by the textiles industry. Overly strict and complex customs regulations impede access to international trade for small and medium-sized enterprises in particular."
"It is obvious that European competitiveness would benefit from simplification, modernisation and harmonisation of the rules and procedures with regard to the import and export of goods."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Audy on the top quality report he has produced, both in terms of the ideas contained therein and the proposals it makes."
"In actual fact, customs, as the report explicitly says, are a multifunctional tool nowadays."
"They play a fiscal role, their original role, but they also play an economic role and an ever increasing role in terms of protecting the security of European businesses and European consumers."
"From an economic point of view, they naturally have to facilitate international trade and the European Union has every interest in seeing this happen."
"Yet they also have to focus on their security role, in terms of thwarting and fighting against counterfeiting and piracy, combating situations of totally unfair competition that undermine some European businesses, especially in weaker sectors and in terms of protecting the environment and public health, which are assets that our communities are increasingly coming to appreciate."
"This is why we need to make more headway."
"The proposal outlined by the rapporteur is, in our view, a good one, as it follows the line of promoting harmonisation of the customs system."
"We have a community trade policy and a community customs policy, but we then have a series of national administrations that do not always work together in the most appropriate way."
"To ensure that the interests of European producers and consumers are protected, it would be advantageous if we could progress more quickly towards harmonisation."
"Progress through new practices, establishing better coordination and creating conditions for the effective harmonisation of customs administration at Community level."
"We shall therefore be doing European citizens a good service, both from the viewpoint of producers and consumers."
"There is also an issue that I believe to be very important and that relates to small and medium-sized enterprises, and that is also addressed in the report and was tackled by the previous speaker."
"Our small and medium-sized enterprises are particularly vulnerable in situations where we fall prey to unfair competition and our customs system is not always ready to deal successfully with such risks."
"We therefore need to invest heavily in this and improve coordination with small and medium-sized enterprises themselves."
"They are not always experts on the rules and procedures, and are therefore at a disadvantage in terms of their ability to access international trade."
"I shall end as I began, by congratulating the author of this report, that I believe has done Europe a service in this specific and very important field of the customs system."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, in taking the floor on behalf of the UEN Group in this debate, I wish to draw attention to three matters."
"Firstly, many countries involved in international trade facilitation, even those that are WTO members, fail to observe social and environmental standards, which leads to a marked diminution in their manufacturing costs, while at the same time ruling out fair competition."
"Improving access to the European market for goods originating from such countries must take this aspect into account, otherwise many spheres of manufacturing in Europe will be routinely eliminated."
"Secondly, the increasing openness of the European market for goods of agricultural origin from third countries in exchange for opening up these countries for exports of European industrial goods and services is in fact a realisation of Commissioner Mandelson's idea that the European Union must make concessions to other countries as part of WTO negotiations, because the European Union earns more from exports of industrial goods than it disburses on its weak defence of agriculture, but unfortunately this means a continuation of the weakening of Europe's agricultural potential."
"Thirdly and finally, the European Commission must respond a lot more promptly than hitherto to breaches by third country exporters of agreements on access to the European market, and if exports originating from such countries suppress European production, the Commission must act without delay and not only after many months have elapsed."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, it is like customs night here tonight, with Mr Markov's report on the GSP and Mr Audy's report on non-tariff barriers, in other words these import and export rules and procedures which we call administrative protectionism, or self-righteous customs barriers."
"Although the WTO talks a great deal about reducing GATT tariffs, we also have subtle protectionism in the form of quotas, peak tariffs - Europe has more than 110 peak tariffs; Canada, admittedly, has 430 - and graduated import duties that prevent small countries from becoming industrialised, not to mention a list of sensitive products and a GSP which is conditional on respect for human rights and the subjective state of play of customs rules of origin, value or tariff lines."
"Europe has more than 5 000 tariff lines."
"In agriculture alone, we have 2 726 tariff lines."
"Japan, admittedly, has 1 890 and the USA has 1 779, so what do we do with goods when it comes to tariff lines?"
"For example, how do we classify a mummy that arrives here from Egypt for an exhibition?"
"We classify it as dried fish!"
"Mr Audy's report covers all of these problems and recognises that the US has returned to customs McCarthyism with a security/insecurity witch-hunt."
"The era of the pacifist approach of Pope John Paul II, with his famous 1978 homily ('Open the borders of states, political and economic systems, wide expanses of civilisations and cultures to His grace."
"Do not be afraid!'), is over, hence the Doha Round, which is still ongoing 10 years after it was started, whereas the Uruguay Round, if I may be so bold as to say, only took 8 years."
"What is the root of this problem?"
"The problem stems from the fact that customs duties are 2 000 years old and date back to ancient Rome, to Rome tolls."
"However, this is the 21st century, and as such, Commissioner, we need new customs technology."
"Fortunately this new customs technology has been invented by scientists and involves deductible customs duties that can be adapted according to the production cost differential, that are refundable, that can be traded on an exchange and that can be modified to help developing countries."
"This, Commissioner, is what you should lay on the WTO negotiating table - this new customs technology - so that we can abolish our archaic customs system."
"(BG) Mme President, Commissioner, Colleagues, We are discussing an extremely important report today."
"The effective trade policy is an instrument for achieving regional or broader integration."
"Imports and exports, against the backdrop of reliable rules and procedures, enable us to protect the European internal economic space."
"The spirit of the report is objective and critical, yet constructive."
"It focuses on several theses, i.e. the bilateral, regional and multilateral mutual benefit, the common regional prospects, the enhanced competitiveness of the European Union through market-based instruments to prevent the ousting of European products from the market."
"Trade determines a large portion of the economic growth of some countries."
"In this sense, import and export rules are of paramount importance."
"Their implementation and control are of special significance, particularly for some new Member States like Bulgaria, where higher export levels determine the existence of trade deficit."
"In this case, the access to third markets becomes crucial."
"The difficult entry of goods from the new countries into external markets, even when these products fully meet all requirements, generates conditions for unequal treatment."
"Therefore what we need is full consistency of the legislation and its implementing regulations."
"The work of the national customs authorities is essential for the proper functioning of an efficient trade system, especially in the context of their enhanced mission to combat forgeries and fraud, and to protect intellectual property rights and consumers."
"National costoms authorities need to collaborate in a well organised manner."
"It is equally important to undertake measures for proper motivation of customs authorities within the framework of the administraive solutions of each Member State, as well as for protection and support of the mission of customs authorities."
"It is possible to consider the establishment of specialised centres in countries of key importance for the trade with third countries or regions respectively. This would be useful with a view to promoting the effective trade policy of the European Union."
"(CS) Madam President, there is one issue that has not been debated so far."
"I want to ask the Commissioner what steps the European Union has taken to date with regard to the regulations applied by the US."
"What, in his opinion, are the best ways of coordinating trade procedures within the framework of transatlantic relations and, basically, can he see any possibility of achieving a good balance between security measures and the need for a more flexible economic relationship between Europe and the US?"
"I am referring to the requirements concerning containers, which are also mentioned in the report by my colleague Mr Audy."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would firstly like to thank you for your interest and contribution to the improvement of our legislation and practice in the customs area."
"I want to emphasise that the two legal documents - the modernised Customs Code and the e-Customs Decision - will make the functioning of the European Union's customs services better, faster and even cheaper."
"I am, of course, at the disposal of Parliament to keep you informed of the main developments in the field of customs legislation and its implementation."
"On 1 April the Commission adopted a new communication on a strategy for the evolution of the Customs Union, which was supported by a resolution of the Council."
"The future customs initiative resulting from this communication will support customs in providing an appropriate and balanced response to the double challenge that they face - on the one hand ensuring the safety and security control of goods at the external borders and, on the other hand, facilitating trade."
"To this end, the initiative envisages moving from the current transaction-based approach of customs formalities and controls to a system-based approach, focusing on the internal control systems and supply chain of the economic operators."
"Such a new approach implies new working and control methods and a future customs risk management strategy."
"It will also offer a platform for working with the Member States on the most appropriate operational structures to be put in place in the future for an efficient functioning of the customs union."
"Regarding Mrs Roithová's question about the US Congress's hundred percent scanning initiative: even before it was adopted by the Congress we had made a number of efforts to change the proposal, but failed to do so."
"The US Administration showed a great deal of understanding because they also realised that the introduction of such measures would be a unilateral step and so would be contrary to our bilateral and multilateral approach."
"The US Administration understood that it would certainly not increase security but, on the contrary, would generate a false sense of security, which would divert resources and attention from the real security measures."
"Our concept is the future recognition of security standards, of security controls, the result of security controls and also the mutual recognition of the customs trade partnership: the CT Pact on the US side and the authorised economic operator on the EU side."
"I mention this because there was some reference, in connection with SMEs, to the fact that this authorised economic operator is a very good system for making life better and easier for small and medium-sized companies."
"We quite recently provided information for the US Administration when, in April, we presented a report to Michael Chertoff and to the Customs and Border Protection of the US in which we explained what kind of difficulties we expect from the introduction of hundred percent scanning: the disruption of trade, the disturbances in maritime traffic and also in bilateral trade relations."
"Just to give you one figure: in one single year the US receives more than ten million sea containers."
"We send some two million containers from the EU, and this system, if introduced, would cover more than 700 ports all over the world, so you can imagine what kind of problems it will cause."
"We hope that, step by step, not only the US Administration but also the legislators will come to understand that it will certainly not increase security, but will create very serious problems in bilateral and multilateral trade."
"Finally, as emphasised in the report, 2008 is the year of the 40th anniversary of the Customs Union."
"It will also be the year of a new start for the Community and the Member States in that field."
"Madam President, Commissioner Kovǎcs, thank you for your answers."
"I would like to extend our thanks to the Commission staff that I have worked with, as well as members of the Committee on International Trade, such as Mr Musquar, and rapporteurs from the political groups, such as Mr Assis."
"I am also happy to see his colleague Mrs Lyubcheva here today, as we recently worked together on another matter."
"You were right, Mrs Roithová, to draw attention to the problem of 100% scanning, and thank you, Commissioner, for the resolve you have shown in defending us."
"It is not the first time that the EU has come under attack from the United States on these issues, since we also had to defend our customs system in a case brought before the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB), which we won, partly down to the efforts of your staff, Commissioner."
"You were right to defend us."
"Mr Martinez has explained his theory on inverted tariffs to us."
"He also explained this to me back in December 2005, when we were in Hong Kong together."
"I still do not understand them, but I live in hope that one day I will be able to see how these inverted tariffs apply to mummies and dried fish."
"I would like to thank all of the political groups for the support they have shown for this report."
"I believe that people can now see that the world, which is becoming more complicated and fast-paced, would in the past have resolved conflict by a military war. Today, we have an economic and social war, rather than a military war."
"Instead of deaths, we have unemployment. In any case, we no longer really know who the enemy is."
"It is in this climate of a worldwide economic and social war that we need to have a strong customs union and import and export mechanisms that protect - and I am talking about protection, not protectionism - our businesses, citizens and the European Union in general."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Forced prostitution and trafficking in women for the purpose of sexual exploitation (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question - B6-0160/2008) to the Commission by Anna Záborská, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on forced prostitution and trafficking in women for the purpose of sexual exploitation."
"Madam President, Commissioner, with these oral questions, this Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality would once again like to request that attention be given to the huge problem regarding trafficking in women and forced prostitution in the European Union."
"Exact figures do not exist but, according to rough estimates, hundreds of thousands of women and girls are trafficked each year by criminal gangs, subsequently ending up in forced prostitution in our Member States."
"This is a degrading issue and, unfortunately, the approach of the European Union and Member States is having barely any effect."
"It is a well-known fact that large-scale events, such as major football championships, draw in criminal gangs involved in these degrading practices, and it is for this reason that the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality launched a campaign on International Women's Day, 8 March 2006, to draw the public's attention to the need to prevent and combat trafficking in women and forced prostitution during the 2006 football World Cup."
"This 'Red Card to Forced Prostitution' campaign was a huge success in raising awareness not only among audiences, supporters, but also in society that trafficking in women and forced prostitution must be actively combated."
"Nevertheless, the results of the approach of the European Commission and the majority of Member States are unfortunately still disappointing."
"We should therefore like to raise this issue once again, and make it clear to audiences and to society during Euro 2008 this month that this type of violence against women and girls is unacceptable."
"In 2005 the Commission and the Council adopted a detailed action plan on the exchange of best practices, standards and procedures for combating and preventing trafficking in women."
"It is important that Member States do implement this action plan."
"One of our questions also focuses upon this."
"After all, a coordinated policy is required in related areas, such as gender-specific prevention strategies, including in the countries these women and girls come from, and also awareness-raising measures and an evaluation of their effectiveness."
"Can the Commission therefore answer the following questions?"
"Has the action plan been implemented regarding trafficking in women for the purpose of sexual exploitation, what is the result and how effective has it been?"
"What specific measures have been reported by Member States in order to combat trafficking in human beings for sexual exploitation?"
"To what extent have Member States correctly transposed and implemented Directive 2004/81/EC, and what actions has the Commission taken if this was not the case?"
"Is the study on the links between the legislation on prostitution and the extent of trafficking in women and girls for the purpose of sexual exploitation, requested by the European Parliament Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality since January 2006, now available?"
"Can the Commission indicate if and how it intends to encourage Member States to build on and further develop cross-border police cooperation in the field of the fight against trafficking in human beings and forced prostitution?"
"How can the Commission support the Committee's 'Red Card to Forced Prostitution' campaign?"
"Is the competent Commissioner also prepared to send a letter to the governments of Austria and Switzerland to call upon them to combat trafficking in women and forced prostitution during the coming Euro 2008 football championship and to support our 'Red Card' campaign?"
"Madam President, it is general knowledge that major football championships are a source of great pleasure and fun for audiences and supporters, but this is nevertheless a problem that constitutes a dark side to the events, to which attention must be devoted, and not just in terms of words; after all, to quote a well-known Dutch football song: 'geen woorden maar daden' [actions speak louder than words]."
"I hope that the Commissioner also wants to support this."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, although the issue does not fall within in my portfolio, I feel privileged to substitute for my good friend and colleague Jacques Barrot, and to participate in this debate, because I am convinced that this is a very important issue."
"I wish to assure you that the Commission is wholeheartedly committed to the fight against trafficking in human beings as a brutal violation of human rights and as a very serious criminal offence, and is in particular committed to fighting forced prostitution."
"Concerning the very relevant questions, which cover the whole complex issue, I will start with Question No 1."
"The 2005 EU action plan on best practices, standards and procedures launched by the Council contains a very ambitious array of measures to fight trafficking in human beings."
"On the basis of the information submitted by the Member States, our impression is that, although some results have been achieved, the situation remains unsatisfactory concerning both criminal proceedings and assistance to victims, which is of particular importance."
"The Commission will be delivering a report on its implementation by the end of this year."
"This stocktaking exercise could form the basis for deciding what actions to pursue in the near future, and in what form."
"Question No 2: the protection of victims of trafficking is a human rights duty."
"Furthermore, it is an essential condition for the successful prosecution of traffickers, as victims' testimony is vital to getting convictions."
"Directive 2004/81/EC follows that line by providing for the granting of a reflection period allowing the victim to recover and escape the influence of traffickers, and granting a residence permit."
"All Member States bound by the above Directive have officially notified full transposition of the legal instrument to the Commission, with the exception of Spain and Luxembourg."
"The Commission has decided to refer those two Member States to the European Court of Justice."
"As regards the analysis of its substantial transposition and implementation, in January 2007 the Commission launched a study to evaluate the transposition into national law of 10 directives in the field of asylum and immigration, including this Directive."
"The final findings of that study, which will soon be made available to the Commission, will provide the basis for a systematic monitoring of the existing acquis in this area, in accordance with Article 226 of the EC Treaty."
"Question No 3: the Commission has also launched a study to evaluate Member States' legislation and the situation concerning trafficking in human beings."
"The results of the study are expected to be delivered by the end of February 2009."
"Question No 4: forced prostitution and trafficking in human beings are a violation of fundamental rights and are one type of organised crime."
"Efforts to combat criminal networks must necessarily be transnational."
"Cross-border cooperation between Member States' police forces has a privileged channel in Europol."
"In addition, the fight against trafficking in human beings is a priority area in the financial programme 'Prevention of and Fight against Crime', which supports transnational cooperation projects involving law enforcement authorities, as well as NGOs."
"Finally, to Question No 5."
"The campaign 'Red Card to Forced Prostitution', launched for the 2006 Football World Cup, was a good step towards raising awareness about trafficking in human beings for sexual exploitation."
"Although the assessment carried out by Germany shows that the fear of an increase in forced prostitution and trafficking did not materialise in 2006, we welcome all initiatives aimed at informing public opinion, raising public awareness, preventing such heinous criminal phenomena and helping victims."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this coming Saturday the European Football Championship starts in Austria and Switzerland."
"This is the second-largest sporting event after the World Cup."
"It has been found that some 2.5 million sports fans from across Europe will attend the matches."
"It has also been reported, however, that as happens at such major events, a large number of women, estimated at 25 000, will travel from around the world to the cities where the matches are to be played, unfortunately not merely to support their teams, but because they are being forced into prostitution."
"I am sure that the international community, and particularly the EU and the European Parliament, cannot be unmoved by this."
"Madam President, Commissioner, as we have heard, the intervention by the European Parliament in 2006 in the similar case of the World Cup in Germany produced positive results."
"At the time, the number of women reported to have been forced into prostitution was between 40 000 and 60 000."
"It would therefore be worthwhile for us to take action again, as we did back in 2006 as a result of the oral question by Mrs Wortmann-Kool."
"I propose that the President of the European Parliament and the relevant Commissioner should send a letter, like the letter Mr Frattini sent to Angela Merkel in 2006."
"It should be addressed both to the organising committee and to UEFA, spelling out our concern over the danger threatening to transform a sporting event into uncontrolled entertainment with women as its victims."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that if we are united and draw attention to what we are saying, we will avert dangers which do neither us nor society any credit, but rather allow the exploitation of human suffering."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, a few days before the European Football Championship gets under way, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality - and I hope the entire European Parliament - is showing forced prostitution the red card once again."
"Up to 800 000 women throughout the world become victims of human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation every year."
"This is one of the worst human rights violations today and even at major sporting events, quick sex around the venues of football matches is also linked to this modern-day slavery."
"Two years ago at the football World Cup in Germany, we initiated a wide-ranging debate here in Parliament and launched a campaign to ensure that the huge wave of forced prostitution the experts initially feared and the corresponding negative spin-offs were able to be prevented thanks to the support of the fans through the opinioned public."
"However, the subject then disappeared from sight again."
"We have introduced legal initiatives and, with the experience we have gained from the German campaign, supported very extensively by the women's organisations, have managed to set up victim protection measures and demonstrate the plight of the women who usually come from Central and Eastern Europe."
"They are in dire straits as criminals on the one hand, since they do not have any residence permits, but as victims, on the other hand, because they are mercilessly exploited by the human traffickers."
"We have moved on a step further with the victim protection measures, cross-border cooperation and the legitimate issuing of residence permits."
"We now want to use the public at matches in Austria and Switzerland to highlight the subject again."
"In Germany the Socialist Minister of Justice has announced draconian penalties for punters of forced prostitution."
"There are still, however, many loopholes, and Parliament has to ensure that these loopholes are closed."
"I would ask the Commission to support us in this."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (ET) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there seems to be a symbolic significance to our discussing light-sensitive issues on a dark night."
"Each year hundreds of thousands of women are abused in the European sex industry."
"It is a rapidly growing industry bringing together new technology, criminality, narcotic drugs and big money, although its nature can be summed up in a single word: violence."
"It is common knowledge that most women are lured into the sex trade because of poor social circumstances, chiefly poverty and unemployment."
"Most prostitutes are from precisely those areas where unemployment is higher, which, where the European Union is concerned, means the poorer East European countries."
"This shows that the European Union and Member States individually must act primarily to improve the vocational skills of women in at-risk groups and use active labour market measures in their regard."
"There is no doubt that campaigns to raise awareness of the issue of prostitution, such as the 'Red Card to Forced Prostitution', are important and that for a certain period they affect society's awareness of the issue."
"I find, however, that the objective of forced prostitution and the commercial sexual exploitation of women needs constantly to be at the forefront of society's and the public's focus."
"I find that fairly often, funding preventive measures is more effective and cheaper for the economy than constantly dealing with the consequences of the problem."
"In addition to preventive measures, it is important to increase the effectiveness of police cooperation between the Member States, particularly in the Schengen Area."
"I call on the Commission and the political parties represented here to be resolute and help make prostitution a thing of the past and support a ban on purchasing prostitution services in their home States."
"Freezing demand will also lead to our achieving our ultimate objective."
"Finally, it is also important to stress that there must be a zero-tolerance policy throughout the European Union on prostitution and human trafficking."
"We should start to take decisions and act."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, we know that trafficking in women for the purpose of sexual exploitation has to be outlawed and combated throughout the world."
"It is a scandal not worthy of a Europe of values and human rights."
"We also know that trafficking in women no longer stops at borders."
"We therefore need a European, a global response to the problem, but one that must go far beyond border controls and repression alone."
"In principle it is a positive sign that this topic has been on the agenda for around 10 years, but the focus lies too one-sidedly on border controls; prevention and victim protection are unfortunately neglected too much."
"Nor is any all-clear being given."
"More and more people - girls and women - are becoming victims of sexual exploitation although, as Mrs Gröner has already mentioned, there was no sign of the feared increase at the 2006 World Cup."
"We do know, however, that the estimated number of unreported cases is high."
"There are too few crackdowns against human traffickers and too few proceedings against unscrupulous criminals."
"The European Commission has also confirmed this in response to a question I raised in Parliament."
"We are focussing on better victim protection, not just in Germany, but in Europe."
"In this regard I find it somewhat regrettable that the Commission can apparently find only fine words to say and is not really doing anything to improve matters."
"How the Commission is agitating for the implementation of the Directive on protection of the victims of trafficking in the Member States is not transparent, nor is its implementation being monitored."
"I find it extremely regrettable that the Commission merely points to a study in response to my second question in Parliament on how the Directive on protection of the victims of trafficking is implemented in Germany."
"I would ask the Commission ultimately to take a very firm stand on whether the directive has been properly implemented, not only in Germany, but also in the other EU Member States."
"It cannot therefore be true that the Commission does not know whether its own legislation has been properly implemented!"
"This would be a sign of inadequacy."
"On migration, we should be looking not only at the subsequent migration of family members, but also at the possibilities of how women can migrate legally so that they do not have to place themselves in the hands of human traffickers."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) Madam President, hundreds of thousands of women and children are transported like commodities in the EU."
"They are sexually exploited, ill-treated, threatened, used, and deprived of all human dignity."
"What crime have they committed to be condemned to such an existence?"
"Their crime is in fact poverty and lack of social rights and the fact that there are men who think that their money gives them the right to use women and children as commodities."
"Usually young girls are enticed with false promises of jobs and good money, but then the nightmare begins."
"To the shame of the EU and the Member States this trade is allowed to continue and, indeed, increase."
"No one can fall back on the excuse that 'we knew nothing'."
"We know, but too little is done."
"We must therefore get an answer from the Commission to our questions arising from the 'Red Card to Forced Prostitution' campaign."
"I maintain that the sex slave trade is a form of terrorism."
"The EU and the Member States have been particularly effective in adopting more or less good measures to combat terrorism."
"But this other terrorism which hurts women and children has not been given the same priority, either by the EU or the Member States."
"We also need to realise that more and more men are becoming involved in this tragic trade."
"Men must not only refrain from buying sexual services themselves."
"They must also show other men that it is not OK to buy women's bodies."
"It is up to men to ensure that the demand, hence also the trade in women's bodies, is reduced."
"As long as there is a demand and a market with big financial gains, the trade will continue."
"I repeat: women are not for sale."
"We must put a stop to this."
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the resolution on the future of professional football, which we adopted last year on these same benches, we expressly call on the Council to take measures to combat criminal activities in professional football, such as forced prostitution."
"We literally said this in that text."
"Just to be clear, it is not the fault of the football authorities that these phenomena occur on the margins of major tournaments."
"They are almost characteristic of all large-scale international events."
"However, the sporting world of course has every reason to want this problem tackled efficiently and thoroughly, because of course it makes little sense, ladies and gentlemen, for us to argue for and work towards more fair play in the stadiums and argue against and combat racism in the stations, if in and around the stadiums instances of slavery are tolerated."
"The 'Red Card to Forced Prostitution' campaign worked excellently during the 2006 World Cup in Germany."
"Around 1 000 local and regional action groups and associations were involved in this prevention campaign, and that had a clear deterrent effect upon traffickers in human beings and other criminal networks."
"The result - and the Commissioner has already referred to this - was that forced prostitution during the 2006 World Cup in Germany was limited to just a few tens of cases, and these were generally not directly related to the World Cup."
"It is clear, therefore, that awareness raising and prevention campaigns work."
"They are highly effective and we must therefore use them once again, including during the coming European championship that commences this week."
"Therefore, Commissioner, we urge the European Commission to send a letter in this regard to the relevant governments, those of Austria and Switzerland, as Mrs Wortmann-Kool has just rightly stated."
"I repeat our question."
"Can you comply with our request and confirm here and now that you will support this initiative?"
"I have one further comment to make: prevention alone will not suffice."
"The Member States agreed in 2005 that they would prevent and combat trafficking in human beings but, at national level, the action plan you referred to, Commissioner, is more than ever a dead letter."
"Now is the time, therefore, to remind the authorities of that action plan."
"As much as two years ago, the Commissioner of the time, Mr Frattini, said that the role of Europol and Eurojust in this regard had to be strengthened, and Parliament expressly requested the same in its resolution."
"We therefore also trust, Commissioner, that, in view of this tournament, the Commission and the Council will make greater efforts than ever to put these promises into practice."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, human trafficking, as we have heard, is a crime against humanity, especially against women - a new form of slavery and a highly profitable business, widely developed with an annual turnover of EUR 44 billion according to the OSCE."
"It is worth discussing this at greater length as well as highlighting the various facets."
"We are dealing today with trafficking in women and forced prostitution following the campaign we conducted at the 2006 World Cup in Germany."
"There was also a report here in Parliament, which I was able to draw up, which dealt with forced prostitution and in which we requested various measures from the Commission."
"The response was the action plan."
"The question on implementation has already been asked repeatedly today and I should like to emphasise that it concerns residence permits for victims and training offensives at police training colleges, institutes for social studies and the like. It also concerns education in the countries of origin and educational and training opportunities for women locally as well as for young men."
"They, too, are increasingly affected."
"Obviously 18 October is EU Anti-Trafficking Day, which we were able to hold for the first time last year."
"In other respects I still cannot see much sign of the campaign."
"Regard for this subject has also declined since the Red Card campaign and the World Cup. We therefore want to give it another boost."
"This is not about the ban on prostitution or discrimination against sex workers."
"On the contrary!"
"It is about raising awareness and also seeking here to reject stigmatisation and building up a social network in order to protect sex workers in their trade as well."
"Conviction of forced prostitution is vehement. The European Football Championship in Austria and Switzerland gives us the opportunity to draw attention to this."
"I can guarantee that the Austrian authorities are taking the appropriate measures. They are pleased to invite you to a great European Championship and are hoping for fair play and fair sex."
"(DE) Madam President, many are delighted about the European Football Championship in June 2008."
"We should not forget, however, that aside from the matches, human trafficking, forced prostitution of women and child abuse are on the increase and the crimes committed by traffickers transcend all borders."
"The matches will take place in Austria and Switzerland and the role of neighbouring Central European countries as transit countries is being strengthened for this extremely lucrative criminal trade."
"The EU is being asked here for preventive measures, cross-border monitoring and law enforcement to be better organised and coordinated."
"The European mechanisms for joint investigation must be improved."
"Every Member State is being asked to protect victims more effectively and to actively make use of these instruments."
"This is the only way that we will be able to catch the perpetrators out and show them the red card."
"(PT) It is vital that we take advantage of the Euro 2008 Championships to inform the general public once again that prostitution and the highly lucrative trafficking of women for the purpose of sexual exploitation are unacceptable, as they are forms of violence against women, girls and children."
"For this reason, it is crucial that measures are taken to combat this trafficking effectively and at the same time to support victims of this situation in the various Member States, with information on the results of the actions carried out."
"Yet we should not lose sight of the worsening inequalities, precarious and badly-paid work, unemployment and poverty that draw thousands of women and young girls into prostitution and that make the traffickers' lives easier."
"This therefore raises another question: how will EU leaders act to fight the fundamental causes of these serious breaches of the human rights of hundreds of thousands of women and young people so as to put an end to these new forms of slavery?"
"(NL) Madam President, during the 2006 World Cup, attention was also drawn to a helpline for victims of trafficking in women and forced prostitution."
"In Turkey, for example, a helpline has already been active for some years now, which women can call to report cases of trafficking in women."
"Back in 2006, the European Parliament called for such a helpline to be set up that could speak to victims of human trafficking in several languages and offer assistance."
"Even now, two years later, such a helpline has not been set up."
"Two weeks ago, I attended the launch by Commissioner Kuneva of a helpline for disappointed consumers during Euro 2008."
"What a good initiative it was to set up a single telephone number."
"It can be done, then, but why offer help to consumers and not to victims of trafficking in women?"
"This new consumer line shows how quickly action can be taken and how little effort it can take."
"Now it is time to combine these initiatives and provide the victims of trafficking in women with a means by which to ask for help."
"To use the words of Barack Obama: 'We can do it, yes we can'."
"(SV) Madam President, on Saturday the European football championship kicks off and the party can begin."
"But there is a reverse side to the coin."
"When sporting events of this magnitude take place, illegal trafficking in women and young girls for prostitution always increases."
"It is therefore important for us to react, and act exactly as we did two years ago with the 'Red Card to Forced Prostitution' campaign."
"It is very important that we get together in the EU and work towards zero tolerance as regards trafficking in human beings."
"I therefore appeal to all the EU governments which have not yet done so immediately to implement the action plan which the EU developed in 2005 to combat the sex slave trade."
"I wish that more countries had legislation on buying sex, for it has a clear preventive effect in curbing the sex slave trade."
"In addition, I look forward to the report which the Commission is to present on patterns of prostitution in the Member States, and I hope that we shall soon be able to study it."
"I want the European football championship, both on and off the pitch, to be imbued with the values which are the lifeblood of sport: comradeship, healthy activity and fair play."
"Not to condemn reprehensible trafficking in human beings for prostitution is to give it indirect support."
"Madam President, trafficking may be an illegal market, but is nonetheless a market, having both a supply and a demand side."
"A country where there is significant demand plays an equally active part in trafficking as an origin country."
"Besides being a leftover of slavery in our times, trafficking constitutes continued defiance and infringement of the law and is linked to other criminal practices, such as money laundering, violence, smuggling, prostitution, tax evasion, fraud and forced labour."
"Trafficking produces dangerous reversals within the order of values in our society, preserving old inequalities - women and children are seen as merchandise - and generating new ones."
"The money that traffickers earn undermines the belief in the value of labour and fair business."
"It is necessary for all Member States urgently to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Trafficking and to apply the measures they have agreed, starting with combating the root cause of trafficking for prostitution, which is male demand for women and girls."
"(SK) With the arrival of the UEFA Euro 2008 Championship, starting in Austria and Switzerland this coming Saturday, we are again reminded of the subject of forced prostitution."
"Those who appreciate good football will definitely have a great time."
"Unfortunately, these sporting events also provide fertile ground for mafia activities, and pose a higher than usual risk of increased trafficking in human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation."
"I agree with the other speakers that the so-called 'Red Card to Forced Prostitution' campaign, launched by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in March 2006, was successful because it brought out into the open one of the most burning social issues."
"I am convinced that only a good information campaign during the Euro 2008 Championship about the need to prevent trafficking in women and forced prostitution will open the eyes of the public and expose this horrible type of violence against girls and women."
"(DA) Madam President, I have a direct question for the Commission regarding what specific initiatives have been taken to prevent trafficking in women in connection with the Euro 2008 Championship in Austria and Switzerland."
"After all, we have heard here this evening, and past experience has taught us, that trafficking in women takes place in connection with this kind of major sporting event."
"I have the following questions. Firstly, have the governments of the two countries been approached and asked to support Parliament's 'Red Card to Forced Prostitution' campaign?"
"Secondly, has their attention been drawn to the need to intensify police efforts in connection with the championship? Finally, have the two governments been called on to take action to support the victims?"
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, as many speakers have said - and as I also mentioned - similar initiatives and proposals were tabled and actions were adopted by Parliament and the Commission before the 2006 World Cup organised in Germany."
"Fortunately, the concerns and fears of the German authorities and the European institutions did not materialise."
"But that is certainly not a reason to draw the conclusion that we should not do anything now and that we can sit on our hands."
"It is more than reasonable to have this debate, because it is certainly better to be on the safe side and to be better prepared than necessary; it is also reasonable to make use of this opportunity to take stock of the actions, and to enable Parliament to make suggestions to the Commission, and it is also a good opportunity to raise public awareness."
"I do understand the dissatisfaction of a number of speakers."
"In my introductory remarks I mentioned how many concrete reports the Commission launched and we are expecting the studies and the conclusions which are being drawn up, on which further actions and further action programmes can be based."
"Mrs Bozkurt mentioned the issue of hotlines and I think it is a good idea, though it is not so easy to achieve."
"As far as the other hotline of consumer protection is concerned, it is a very different issue."
"So I do not think that this hotline established or initiated by my fellow Commissioner Mrs Kuneva could be used, for instance, for victim protection, because it is a very different issue."
"It is much more complicated."
"Mrs Breyer also mentioned victim protection which I think is a very important key issue."
"I would like to point out that there will be a specific chapter on victim assistance in the evaluation and monitoring report of the action plan, which will be ready by October or November 2008, and we will assess the real implementation of measures to protect victims."
"On the first EU anti-trafficking day which was on 18 October 2007, GLS issued recommendations on victim identification and referral services."
"I want to assure you that we are determined to ensure appropriate follow-up and I want to assure Members of Parliament that the Commission is ready to intensify the fight against trafficking, against forced prostitution and the organised crime behind it."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 11 a.m."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - As football fans all over Europe await the opening of Euro 2008 it is time to reflect on the dangers to women, especially from the former Soviet Republics, who will be victims of trafficking and subject to the ordeal of forced prostitution in order to meet demand for sexual services at the venues of the football matches."
"What will be a wonderful celebration of the best European sporting traditions for many will also be a time of physical and psychological suffering for those unfortunate young women who, in their naivety, believe that the attractive jobs they are being offered in the hospitality sector will be limited to work as waitresses or behind a bar."
"It is time to reiterate the call for the remaining 17 Member States of the European Union who have so far failed to ratify the European Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings to do so without further delay."
"EU Member States who champion human rights causes can surely offer no excuse for failing to adopt this Convention, which was adopted in Warsaw over three years ago."
"in writing. - Could the Commission clarify to Parliament what progress it has made on the 2005 plan to combat and prevent trafficking of humans in Europe?"
"Concerned by the delay of implementation of this plan by Member States, I ask that the Commission state the impact this could have on the campaign 'Red Card to forced prostitution' in Member States."
"Could it also inform us what campaign it is putting in place to raise awareness of trafficking for prostitution during the UEFA 2008 games?"
"I am deeply concerned that, whilst sporting events bring joy to millions worldwide, they are also ruthlessly being used as an opportunity to exploit women and girls."
"I am shocked that around 100 000 women are trafficked in Europe annually for prostitution."
"What I condemn the most is that girls as young as 14 are affected."
"We simply cannot let this form of modern day slavery continue."
"Not only is sexual exploitation a crime, it is also a gross violation of human rights."
"in writing. - (HU) The Union is responsible for preventing by all possible means the sexual exploitation and people trafficking that emerge at sporting events organised on its territory."
"The 2008 European football championship is a sporting event that brings together a significant number of people, during which there is a temporary rise in demand for sexual services."
"It is therefore of fundamental importance that we protect ourselves using temporary campaigns such as those initiated by Mrs Záborská during the 2006 football World Cup, which also deserve to be continued this time."
"However, in order for the initiative to reach as many people as possible, I feel that there needs to be more widespread publicity in the media (including on the official website for the European Championship), with the participation of politicians, sports directors, sportsmen and supporters (modelled on the 'Youth Voices Against Racism' programme)."
"However, a temporary campaign is not enough in itself."
"In order to take decisive action against people trafficking, directives need to be created, but above all it is necessary to comply with those that already exist, as soon as possible."
"I would like to draw the Commission's attention to the fact that many countries are suffering from shortcomings in transposing and interpreting Directives, and so their implementation is being delayed ever further."
"For this reason, I feel it is particularly important that we receive an accurate answer to Mrs Záborská's question relating to Directive 2004/81/EC."
"Even if border controls play an important role in filtering out sexual exploitation and people trafficking from sporting events that take place in the Union, I feel that we can achieve this not by making internal border controls more stringent but by reinforcing external controls in appropriate cooperation with border guards."
"In this way, we will not make it more difficult for law-abiding citizens to participate in European events!"
"in writing. - (HU) Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to follow Mrs Záborská's question by again drawing your attention to the defencelessness of Roma women in the areas of people trafficking and forced prostitution."
"Social exclusion and, frequently, a lack of official documents make Roma girls particularly vulnerable and 'easy targets' for those who profit from people trafficking."
"Their situation is exacerbated by the racial prejudice they face from the whole of society, the sexual prejudice that appears in their own communities, and the general mistrust that the Roma have of the justice system."
"Individual programmes are needed to help those who have become victims of people trafficking, and their families, and to prevent adolescent girls from being forced to live and work in an exploitative environment."
"The creation of more advisory networks and centres is essential, both on the part of NGOs and of Member States, as well as the gathering and analysis of reliable statistical data on the relationship between Roma communities and people trafficking."
"In this latter area, some NGOs and international organisations can demonstrate some results, but a greater role also needs to be assumed by the European Commission and the Member States."
"However, the main breeding ground for people trafficking and sexual exploitation is the poverty that reduces human life into an everyday struggle for survival, in which the danger of illegal activities grows significantly in the absence of financial and educational opportunities."
"For this reason, in addition to programmes to raise awareness and helping those who have already become victims, putting an end to inhuman poverty is our primary common duty."

"° °"
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the ECURIE System - the European Community security system - was triggered yesterday following an undefined incident in a Slovenian nuclear power station."
"The alert was subsequently called off, but doubts persist as to the true nature of the incident and the reasons for this highly unusual alert."
"We therefore wish to make the most of the fact that the Commission will be present later on today, and that Slovenia holds the presidency, to call upon the presidency and the Commission to inform the European Parliament, and hence the public, of the real reasons why this utterly abnormal procedure occurred."
"I should be grateful, Madam President, if you would act on this request."
"I think that the Slovenian Presidency, which will be here today, will come back to this request."
"The Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think I should speak French today, so that is what I will do."
"I would like to begin by thanking the European Parliament for having included this item on our relations with our Mediterranean partners in this sitting's agenda."
"That has given rise to a debate on a subject that is vitally important for Europe and I would especially like to congratulate the European Parliament on its role in recent years because its interest in the Mediterranean has never waned."
"The Barcelona Process has enabled us to tackle numerous regional issues of strategic importance and, naturally, a number of political issues."
"I believe that we have achieved a great deal, although many common challenges remain, including security, environmental protection, ensuring sustainable energy supply, combating organised crime, controlling migratory flows and intercultural dialogue."
"In addition to this cooperation with our Mediterranean neighbours, I would like us to strengthen our understanding of one another and our interests, respect as well as mutual trust."
"In March the European Council invited the Commission to redefine the modalities of the 'Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean' and on 20 May the Commission adopted a communication underlining the central role of the Mediterranean, its historical and contemporary importance, and the considerable challenges of our common future."
"However, I should point out that we still have the European Neighbourhood Policy of course, which is a bilateral policy while the other is a regional policy."
"We also need to take account of the fact that the existing action plans effectively implement the decisions taken by the various sectoral ministerial meetings."
"When we think about the Mediterranean, we think about the cradle of the three monotheistic religions, the melting pots of civilisation and culture, migration and trade."
"We think about the history of the Mediterranean, a history that is inseparable from the history of Europe."
"The Mediterranean Basin is effectively the bridge between the North and the South, the East and the West, and, situated at the point where three continents converge, it is more than just a border for the European Union."
"Stability in that region is crucial for our security and our prosperity, not to mention the security and prosperity of our Mediterranean neighbours and friends."
"It is only through determined and realistic political action, combined with a strong and tireless commitment and constructive dialogue, that we will be able to tackle these challenges together."
"The Commission has always called for a stronger, more open and more constructive relationship with our Mediterranean partners, and we are putting forward concrete proposals to achieve this."
"Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to outline for you today the main observations and proposals in the communication that I presented to the Commission."
"The Barcelona Process has unfortunately suffered as a result of the ongoing conflicts in the Southern Mediterranean and, at times, from the lack of cooperation between the various partners."
"A positive change is taking place, however, and I saw this myself during my recent visits to the region."
"The time has come to take advantage of a renewed political will to breathe new life into our cooperation to ensure that it is more balanced and more in tune with our fellow citizens."
"In our opinion, there are three key objectives."
"The first is to upgrade the political level of the European Union's relationship with its Mediterranean partners; the second is to provide more co-ownership to our multilateral relations; and the third is to make these relations more concrete and more visible through additional regional and sub-regional projects, relevant for the people of the region."
"These measures would bring great added value."
"Naturally, private funds will come into play: hitherto only the Community sector has been involved, so the private sector will now play a role."
"We will of course have to see whether this really works, but that is the idea in any case."
"It is therefore essential to upgrade the level of our relations."
"The Commission proposes organising biennial summits of the heads of state or government."
"It would be difficult to understand why we hold regular summits with our major partners throughout the world without having a forum for talks between the EU heads of state and our Mediterranean neighbours and friends."
"In addition, the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly has reaffirmed itself as the parliamentary dimension of the Barcelona Process."
"It provides a framework of debate, open dialogue and free exchange of views."
"It gives impetus to the partnership by adopting resolutions and recommendations, and it will be the legitimate parliamentary representation of the Union for the Mediterranean."
"The Commission unreservedly supports the strengthening of the role of the Parliamentary Assembly in relations with the Mediterranean partners."
"Increased co-ownership is also essential."
"Over the past few years, one important shared belief was that the agenda of the Barcelona Process was influenced by the fact that the EU presidency also held the presidency of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership."
"Three proposals have received the general support of the partners: the establishment of a co-presidency, with one co-president from a Southern country and one from a Northern country; the establishment of a Joint Permanent Committee, based in Brussels and responsible for governance; and the establishment of a secretariat responsible for the promotion of the projects."
"Finally, as Robert Schuman said, we must set up concrete projects 'which first create a de facto solidarity'."
"It is the quality of the projects that we carry out together that will guarantee the success of the initiative."
"That is what enables the citizens to feel the force of the links that unite both shores of the Mediterranean."
"The projects must add structure to the region and provide for the participation of non-State actors, civil society and businesses."
"Europe must act as a lever for private capital, an intermediary."
"The Commission is provisionally proposing the promotion of coastal motorways, the linking-up of the trans-Maghreb Motorway, solar energy and de-pollution of the Mediterranean."
"Of course, this list is non exhaustive and other projects will follow."
"In conclusion, Madam President, I would like to emphasise one point that, in my view, is crucial."
"This renewed cooperation with our partners in the South must in no way detract from our solid links and policies with our neighbours to the East."
"On the contrary, in addition to our efforts to strengthen the individual links with our friends in the East, the Commission is enhancing regional cooperation with its 'Black Sea Synergy' initiative."
"We will soon publish the annual report to celebrate the first anniversary of its launch and at that stage we will be able to discuss the recent Polish and Swedish initiative."
"Through these efforts, in the East and in the South, we will be able to stick to our goal: enhancing our relations through flexible cooperation instruments focusing on the priorities of our partners."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Paris summit is a real opportunity to bring a new dimension to our relations with our Mediterranean partners."
"Although we cannot ignore the lessons of the past, we must not remain a prisoner of them."
"The 'Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean' initiative is going to launch a new era in our relations with our Southern neighbours, a new partnership, based on successful elements of the Barcelona Process, with a view to moving forward together to achieve our common objectives of peace, democracy and prosperity."
"Excuse me, Madam President, if I have spoken for too long, but I believe that this is a crucial subject, for me and for us all."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my Group awaited today's statement by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner with great interest."
"I should like to thank her again and say that the Commission's communication, adopted on 20 May, made very interesting reading."
"We applaud President Sarkozy for having started the ball rolling, for having aroused the interest of the European Council and for having prompted a renewal of our Mediterranean policy, which my Group supports and hopes will prove tangible and rapid."
"We know how difficult it is to pursue the ambitious goals of the Barcelona Process."
"On the one hand there is the unresolved Middle East conflict and tension in the Western Sahara."
"There is also the gap that sometimes separates us from the democratic, economic and social models of our partner countries, hampering attainment of the goals we have set ourselves."
"All of this is serious and makes matters difficult, but should not constitute a pretext to justify delays or changes of mind."
"We believe that President Sarkozy's political initiative and the backing provided by the European Commission go in the right direction, namely that of lending substance and reality to our political aspirations."
"To this end the Commission has identified four projects, recalled by our Commissioner this morning, in addition to the activities already planned: motorways of the seas, depollution of the Mediterranean, environmental management, civil protection cooperation to tackle natural disasters and, lastly, a solar energy programme for the Mediterranean."
"Each of these projects is important, and rather than dwelling on them now we shall do so once the Commission has provided more details."
"These are projects which, if carried out, will act as an incredibly important driving force, both to give the Barcelona Process a new lease of life and to complement measures already under way but not yet completed."
"I would recall the free trade area planned for 2010: we should like to know more about this, Commissioner, as well as about the state of play on the objectives set out in the association agreements and other ongoing projects."
"To conclude, as concerns tangible projects to be completed within a reasonable time frame, I would also recall that, as well as the infrastructure of the seas and the North-South link, fresh impetus is also needed for a South-South motorway corridor connecting the countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean; this system must in addition be interconnected with Europe."
"Lastly, there needs to be a loan scheme providing help on issues such as water and infrastructure in the Middle East."
"Finally, I wish to draw the attention of the Council and the Commission to two issues."
"The first concerns the administration and operation of the Euro-Mediterranean Assembly."
"The European Union has also made major commitments in the Middle East, and we expect these commitments to be followed up with political action."
"Can the Council tell us what real, practical prospects there are of such action?"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not agree with Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner that it is appropriate to speak French this morning."
"(FR) Along with my mother tongue, it is my favourite language, Commissioner, but I think that this morning in particular it is inappropriate to speak in French because President Sarkozy's mistake from the outset was to give the impression that the Union for the Mediterranean was a Franco-French idea."
"However, he has since become more reasonable, and that is why he must be congratulated, Mr Bonsigniore."
"(DE) May I also remind you that when Mr Sarkozy came to the House right at the beginning, in order to introduce the idea of the Mediterranean Union to the Conference of Presidents for the first time, I asked him: 'Can you tell me which role the Federal Republic of Germany should play in your Mediterranean Union?', and he answered: 'Le statut d'un observateur'."
"We have moved on in the meantime and have clarified these issues."
"That is why the approach that you have described, Commissioner, is the right one."
"I am firmly convinced that there are three central challenges that we have to deal with in the framework of the Mediterranean Union."
"First of all, I think social stability is the precondition for peace, but nowhere in the North or the South is social stability at greater risk than in the Mediterranean region."
"Nowhere else is the direct clash between immense wealth, on the one hand, and immense poverty, on the other, greater or more visible - indeed, tangible - than in the Mediterranean region, and nowhere are the confrontation and the ensuing tensions for us Europeans greater than in the Mediterranean."
"That being the case, the Mediterranean Union is a project which could lead to more peace and stability via the economic integration of our two regions, so it is an extremely good idea, and it is one which we Socialists therefore fully endorse."
"Secondly, what makes this an even more appealing concept is that it makes multilateralism the basis of cooperation, not only within the framework of the Mediterranean Union but also as a project of regional cooperation, which cannot act as a model for the world but could give rise to joint initiatives which could contribute to greater stability on a global level as well."
"The third point which is so important for us Socialists is that we have managed to avoid creating any parallel processes."
"The Barcelona Process - for which, incidentally, a sum of around EUR 15.5 billion is made available in the financial perspective to 2013 - was, after all, also launched for the reasons which I have just outlined and which formed the political basis for the Mediterranean Union. Through the Mediterranean Union, the Barcelona Process is now being taken to another level."
"It is being strengthened and stepped up, but without any new institutions being created outside the existing EU institutions. That being the case, the Commission's role and also our role as Parliament - and, incidentally, the role of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly as well - is a special role."
"In political, institutional and economic terms, and in terms of the practical objectives set, we are now on the right track with the Mediterranean Union."
"I think that gives cause for celebration on 14 July in Paris as well."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, with his proposals for a Mediterranean Union, President Sarkozy recognised what many knew yet would not admit: that the Barcelona Process - top-down and driven by European interests - was dead in the water, leading our southern partners to opt out and a widening prosperity gap to emerge on either side of the Mediterranean."
"If Europe is serious about reversing the failures of the last decade and generating development and security on its southern shores we must now learn to give as well as take."
"We must build on the ashes of the Barcelona Process - a true partnership based on trust, reciprocity and, above all, mutual respect."
"The Mediterranean must not be a cultural dividing line but a meeting place."
"Joint investment in infrastructure - such as ports, sea links and energy grids - will bring our peoples together far more effectively than the high-sounding declarations which characterised the Barcelona Process."
"We need investment in people too."
"The kind of energy which brought together the French and Germans after the last big war must be invested in bringing Europeans and North Africans together to prevent the next."
"The worst possible mistake the French Presidency could make is to commit the European Union - and by extension its citizens - to a grandiose project without providing finance for such cooperation for a number of years down the line."
"And, as Mr Schulz said, creating a full-blown bureaucratic structure alongside the standing delegations and the External Action Service need not be the way; a focus on values must be."
"Despite the worsening situation, particularly in Egypt and Israel, and the fact that we claim such values as the basis of EU foreign policy, references to human rights are mysteriously hard to find in the Commission's proposals."
"I hope this is something the Commission will look at."
"But, these objections aside, Liberals and Democrats are pleased to show support for this Union for the Mediterranean, with one important caveat: pragmatic cooperation on economic issues must not be a substitute for promoting peace in the Middle East through the common foreign and security policy envisaged in the Lisbon Treaty."
"Since the Commissioner recognises the link between economic development and peace, what would be a better sign of peace and goodwill towards our Arab neighbours than abolishing agricultural tariffs?"
"Our much-vaunted free trade agreements have failed to boost living standards because they excluded agriculture and services, which account for two thirds of the GDP in the Middle East and North Africa."
"If we do not take the produce of these countries, we will end up taking their people."
"Reforming the CAP, providing a level playing field for goods from the Southern Mediterranean, would go a long way towards tackling the causes of record migration into Europe."
"As the inimitable Doctor Johnson once said 'Life cannot subsist ... but by reciprocal concessions'."
"And, for the sake of the success of this Union, Europe must make the first move."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Madam President, the European Commission has put forward a good proposal."
"It has transformed a relatively clumsy political initiative - the 'Union for the Mediterranean' - into a renewed political ambition for a strengthened Barcelona Process."
"That is an excellent thing and, in this context, the Commission is performing its role to the letter."
"We support its proposals, particularly as regards incorporating the institutions of the future project in relation to the Lisbon Treaty and its goal of a more coherent and better integrated external policy for the Union."
"In so doing, it is putting an end to the justified fears of ad hoc political manoeuvring dictated by the agreements reached at the summit or on an à la carte or circumstantial basis, fears fuelled largely by the misplaced initiatives of President Sarkozy to promote, for example, the proliferation of nuclear power in the region."
"The mediocre results in terms of democracy and human rights were unanimously identified in 2005 as an obstacle to the Barcelona objectives."
"That is why the European Parliament insists that all the mechanisms aimed at strengthening democracy and the rule of law as well as the parliamentary dimension of the process and the participation of civil society must be duly guaranteed within the framework of this new ambition for the Euro-Mediterranean region."
"An amendment has been tabled on the conflict in the Middle East."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I think that the European Parliament would be well-advised to accept it."
"It is right to ensure that new initiatives in the region are not dependent on resolution of the conflict, but we would also be fooling ourselves if we ignored its negative impact on the concrete capacities to develop Mediterranean projects that are relevant to the citizens."
"Moreover, the ad hoc delegation that recently visited Palestine documented serious violations of humanitarian law and human rights, clear violations of the Oslo and Annapolis commitments."
"It would be futile to suggest that the persistence of this situation does not undermine profoundly the mutual trust between the partners and the civil societies in the region, trust that is nonetheless vital to the success of our Euro-Mediterranean ambitions."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, the European Union has many so-called old neighbours to the South and many so-called new ones to the East."
"As far as the former are concerned, there exists an instrument for external cooperation which is currently being strengthened."
"This strengthening process should continue, but it will not lead to any of the countries concerned joining the Union."
"In the case of our Eastern neighbours involved in the Neighbourhood Policy, membership of the Union is most certainly a possibility."
"Membership is not the aim of effective cooperation, but a successful neighbourhood policy is bound to lead in that direction."
"The Barcelona Process needs new political impetus, because the 'one size fits all' Neighbourhood Policy fits neither the East nor the West."
"It is therefore entirely appropriate that two projects appeared on the European agenda at almost the same time, one concerning a Mediterranean Union and the other an Eastern partnership."
"As a neighbour of Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova and Georgia I very much hope that no damaging competition will arise between the Southern and Eastern neighbourhood policies."
"The two should instead be mutually complementary."
"If we are to be successful in budgetary negotiations, for example, we need to stand shoulder to shoulder."
"Mutual political solidarity is called for when designing the eastern and southern aspects of neighbourhood policy."
"A level playing field is also urgently required at institutional, political, assistance and economic level regarding our policy towards the South and the East."
"That is why I am today strongly supporting strengthening and renewal of the political framework for neighbourhood as regards the Mediterranean countries."
"We support the projects relating to credits, communication and energy."
"We also support institutional reforms affecting the South."
"We trust that in the future similar support will be offered for strengthening policy towards the East."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, the challenges involved in Europe's relationship with the people of the southern shore of the Mediterranean far exceed those of a simple neighbourhood relationship."
"It is perhaps a peaceful future that hangs in the balance in this region of unparalleled division."
"The reasons for this situation are very clear to see."
"The first is the economic imbalance."
"Thirteen years after the launch of the Barcelona Process, not only has the promised shared prosperity not materialised; the gaps have grown wider."
"In fact, the obsession with free trade has taken precedence over the goal of development."
"In order to succeed tomorrow where we failed yesterday, a change of direction is needed."
"I do not see this, however."
"The second problem is the humiliating treatment of migrants."
"The population of these countries is very young."
"The people want to live yet they do not see any future."
"Although they are deeply attached to their land, their culture, the history of their civilisation and its impressive contributions - all due respect to Mr Berlusconi - many of them are looking to Europe and they see their emigrant brothers and sisters suffering the affronts of which we are all aware: from profiling to discrimination, from detention centres to 'refoulement'."
"In this regard, too, the gap has increased dramatically."
"Talking about a dialogue of cultures and bringing the people closer together without putting an end to these practices has absolutely no credibility whatsoever."
"Finally, there is Europe's inertia regarding the Palestinian problem."
"There will be the retort that the Union and its Member States are Palestine's largest donors; that is true and it is a good thing."
"However, any observer will confirm, as the EP delegation that has just returned from the Middle East has just done, that without a firm European commitment on a political level, this aid will resolve none of the real issues."
"In other words, what is expected of Europe in the Southern Mediterranean in this respect is that it finally overcomes what the former representative of the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr de Soto, quite rightly called self-censorship with regard to Israel and the persistent violations of international law and its own commitments."
"Israel must understand - and it is the Union's duty to help with this - that the normalisation of its relations with the region as a whole has a price, and that price is no more or no less than what is stipulated in the Peace Initiative of the Arab League, the Quartet's Roadmap or the Annapolis Declaration, namely the end of the occupation and resulting barbarism, and the recognition of the Palestinian State within the borders as they stood in 1967."
"Europe's attitude to this matter is perhaps the decisive criterion in the success or failure of any attempt to relaunch the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership."
"It is therefore recommended that the European Union-Israel Association Council meeting on 16 June give serious consideration to this when examining the Israeli request for the status of its partnership with the Union to be upgraded."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, I have been asked to speak today on Euromed."
"This is the insane attempt to create a pan-Mediterranean bloc, joining Europe with north Africa."
"To the architects of this scheme, it was a brilliant idea: Europe would transfer wealth and technology to north Africa and north Africa would transfer cheap labour and oil and gas to Europe."
"In reality, it is a disastrous idea."
"We have already seen what happens when you allow people from poor countries to have freedom of movement into richer ones."
"Can you imagine how much more true this will be if north Africa gets this right too?"
"At a time of heightened international terrorism, is it a good idea to have freedom of movement from countries with known al-Qa'ida presences?"
"After the terrorist atrocities in Madrid and London, one would have thought Europe would have learned its lessons."
"Clearly not!"
"Let us also talk about oil and gas."
"The north African countries know Europe can be bullied."
"Is it really a good idea to put our energy security in the hands of the military dictatorship in Algeria or Colonel Gadaffi in Libya, both of whom are aware of our vulnerability?"
"I strongly urge the EU to cease this scheme."
"We have already had one imperial mare nostrum."
"We do not need another."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, the Mediterranean is the region of all divisions: geographical divisions, historical divisions - in Salamin, Axion, Lepanto - demographic divisions and even philosophical divisions, between magical thinking and logical thinking, in other words the Orient and the Occident, but also the East and West, from the Egypt of Moses, then Jesus, then Mohammed, from Omar Khayyam to Baudelaire, from the plateaus of Syria to the plains of Languedoc."
"The Mediterranean is the hope of three monotheistic religions and the civilisation of wheat and wine, not of sauerkraut and beer or mussels in Chez Léon."
"The Union for the Mediterranean is not just a matter of de-pollution or civil security."
"What you need for that is the fire brigade!"
"The Mediterranean is not managed by 44 senior officials in Brussels, capital of the Mediterranean."
"Why not also have an Erasmus grant so that Plato and Aristotle can come and study Community law in the Bruges College?"
"The Mediterranean manages the affairs of the women and men of the Mediterranean: in other words prosperity, for example, of fishermen, who are asking you for it at the moment; in other words peace in the West, in the Saharan provinces of Morocco, and in the East, in Palestine."
"Commissioner, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, our dreams need to be big enough for us not to lose sight of them when pursuing them, and that is why there is not a restricted union of the people of the Mediterranean."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Mediterranean has played a part in Europe's external relations since the beginning of European unification."
"Even the Treaty of Rome anticipated preferential relations with certain Mediterranean countries."
"The politics of the Mediterranean and the international situation have helped to develop our institutional framework because the region has always been an arena for international challenges and problems."
"As is universally recognised, we did not reach the ambitious targets we set in Barcelona in 1995, so we set new ones in 2005."
"Our Euro-Mediterranean relations have undoubtedly given us numerous opportunities for meetings and familiarisation both bilaterally and internationally to improve contacts with the public and with parliaments."
"President Sarkozy's proposed Union for the Mediterranean, and its progress under the aegis of the EU and its institutions, have highlighted how urgent it is to realise the Euro-Mediterranean dream, which has become more real and advanced on both sides."
"The dream has made an important contribution."
"The Mediterranean has been ever present in our questions, changes and plans; it has been key in the EU's balance of power and relationships."
"The progress this proposal represents is also proof of the mobilisation, innovation and commitment the Union is capable of in the face of major challenges."
"I congratulate and thank the European Commission, particularly Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner for her work and her proposal, which in our view is balanced and integrated."
"Her proposal makes the most of our commitments and vested interests; it builds on the new French proposals and paves the way ahead."
"Through the joint resolution, the European Parliament welcomes and supports these efforts."
"It will lend its support to the interesting and ambitious project which has begun."
"The challenges in the region are becoming ever greater and more urgent."
"There are deep economic and political differences, serious security problems and economic inequalities."
"Additionally, the economic and political environment of the Mediterranean is becoming increasingly complex."
"The US as well as China and Russia have to be taken into account, so we must become more prudent and effective."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament wished to react immediately to the Commission's communication."
"This is because, as the Commissioner herself said, we are keen to see a revival, renewal and development of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership."
"We support the Commission's view that the European Union should be the key institutional and political player - on the European side - in building the Union for the Mediterranean."
"This may also encourage our partners in the South to cooperate more closely among themselves, something that has hitherto proved exceedingly difficult."
"We agree that the task of the Union for the Mediterranean should be economic and territorial integration among the countries of the Mediterranean Basin, to be brought about by means of major infrastructure projects, and we also believe that the examples put forward by the Commission are appropriate."
"For this purpose, however, it must be clear who does what."
"Above all, any overlap between the role of the Commission and that of the prospective secretariat must be avoided."
"As for the revival of the partnership, we are of course keen to bolster its political dimension: we are interested not just in dialogue between governments but in the role of parliaments, in the establishment of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliament and in its work and that of civil society, where I would strongly emphasise that the social partners play a fundamental role."
"Finally, it must be clear that the projects set out in the Commission's communication should not be carried out to the detriment of regional programmes already under way in the culture, heritage, training and audiovisual fields."
"In this regard we would appeal for the Erasmus Mundus programme to be better resourced and for the Euromed Audiovisual programme to be refinanced."
"(FR) Madam President, welcome thus to the relaunch, 13 years later, of the process governing the multilateral relations between the European Union and the countries bordering the Mediterranean."
"Our resolution makes no mistake."
"There was no misplaced initiative."
"On the contrary, there was a timely and welcome initiative: a new initiative, new impetus, new momentum."
"That proves that it was at least possible to perfect the Barcelona Process and we will all focus our efforts in that direction."
"Welcome thus to this 'Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean'."
"It is nevertheless the first time that the instrument has been given priority over the objective."
"I have no doubt that the Union for the Mediterranean will remain as a generic name, but I do not want to fall out with anyone."
"The Union for the Mediterranean is the egg of Columbus, is it not!"
"The Mediterranean is a lake."
"We all live on its shores; some are organised, others are less so or not at all - such as the Southern countries - but we must work together."
"In this respect, we must begin - and the Commission underlined this perfectly - with specific projects relating to pollution, energy production and jobs for young people, which are essential for the Mediterranean countries."
"Welcome, too, to the parliamentary relaunch in less tangible fields, in human rights, in gender issues."
"However, I must conclude by saying that there will surely be no need for a third relaunch."
"We absolutely have to succeed this time because if we do not we would be showing ourselves to be enemies of our own interests."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a great deal has been said about the French President's idea to equip and arm the countries of North Africa and the Middle East with a nuclear capability for civilian but also military use within the framework of the Mediterranean Union."
"Let me quote Asterix the Gaul here: 'They must be crazy, the French!'"
"However, I am now even more concerned about this development, given that these plans have been taken up and are fervently supported by the European Commission as well."
"Around two weeks ago, a meeting took place between Dr Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and the Commission."
"Mr Barroso was in attendance."
"An agreement was signed between the IAEA and Euratom, or the Commission, which aims to drive forward the proliferation of nuclear energy."
"There is apparently a desire to equip the same developing countries that Mr Sarkozy has his eye on, and put them on track and support them in all manner of ways so that they can deploy nuclear energy."
"This raises a great many questions, in my view."
"First of all, Commissioner, you were originally supposed to be a co-signatory of this agreement."
"I have the relevant draft agreement available to me."
"Why did you distance yourself from it?"
"Could this be because there is actually no basis for this agreement in the Treaties?"
"Secondly, what is Mr Solana's position on the signing of this type of agreement?"
"I cannot imagine that from a security perspective, and especially in view of the difficult situation with Iran, this agreement could possibly gain Europe's backing."
"Since this all appears to have taken place in secret, I would be very pleased to receive an explanation from the Commissioner, particularly as she comes from a country, namely Austria, which has a highly critical stance towards nuclear matters."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Schulz will be pleased to hear that I do not intend to speak French."
"That, however, does not prevent me from unreservedly backing President Sarkozy's initiative, which has pushed - or even propelled - Europe into a position from where it can reclaim a vital role in the Mediterranean area."
"The merit of the Sarkozy initiative is that it responds to the question of outcomes from the Barcelona Process in anything but a tame manner."
"Whenever we ask ourselves what the Mediterranean has gained from the Barcelona Process, our objective, serious and truthful answer is inevitably unsatisfactory."
"There has of course been the war, and there is still conflict in the Middle East."
"When it was decided in Barcelona in 1995 to launch this new European policy, the idea was to manage the post-conflict peace."
"That was not the case then and is not now."
"Europe is still dragging its feet, and the French President's initiative strikes us as well-timed."
"We endorse the Commission's initiative and the compromise which has emerged from it."
"We back it, yet we believe that it is still insufficient with regard to the role that Europe can and must play in the Mediterranean."
"Some people feared, and still fear, that the French initiative might jeopardise European cohesion; I do not believe there is any such danger."
"No such danger exists whenever Europe is asked to focus more on politics and less on the market."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate is crucial."
"One of the keys to the future of our continent lies in our capacity to prevent a deep split from dividing the Mediterranean Basin into two antagonistic sides, culturally and economically."
"In spite of all the differences between the two shores of the mare nostrum, what unites us is even stronger than what separates us."
"That is why Nicolas Sarkozy's initiative is excellent in principle: it breathes new life into a Barcelona Process that is marking time."
"I do have some reservations about the method, however."
"When France signed up to the European commitments in the various Treaties, from Maastricht to Lisbon, it agreed to transfer to the Community - and this is something I regret - a number of its prerogatives, notably in the area of foreign affairs."
"With all due respect to Mr Guénot, that is unfortunately the world in which these Treaties oblige us to live."
"That is why, in my opinion, it is somewhat inconsistent to launch such a project, to great media hullabaloo."
"In reality, France no longer has the power to force it on anyone."
"The only way to move it forward was to make use of all of the diplomatic and human resources available to France to convince its partners to carry out the reform of the Barcelona Process, without giving the impression of undoing what had already been achieved, even if what existed was far from satisfactory."
"The result of this inconsistency can be seen today because it is certainly no coincidence that this debate was postponed from yesterday, when the Council could have taken part, to this morning, when only the Commission is represented."
"This must be more than a sign: the Commission has no intention of relinquishing this matter."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, I am pleased today that the 'Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean' is at the top of the European agenda."
"The Commission's analysis seems to be pertinent."
"Based on the acquis of the Euro-Mediterranean cooperation undertaken since 1995, it breathes new life into the process with a view to overcoming the existing gaps and shortcomings."
"I am pleased, in this regard, that the objectives set out here are founded on the principles of parity and equality, which are at the heart of the proposed Union for the Mediterranean."
"The regional projects to be carried out will also make the Euromed partnership more visible and, above all, bring it closer to the citizens."
"It is in fact ownership by the people that will guarantee a strong partnership and greater regional cooperation in the Southern Mediterranean."
"In pursuing this objective, the official role to be played by the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly will therefore be crucial."
"This Assembly will finally be recognised as a form of parliamentary support to the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership."
"Finally, I would like to mention the governance of the project."
"Our objective must continue to be to strengthen the political relationships, share out the responsibilities, promote equality and increase the number of meetings between the Euro-Mediterranean partners."
"We must not dilute the political content of this project under the weight of an institutional mechanism that would certainly lead to inertia."
"We should also ensure that the project is truly efficient by setting up a North-South co-presidency, which would guarantee equality and shared responsibility, and a secretariat, which should be responsible for the governance of the Union for the Mediterranean and for monitoring the implementation of the specific projects."
"The Union for the Mediterranean is a major step forward and, as you said, Commissioner, it will launch - I hope - a new era with our partners, for we share a common destiny."
"(ES) Madam President, since there is life outside the European Parliament I imagine that some of us have the opportunity now and again to go to the cinema at the weekend."
"I did so on Sunday past and I saw a film that I highly recommend, and I do not have any financial interests in its production or distribution: it is called The Yacoubian Building and it looks at the political, economic, social and cultural problems experienced by a large Mediterranean country, Egypt."
"At no point in that film, which is almost two and a half hours long, is there any mention of the European Union, of our presence, of the Barcelona Process."
"Does that mean that the Barcelona Process does not exist, that it has not been successful?"
"No, we must not confuse things."
"It has not been visible enough, but it has contained elements that have benefited the people and that have today become a point of reference for a different type of external policy based on cooperation and based on equality."
"The Barcelona Process is the exact opposite of the historical relationship between Europe and the Southern Mediterranean."
"It is not a neo-colonial process, it is not a process of demands; it is a process of partnership, a process of association, and we must not forget that."
"This process has not been able to change the major dynamics of the Mediterranean, but how could we expect to change in just over 10 years dynamics that have existed for hundreds of years?"
"Nonetheless, it has succeeded in giving a new direction to some of these dynamics."
"We therefore need to strengthen it on a political and institutional level, through programmes, through funding."
"That is the Union for the Mediterranean."
"The European Commission states this clearly in its communication and this Parliament is thus going to support the communication today and support what the vast majority of European governments want: more Barcelona Process, more Barcelona Process, more Barcelona Process."
"That is the Union for the Mediterranean: not more structures but the possibility of the people living a better life thanks to cooperation between equals."
"I want to say that in that case the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly must be the legislative body that lends democratic legitimacy to this process."
"It is no coincidence that you, Mrs Rothe, a member of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, are chairing this sitting today."
"Madam President, I thank all colleagues who have spoken and who have supported the Barcelona Process over many years."
"It is a wonderful concept and one that deserves to succeed."
"I particularly welcome President Pöttering's initiative in forming some structure inside this Parliament to push forward the Barcelona Process, and President Sarkozy's commitment to strengthening the process as well with different aspects."
"This Monday, 9 June, marks the opening of the European Union Mediterranean University."
"Colleagues, I want you to note that date."
"We say that our success rests on dialogue, and the European Mediterranean Process should be exemplified by a successful university."
"I congratulate the Slovenian Presidency for offering the seat of the University, but I ask colleagues in all committees - and the Commission and the Council of Presidents - why has no budget been set aside for the University?"
"Surely we should not rely on one single presidential State - in this case, Slovenia - in furthering the future of the University."
"If we want the University to succeed, we have to find a budget for the years ahead."
"(ES) Madam President, the Mediterranean's history is much more profound than its geography."
"You do not need to come from that region to understand, as the Commissioner rightly pointed out, the major problems it faces: migration, mafias trafficking human beings, which unfortunately is not mentioned in the motion for a resolution, drugs, the economic gap between the two sides of the Mediterranean and, of course, radical Islamic fundamentalism, which is one of the greatest black holes in international politics."
"Hence the importance of the situation in the Mediterranean for the stability and security of our own political project."
"We therefore welcome this Commission communication: we welcome its diligence, as it has rapidly fulfilled a European Council mandate; we welcome its realism, as it puts things into perspective; and we welcome its common sense, as it underlines additionality and the multilateral nature of the initiatives taking shape in this new initiative, aimed precisely at breathing new life into the Barcelona Process."
"I want to point out, Madam President, that I do not agree with some of the criticisms that have been made during this debate."
"I believe that, when necessary, the European Union and the Commission give priority to the ideals over the figures and it is clear that in its external action the European Union always tries to defend the principles in which we believe."
"However, it is also true, Madam President, that we frequently have to move from the Beatitudes and grand principles to the accounting books in order to ensure credibility and realism, and move from words to actions in the policies we wish to promote."
"Therefore, Madam President, it is very easy to criticise and propose initiatives, but those initiatives have to be assessed in relation to the financial resources that the Member States give the European Union to implement the policies appropriately."
"I thus believe, Madam President, that within the framework of the current financial perspective, we have what we have, and if we do not use those resources we will be unable to realise the ambitions that we are striving for as a European Union."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the launch of what was at the time the Mediterranean Union gave rise to controversy and concerns both in Europe and among our Mediterranean partners."
"This initiative clearly could not be a purely Franco-French or Euro-European initiative, nor the expression of a security-oriented vision of Euro-Mediterranean relations."
"I therefore welcome the Commissioner's words this morning and the specific proposals put forward, which respond to some of our concerns."
"This common project must consist of collective dialogue, based on parity and co-management."
"However, the Euro-Mediterranean relationship is an asymmetric relationship that is both emotive and irrational."
"It is obviously asymmetric when it comes to trade: both North-South trade and South-South trade."
"We therefore need to look at whether or not a free trade zone should be set up in 2010."
"It is irrational because it is based on relations linked to a history that is often painful and complicated, and that is today magnified by what certain conservatives want, namely the clash of civilisations, a confrontation between the Western bloc and the Eastern bloc."
"Consequently, if had to take decisions, the first would be to look at this Euro-Mediterranean relationship dispassionately and rationally."
"We must be rational in terms of strengthening the role of the parliaments, notably the role of the EMPA; we must be rational in terms of our proposals on good governance; we must be rational in terms of the aid that can be provided from a South-South perspective; we must be rational, too, when it comes to the free movement of people and the Israel-Palestine issue."
"We also need to be dispassionate because if we cannot we will not create this area of peace and we will not prevent this clash of civilisations that some people desire."
"Madam President, the new impetus given to the Barcelona Process Mediterranean Union has been well presented by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and previous speakers."
"The ideas of Barcelona are now even more pertinent than ever."
"The prosperity gap between the European Union and most Mediterranean countries has unfortunately increased."
"Gradual free trade with the European Union has not attracted the domestic and foreign investment needed to boost the standard of living of our Mediterranean partners."
"A lot will depend now on the success of the new projects proposed, which must be visible and tangible to ordinary citizens on both sides of the Mediterranean, and affect and attract the interest of the private sector: projects dealing with topics such as civil protection, the effects of climate change, drought and the lack of water, forest fires, the de-pollution of the Mediterranean Sea, and the development of technology to make the best use of solar energy for the benefit of both sides of the Mediterranean."
"Common projects for all Mediterranean countries, north and south, are one of the keys to success."
"The issues of migration, social integration, justice and security are also of mutual benefit and visibility."
"Let us not forget that our partners are now transit countries for the waves of migration from sub-Saharan Africa."
"The question of funds, particularly with a more ambitious project such as this one, remains open."
"The more tangible and visible the benefits of this project, the more willing the Member States will be to provide funds."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate President Sarkozy for once, albeit reluctantly, at this juncture."
"With the rumpus that he has created over EU-Mediterranean relations, he has actually managed to give the Barcelona Process, which has existed since 1995, the higher profile and visibility that it deserves, and has unleashed a new debate about our neighbouring region to the South."
"Looking at the outcomes, however, it is clear that Mr Sarkozy's original idea, launched in February 2007, has failed on three counts."
"Firstly, a possible alternative to EU accession for Turkey was effectively banished by Spain and Italy with the declaration adopted in Rome in December 2007."
"Then Chancellor Merkel ensured that EU-Mediterranean relations would be developed further within the existing EU structures."
"Finally, the Commission has now applied the brakes to Mr Sarkozy's ambitious plans for the secretariat and leadership structure of the project."
"It is apparent, in other words, that go-it-alone approaches by Mr Sarkozy will not be tolerated in the European Union."
"(MT) We needed this new beginning; we needed this new energy for the Mediterranean policy that is so important for the Mediterranean as well as for Europe."
"Perhaps the biggest flaw in the Barcelona Process was that our neighbouring countries in the central Mediterranean always felt that this was a European process that was imposed on them and there was not enough of a sense of equality and a sense of membership."
"At the summit on 13 July we need to ensure that we are building this new Union for the Mediterranean project on the basis of true membership and true equality."
"We should build it on structures that are separate and not impose our prospects on others."
"This naturally means that there are obligations as well as rights on both sides, not just on one side."
"We welcome this proposal with a mixture of scepticism and at the same time hope."
"I hope that hope will triumph over scepticism."
"(PT) The Barcelona Process exists only because a series of central European policy issues are affected by our relationship with the South."
"Energy, the fight against terrorism, demography and immigration, economic development and the fight against crime are some of these issues."
"However, we must recognise that the Barcelona Process has not in itself been a success."
"Europe's big success has in fact been to promote reforms in candidate countries."
"However, the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean cannot join the European Union but are, in some cases, our most problematic neighbours."
"Therefore, the question is how we must change our strategy to relaunch the process so that the new Union for the Mediterranean is not just another fine idea."
"Do we believe that the way forward is support for specific investments within the framework of truly open markets?"
"Do we believe in the broadest possible access to Community recovery instruments?"
"Do we defend the idea of the amount of aid depending on the quality of the reforms to be undertaken?"
"I believe so, because the Mediterranean's problems are also our problems."
"We must bear in mind that, if we fail to understand what has gone wrong in Barcelona, we will be unable to introduce a new dynamic into the relationship with our southern partners."
"(FR) Mr President, I would like to ask the Commissioner, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, not to look on this Barcelona Process as a mere economic process."
"When Europe needs energy, it turns to Africa to benefit from its sun and sand."
"Is that not a little too little?"
"Should we not be implementing this process through work in the field of culture?"
"We will be dealing with countries that are very diverse, proud countries, countries that have a history and a great culture."
"Should we not be making efforts to improve social cohesion through in-depth cultural work?"
"Not a single document refers to the Anna Lindt Foundation, which for some years now has been striving to promote cooperation."
"I would also be very keen to see further progress, too, on the proposed Euro-Arab university."
"(BG) Mr. President, Mme Commissioner, The issue related to the establishment of a Black Sea Union is of strategic significance."
"This is a process for joint future development concerning not only the increased influence of the European Union and economic cooperation, but also goodneighbourliness."
"The Mediterranean region with its rich cultural and historical layers and modern political and economic influence is particularly important."
"I view this as a process, a step towards a more global role of the EU as a whole rather than of any single country."
"At the same time, the Mediterranean axis in the development of the EU policies should be linked to the Eastern dimension of the EU strategic projects."
"The Black Sea areas has always been linked to the Mediterranean and thus both should be comparable and put on equal footing today."
"This is the only way for us to achieve new efficiency, greater influence of the European Union's policies and values."
"It will lead to new added value of the EU policies."
"Mr President, I would say to the Commissioner that planning to build motorways will not solve the serious problems facing the Mediterranean area, unless she is intent on convincing President Sarkozy to build a six-lane motorway linking France with Turkey!"
"Commissioner, I was disappointed with your introductory speech, because you did not address some of the major political problems in the Mediterranean."
"I refer, for example, to the occupation by Israel of land belonging to the Palestinians; to the occupation of Cyprus by Turkey; and to the continuing colonisation, in this the 21st century, of part of Morocco by Spain, which has two colonies in Morocco, and to Britain's two colonies in Cyprus and - I understand - one colony in Spain."
"Unless you address those serious issues, we will not be able to turn the theoretical plans for a Mediterranean Union into a reality."
"(PL) Mr President, Europe really does breathe through two lungs."
"One of these lungs is the Mediterranean dimension we are currently debating."
"The other is the Eastern dimension, which includes countries sharing some of their borders with Poland."
"By way of example I could name Ukraine, Belarus and Russia."
"The Eastern dimension also includes countries in the Caucasus, such as Georgia and Armenia."
"It is right and proper that today, 13 years after Barcelona, we should be devoting so much time to the vital Mediterranean dimension of our European policy."
"It should be emphasised, however, that this is only part of a greater whole."
"The policy on the countries of the Mediterranean Basin is necessary and needs to be renewed, but it is only one element of the European Union's broader foreign policy."
"Our policy towards future members of the European Union should be a very important part of the latter."
"To put it plainly, I do not believe that any of the Mediterranean countries we are today discussing will join the Union."
"Ukraine, Georgia and Armenia are, however, bound to become Members."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, as far as I am concerned, it takes two to tango."
"What I want to know is whether there is really enough interest on the other side of the Mediterranean."
"When we see today the dance the French Government is having to perform to actually bring the Mediterranean heads of state together, to get them to come to Paris on 13 July, I wonder if there is really the same commitment on the other side."
"I want to tell you that your revisited project is extremely interesting."
"The European Union was built after the war on the basis of coal and steel."
"If we are proposing to our partners that we build a project for the 21st century, based on climate change, on renewable energy, on the restoration of a Mediterranean environment that has been completely ruined, then yes, we can support this project."
"However, where is the consistency, Commissioner?"
"What can we say to this solo by Mr Sarkozy, who even today, before his presidency, is urging Algeria to sign an agreement on the establishment of a nuclear plant?"
"I think that that is a clear example of the contradiction that perhaps exists between the Council and the Commission."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Matsakis is quite right: I agree with much of what he said."
"There have always been difficulties and problems for the states bordering the mare nostrum, as it was called 2000 years ago."
"However, what Mr Watson, Chairman of the Liberal Group, said is also true in my opinion: we must learn to give as well as take."
"I would therefore call upon Italy's new government under Prime Minister Berlusconi to heed the pleas and entreaties of Colonel Gaddafi, whom we were very eager to please at the time of the Bulgarian nurses affair, ignoring everything that lay behind it."
"He has repeatedly requested Italy to build a motorway in his country."
"A motorway will benefit not just President Gaddafi but all the inhabitants of North Africa, so we will be showing our good will and doing something positive for the Mediterranean as a whole."
"(PL) Mr President, the Mediterranean Basin and the Middle East are strategically important regions from the European Union's point of view."
"It is abundantly clear that an area of peace and economic stability based on the principles of democracy, solidarity and cooperation must be created if we are to rise to common challenges."
"It is also necessary to revive and develop the Barcelona Process, so as to establish a strong partnership in the area of foreign and security policy with a view to combating terrorism."
"The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership cannot focus exclusively on issues pertaining to the economy and trade, however."
"It should be accompanied by strengthened regional cooperation, closer social integration and by cooperation in the area of protection of the natural environment."
"In addition, we should emphasise the need to strengthen policies aimed at increasing the role of women in Mediterranean societies, by promoting gender equality."
"Respect for customs and traditions must not infringe the fundamental rights of women."
"In conclusion, I should like to welcome the Commission's proposal on the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly."
"The role and democratic legitimacy of the latter should be reinforced."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will continue in French."
"Perhaps Mr Schulz does not agree, but I believe that President Sarkozy provided the impulse for the Union for the Mediterranean."
"That is why I think that for once I am nevertheless going to continue to speak in that language."
"First of all, I see, ladies and gentlemen, that this debate or this matter has provoked strong reactions."
"Everyone has something to say on the issue and that is extremely important."
"It is true, as far as I am concerned, that peace could perhaps hang in the balance in the Mediterranean."
"It is also true that there is still a gap between the two shores: it is shrinking but it is still there."
"We must take account of the progress that has been made: macro-economic stability, lower inflation, greatly improved human rights."
"Naturally, there is still a great deal to be done."
"On the one hand, reforms are badly needed and these reforms must be more rapid and more comprehensive."
"In addition, the issue of trade and investment is vital."
"I do not agree with Mr Wurtz that the Barcelona Process is dead."
"No, as I have always said, it has been very difficult to implement it because of the existing political problems, and that is true."
"When there was discussion of the political problems, as we know, it was about the Barcelona Process."
"Unfortunately, these problems will remain even if we try to overcome these issues with very specific projects, which is something I support."
"I therefore believe that this idea is a good idea and I think that we have renewed it through a pragmatic and concrete approach that is, of course, fully inclusive."
"As regards free trade and the free trade agreements, ladies and gentlemen, I must point out that as a result of the excessively long transition periods, 2010 is the first year in which we will be able to implement these agreements."
"In fact, we still do not have any free trade agreements."
"As far as agriculture is concerned, we are in the middle of negotiations but it is very complicated, for the other side too, because it involved not just giving, but also receiving."
"These negotiations are always difficult."
"Free trade agreements with Tunisia and Israel will enter into force in 2010."
"A similar agreement with Morocco is being finalised, but considerable efforts are still needed."
"The last country concerned will be Egypt."
"You can thus see that things are moving very slowly, and that is not because of the process; it is because of the countries themselves, which do not wish to move any faster."
"That is important to point out."
"In spite of everything, this new idea is a good idea, an opportunity, and I hope that the partners are going to make use of it."
"It is true, too, Mrs Isler-Béguin, that the partners clearly have to want to dance."
"That is why the Commission spoke with each of them to ensure that its proposals reflected their concerns and their point of view."
"When it comes to human rights, ladies and gentlemen, I must point out that I myself would not have done anything if there had been no human rights."
"However, the Barcelona Process remains; that is the idea."
"The institutions are also involved."
"In principle, the institutions play a role, and that applies to the Anna Lindt Foundation, too."
"Of course, the Anna Lindt Foundation is present, and with a new presidency and a new director these aspects should be further enhanced."
"These things are not lost."
"The Neighbourhood Policy that I mentioned, which is a bilateral policy, also remains of course, because through its action plans it is genuinely trying to strengthen and promote the reforms."
"Do not think, therefore, that it is not involved."
"That is the real value added of the projects that we have actually implemented and emphasised."
"As regards the Euro-Mediterranean University in Portorož, I think first of all that it is an excellent idea by the Slovenian Presidency."
"I am personally going to attend its inauguration;"
"I have been invited to it and I fully intend to be there."
"As regards funding, first and foremost, since it is a Slovenian idea, it is only natural that Slovenia must also make a contribution to it, which it will do to the tune of EUR 1 million."
"I have also been asked for a contribution, which is why I have tried to find something among funds that, in principle, are already allocated."
"That is far from easy."
"I have found EUR 1 million, which I am going to add to this project."
"However, there are other instruments and I have informed the presidency of them."
"Firstly, there are the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund, which simply need to be re-distributed in Slovenia, and secondly, there are the funds for research and education."
"Thus there are funds available."
"In addition, you are of course all aware of the Erasmus grants, which are still applicable."
"That is something new that we are going to strengthen."
"I would like to talk briefly about culture, Madam."
"I think that someone mentioned that Robert Schuman once said that if we were to start building the European Union again, we should start with culture."
"That is true, but while there is so much poverty, so much illiteracy, etc., we have to do other things, too, and I can repeat what I said in relation to human rights: all the culture programmes remain in place and there is quite a number of them."
"Finally, I will say a brief word on the secretariat because that was a very precise question."
"In the light of the different views expressed, we concluded that, as indicated in our communication, the secretariat should be asked to perform the role of making proposals for joint initiatives, which would then be adopted by political bodies, and ensuring the necessary follow-up of project-related decisions taken by the heads of state or government."
"The secretariat could also have a separate legal personality with an autonomous status."
"The detailed modalities have yet to be clarified."
"I will conclude with a few words on the nuclear issue."
"Madam, the Memorandum of Understanding that our President signed with the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, relates to safety and security."
"I personally support it and I think that everyone should because we cannot choose what energy sources the countries use."
"Each country has the right, as you said, to have some reservations about nuclear energy, and you know that we ourselves do."
"However, the countries must at least have the opportunity to do as they wish."
"As such, safety and security are crucial, and those are the issues dealt with by the Memorandum."
"I apologise, Mr President, but as I said at the beginning, this debate has provoked strong reactions."
"To conclude this debate I have received six motions for a resolution1 tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - It is a pleasure to hear statements from the Council and the Commission regarding the Barcelona Process and the proposal for a Union for the Mediterranean."
"The latter is to be initiated on 13 July in Paris during the French Presidency."
"The Government of Malta has issued a position paper on the said statements."
"I fully agree with the proposals being made regarding the Union for the Mediterranean."
"As it is important not to duplicate efforts and energies, the suggestion relating to maritime activities is laudable."
"Malta has offered to host a secretariat to overview the implementation of such proposals and I fully endorse this offer, not only because of the unique geographical position of the island in the Mediterranean but also because we have the infrastructure, personnel and experience to host such an institute."
"To conclude, I would like to mention that, just over thirty years ago, it was a Labour Government that managed to bring world attention to the importance of the Mediterranean and the necessity of collaboration between the countries bordering the Northern and Southern shores of this sea."
"in writing. - (IT) I welcome the establishment of the Union for the Mediterranean, which will help to improve and intensify relations with our Mediterranean partners and will promote mutual awareness, growth, employment and training in the EU and the 12 non-European countries concerned."
"Promoting peace and democracy, immigration controls, economic relations and raw materials supplies: these have historically been the key points of my country's neighbourhood policy with the Mediterranean countries."
"Bettino Craxi was a pioneer in this regard."
"The Union for the Mediterranean will help to facilitate the completion of cross-border projects that are important for the entire area, serving to improve the motorways of the seas, combat marine pollution, improve civil protection, create a better-integrated energy market and develop new renewable technologies."
"The Union for the Mediterranean must contribute to promoting democracy and resolving the conflicts that are still destabilising the Middle East and the Western Sahara, with assistance from the Euromed Parliamentary Assembly, which must be fully involved."
"Hygiene of foodstuffs (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Horst Schnellhardt, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation No 11 concerning the abolition of discrimination in transport rates and conditions, in implementation of Article 79(3) of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community and Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and the Council on the hygiene of foodstuffs - C6-0211/2007 -."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are talking about a project which serves as a pilot for one of the largest and most important policy programmes initiated by this Commission, namely freeing small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe from unnecessary administrative burdens."
"In other words, it is about cutting red tape. We are not talking about problems of veterinary law today; let me just make that clear."
"This is about reducing administrative burdens in a way which will strengthen the European economy and thus make a contribution to creating jobs."
"The Commission is fully aware that cutting administrative costs must never result in less safety for our citizens, so this is not about lowering standards."
"It is about enforcing standards in such a way that unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles are removed for our companies."
"We will be very strict on enforcing this fundamental principle in this case as well."
"Let me emphasise that the Commission has not the slightest intention of changing the substance of the rules on the hygiene of foodstuffs."
"The identification of hazards and the designation of procedural steps in the production process so that hazards can be eliminated remain our central concern."
"We are not lowering existing standards of food hygiene in any way; instead, we want to establish more clarity."
"We would like to ensure that the existing flexible provisions on record-keeping can be applied more effectively."
"This will not entail greater complexity for the relevant authorities in the Member States, for already the responsibility for compliance with the regulations lies with the food producers, not with the authorities."
"We want to establish a rule for micro-enterprises which exempts them from certain requirements of the existing Regulation."
"We are talking about the very small family firms: bakeries, small food stores, market stalls, cafes and bars, shops at petrol stations and mini-markets."
"Why, you might well ask, do we require these small family firms, none which has anything to do with the internal market, to undergo the same bureaucratic procedures as the major supermarket chains?"
"That is a good question, and it is the question that we are here to discuss."
"Let me emphasise that the rules apply to all food producers and companies involved in the production, processing and sale of foods, irrespective of size."
"The rules do not apply to foods designed for private household consumption, and they do not apply to the producers of small quantities of unprocessed products for local retailers, such as farming, hunting and fishing."
"The current flexible rules on record-keeping make no distinction between the various sizes of companies."
"For the purposes of clarity, let me explain: the small corner shop where you can buy your food here in Brussels at 10 o'clock at night must comply with precisely the same regulations as the giant supermarket chains."
"My question is this: can that possibly be fair?"
"Due to the nature of their business operations, it goes without saying that these very complex and comprehensive provisions are easy for major companies to cope with, but that is not the case for micro-enterprises."
"For the formal application of the HACCP system, food producers must undertake a hazard analysis."
"This can be a complex and burdensome task requiring expert input."
"In order to reduce the burdens associated with this type of analysis, the Regulation already allows small food producers to make use of good practice guidelines which have been drawn up for the relevant sector."
"They already exist for bakeries, breweries, butchers' shops and restaurants in various Member States, but they do not exist everywhere."
"One objective of the Commission proposal is to ensure that the rules on possible exemptions, which are already established in principle in the Regulation and the accompanying guidelines, are being used efficiently. What does this mean in practice?"
"Well this brings us to the heart of the matter. If, during the first stage of the HACCP process, a food business operator can prove that either there are no hazards that must be prevented, eliminated or reduced to acceptable levels, or that identified hazards are sufficiently and regularly controlled through the implementation of general and specific food hygiene requirements, then the operator should be exempt from all the other requirements of the HACCP Directive."
"Let me put it in straightforward terms: this flexibility is already available under the current Directive, but it is not being applied by all the Member States."
"The Commission's proposal is therefore presented as a fast track action within the framework of our Action Programme for Reducing Administrative Burdens in the European Union."
"The proposal has met with some resistance in the Council and in some Member States."
"I am aware of that. These Member States do not appear to attach as much importance to reducing administrative burdens and cutting the costs of red tape - especially for their SMEs - as the Commission and the European Parliament do."
"The impression which we have gained, however, is that this debate has so far been conducted only between civil servants in the Member States; it would seem that their politicians have not yet addressed the issue."
"In my view, the politicians in the Member States whose civil servants have shown such resistance to the proposal cannot possibly justify to the public why their country is resisting a Commission proposal which could make life easier for hundreds of thousands of their micro-enterprises and small businesses."
"At that moment, the frequent agitation against Brussels - this 'bureaucratic monster' which is supposedly determined to regulate and restrict every aspect of people's lives - would be revealed as mere propaganda and would collapse, and it would become apparent who is actually responsible for the excessive red tape."
"From the Commission's perspective, this opposition is regrettable, as this proposal constitutes an important, substantive and symbolic element of our Action Programme for Reducing Administrative Burdens in the European Union."
"I am very grateful to Mr Schnellhardt for his report and his active support."
"I would urge you all to give it your backing, for I am convinced that a clear political message from Parliament of the kind that could be sent out today will create the necessary political momentum in the Council, too, to get this proposal through."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with this report, we are making a contribution to cutting red tape."
"We have succeeded in making it clear that it is, and should be, possible to ease the burden associated with the implementation of HACCP criteria, especially for small businesses, without lowering or jeopardising our high hygiene standards."
"A priority - as the Commissioner has already said - is to ease the burden associated with record-keeping."
"I would just like to remind you that these options were already available in the hygiene package which came into force in 2006."
"However, we have noted that following this paradigm shift in the area of hygiene, difficulties have arisen in the context of implementation."
"It has always been the stated aim of Parliament and the Commission to preserve diversity of food production in a European Union of 27 Member States."
"It is only right and proper that small butchers' shops, for example, should be able to continue to operate in future too."
"However, the information that we have received from various countries is that in some regions, some small companies are finding economic survival increasingly difficult."
"That is why it is essential to draw attention to the flexibility built into the regulations and help it to become a reality."
"This - nothing else - is what we have emphasised clearly and unequivocally in this report."
"Maintaining flexibility means that we mention the focus on small and medium-sized enterprises only in the recitals."
"This makes it possible, for example, for companies which have 11, not 10, employees, let us say, to benefit from favourable treatment so that they too can apply for the administrative burden to be eased: provided, of course, that they can prove that either there are no hazards or that identified hazards are sufficiently and regularly controlled."
"The report also emphasises that the food business operator is responsible for furnishing the proof that either there are no hazards that must be prevented, eliminated or reduced to acceptable levels, or that identified hazards are sufficiently and regularly controlled through the implementation of general and specific food hygiene requirements."
"In 2006 we adopted a hygiene package which applies as it stands in the EU27."
"That is why I fail to understand the amendment tabled by Mrs Corbey, which states that it should be a matter for the Member States whether to allow any easing of burdens in HACCP implementation."
"This would create new subsidiarity scenarios, which was actually what we were trying to avoid with the Regulation; in other words, we do not want any distortions of competition."
"The adoption of Mrs Corbey's amendment would also conflict with the intentions of the Regulation itself: in other words, the regulation would conflict with itself."
"That is certainly not what we are trying to achieve!"
"The text adopted in committee is certainly acceptable, but it explicitly restricts the option of easing the burdens to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The strong involvement of the authorities, too, is out of step with the principles of the Regulation."
"In the Regulations themselves, it is made very clear that food businesses have a responsibility to maintain good hygiene practice and must furnish proof that they are controlling any risks."
"There have been repeated objections to the effect that a review of the regulations is due in 2009 so no new measures are needed now."
"I take issue with this view."
"By 2009 all food-producing companies must be licensed."
"Problems are likely to arise in this licensing process."
"This will trigger a debate and is likely to put at risk the survival of the small butchers I have already mentioned, for example."
"In fact, that was the starting point underlying the Commission's intention to bring forward this proposal."
"It is very important, therefore, for the European Parliament to send out a clear signal about the intention established in the relevant Regulation."
"This signal is sent out, first and foremost, to food companies and the regulatory authorities."
"The European Parliament has a strong track record in cutting red tape, and should do so again now, by giving its seal of approval to these regulatory provisions."
"Mr President, I dare say I shall not use up my two minutes."
"I merely wish to point out that the Committee on Legal Affairs, on examining the legal principles, considered Article 95 to be the legal basis for the first part, and Articles 95 and 175 for the second part."
"The opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs will be taken into account when validating the decision."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Thank you very much, Mr President."
"For European citizens of the 21st century, health and the consumption of good-quality foodstuffs are of overriding importance."
"Our task as MEPs is to guarantee this, but to do this we need legislation and procedures such as HACCP to guarantee the interests of consumers."
"However, it is just as important that we do not go overboard and over-regulate our lives, because in doing so we would not serve quality of life but bureaucracy."
"In my view, the present compromise recommendation points in a good direction."
"Experience up to now has shown that the HACCP provisions currently in force are unjustifiably too stringent in many cases."
"Moreover, they cannot always be applied in the hospitality and hotels sector, since they assume the conditions and working methods of the food industry."
"Despite this, the new Member States, including Hungary, have implemented the HACCP provisions to the full, and even beyond."
"Our companies have suffered from this, many have abandoned their traditions and practices that are hundreds of years old, but this cannot be our goal, so we need to make changes."
"Firstly, it is important to emphasise that restaurants are not food factories, so they must not be required to follow the same provisions, since this erodes quality and traditions."
"Let us not forget that there were Michelin stars before the HACCP."
"We must reduce the exaggerated number of administrative duties."
"I support the fact that exemption from the HACCP should only apply to micro-businesses and SMEs that are able to monitor food hygiene."
"I regret the fact that, while micro-businesses are taxable, the exemption of SMEs is hidden in the text."
"It is important to state and declare this clearly."
"Finally, the system must be more flexible than it is now."
"The competent national authority should decide what common sense dictates in a given case."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, better regulations, who does not want that?"
"Our Group greatly appreciates the efforts of Commissioner Verheugen to cut down on excessive bureaucracy."
"Anything that we can do to help small and medium-sized enterprises, we must do."
"I have set to work on his proposals on food hygiene and I have been making enquiries in the Netherlands."
"My colleagues have been doing the same in their own countries."
"How are the bakers, butchers and corner shops doing all over Europe?"
"We have already heard from Sweden about the problem of pieces of cake being served in the back of the church."
"Complaints have come from the Netherlands about the rules that theatres and cinemas have to follow."
"In both of these countries, however, it turned out that the hygiene laws were not the cause of the problem."
"Other messages have come in too though: from small shops in the United Kingdom which have made great efforts over the last two years to apply the HACCP principles and were proud to have managed it all."
"Should Parliament now go and say that it is all unnecessary?"
"That brings us to my next point."
"In our last term of office, we worked hard on the reform of the general food law."
"We had to do this because of the shortcomings in food safety and a number of major food scandals."
"The essence of the general food law is that the responsibility for food safety rests with the producer."
"The public authorities have a supervisory role."
"We cut across this division of roles if companies are given exemptions based on a risk analysis, as this would mean that the government was taking the responsibility upon itself again and that would in fact be a step backwards."
"It is also an unnecessary step, as it has also become clear meanwhile that the implementation is actually going very well in the majority of Member States."
"The small businesses in the European Member States have already put their houses in order and they are working with practical workable hygiene codes."
"There are two things that we should not forget."
"First, the general food law that we hope to amend today replaced a whole raft of rules."
"Even in 2004, Parliament, and certainly the PSE Group, made the case for combating excessive bureaucracy."
"Small companies can already appeal for flexibility under the present rules."
"A second point is that a reform is already planned for 2009."
"If there are serious problems, they can be resolved in 2009, i.e. next year."
"In a word, our Group is not convinced of the need to implement changes in a great hurry now, without a thorough evaluation."
"All the same, we do not want to let the small companies down, which is why we have tabled an amendment that entails leaving the decision to the Member States."
"Should there be urgent problems in one of the Member States, then that state can decide for itself whether to permit exemptions."
"That is perfectly in accordance with the Regulation, Mr Schnellhardt, and what is more, it is very pragmatic and also very simple."
"I am therefore asking you to support Amendment 12."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I also wish to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur for the hard work he has put into this report."
"This proposal aims at reducing the administrative burdens in food-related enterprises."
"Specifically, the express goal is to exempt micro-enterprises from basic HACCP procedural obligations but without, of course, in any way compromising food hygiene and consumer health safety."
"This was deemed necessary as companies with less than 10 employees, whose activities consist predominantly of the sale of food directly to the final consumer, are suffering severely under the heavy bureaucratic necessities of HACCP to the extent that, in many cases, bankruptcy becomes an inevitability."
"Such an aim is fully in line with our expressed wish to support small businesses in their antagonistic and - in most instances - unfair fight for survival against the large companies."
"This aim appeared at some stages of our deliberations not to be shared by either the rapporteur or the Council."
"It became my understanding that their preferred line was - and, it seems, probably still is - to provide exemptions and flexibility equally for all companies, large and small."
"At first sight and in theory, this may appear proper, but in practice it is grossly unfair to small companies and clearly defeats the purpose of having this piece of legislation in the first place, which is of course to help the micro-enterprises."
"Some may argue that this is preferential treatment and unfair competition."
"They may be right on strictly legalistic and oversimplified theoretical grounds but, in terms of fairness and long-term planning, it is the same as putting a 6-foot champion and a 3-foot child in a boxing ring on exactly equal terms."
"Our philosophy is that, in some circumstances, the small and weak need some privileged assistance."
"Otherwise our free internal market will become a deadly pond where the big fish will eat the little ones and then probably eat each other."
"Our voting philosophy reflects this."
"I urge you to vote to protect the small businesses of Europe."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the report by Mr Schnellhardt contains a number of important amendments to the Commission's proposal."
"Some of these deal with the differences between Regulation No 852 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning food hygiene, and Regulation No 11."
"The proposal is for greater flexibility on the part of the relevant bodies where food hygiene is concerned, and for procedures to be simplified."
"Both these issues are particularly important for small enterprises operating on local and regional markets."
"Implementation of the Regulation will require cooperation between supervisory bodies at different levels of the market, constant monitoring of the latter and appropriate support from the Commission, concerning the exchange of best practice for example."
"Pursuant to adoption of the rapporteur's amendments, this Regulation will have a beneficial effect on the market, and we therefore support it."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, Europeans are entitled to safe food."
"That should, I believe, always be the main message in debates like this and the main underlying assumption for European policy."
"Of course, it is also important to ensure that the citizens are obstructed by as few pointless bureaucratic rules as possible, but the present rules already allow scope for micro-enterprises to be exempted from the most complicated administrative hygiene requirements."
"Coffee in community centres or stalls selling soft drinks are not under threat and other businesses should simply make sure that their hygiene is good."
"It is not necessary, therefore, to allow new exemptions apart from the small micro-enterprises, and it is not sensible at all to expand the number of exceptional cases or to make the rules more vague, as the rapporteur seems to want to do on certain points."
"Just like the consumer organisations, I would advise strongly against this."
"(SK) I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt, for his report, dealing with two different themes that are subject to different procedures."
"Since the hygiene of foodstuffs is subject to the codecision procedure, this procedure will inevitably hold back the area of prices and transport conditions, subject only to a consultation process."
"I agree with the stipulation that food safety requirements in individual Member States must be the same across the board, or at least should not significantly differ from each other."
"However, here we come to the question of imports to the European Union from third countries where the foodstuffs are full of pesticides."
"We have a polluted environment, which has a negative impact on human health."
"Consequently, we must do everything possible to prevent unhealthy foodstuffs from damaging our health."
"We have to start testing foodstuffs, their components and the raw materials of animal and plant origin for health hazards, hygienic acceptability and biological values."
"We have to concentrate on identification or on possible falsification."
"We have to test for foreign materials in food and to focus on everyday use: for example not just phthalates in toys, which are not used by everyone on a daily basis."
"Slovak producers are often criticised with regard to the hygiene of foodstuffs."
"I must point out, however, that Slovakia has much stricter food standards than the 15 old Member States."
"- (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank our rapporteur for his excellent cooperation: at first sight it seems to be a straightforward matter, but when we listen to our fellow Members, we can hear that it certainly is not."
"It should be obvious to everyone that every business must indeed aim to give the best possible hygiene guarantees, but the way they achieve this aim need not, of course, be the same for all businesses."
"I think it is crucial that the competent authorities in the different Member States do actually make use of the flexibility that is already provided for in the present Regulation, and exempt certain food companies from what is after all a very complicated HACCP procedure, on condition, of course, that the same standards of hygiene safety can be demonstrated and guaranteed."
"I believe that it is perfectly possible to do this by observing good hygiene practices based on sectoral guides, such as those that have already been drawn up in some countries."
"Nevertheless, I would still like to ask the Commissioner - if he could listen to me for a moment, as I see that he is talking to our rapporteur - whether he can give further clarification on a couple of points."
"He has said that all food companies are covered by this, regardless of their size."
"I would still like to hear him say whether he really believes that this report offers more flexibility to a broader range of food companies and not just micro-enterprises."
"Secondly, the Commissioner has just said that no additional burden will be imposed on the Member States but there may be additional burdens on businesses."
"What I would really like to hear, therefore, is whether the proof that the companies have to provide really can be based on the sectoral guides, so that this does not involve additional red tape for companies."
"(RO) The report outlines the necessity of reducing bureaucracy in the two fields."
"Regulation No 11 on eliminating discrimination in terms of tariffs and transport conditions requires carriers to hold a transport document which should contain, among others, the distances, routes and borders passage points."
"In the field of transportations, the proposal aims at the reduction of certain obligations to provide statistics in the transportations field."
"With regard to Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs, I would like to support the amendment submitted by the European Socialist Group, in which the competent bodies are allowed to exempt economic agents in the foods sector from the implementation of one or several of the imposed measures, provided that these bodies are capable of proving that there is no risk that must be avoided, or that all identified risks are sufficiently and regularly controlled by means of application of the general and special requirements of hygiene of foodstuffs."
"This refers to bakeries, butcheries, fruit and vegetables shops and, mainly, to market stands."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, food and hygiene go together; there is absolutely no doubt about that."
"Everyone has at some time in their lives eaten something that was 'off'."
"On the other hand, over-caution and excessively stringent regulation do not give us a cornucopia of foods which meet exemplary hygiene standards."
"A small producer is more likely to close down his shop because he cannot afford to pay the additional workers required to fill in forms rather than bake bread."
"My host, who serves the bread rolls, does not have to keep a record of whether he has wiped the counter and washed the dishes."
"After all, if he failed to take these basic precautions, he would have no customers anyway."
"What is happening is that responsible legislation is sliding into regulatory zeal that does more harm than good."
"That is why I am completely in favour of easing the administrative burden on companies, especially micro-enterprises, which find it more difficult to cope with this burden than the major corporations."
"I would like to see this greater awareness of the impacts on micro-enterprises being carried over into other areas of legislation that we discuss in this House as well, especially environmental and consumer protection."
"(DE) Mr President, we have opted for a system in which every enterprise which produces, processes or sells food must continuously and consistently monitor and document every step in its operations."
"While we are sitting here debating whether food hygiene is guaranteed, however, consumer confidence is being undermined by BSE and scandals involving rotten meat, adulterated olive oil, and wine containing glycerine."
"The fact that more and more GM foods are coming into the EU, even though these are rejected by 70% of the European population, also does very little to boost people's confidence."
"That is why we must give very careful thought to today's decision, and we must ensure that the health of our citizens is not sacrificed through our kowtowing to the food corporations in advance of the EU-US Summit."
"We cannot demand compliance with more stringent provisions from our own producers while allowing imports of foods which are not produced in accordance with the same rigorous standards, given that this after all offers advantages in terms of price and competitiveness."
"At some point, domestic producers will start demanding exemptions as well, and they would be quite justified in doing so."
"Mr President, the purpose of this proposal is to reduce administrative burdens on small enterprises."
"The proposal came from the Enterprise and Industry DG as part of the Better Regulation initiative."
"Unfortunately, while I am very sympathetic to the idea of reducing administrative burdens on small businesses, I find this proposal was initially ill-defined (Mr Schnellhardt has amended it extremely well), as it allowed some businesses, such as mobile food outlets and garage forecourt retailers - two categories of businesses that do need to be considered under hygiene rules - to derogate from applying all the hygiene rules."
"There is discretion in the hygiene regulation itself to allow businesses who do not need to apply the full HACCP regime to derogate from it with the approval of competent authorities."
"The problem appears to be that administrations in some Member States are not using their discretionary powers, and in some regions of the EU small sweetshops and even church halls are being asked to apply full HACCP rules."
"It is my view that it is the application of the original legislation and not the legislation itself that is the problem."
"(HU) I feel that Mr Verheugen's efforts to help SMEs should be supported fully, and I would also like to thank Mr Schnellhardt."
"Food safety is of crucial importance in the European Union, but we should only regulate and monitor it sensibly and rationally."
"People often have the feeling that excessive regulation by the EU helps multinational companies and not SMEs."
"Mr Verheugen is right that the national monitoring authorities continue to exacerbate the situation, and so small and medium-sized food factories are inspected unnecessarily in Hungary too, and the provisions are complied with excessively and in a pushy way, while they do not dare to take any real action against the multinational companies that have greater lobbying power."
"Unfortunately, this report will no longer support the small village abattoirs and bakeries that have been forced to abandon production as a consequence of the incomprehensible over-regulation, but I feel this report should be supported unreservedly."
"(PL) Mr President, I support the Commission's proposal."
"Reducing the bureaucratic burden on small enterprises, small shops and service providers will enable more such entities to survive."
"It is therefore in the interest of small entrepreneurs, their workers and consumers."
"Accordingly, providing the criteria of the HACCP system are not infringed, and providing hygiene is maintained in the production of food and services in this area, it is worth helping small bakers, confectioners, butchers, greengrocers and corner cafés, all of which tend to be family businesses."
"The effect of these legal changes should, however, be subsequently monitored."
"I congratulate the rapporteur."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, we are not talking about whether we want more hygiene or less hygiene."
"We are talking about easing burdens and cutting red tape for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The question which we need to address once again, then, is this: is HACCP appropriate and necessary in every case and in every company, large or small, and regardless of who is responsible?"
"In the case of companies which are engaged predominantly in the direct sale of food to the final consumer - such as bakeries, butchers, food stores and market stalls, and indeed, farmers' coffee shops, wine bars and the seasonal wine taverns run by the vineyards, where the owner or manager is known to the customer and is generally available in person - we must undoubtedly apply different criteria from those applicable to a major corporation."
"This is about the dismantling of bureaucracy and it is about accountability."
"I think we should certainly harness the principle of subsidiarity here, but not by demanding the opportunity to introduce significantly different requirements in individual Member States. We must have a level playing field in terms of competition."
"I therefore support the Commission's proposal and Mr Schnellhardt's report."
"(FR) Mr President, no one is denying that we need to establish a procedure based on the principles of hazard analysis and critical control points."
"Everyone welcomes the fact that at Community level the European Union is proposing inventive legislation on foodstuffs to guarantee the highest possible level of food safety for our fellow citizens."
"However, we must reduce the amount of pointless bureaucracy, especially for small and micro-enterprises, and ensure efficiency without restricting the objectives relating to foodstuffs."
"Do we need to sink into a health and regulatory phobia and drift?"
"Certainly not."
"As the representative of Bourgogne-Franche Comté in Parliament, I am familiar with the methods used for the production of all the cheeses in my region by small and micro-enterprises."
"Bacteria are necessary to make cheese."
"Reintroduced to pasteurised milk - for certain cheeses - they ensure that these products meet the highest food safety standards."
"Increasing the volume of regulatory procedures would weaken small and micro-enterprises."
"That is why I am calling on Parliament to accept Amendment 12, which facilitates this flexibility."
"When it comes to respect for cultural diversity and dialogue, I believe that it is essential..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Member of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me set the record straight once again."
"This is not about changing the current food hygiene rules. These rules will not be amended, even to a very minor extent, and there will be no exemptions of any kind for anyone."
"In future, as now, everyone must comply with our food hygiene rules."
"What we are talking about today is something entirely different."
"We are talking about whether the extremely complicated and bureaucratic provisions that we currently have in place should be applied to all businesses if, in the first stage of the procedure, they are able to prove that there is absolutely no risk, or that the risk is sufficiently controlled."
"That is the purpose of this proposal."
"In answer to my question: the proposal only concerns those businesses which can demonstrate in the very first stage that there are no risks to food hygiene, or that such risks are sufficiently controlled."
"This provision is, of course, one which will have a particular impact on small and medium-sized enterprises and especially the micro-enterprises, which will find it easy to furnish the necessary proof."
"The proposal will not result in an additional burden on the authorities, unless Mr Corbett's additional amendment is adopted, which would mean that at every stage of the procedure, the authorities would have to take action. In that case, we would have a greater administrative burden."
"I would ask you to support the rapporteur's proposal."
"He has indeed improved upon the Commission's original proposal."
"What we are trying to achieve is quite straightforward: the existing law is currently being applied in a way that does not conform with the legislator's original intention."
"The Commission underlines that the amendment to the HACCP regulation does not weaken existing food hygiene requirements."
"It simply serves to provide greater clarity and, thereby, more effective use of the existing flexibility provisions of the regulation in respect of reporting requirements."
"The existing flexibility provisions in respect of reporting requirements do not distinguish between different size classes of companies."
"However, given the nature of operations of larger food business operators, these provisions are less likely to apply to larger companies."
"The amendment is, therefore, likely to be particularly beneficial for small and medium sized enterprises."
"A proposed new recital makes this explicit."
"The amendment does not create any additional compliance burdens for competent authorities since the responsibility to demonstrate compliance rests exclusively with food business operators."
"The objective of the amendment is to reduce administrative burdens on companies through a more effective uptake of the existing flexibility provisions on reporting."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful indeed for the various contributions to this debate."
"I think almost all the contributions have made one thing clear: we have the will to roll back bureaucracy, and we have the will to ease the burden on small and medium-sized companies in Europe when it comes to implementing the HACCP rules."
"Now it is up to us to express this will by voting in favour of the right amendments, and that means Amendment 10, which we have agreed with the Commission and representatives of the Council presidency."
"This amendment states in clear and unequivocal terms what we want to achieve."
"In this way, we can proceed in a very straightforward manner, building on the Regulations adopted in 2006."
"We want to equip the authorities and, indeed, the food companies with a procedure which enables them to react quickly."
"As I pointed out in my speech earlier today, the difficulties will arise in relation to the licensing of companies up to 2009."
"We need to send a clear message here. We want to roll back bureaucracy and we want to maintain hygiene standards."
"They are not diluted by this proposal. I think that is the message which conveys what Parliament wants."
"Congratulations on your excellent work, Mr Schnellhardt."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (HU) Inspections by the authorities in Hungary, which fall due in the summer, show that there are often certain hygiene problems with casual traders, fast-food outlets and market stalls."
"These phenomena are also known in other countries."
"I agree that we must deconstruct the unnecessary bureaucracy, mainly if the provisions make it impossible for small businesses to work."
"However, reducing the scope of the legislation cannot mean eroding food safety."
"In contrast with other continents, food safety regulation in Europe is at a unique, outstanding level."
"There may be deficiencies in its implementation, but these problems must not necessarily be solved by weakening regulation."
"For this reason, we can only grant exemption from the HACCP and hygiene monitoring by the Union in cases where we can be completely sure that we are not causing any harm by doing so."
"As the Hungarians say, it is better to be frightened than to take fright."
"Approval of Minutes of previous sitting"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission triggered the radioactive risk alert system yesterday following an incident at Krsko in Slovenia, the details of which remain sketchy."
"The alert was made public via a procedure that has been described as unusual, but its causes and its consequences are still totally confused and unclear."
"We therefore call on the Slovenian Presidency-in-Office and the Commission to maintain the level of transparency urged by the Commission, and to tell the European Parliament and the public what really happened and what is happening now, because a number of rumours are currently circulating which are neither clear nor wholly unambiguous."
"We therefore demand the necessary clarification from the European authorities."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like very briefly to endorse my colleague's request."
"We have here a very serious incident in a reactor which has already experienced problems in the past."
"Maximum transparency is required, not least because we know that shutting down a reactor and making it safe is no easy matter."
"As far as my country is concerned, we are just a few dozen kilometres away from Slovenia, which moreover currently holds the presidency."
"We have heard from two speakers on this item and I think that is sufficient."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, on 1 June, on the basis of information received through the European Community Urgent Radiological Information Exchange (ECURIE) system and guided by the principle of precaution, the Commission released a public statement about the alert message from Slovenia at 17.38 local time."
"This concerned the loss of coolant that occurred in the primary cooling system of the Krško nuclear power plant in south-west Slovenia."
"According to the last information received from the Slovenian authorities, the reactor of the nuclear power plant of Krško was completely shut down on Wednesday, 4 June at 19.30."
"The relatively small leakage remained within the containment building."
"The Slovenian authorities have confirmed that there has been no discharge to the environment."
"The situation can be considered fully under control."
"The Commission immediately transmitted this information to all Member States according to the procedure and released a second public statement."
"The information about the incident came from the European Community Urgent Radiological Information Exchange system."
"The ECURIE system requires that Member States promptly notify the Commission and all the Member States potentially affected when they intend to take counter measures if necessary, in order to protect the population against the effects of a radiological or nuclear accident."
"The European Community needs to immediately forward this notification to all Member States."
"All the 27 Member States, as well as Switzerland, have signed the ECURIE agreement."
"The Commission emphasises that the ECURIE system is an information-sharing system about nuclear incidents, and the Commission considers that a full transparency approach is the most appropriate response in cases of nuclear incidents."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I recently obtained radiation measurement data from a radioactivity measuring station in Krško which show that in fact, an astonishing peak in radiation levels was recorded the day before the alarm was sounded."
"There has to be an explanation for that."
"With that, we close that particular item. The Commission will take note."
"We will now proceed with our normal business."

"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before all of you, as far as possible, vote in favour of this report, I would like to give you some brief information and voice an appeal to the Council which, yet again, is absent."
"The Member States and the European Union wish to, and must, take more ambitious and effective action against corruption."
"That is why the European Parliament has endorsed the establishment of a contact-point network against corruption."
"The lead committee, at least, has voted unanimously in favour of such a move."
"The purpose of the network is, firstly, to foster cooperation among the authorities and agencies in the Member States and, secondly, to encourage the exchange of data on effective strategies."
"However, the Council proposal before us is quite simply too lacking in ambition and is toothless and thus redundant as it stands."
"Parliament has therefore tabled a number of very significant amendments, with unanimous support, as I said, being achieved in committee."
"Firstly, OLAF, Europol and Eurojust should be integral parts of this network, which is why we are asking for their participation to be mandatory."
"Secondly, the network should submit an annual report to the European Parliament on its activities, with practical proposals on how to improve the prevention and combating of corruption."
"Thirdly, the costs of all of the network members should be borne from the Community budget, so as to ensure the independence of the network as a whole."
"I therefore urge the Council to incorporate Parliament's proposals and establish the contact-point network swiftly, for this would give us a unique opportunity finally to achieve a joint strategy for the European Union and establish an appropriate mechanism to combat corruption."

"Community system against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing ("
"- Before the vote:"
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the fisheries sector is experiencing a serious crisis at present, not just because of the increase in the price of diesel, for which sustainable, global proposals must be put forward and not just temporary solutions, but also because of the poor management of fisheries resources, over-fishing by the European fishing fleet and the increase in the number of products of illegal fishing that find their way onto the European market."
"This highly lucrative illegal fishing speeds up the deterioration of fish resources and marine ecosystems and destabilises the entire sector, which is feeling the full force of this unfair competition."
"The proposal by the European Commission and this report are thus essential elements in the implementation of sustainable, responsible fishing that enables European fishermen to earn a living."
"This report was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Fisheries."

"Mr President, I would like to put on record that, if we call for the sending of an ESDP border mission to Georgia, then we should also consider in the near future sending an EU police mission to Georgia."
"(PL) Mr President, I cannot support today's resolution on Georgia because I consider it to be unduly biased."
"The situation in the Caucasus is more complex than the text of the resolution now before us suggests."
"I should like to remind the House that Georgia has Stalin to thank for its present borders."
"The latter are the result of the policy Stalin, who was himself a native of Georgia, conducted in the 1920s and 1930s."
"In addition, the policy conducted by the Georgians during the 1990s did a lot to make the authorities in Suckhumi wish to break with Georgia."
"Furthermore, I cannot understand why the same Members who only recently so enthusiastically supported the independence of Serbian Kosovo are now denying two historical nations in the Caucasus the right to self-determination."
"I do, however, support the international efforts to promote dialogue and the peace process in the Caucasus."
"Mr President, I would like to support the original amendment by my colleague, James Elles, who has proposed a new paragraph which declares that the EU recognises the substantial contribution to the protection of the EU from long-range ballistic missiles to be provided by the planned deployment of the European-based US missile defence assets."
"- (NL) Mr President, the resolution on the EU-US Summit does, of course, cover a very large number of different topics."
"A number of positions from this resolution are, for me, completely unacceptable, while others are extremely valuable."
"I had no choice, therefore, but to abstain."
"What I would like to add here, however, is that this resolution should, in the first place, have included a clear passage pointing out to the United States that it should not interfere with the potential expansion of the European Union."
"The way in which the United States regularly intervenes to champion the unacceptable Turkish case is, in my view, unacceptable interference in a European affair."
"The United States must realise that there is a great difference between the interests of NATO on the one hand, and the interests of the European Union and the people of Europe on the other hand."
"Turkey cannot join the European Union because it is not a European country."
"As far as this is concerned, we are asking for no more and no less than respect on the part of the United States."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am taking the subject of compensation for prisoners at Guantánamo, addressed in this report, as an opportunity to recall that there is another case of civilian and military prisoners still to be resolved: it involves a Member State, indeed a founder member of the European Union."
"Yesterday, Italy's supreme Court of Appeal found in favour of the Italian military and civilian detainees who were seeking compensation for the work they performed in prison camps during the Second World War."
"This is an unresolved moral issue, which I have attempted to draw to the attention of the President of this House on several occasions."
"I have also raised it with Chancellor Merkel in this House: she stated in her personal capacity that she agreed on the need to settle the matter."
"Now that the attempts of the Federal Republic of Germany to delay the decision in court have finally been thwarted, one wonders whether - more than sixty years after the end of the war - Germany will now decide to compensate Italy's military detainees."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Veraldi very much for his report on young farmers."
"I think that we live in a world now where food production is becoming very important again and we have to look to the future."
"One of the ways of looking to the future of agriculture is through young farmers."
"With the reform of the common agricultural policy, we now have the health check to look particularly at things which will help young farmers, and that is reduction in bureaucracy and abolishing quotas so that young farmers can go into milk production, which is one of the ways that they have always got into farming."
"We also have to look a little bit further towards some sort of venture capital schemes, because one of the problems facing young farmers is they have very little collateral when they want to start farming."
"Very often banks will not give them the necessary cash to start, so I think we have to look forward to that as well."
"I believe that young farmers can link into food production, they can link into niche markets, and they can produce the type of food in the regions that we want and really link into the market place."
"I welcome the report and I look forward to supporting young farmers."
"(FR) Mr President, I voted in favour of this report because if there is no acceptable future for young farmers, there will be no future for European agriculture."
"For many reasons relating to food safety, the supply of quality products, the environment, and preserving our beautiful mountainous landscapes and vineyards, we need to implement positive actions to encourage young people to work in the agricultural sector, to take over the family business."
"However, above all I would like to express my satisfaction that, on the basis of my initiative in the Committee on Agriculture, the European Parliament has just added an amendment to draw specific attention to the importance of providing information about the status of partners assisting farmers."
"I would like to point out in this regard that in 1997 - more than 10 years ago - this Parliament adopted by a vast majority my report on the status of assisting spouses in the agricultural sector."
"In our resolution, we stressed in particular that Member States should ensure that all assisting spouses in the agricultural sector are eligible for insurance cover for retirement pensions."
"The Commission did not follow this through."
"We have such a system in my country: compulsory insurance."
"That example should be followed and we need a framework directive to achieve that."
"(DE) Mr President, I wish to point out that I abstained in the vote on this report, but not because I disagree with the view that young farmers need support."
"I strongly believe that they do indeed require support, for young farmers undoubtedly face greater problems than many other farmers."
"The reason why I abstained had to do with the vote on paragraph 4, which makes reference to the situation of young farmers in the so-called new Member States."
"In my view, now that almost an entire legislative term has elapsed, it is surely time to drop the reference to the so-called 'new' Member States and treat them as full Member States of equal value, for in my opinion, they are now well-established as such."
"(PL) Mr President, since the end of the Second World War we have worked hard to achieve the period of peace and stability we now enjoy."
"Even so, we are today threatened by terrorism, regional conflicts and international crime."
"The European Union's role in the contemporary world should be to spread peace, democracy, and freedom across the globe."
"The Union should also ensure stability, and combat humanitarian disasters and mass violations of human rights."
"That is the vision enshrined in the European common foreign and security policy."
"We are jointly responsible for ensuring security at global level."
"Security now involves more than resolving international conflicts and protecting borders."
"A wider interpretation of security is needed."
"We must place greater emphasis on the types of security that are not covered by the European common foreign and security policy, namely food security and energy security."
"It ought to be borne in mind that the desired objective can only be achieved through cooperation and the exchange of best practice."
"Coordinated action is essential both at Member State level and between the various European institutions."
"There must also be collaboration with NATO and cooperation with other regional and global organisations."
"(EL) Mr President, I am asking to speak because we have just voted by an overwhelming majority in favour of making EUR 90 million available from the EU's Solidarity Fund to Greece in the wake of last summer's disastrous forest fires."
"European public opinion was shocked by last summer's disaster."
"Today's European Parliament decision is a gesture of real solidarity with the regions and citizens who were severely affected last August."
"Let me thank all my fellow Members in the Committee on Budgets, and you as well, ladies and gentlemen, for the most interesting and rapid work we have accomplished and for the very successful hearing we have organised."
"Allow me to make one final point, Mr President: we are perhaps the only parliament in the world which manages to stifle good news."
"Today we have an important decision on the allocation of money to Greek citizens."
"For technical rather than political reasons, we have, unfortunately, not been able to make the decision by means of a debate."
"I regret this, but the effectiveness of the decision is more important than anything."
"(PL) Mr President, we are facing a tremendous challenge in terms of how to encourage young people to remain in rural areas."
"There is also a shortage of people willing to go into farming, and to take on the farms run by their parents."
"Young farmers who are starting out come up against many difficulties."
"The latter include a shortage of suitable land, high prices, production limits, lack of start-up capital for investment, expensive loans and strict agri-environmental requirements."
"Almost one third of Polish farmers are young people under the age of 40."
"As a group, they are open to change, technological progress and innovation."
"Young farmers are just like other entrepreneurs."
"They are enthusiastic and are not afraid of new challenges."
"They are also crucial to our future, because the food security of Europe and of the world depends on them."
"They need help to become better qualified, through vocational training and advice."
"In addition, efforts should be made to improve the financial conditions for running a business in a rural area, to eliminate the differences in the pace of development of technical and social infrastructure between rural areas and towns."
"Above all else, stable conditions for development must be ensured."
"Written explanations of vote"
"in writing. - (PT) Following the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 1405/2006 laying down specific measures for agriculture in favour of the smaller Aegean islands, two lines of support (aid for supply and aid for local production) were set up."
"Certain technical aspects must, however, be corrected in order to fully apply this Regulation and these two lines of support, which is why I support the Commission proposal and the Parish report."
"in writing. - We note that the PDAB 3 contains positive measures, such as: to authorise the total figure of €849m owed by Microsoft for abusing their market position; to vote through the funds under the EUSF for Greece and Slovenia; to fully fund the provision of bluetongue vaccine to combat the disease and to provide 50% of the cost of implementation per Member State and provide savings on salaries and pensions for the Institution's staff."
"However, we also note that the PDAB contains undesirable measures such as the salary increase for the Director of the Gender Institute as well as changes to the establishment plan of the European Economic and Social Committee."
"We welcome the criticism of the previous two measures in the Virrankoski report and, while we are against the decision to adopt the PDAB 3 unamended, accept that the raft of positive measures outlined must be voted through this session."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the joint report by my Finnish colleagues Kyösti Virrankoski and Ville Itälä on the third draft amending budget of the European Union for 2008."
"It relates mainly to: the budgeting of the revenue accruing from the Microsoft case (fine and interest totalling EUR 849 200 000); the budgeting of savings arising from the smaller than estimated increase for salaries and pensions of officials in 2007; the reinforcement of the emergency fund for veterinary measures due to the bluetongue crisis (EUR 130 million in commitment appropriations, and EUR 63 950 000 in payment appropriations); the creation of budgetary items to accommodate subsidies for four Joint Undertakings: Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), Clean Sky, ARTEMIS (embedded computing systems) and ENIAC (European Technology Platform on Nanoelectronics), totalling EUR 257.5 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 194.6 million in payment appropriations from the Seventh Framework Programme for Research; and the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund for an amount of EUR 98 million (forest fires in Greece and floods in Slovenia)."
"in writing. - (PT) This draft amending budget covers, among other items, mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund in favour of Greece and Slovenia."
"The aim is to help compensate for the damage caused by the forest fires and flooding which seriously affected the populations of these two countries in 2007."
"The draft also aims to reinforce the emergency fund for veterinary measures due to the bluetongue crisis which has affected several Member States, including Portugal."
"Accordingly, in order to finance 100% of the cost of supply of the vaccine and 50% of the costs incurred in carrying out the vaccination in nine Member States, it is planned to include in the Community budget EUR 130 million in commitments and EUR 63.95 million in payments."
"However, we would highlight the inclusion of over EUR 257 million in commitments and EUR 194 million in payments for the creation of new public-private partnerships in the context of the Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration activities."
"These partnerships cover Innovative Medicines (IMI), 'Clean Sky', European Technology Platform on Nanoelectronics and ARTEMIS for Embedded Computing Systems."
"At the very least, these initiatives need a public development strategy and public investment that are not dependent on private capital interests."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my Finnish colleague Kyösti Virrankoski on the fourth draft amending budget of the European Parliament for 2008."
"It relates solely to the inclusion in the 2008 budget of the surplus of the 2007 financial year, i.e. EUR 1 528 833 290."
"For 2007 the difference between the revenue received (EUR 117.4 billion) and the payments made (EUR 112.9 billion) shows a surplus of EUR 4.5 billion, from which must be subtracted the payment appropriations carried over to 2008, i.e. EUR 3.1 billion."
"To this surplus of EUR 1.4 billion the cancelled EUR 0.2 billion of the appropriations carried over from 2006 to 2007 must be added and the negative balance of monetary exchange of EUR 0.1 billion must be subtracted, giving the 2007 surplus of EUR 1.5 billion."
"This surplus is primarily due to an under-spending in expenditure of just under EUR 1.6 billion."
"I am sorry that, instead of being automatically refunded to the Member States, there was no political debate on allocating this surplus, for example, to financing investment in the trans-European transport networks."
"I still remember the difficulties we encountered when trying to find some EUR 3.5 billion to finance the excellent Galileo project."
"in writing. - (PT) The aim of this amending budget is to include the surplus from the budget year 2007 in the Community budget for 2008."
"This surplus is over EUR 1.528 billion and is due mainly, inter alia, to the delay in approving operational programmes of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund to be transferred to the various Member States."
"The draft also includes amounts not used in 2007 under the EU's common foreign and security policy, such as the 'police mission' to Afghanistan and the so-called 'civil mission' to Kosovo."
"As regards the situation in Kosovo, we would highlight the illegal and illegitimate military/'civil' operation by the US-NATO-EU - in other words, interference, destabilisation, aggression, occupation and unilateral declaration of independence of the Serbian province of Kosovo, with total disregard for international law - and the current 'stalemate in negotiations on the transfer of responsibilities from the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) to EULEX' (European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo) in the United Nations."
"Finally, I want to point out that the 'surplus' from 2007 will reduce the Member States' contributions to the Community budget, in particular as follows: EUR 300 million less for Germany, EUR 258 million less for the United Kingdom and EUR 233 million less for France."
"This is what is known as 'winning every which way'..."
"in writing. - (PL) Mr President, I voted in favour of adoption of the report on the draft amending budget of the European Union No 4/2008 for the financial year 2008 (9904/2008 - C6-0207/2008 -."
"The report by Mr Virrankoski is thorough and to the point."
"I agree with the rapporteur's stance that the balance of each year's budget should be entered in the budget for the subsequent financial year as revenue or expenditure."
"In the case before us it would be the budget for 2008."
"This should be done through an amending budget to be submitted to the Commission."
"in writing. - Conservatives abstained on this report as it forms part of the European objective to develop an area for freedom, security and justice - instead preferring an intergovernmental approach."
"in writing. - (PT) The European Union strategy on the prevention and control of organised crime indicates the need to develop a comprehensive EU policy against corruption in which all the relevant players must actively participate."
"Effective prevention and combating of corruption in Europe therefore depend on the existence of effective and efficient cooperation between the respective authorities and services of the Member States, identifying opportunities, sharing good practices and developing high professional standards."
"For this reason I support the idea of formally establishing an anti-corruption network with contact points in the Member States, the activities of which must be fully associated (within the respective competencies) with other organisations and agencies playing a fundamental role in this fight, as is the case with OLAF (European Anti-Fraud Office), Europol and Eurojust."
"I also support the amendments tabled by the rapporteur, Hubert Pirker, in particular the amendment on the need for transparency and information in relation to the activities and recommendations of this network, which must result in the presentation of an annual report to the Commission and the European Parliament."
"in writing. - (RO) I welcome the Council's decision regarding the contact points network against corruption, aimed at improving cooperation between the authorities fighting against corruption in the EU."
"European cooperation is an essential element in the fight against corruption, especially in the new Member States, where non-governmental organizations and European experts underline the continuing existence of some significant deficiencies, including those within the operation of the legal system."
"The last assessment report of GRECO (The States' Group against Corruption) of the Council of Europe with regard to Romania, outlines, for the year 2007, that our country has implemented only 40% of the anti-corruption measures advised by the European institutions."
"On this occasion, I invite the Romanian rightist government to assume in public the failure of its programmes in the fight against corruption."
"I consider that the fight against corruption should be a major objective of the European Union in order to provide its citizens a space of freedom, security and justice."
"The European Commission (by means of OLAF), Europol and Eurojust should be part of this network."
"Unfortunately, in several of the new EU Member States, including Romania, the fight against corruption is rather used as an election promise and as a political weapon directed against the opposition political parties."
"in writing. - (PT) The establishment of a 'network of contact points' in a framework of cooperation between the various Member States, with the aim of sharing experiences and good practices, could form another asset in the fight against corruption in each country."
"According to the EC Treaty, the Community and the Member States are responsible for adopting measures to combat fraud and protect the Community's financial interests."
"At Community level there is, for example, a need to guarantee more autonomy and resources for the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)."
"However, we dislike the fact that this measure is regarded as an embryo and will be used to promote or will be part of the more general objective of developing the so-called 'area of freedom, security and justice', in line with the 2005 Hague Programme, in particular by bringing justice and home affairs within the Community system."
"This communitisation process is encouraged and ensured by the Treaty now known as the 'Lisbon' Treaty, by removing from the Member States' sovereignty (from their parliaments and other national institutions) those responsibilities which are at the heart of this sovereignty."
"We therefore repeat our reservations about the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor, which is a stage in the process of establishing a future 'European Public Prosecutor's Office' based around Europol, Eurojust and OLAF."
"in writing. - (DE) Corruption is a widespread problem affecting every sector of our society, whether it be the economy, trade unions or the administration."
"After cases of corruption at Siemens that ran into billions, the newspapers are now full of articles about the scandal in the Polish football league."
"Even the EU hits the headlines again and again, and certainly not in a positive way, with accusations of corruption, mismanagement, mis-spending and so on."
"The fact that the Group of States against Corruption (GRECO) is there to pool the anti-corruption efforts of all the Council of Europe members is therefore welcome."
"We must hope that the right lessons will be learned."
"It is not only Bulgaria which must improve its record on combating corruption; the EU must put its own house in order as well."
"We still have far too lax management of EU funds, poor controls, lengthy procedures and virtually no way of recouping EU funding that is paid out incorrectly."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my French colleague Marie-Hélène Aubert, which proposes amending, via the consultation procedure, the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing."
"It has become urgent to tackle this issue because illegal fishing is a serious problem all over the world."
"I unreservedly support this initiative, which, as the rapporteur points out, was proposed by the European Parliament in February 2007."
"I welcome the clarification that access to ports of Member States, the provision of port services, and the conduct of landing, transhipment or on-board processing operations in such ports must be prohibited for third-country fishing vessels except, of course, in cases of distress or force majeure."
"As long as it is not too complex, I am in favour of catch certificates to ensure the traceability of fisheries products."
"in writing. - (PT) Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing is currently one of the main problems facing the management of marine resources."
"It threatens the sustainability of resources and marine biodiversity and has serious economic consequences for fishermen operating within the law."
"As the biggest consumer and importer of fish products, the European Community has particular responsibility in the fight against illegal fishing, in the adoption of solutions preventing these practices from continuing and in the pressure which must be brought to bear on the international community to adopt similar measures."
"The European Parliament report contains 65 proposed amendments which complement the Commission proposal and go against national interests."
"It should be noted that the proposal defines a system applicable to all IUU fishing activities or associated activities, carried out on Community territory or in waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of Member States, which were fully debated and defended during the period of the Portuguese Presidency."
"This document therefore merits my support."
"in writing. - (PT) The sustainability of fish stocks is fundamental to guaranteeing the long-term existence of fishing activity and the socioeconomic viability of the fishing sector."
"Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing threatens this sustainability and calls into question the viability of the sector and fishing communities dependent on it."
"As such, it is vital that measures are adopted to reinforce the fight against these illegal activities, in particular by reinforcing control mechanisms in each Member State."
"This proposal, which complements measures already laid down within the common fisheries policy, introduces various provisions which aim to curb these practices carried out by vessels flying the flag of a Member State or by vessels from third countries."
"The measures proposed therefore include greater control by the Member States at their ports, the requirement for a certificate issued by the flag State indicating that the catch is legal and the creation of a list of vessels involved in IUU fishing."
"However, we would reiterate that any future harmonisation of these proposals with a future revision of the Community legislation on control must safeguard the competences of the Member States, particularly for inspections."
"We would also reiterate that all the issues relating to penalties come under the competence of each Member State."
"in writing. - I welcome my colleague Ms Aubert's report on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing."
"It is in the interests of all fishing communities that IUU is tackled and the EU has a vital role to play in this."
"Nevertheless, the management of fisheries resources should be the responsibility of the fishing nations and the EU must work towards the dismantling of the CFP."
"in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of adoption of the report by Mrs Aubert on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing - C6-0454/2007 -."
"This is a sound report that provides an accurate picture of the problem of illegal fishing, which represents a real threat to the survival of marine resources."
"It therefore seems essential to establish a Community system to combat the aforementioned practice."
"in writing. - Mrs Aubert's report on the Community system against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is a report that I generally support."
"I agree with a number of the rapporteur's proposals."
"To see that Member States provide certification of the legality of the fish that their boats catch, for example, appears fair."
"Europe-wide action is required to counter irregular fishing practices and my vote reflects these views."
"in writing. - (FR) Fishermen in France, Spain and Italy are telling us of their legitimate revolt, their right to make a living, their indignation."
"Small farmers are saying the same."
"For a year the price of fuel has been stifling our fishermen economically."
"This comes on top of the bureaucratic stifling they are experiencing as a result of the quotas, penalties, monitoring and inspections that are transforming the freedom of the high seas into a liquid Soviet Union."
"In the light of the tragedy affecting this profession, what are we proposing to these men, these regions, these villages, these local economies?"
"Nothing!"
"Except vague transitional aid, like palliative care."
"What is worse, on the day that the Mediterranean fishermen are in Brussels to demand their right to live, here we are discussing additional criminal penalties to combat illegal fishing."
"Fishermen are even refused support in terms of VAT and excise duty."
"The solution is a European debt compensation fund for fishermen to ensure that they do not have to put up with the inequality in relation to public burdens, generated by the import policy and the domination of the distribution giants."
"in writing. - Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is a growing problem which requires enhanced cooperation between the EU and the international community if it is to be efficiently tackled."
"To a large extent this proposal by the Commission reflects recommendations made by the Fisheries Committee, specifically Ms Aubert's first report dealing with IUU."
"I fully support the main elements of the proposal which include a ban on the importation of IUU fish and the implementation of port controls which would prohibit access of third country vessels suspected of illegal fishing."
"Until recently, the EU has focused solely on the regulation of its own fishermen, concentrating on making sure that they do not flout EU laws while the practice of IUU was essentially ignored."
"It is encouraging to see that now real efforts are being made by Parliament and the Commission to address this problem."
"in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am voting in favour of the report tabled by our colleague Marie-Hélène Aubert on a Community system to prevent illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing."
"Illegal fishing represents one of the worst threats to the sustainability of fish stocks and marine biodiversity."
"The Commission's proposal is important in enabling the European Union to play a proper leading role within an ever more complex and interconnected sector."
"To this end, I think it desirable that the proposal should apply not only to third-country fishing vessels but also to those flying the Community flag, in order to adopt non-discriminatory measures and introduce a common policy within the European Union."
"There can be no disputing the importance of a certification system to ensure traceability and make it possible to have a label guaranteeing the fish product, in parallel with harmonised, dissuasive sanctions and a system of checks and inspections to minimise illegal fishing activity."
"in writing. - I would like to support the Aubert report and condemn illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing."
"in writing. - ?PL) Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, known as IUU, represents a serious problem."
"In its effort to deal with the problem actively and effectively, the European Union should benefit from the experience of countries which, although they are not Members of the Union, nonetheless have much stricter provisions aimed at combating illegal fishing."
"The countries concerned include Norway, Iceland and Canada."
"First and foremost, we must concentrate on dealing with fisheries infringements within the Union."
"To date, this has been a major problem."
"The next step should involve supporting developing countries wishing to adopt the programme to counter IUU."
"Unfortunately, those developing countries do not have sufficient financial resources for the purpose."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my esteemed Portuguese colleague Duarte Freitas, which, in accordance with the consultation procedure, proposes amendments to the proposal for a Council regulation on the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems in the high seas from the adverse impacts of bottom fishing gears."
"This draft regulation implements the United Nations recommendations of 2006 and applies to EU vessels operating in the high seas in areas that are not regulated by a regional fisheries organisation and thus require flag state regulation."
"Between doing nothing and banning everything, I support the third alternative proposed by the European Union: it involves strictly regulating bottom trawling by defining the conservation and management measures adopted by the regional fisheries organisations (RFOs) and laying down the discipline that flag states must apply in respect of their vessels when these operate in areas of the high seas not regulated by an RFO."
"in writing. - (PT) Some marine ecosystems (such as reefs, seamounts, hydrothermal vents, cold water corals or cold water sponge beds) are, by their very nature, vulnerable to the use of certain fishing gear."
"This proposal aims to protect these ecosystems in the high seas, particularly in areas not regulated by a regional fisheries management organisation."
"While fundamentally agreeing with the proposal presented and with the report adopted, we would, however, reiterate that certain aspects of the proposal should be clarified."
"For example, as regards the definition of 'vulnerable marine ecosystem', the report highlights the need to wait for an FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) definition according to the 'best scientific information available', bearing in mind the lack of in-depth scientific knowledge of these ecosystems."
"In addition, we would also highlight the need to distinguish between the consequences of using different gear, by carrying out scientific fishing research to determine their potential impacts on stocks and the seabed."
"Finally, we also feel it is appropriate to reiterate that the issues of inspections or observation missions on fishing vessels come under the competence of each Member State, particularly as new federal levels to the common fisheries policy have been announced."
"in writing. - The Freitas report relates to vulnerable marine ecosystems in the high seas."
"The high seas fall outwith the responsibility of any nations or fisheries organisations and fishing activities have been largely unregulated."
"It is appropriate that the EU takes action in this area, given the international nature of the fisheries."
"This distinguishes the high seas from coastal waters, where the most appropriate control bodies are in the fishing nations themselves, not the EU institutions."
"in writing. - (FI) The EU's Maritime Policy is one of the main initiatives for which the current Commission will be remembered in a good light."
"This proposal for a Council regulation on the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems in the high seas from the adverse impacts of bottom fishing gears is a necessary addition to the EU's strategy."
"When a halt to biodiversity loss was made an objective at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002, the year 2010 was set as the deadline."
"Now, to our regret, we have to say that that aim is not going to be achieved in two years' time."
"Although environmental targets have been at the top of the world's political agenda for more than twenty years now, many factors still threaten maritime biodiversity."
"Scientific research has shown that, in spite of the high yields associated with deep sea fishing, poorly organised fishing practices can lead to the destruction of certain species in less than 10 years."
"We need to remember that, although such new approaches as these applied in the fishing sector are necessary, woefully little is known about the recovery of deep sea fish species, and all in all the threats to the deep sea ecosystems are much greater."
"This proposal for a regulation on the fishing industry is nevertheless a clear and necessary one."
"in writing. - The protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems is essential in order that future generations can enjoy the marine environment."
"in writing. - (FR) With its vote the European Parliament is putting in place strict principles to regulate the activities of Community vessels using bottom fishing gears in the high seas, in zones not regulated by regional fisheries organisations."
"Conforming to the recommendations of the United Nations General Assembly, the spearhead in this area, the Members are putting an end to the legal vacuum that allowed the irreparable destruction of our marine ecosystems to take place."
"I am pleased that the Members of the European Parliament have recognised that the deep-sea ecosystems are an important source of marine biodiversity and that the shift in the fishing effort towards these habitats risked destroying our heritage."
"The ecological conscience of the Members of the European Parliament does not seek to make the already difficult work of our fishermen even more complex, nor to increase the bureaucratic pressure."
"From now on, fishing activities in these specific areas will require a permit and be subject to a prior assessment, which will be carried out by the Member State, to ensure that they will not cause any significant damage."
"The precautionary principle also comes into play here."
"Preservation of marine biodiversity will only be guaranteed if it is integrated vertically into the other Community policies, notably the EU's future maritime policy."
"in writing. - (IT) Mr President, I welcome the Commission's objectives of simplifying, stabilising and clarifying trade rules and procedures."
"Trade is a key instrument in the current international scenario, serving as a means both of improving the efficiency of international markets and ensuring social and cultural growth for the nations concerned."
"Trade agreements between countries can guarantee political stability and lay solid foundations for reasonably durable diplomatic agreements."
"They are therefore increasingly becoming the main factors in a world ever more dominated by economic relations which, as well as influencing the flow of cultural exchanges between peoples, help to avoid military confrontation and maintain peace."
"Trade therefore represents an extremely important vector of dialogue and an opportunity for economic and social development."
"Making trade less rigid means making the economic system more efficient."
"Given the significance of the matter in hand, I hope that this House will shoulder its share of responsibility for achieving these objectives."
"in writing. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Audy's report calls for the harmonisation of import and export procedures with a view to ensuring the smooth application of the European Union's trade policy and, above all, consistent application at all the entry points to the EU in order to make life easier for businesses."
"That might seem logical because we have been part of a customs union for more than 40 years."
"However, Mr Audy wants the procedures to be completely harmonised and entrusted to a single European customs service."
"The customs authorities are responsible for monitoring the movements of goods and ensuring that they comply with the standards laid down (product safety, consumer protection, health, environment, etc.)."
"They also have a fiscal function: they apply appropriate customs duties, of course, but they also deal with VAT, which, with all due respect, is still a national tax."
"Finally, or perhaps above all, they have a security role to play and they participate in the fight against trafficking of all kinds, notably drug trafficking, in close cooperation with the police services."
"It is no surprise that the rapporteur gives priority to the first function, in the name of the virtues of international trade, and underestimates the other two."
"That is why we voted against this report."
"in writing. - I support the recommendations outlined in Jean-Pierre Audy's report 'Implementing trade policy through efficient import and export rules and procedures.'"
"I feel it to be a well balanced report that rightly looks ahead at EC customs law after the Lisbon Treaty and the US '100% scanning law'."
"Indeed, I share the rapporteur's view that a common approach to the EC customs system would address the inherent difficulties of Member States having responsibility for customs implementation."
"I voted in favour of the report."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted for the report regarding the efficient import and export regulations and procedures in the sector of trade policy, which ensure greater efficiency in the customs field, as well as the cooperation among the European customs agencies."
"The European Union market is confronted with the counterfeiting and piracy phenomenon."
"The losses incurred by the violation of intellectual property rights amounted to EURO 62 million in Romania in 2007, according to the analysis conducted by the International Alliance of Intellectual Property."
"The adoption of this report by the European Parliament and the development of the plan for fighting counterfeiting and piracy on a European level will reduce this loss."
"The report welcomes the consensus reached by the Member States and the Commission with regard to the negotiation mandate of an international agreement against counterfeiting (The Commercial Agreement against Counterfeit), as this agreement is of major importance for the EU trade strategy."
"As the European regulations for consumers' protection, mainly the ones concerning health and the safety, are applied for all products within the EU market, the Commission and the Member States are asked to take all the necessary measures so as to effectively monitor a high level of protection for consumers."
"in writing. - (PL) Over 2 billion tonnes of goods pass through the Union's air and sea ports every year."
"The customs services deal with in excess of 100 million customs declarations."
"By so doing, they are protecting the health and safety of European Union citizens."
"The customs services are also involved in practices connected with counterfeiting goods."
"This is a growing and increasingly dangerous phenomenon concerning not only fashionable luxury goods but also medicines, toothpaste and skincare products."
"The customs services are seizing counterfeit spare parts for motor vehicles, such as braking systems."
"Counterfeit sunglasses can cause damage to the wearer's eyesight."
"Combating these practices and putting a stop to them will contribute to better health protection and improved security for the citizens."
"The customs authorities introduced appropriate security checks to protect the internal market."
"Working in close cooperation with important trading partners at international level, they protect international freight transport against the smuggling of goods linked to terrorist activity."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my esteemed German colleague Reimer Böge, which proposes approving as it stands the Commission proposal to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund to assist Slovenia and Greece, which in 2007 were affected by floods and forest fires respectively, to the tune of around EUR 98 million, which should be the subject of an amended budget adopted in parallel."
"In order to avoid any delay in the provision of financial assistance in the case of disasters, I support the recommendation in the report that the Commission propose amending budgets aimed solely at mobilising this Fund, use of which must not exceed EUR 1 billion per year under the current Interinstitutional Agreement."
"in writing. - (PT) The severe forest fires that devastated Greece in the summer of 2007 and the serious flooding in Slovenia in September 2007 justify this (second) mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund for 2007."
"This Fund has an annual ceiling of EUR 1 billion, of which around EUR 163 million has already been used at the request of the United Kingdom following the floods that hit that country in 2007."
"An amount of around EUR 837 million is therefore still available."
"The proposal adopted today provides for the allocation of nearly EUR 90 million to Greece and around EUR 8 million to Slovenia."
"This is peanuts compared with the damage suffered by the populations of these two countries which, in the case of Greece, exceeds EUR 2 billion."
"However, there is at least one question that must be answered: how is it possible that it is only now, nearly one year after the disasters suffered by these populations, that EU funding is being made available?"
"Clearly there is something wrong here..."
"We would point out that we have presented proposals to speed up the procedures for mobilising this Fund, to ensure that regional disasters remain eligible and to recognise, within this Fund, the specific nature of natural disasters in the Mediterranean, such as drought and fires."
"in writing. - (PL) The proposal to mobilise the Solidarity Fund once again is contained in amending budget No 3/2008."
"The previous application benefiting the United Kingdom (EUR 162 million) together with the application currently under consideration to benefit Greece and Slovenia (totalling EUR 98 million) leaves considerable scope for manoeuvre in the second half of 2008, bearing in mind that the annual ceiling for Solidarity Fund resources is approximately EUR 1 billion."
"Furthermore, other formal requirements contained in the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006 have been met."
"The Committee on Budgets was able to obtain all necessary additional clarification at the meeting in May attended by representatives of the countries that suffered natural disasters in 2007."
"The countries concerned were Greece, which was affected by forest fires, and Slovenia, which was affected by floods."
"As is customary in such cases, the only concerns relate to the time it takes for the Union's institutions to react."
"This issue has been raised ad nauseam."
"The applications by Greece and Slovenia were received in October and November of 2007."
"The amending budget was submitted by the European Commission on 14 April 2008."
"Although this does indeed indicate that the process was swifter than in the past, the pace remains unsatisfactory."
"There is therefore all the more reason to highlight the swift response by the European Parliament, and the good cooperation between the Committee on Regional Development and the Committee on Budgets, regarding favourable consideration of the proposal concerning aid for the affected countries."
"in writing. - I welcome the action taken to help Greece and Slovenia recover from 2007's forest fires."
"In pledging EUR 89.7 million and EUR 8.3 million to Greece and Slovenia respectively the EU has shown that it is committed to fostering solidarity among its members."
"I therefore voted in support of Reimer Böge's report on the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund."
"in writing. - (DE) Natural disasters cause not only immeasurable suffering and numerous deaths; they also destroy essential permanent infrastructure such as electricity transmission lines, roads and bridges."
"Besides caring and providing for the injured, it is therefore essential to repair and remedy the damage as swiftly as possible."
"Given that such damage is often extensive, it was decided in 2002 that in such cases, the EU should provide the victims with financial support."
"Of course it is important to ensure that the monies are not used inappropriately, but this should not result in a 12-month delay, on average, in the disbursement of these funds, as noted by the Court of Auditors."
"in writing. - (PT) The general aim of the proposal presented by the European Commission is to continue the EU-wide liberalisation of scheduled and occasional coach and bus services - in particular between the various countries within the EU and between these and third countries, including cabotage operations - as from 1 January 2009."
"The following are some of the many aspects that we reject:"
"those aiming to limit the competence of a state to manage passenger road transport on its territory, particularly in defence of this public service (not to be confused with the so-called 'public interest service' which is privately owned, but financed with public funds);"
"removing the concept of 'working time' and solely referring to 'driving time' and 'rest periods', which aims to increase the exploitation of drivers;"
"the (re)introduction of the 'twelve-day derogation', in other words the possibility of deferring the weekly rest period for 12 consecutive periods of 24 hours which, in our opinion, could lead to situations endangering the safety of road transport professionals and passengers."
"Look at the situations that already occur under more restrictive rules with regard to working time and rest periods."
"Hence the reason for our vote against the proposal!"
"in writing. - (PL) I should like to express my support for the report by Mr Grosch on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the common rules for access to the market for coach and bus services (recast)."
"The aim of this report is to identify the best possible solution for both regular and occasional services."
"Its main objective is to simplify legal provisions concerning the provision of bus and coach services."
"At present, access to this market is governed by two Regulations, pursuant to which occasional international transport services have been liberalised."
"In the case of regular international services, there is still a clear need for simplifying measures to be introduced regarding the issue of authorisations to provide such services in all Member States of the European Union."
"The legal framework should be streamlined, notably by merging the aforementioned Regulations, tightening cooperation between the Member States and introducing sensible provisions."
"Such measures would greatly simplify the international flow of goods and improve control, as a result of harmonisation of documentation and procedures."
"I am also pleased to note the proposed simplification measures relating to regular transport services in border areas."
"The matter of transit journeys by coach and bus has been dealt with well too."
"If such transit takes place, the competent authorities in the relevant Member State will only be informed that authorisation has been granted by those European Union Member States affected by the particular transport service."
"in writing. - (PT) The Grosch report is one of a series of texts on road transport activity and its rules in the European area."
"This recasting aims to reinforce the capacity and competence of national authorities for issuing or withdrawing licences to or from a carrier in the event of serious infringements of Community legislation."
"Instances of serious infringement and also the conditions for establishing non-discriminatory sanctions proportional to the seriousness of the infringement have therefore been clarified."
"To help with assessment, Member States will therefore have access to a register of serious infringements committed by road transport undertakings, linked to the national register of these undertakings."
"I believe that this recasting will result in more administrative simplification and greater legal security for this economic activity and also for undertakings complying with the rules."
"Will this mean that we can finally hope for a real road transport market for coach and bus services that is open and competitive and that guarantees the most stringent conditions in terms of road safety?"
"in writing. - (IT) I am voting in favour of the report put forward by our colleague Mathieu Grosch on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for access to the market for coach and bus services."
"I agree with the proposal to liberalise coach and bus services within the Member States, not only so as to simplify the European legislative framework in this area but also so as to enhance cooperation among EU countries."
"In order to do this it is necessary to standardise identity and identification documents throughout the united Europe, in order to facilitate the checks that a Member State is entitled to carry out when passengers, as well as transiting through that state, engage in cabotage operations."
"To this end, I hope that the authorities of Member States whose territory is crossed will be given prior information."
"in writing. - (RO) The new amended form of the report observes the agreement between the social partners regarding the reintroduction of derogation from the 12 resting days for coach drivers carrying out international passengers transport."
"I voted for amendment 31 establishing the conditions applicable for drivers employed in an international transport service for the delay of the weekly rest period of up to 12 consecutive periods of 24 hours which follow the period preceding the weekly rest."
"These conditions are: the international occasional transport service must include at least 24 hours in a Member State or a third country, other than the one in which the service started; the weekly rest period after the application of derogation must always be at least a normal weekly rest of 45 hours; a compensatory rest period of 24 hours is effectuated constantly before the end of the third week following the derogation implementation; in the case that the driving period is carried out without interruption between the hours 22.00-6.00, the vehicle is provided with two drivers or the driving period is reduced to three hours; starting with January 1st 2014, the implementation of this derogation is possible only in the case of vehicles provided with recording equipment according to the European regulations."
"We have chosen to vote for this report."
"The hygiene package has given rise to debate in several Member States, including Sweden."
"In the great majority of cases, however, the problem has not been the legislation in itself but the implementation of the legislation by the national authorities."
"The EU is sacrificing public health for the sake of the profits of European monopolies, which are demanding fewer checks and restraints."
"A typical example of EU policy is the latest food scandal of sunflower oil mixed with petroleum, with its disastrous effects on health."
"Instead of taking measures to step up restraints on the uncontrolled proceedings of multinationals, the EU and the Member States' governments are merely intervening on exports of sunflower oil from Ukraine."
"At the same time, the EU Food Safety Directive is allowing oils and other liquid cargoes intended for human consumption to be carried by container ships transporting petroleum oils and other toxic fluids."
"On the pretext of reducing administrative costs for small businesses, the Commission proposes to make yet another exception to the Food Safety Directive, which in itself is inadequate."
"Checks on food will be made even more difficult because large multinationals are using monopolies to hide behind in order to avoid any responsibility while carrying on activities that are dangerous and very damaging to public health."
"Safe food, in sufficient quantities and at low prices for the workers, is unlikely to be available unless there is a shift in EU policy that serves the interests of the food multinationals and the increase in their profits."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted against the Schnellhardt report on the hygiene of foodstuffs because I consider that the Commission's proposed amendment of Regulation (EC) No 852/2004, aimed at exempting small and medium-sized enterprises operating in the food sector from the application of the HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point) system, is not currently justified given that to date there is no evidence of specific problems with the application of this procedure."
"I consider that 2009, the date when this Regulation must be reviewed, would be the right time to propose any amendments, if they are justified."
"in writing. - (PT) The European Parliament today adopted, at first reading, a report on the exemption of food business operators from the Regulation on the hygiene of foodstuffs."
"This exemption shall apply to micro-enterprises which sell foodstuffs and not to supermarkets or franchised supermarket chains."
"Experience in Portugal shows that this exemption is essential both to defend traditional gastronomy and its associated habits and customs, and to protect family enterprises, which represent a large part of the workers in this sector and which are the ones facing the most difficulties given the competitive imbalance with large groups."
"Furthermore, the introduction, application and maintenance of processes based on the principles of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system, which may be important for large enterprises to guarantee food safety, cannot be equally applied to large and small enterprises, particularly in the catering sector."
"While it is true that the legislation on foodstuffs must guarantee a high level of protection for the lives and health of people and the interests of consumers, this cannot be confused with the end of traditions and attacks on the gastronomic culture of each country and each region."
"in writing. - The EU's regulations on the hygiene of foodstuffs are of importance across the Member States."
"They have however at times proven to be somewhat burdensome on smaller businesses."
"I welcome the proposals to exempt micro-enterprises and accordingly voted in favour of the Schnellhardt report."
"in writing. - (SK) I voted for the report by Mr Horst Schnellhardt because it will result in the reduction of bureaucratic burdens for small and medium-sized enterprises in the food industry, in particular for micro-enterprises (bakeries etc.), it will make business activities more attractive and it will create new jobs."
"The report introduces several changes concerning small and medium-sized enterprises producing and selling food, operating on regional and local markets."
"These are not veterinary regulations."
"When considering the food hygiene package, Parliament wanted above all to ensure the highest possible level of food safety and at the same time to establish a practicable and flexible control mechanism."
"Those small and medium-sized enterprises that can prove that there are no hazards in the area of food hygiene and that the hygiene of foodstuffs is regularly controlled are exempt from HACCP procedures."
"The HACCP system provides a hazard analysis and a critical control point method."
"It was developed in the US in the 1960s by NASA, when the Agency needed to ensure 100% safety of all foodstuffs and nutritional products."
"In 1992 the system was incorporated into European legislation."
"The Food Code of the Slovak Republic refers to HACCP as 'Proper Production Practice'."
"Preparing documentation is complicated and owners of micro-enterprises are discouraged from doing business by unjustifiable bureaucracy."
"Since the hygiene regulations in Slovakia are far stricter than those in the 15 old Member States, it is necessary to harmonise the hygiene rules across the entire EU."
"in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I support Horst Schnellhardt's proposal on the hygiene of foodstuffs."
"This proposal addresses two distinct problems: firstly, reducing red tape in respect of transport costs and conditions, and secondly, adjusting the rules exempting micro-enterprises from the requirements deriving from the HACCP system, aimed at guaranteeing the maximum degree of food safety and ensuring a high level of protection for human life and health, as well as for consumer interests."
"I agree that the HACCP procedures should remain in place: their removal would lessen the likelihood of achieving these objectives, given that the procedures serve the interests of food business operators, enhance food safety standards and levels of responsibility, and guarantee fair competition and flexibility in the free movement of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs intended for consumption within the Community."
"This amendment should, lastly, be extended to and approved by all Member States without exception, laying down safety requirements in no uncertain terms."
"in writing. - (NL) Mr President, if we mean well toward small and medium-sized enterprises, we have to pass laws that they are also able to comply with."
"That also applies to the hygiene regulations for the food sector."
"Last year the Commission presented a proposal to amend the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 to bring them more into line with what is achievable for the smallest enterprises."
"The amendments proposed by the Commission are very useful because they still require small companies to meet hygiene standards but at the same time they relieve them of red tape and of the obligations that are genuinely not feasible for small businesses."
"On the one hand, it is unfortunate that Parliament has not completely followed the Commission."
"On the other hand, I voted for the final report because we have been able to make some progress towards a solution."
"I still regret the fact that the responsibility is being shifted on to the Member States."
"Member States will now have to take up their responsibility and allow their small and medium-sized enterprises to depart from the strict HACCP requirements."
"in writing. - (RO) The Regulation No 11 on eliminating discrimination in terms of tariffs and transport conditions requires carriers to hold a transport document which should contain, among others, the distances, routes and borders passage points."
"In the field of transportations, the proposal aims at the reduction of certain obligations to provide statistics in the transportations field."
"Yet, as far as this modification is concerned, only the European Parliament has been consulted."
"I voted for amendment no. 12, submitted by the European Socialist Group, afferent to Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs, in which the competent bodies are allowed to exempt economic agents in the foods sector from the implementation of one or several of the imposed measures, provided that these bodies are capable of proving that there is no risk that must be avoided, or that all identified risks are sufficiently and regularly controlled by means of application of the general and special requirements of hygiene of foodstuffs."
"This refers to bakeries, butcheries, fruit and vegetables shops and, mainly, to market stands."
"I regret the fact that this amendment did not gather the necessary majority."
"The quality of goods and services is becoming an issue of increasing importance to European society."
"Quality is a factor in competition between enterprises."
"One way is which quality is demonstrated is through possession of the relevant certificate of compliance with quality standards."
"The most widespread and most respected standards are the ISO 9000 series standards."
"The HACCP system was officially accepted by the World Health Organisation in 1975."
"In 1993 it was adopted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission as an appropriate tool with which to regulate the production of food."
"It is considered that a properly implemented HACCP system, together with a quality control system compliant with the ISO 9000 standards is the best way to ensure the provision of healthy food."
"The fundamental aim of the method and the HACCP system based upon it is to prevent dangers throughout the food chain and ensure the safety of the final product, whilst providing for appropriate reactions should problems arise."
"in writing. - (PT) Directive 96/22/EC prohibits the use of thyrostatic substances, stilbenes, stilbene derivatives, their salts and esters, which are on list A of Annex II, for administration to 'animals of all species', meaning to both animals or animal products used for human consumption as well as to pets."
"However, the two products on list B of Annex II may be used under certain conditions."
"The Commission's amendment proposes:"
"to exclude pet animals from the scope of this Directive, which means that prohibitions on the use of certain substances simply do not apply any more to them and they may therefore be treated with these substances;"
"that the hormone oestradiol 17 ß which was temporarily allowed to be used for farm animals for the treatment of foetus maceration or mummification or for pyrometer will now be banned completely."
"The fourth application for oestrus induction in cattle, horses, sheep or goats was granted only until October 2006 and has already expired."
"This substance is considered to be carcinogenic and alternatives now exist on the market so that the use of this hormone is redundant and can be banned completely."
"in writing. - (PT) The Commission proposes to exclude pet animals from the scope of Council Directive 96/22/EC which would enable their treatment with substances having a thyrostatic action and with beta-agonists."
"This important measure is intended to reduce the suffering of pet animals and will allow the use, for example, of substances having a thyrostatic action for the treatment of hyperthyroidism in these animals."
"However, the most recent developments in scientific assessment tell us that using these substances is economically unattractive in animal production for human consumption or can be replaced with alternative substances."
"It is therefore proposed to prohibit entirely the use of oestradiol 17 ß and its esters in animal production for human consumption, putting an end to the various derogations that still exist today."
"I would point out that these hormones, when used to promote growth, can be carcinogenic to human beings and that the existing derogations can finally be ended as these hormones can be replaced with alternative substances without any problems."
"These changes will ensure a high level of protection for consumers of meat and animal derivatives while at the same time allowing the treatment and reduction of suffering of pet animals."
"in writing. - (PL) I support the report by Mrs Scheele on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council directive 96/22/EC concerning prohibition on the use in stockfarming of certain substances having a hormonal or thyreostatic action and of beta agonists."
"This report represents an effort to find an optimum solution catering both for the need to protect human beings, the consumers, and the need to ensure animal welfare."
"The report also takes account of scientific research in this area of veterinary science."
"In particular, I welcome the complete ban on the use of the hormonal substance named oestradiol 17 β in the rearing of animals raised for meat production."
"I believe the ban is entirely appropriate."
"Priority must be given to the effort to achieve an appropriate level of food safety, especially bearing in mind that the products referred to in the Directive can cause serious cancers in human beings."
"On the other hand, the proposed changes provide for effective treatment of pet animals, such as those suffering from hyperthyroidism or other distressing conditions."
"There is therefore provision for the health of both pet and farm animals."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my German colleague Helmuth Markov, adopted unanimously in the Committee on International Trade, which proposes amending, in accordance with the consultation procedure, the proposal for a Council regulation applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences for the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011 and amending various Regulations."
"This proposal for a regulation conforms to the 2004 guidelines on the role of the GSP for the 10-year period between 2006 and 2015, which introduced a number of new objectives, such as targeting preferences on countries that most need it, enlarging the product coverage of the GSP to products of interest for developing countries, making the graduation system more transparent and stable and introducing a new special incentive scheme to encourage sustainable development and good governance."
"I fully support the report's call for the European Parliament to be more closely involved in this GSP policy, which is crucial for the countries that need it and which costs us EUR 3.5 billion each year in loss of customs revenue."
"in writing. - (IT) In a society now dominated by a globalised economic market, in a world where three billion human beings live on less than two dollars a day and more than one billion survive on just one dollar, stimulating economic development in the so-called third world by means of appropriate trade policies is a duty incumbent upon the Community institutions."
"In order to achieve this shared goal, we must seek adequate means of both bringing about an improvement in the economic circumstances of developing countries and gradually, increasingly, integrating them into the world market."
"In addition, over and above purely economic factors such as market share, other criteria must be borne in mind, such as the beneficiaries' levels of development and commitment to embark on the road to democracy."
"Encouragement should moreover be given to those products which are often distinctive of a given country's economy."
"While pursuing these goals, however, we must take care not to restrict the developing countries' economies to producing a limited range of goods, especially if these are low added-value products, since that would hamper - rather than foster - development and economic growth in those countries."
"in writing. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Markov's report on the system of preferential customs duties granted to developing countries is an act of faith in the beneficial effects of global free trade, particularly for the poorest countries."
"However, when I turn on the television and watch the news it seems that it is in those countries that famines are taking place."
"It seems that it is the choice of the major export crops, to the detriment of the local crops designed to ensure food independence, that is one of the causes of these tragedies."
"It seems that 38 years of preferential systems have not made much of an impact on the economic and social situation of these countries and their populations."
"It seems that if a system takes so long to generate the benefits purported by its ideological supporters, it if leaves so many people behind, in all countries, if it accentuates inequalities and poverty, it is no longer time to modify it along the way; it is quite simply time to abandon it."
"in writing. - (PT) As we have highlighted previously, the current Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) is based on a logic that is in itself contradictory."
"In other words, development is promoted in order to liberalise international trade through a model promoting exports, regulated at world level, with a 'centre' and a 'periphery'."
"This logic prevents fair international relations and aid for the development of the endogenous factors of less economically developed countries, without which - together with the theft of foreign debt and the imposition of the interests of large multinationals from the US, EU and Japan - these countries will continue to have a peripheral and subordinate status."
"Trade is a component of development but is far from being the most important."
"The GSP guarantees preferential access for products originating from a very wide range of countries."
"The GSP applies to products of particular importance for Portugal (canned tuna, tomato concentrate, textiles and clothing)."
"Textiles and clothing are particularly affected, especially due to the existence of a high graduation threshold for the sector."
"This and other negative aspects need to be changed, otherwise there will be serious consequences for the national productive sector which will result in social and economic consequences."
"in writing. - (PL) Mr President, the treatment meted out to Georgia by Russia is simply unacceptable by international standards."
"It is abundantly clear that Russia is exploiting its economic influence in many EU countries to see how far it can pursue its neo-imperialistic ambitions."
"It is doing its utmost to block all relations between Georgia and the West."
"I wish to stress once again that EU or UN forces should immediately replace Russia's so-called peacekeeping armed forces in Abkhazia."
"The European Union should constantly demonstrate full support for Georgia, as has been the case in the House today."
"In addition, the Union should systematically strengthen cooperation and immediately introduce visa facilitation measures for Georgians, especially now that fully democratic elections have been held."
"The resolution adopted today is an expression of precisely that kind of support for a sovereign Georgia."
"I am glad that it was at the initiative of Law and Justice Members that a debate was held in the European Parliament at the beginning of May."
"That debate resulted in today's resolution, which represents Europe's official stance on the issue of Georgia."
"in writing. - (PT) Among the various important aspects that could be highlighted in relation to this resolution, I must point out the profound hypocrisy of those who are currently reiterating their full support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a state when they are the same ones who instigated and supported the illegal and illegitimate 'operation' by the US-NATO-EU against Yugoslavia."
"This operation was an example of interference, destabilisation, aggression and military occupation and culminated in the unilateral declaration of independence of the Serbian province of Kosovo, with total disregard for international law."
"Once again we are seeing clear signs - which we reject - of interference and reinforcement of the presence, including the military presence, of the US-NATO-EU in this region which is increasingly important in geostrategic terms."
"See, for example, the conclusions of the recent NATO Summit in Bucharest where a political commitment was made on the accession of Georgia to this offensive military alliance."
"See, for example, the calls for 'deeper European involvement' and 'bolstering the international presence in the conflict zone by sending an ESDP border mission' (in other words, a mission from the EU which contains 21 member countries of NATO and in which the ESDP - European Security and Defence Policy - is the European pillar of NATO)."
"See, for example, the initiatives to set up 'broad and comprehensive free trade agreements' between the EU and Georgia."
"in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of adoption of the resolution on Georgia."
"The people of Georgia need our support and solidarity."
"Solidarity is not so necessary when all is well and everyone is happy."
"It is very much needed, however, in times of difficulty and hardship."
"The people of Georgia are currently experiencing hardship."
"We should not only show the people of Georgia our support, but also do all in our power to protect them and their country from a conflict with potentially tragic consequences."
"There are strong indications that Georgia and Russia were recently on the brink of armed conflict."
"It is our duty to convince all sides to opt for peaceful political solutions."
"I am convinced that even the most difficult problems can be resolved through negotiation, by seeking compromise and being guided by the principles of goodwill."
"I hope too that the international community will actively and effectively support the mediation process and the search for a permanent and just solution acceptable to both sides."
"In addition, the situation in Georgia demonstrates how important our neighbourhood policy is for our policy as a whole."
"This is particularly true of the Eastern dimension of the neighbourhood policy."
"in writing. - (FR) Our message is clear: we are denouncing the dangerous escalation of the conflict in this region and reiterating the EU's support for Georgia."
"The recent developments in Georgia, and more specifically in Abkhazia, are of great concern."
"A deterioration of the links between Georgia and Russia could be the start of a negative spiral for the Caucasus region."
"I was part of the delegation that visited Georgia to observe the elections on 21 May 2008 and I witnessed the intense efforts being made by Tbilisi in its democratisation process."
"This significant progress, which I observed when monitoring 14 polling stations in the Gori area, should not obscure the difficulties that persist in the region."
"Much remains to be done and the EU will have to play its role, over and above observing the elections, by providing long-term support for a reform process."
"The EU must learn from the Balkan experience: it cannot stand idly by when faced with a conflict on its doorstep."
"In approving this resolution, I am calling on the two sides in the conflict to refrain from carrying out any further acts that could result in an escalation of the tension."
"It is essential to focus our efforts on rebuilding dialogue and persuading Russia to withdraw its troops from Abkhazia."
"in writing. - British Conservatives reject much of Paragraphs 6 and 8 which refer to ESDP missions."
"We are against ESDP in principle and do not regard the EU as the appropriate organisation to be undertaking security missions in far-off areas of potential conflict."
"Furthermore we are disappointed that NATO's Bucharest Summit did not extend the invitation for Georgia to join NATO's Membership Action Plan."
"We have chosen to abstain on recital E. The CFSP and the common security and defence policy will probably require increased budgetary resources in future, but we do not want to pre-empt the forthcoming mid-term review of the long-term budget by taking a view on individual parts of it at this stage."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by my esteemed Polish colleague Jacek Saryusz-Wolski on the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) and the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), which have helped to reinforce European identity and the role of the European Union in the world."
"I agree that the CFSP must become more democratically legitimate by allowing Parliament to exercise real control over this policy and speak with a single voice as well and by emphasising various priorities: the causes of the current insecurity in Europe (terrorism, organised crime), energy security, fight against climate change and sustainable development, improvement in the stability of neighbouring regions, crisis management and conflict prevention/resolution, non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, migration management, and promotion of human rights and civil freedoms throughout the world."
"The first of the geographical priorities must be ensuring stability in the Western Balkans and strengthening the dialogue with Serbia and Kosovo."
"I support the idea that the European Parliament should put forward specific proposals on the financing and budgetary control of the future European External Action Service (EEAS)."
"in writing. - (PL) Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Saryusz-Wolski on his report concerning the European Union's common foreign and security policy."
"I agree with the rapporteur that it is not enough simply to speak of a common foreign policy."
"We have to prove that the European Union is prepared to adopt a common position on crucial issues."
"In relation to important matters such as the aggressive energy policy conducted by Russia, the events in Kosovo and the case of Tibet, the Union has recently demonstrated that the CFSP remains a distant goal."
"As long as the European Union allows its credibility on the international arena to be undermined, as in the aforementioned cases, and as long as individual Member States continue to act on a bilateral basis, implementation of the CFSP will continue to be merely an aim."
"There is nothing to be gained from yet another provision on common policy if we do not begin to speak with one voice on matters of vital interest to Europe."
"in writing. - I will be voting in favour of this report."
"I did vote for Green Amendment 7 that complains of President Sarkozy's 'sales offensive on nuclear technology worldwide'."
"I am afraid this macho technology drives far too much of French foreign policy."
"The rumour is that the reason France is the only Member State not to have established diplomatic relations with North Korea is not through any concern with human rights but because of a failure in 2001 of the then South Korean Government to promise the French nuclear industry a disproportionate share of the nuclear contracts associated with the KEDO project to build two light water reactors in North Korea in exchange for the freezing of their graphite-moderated reactor at Taechon capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium."
"France's nuclear obsession makes us all less safe."
"I voted 'no' because I do not want the EU's common foreign policy and armed forces to be strengthened, with all that that entails."
"in writing. - I fully support my own group's Amendment 7 to the Saryusz-Wolski report expressing concern at President Sarkozy's sales offensive on nuclear technology worldwide, which could lead to enhanced nuclear proliferation."
"The people of Scotland take a huge interest in nuclear issues, given that the UK's nuclear weapons are based on our territory."
"Scotland rejects the London government's plans to build a new generation of nuclear weapons and I fully support the Scottish Government's work to ensure these weapons do not come into existence."
"in writing. - Mr Saryusz-Wolski's report on the annual report on the CFSP seeks to define the common values and priorities regarding Europe's global role."
"With the Lisbon Treaty, the EU would have a more effective and coherent voice on international affairs and I welcome the fact that the report deals with the treaty's contribution in this domain."
"I voted in favour of the report."
"in writing. - British Conservatives do not wish to see British foreign policy subsumed by the EU."
"We reject the Treaty of Lisbon, any idea of an EU 'foreign minister' or an EU seat on the UN Security Council, and any EU role in defence."
"We therefore voted against the Report."
"Of course we welcome opportunities for 27 nations to speak with one voice where this is wholly consistent with British foreign policy interests."
"Similarly, we support better coordinated humanitarian action, and a more robust approach in dealing with abhorrent regimes in Zimbabwe, Burma, and elsewhere."
"We have abstained in the vote on all parts which refer to NATO, since we come from a country which has no military alliances."
"As regards Amendment 14, we think that it is factually incorrect to say that the Treaty does not permit military intentions."
"Even now EU resources are being used for military operations, but not for a common EU defence force."
"in writing. - We generally vote against EU legislation and indeed voted against this report as a whole."
"However, we felt that there were a number of amendments we could vote for."
"We voted yes to Amendments 10 and 12, as they reject the militarisation of the EU."
"We too oppose the militarisation of the EU."
"These amendments did not call on the Commission to act, nor did they acknowledge the authority of the Commission or EU."
"They were simple statements that happened to agree with us on this particular question."
"Therefore, we could vote for these two amendments without compromising our overall stance to both this report as a whole and EU legislation in general."
"in writing. - (PT) If you had any doubts about the real meaning, ambition and scope of the so-called Treaty 'of Lisbon', you would only have to carefully read the resolutions on the 'ESDP' (European Security and Defence Policy) and the 'CFSP' (common foreign and security policy), adopted by a majority of this House, for these doubts to disappear."
"The forces promoting 'European integration' - namely the major financial and economic groups, the social democrats and the right - are trying to affirm the EU as an imperialist bloc under the control of its major powers."
"In addition to confirming the EU's policy of interference (as seen in the 'missions' to Afghanistan, Chad/Central African Republic, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo and Guinea-Bissau) and operational capability ('to undertake rapidly and simultaneously two ESDP military operations'), this report is a real guide to militarisation and militarism."
"Just as an example, the report highlights the following objectives: extension of the 'European Security Strategy'; military dimension of 'civil missions'; militarisation of 'development aid' and 'development' as an instrument of interference; reinforcement of means of military transport (A400M military aircraft and helicopters); increase in expenditure on 'defence' and military actions, including using the Community budget; operational capability to conduct EU military actions, and coordination of projects and the armaments industry."
"These, among many others, are the reasons why we voted against this report."
"I voted against the report because I do not want the EU's common foreign policy to be strengthened."
"Besides, I am against the militarisation of the EU."
"in writing. - British Labour MEPs voted in favour of this report which looks at the implementation of the European Security Strategy and the continuing role of ESDP missions."
"In particular Labour MEPs welcome the emphasis in this report on the better functioning of civilian ESDP missions."
"Labour MEPs voted against the text of paragraph 39 looking at the role of Eurocorps."
"While the UK is not involved in Eurocorps, and this force has never been used, Labour MEPs feel it important to emphasise that there are no standing forces under permanent EU command, and we believe that there is no need for such structures."
"in writing. - I welcome Mr Kuhne's report on the annual report on the implementation of the European Security Strategy and ESDP."
"I would agree with the rapporteur that the Lisbon Treaty reinforces the Union's powers by giving the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy a more important role."
"The international nature of the security issues Member States face requires greater European cooperation."
"I would therefore welcome the introduction of a solidarity clause among Member States on such issues."
"I voted in favour of the report."
"in writing. - (IT) Europe's security needs have changed."
"The risk of territorial aggression, implicit in the classic conception of defence, has largely been superseded by the dangers arising at regional borders in areas adjoining the territory of the EU."
"Added to that there is the threat of terrorism and the huge upsurge in migration flows, the radicalisation of fundamentalists and extremists of various kinds, the increase in trafficking and the risk of a proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"For the European Union it is not just a matter of equipping ourselves with the means of acting independently to manage international crises, but of establishing a fully-fledged European defence system."
"However, in the desirable process of expanding its external action capabilities, the EU must not confine itself to the military dimension alone: it must undertake to develop, in parallel, civil crisis management mechanisms involving action by the police, civil administrators, the judiciary, civil protection officers and so on."
"The common security policy must therefore be strengthened in order to give the Union a key role on the international geopolitical scene, a role which is distinct but not distant from that of NATO."
"On this optimistic note I am today voting in favour of the report by Mr Saryusz-Wolski."
"in writing. - (PT) The European Union's ambition in terms of security and defence is clearly less than its ability, and this is not just due to the traditional problem of coordinating and cooperating on external priorities."
"There is also a central issue that must be tackled."
"We know that the external dimension and the establishment of operational capabilities lack personnel, availability and cooperation."
"However, they also require a public perception of the need for, and usefulness of, this cooperation."
"We must construct this strategy based on cooperation - by specifically investing in interoperability and by creating operational capabilities on the ground - but it is particularly public support that is often missing from this dimension of our policies."
"Recognition of the need for, and the importance and effectiveness of, the security and defence dimension depends, to a huge extent, on public support which must be generated, and this support depends, to a large extent, on our efforts."
"Finally, I would stress the importance of remembering that the Atlantic Alliance is a basic pillar of European security and defence which must not and cannot under any circumstances be disregarded."
"in writing. - (FR) The two reports put to the vote today - one on the common foreign policy and the other on the security and defence policy - have one thing in common: they take the Member States' foreign and defence policies away from them to the advantage of the civil servants in Brussels."
"Diplomacy will be in the hands of a High Representative, a real foreign affairs minister."
"In addition, since it is shared, there will be a single defence, under the patronage this time of the United States, via NATO and the UN, as clearly indicated in take two of the European Constitution, the Lisbon Treaty."
"Our military resources are reduced to their simplest expression because the bulk of the budgets is today spent by France and the United Kingdom and subject to the Stability Pact."
"The French and British permanent seats on the UN Security Council will no doubt be combined into one and handed over to an all-powerful European..."
"In short, none of the EU Member States will have the political and military resources to ensure their own independence and freedom."
"In any case, for the most part they have already handed these over to the Eurocrats."
"We are completely opposed to this disastrous development."
"in writing. - (PL) Mr President, I supported the resolution on the EU-United States summit because in addition to matters pertaining to bilateral partnership and global challenges it refers to the visa question, which is an issue of great importance to Polish nationals."
"Polish nationals wishing to visit the United States as tourists still have to go through the complicated and costly procedure of obtaining a visa."
"Approximately 25% of visa applications by Poles are rejected."
"The main, and sometimes the only, reason for rejection is the consular officials' suspicion that the applicant might be intending to undertake illegal work."
"In fact, most Poles travel to the United States to visit relations."
"Some three quarters of the 10 million Poles resident in the United States hail from the Lesser Poland region of my country, which explains why there are such long queues in front of the American consulate in Krakow."
"I believe that the very existence of such a procedure in relation to a European Union Member State requires the Union to adopt a strong stance in the dialogue with the United States."
"in writing. - I wish to raise the issue in the context of this debate of US Missile Defence plans, particularly in respect to the Czech Republic."
"Two thirds of the Czech population are opposed to the building of a radar installation close to Prague as part of these plans."
"Two Czech peace activists have been on hunger strike for three weeks in protest at the Czech Government's obstinate support for these plans, despite little evidence that they will do other than make Europe's security worse rather than better."
"I welcome the fact that these two are now being joined by key political figures each fasting for 24 hours."
"I agree with them that the EU needs to reach a common position on the installation of these Star War technologies in Europe."
"We need an urgent debate in this Chamber with the Council."
"I hope the President will push for this next month."
"Junilistan sympathises wholeheartedly with those parts of the Resolution which deal with the treatment of American prisoners and their transportation through European countries."
"The United States must either bring the captives before a court or release them, in accordance with international law."
"The conditions prevailing at Guantanamo and other prisons are totally unacceptable."
"Unfortunately the report deals with far too many matters going beyond this problem, questions for which other international bodies, in particular the United Nations, are competent."
"We do not think that the European Parliament has a role to play as regards the political situation in countries which are not in the immediate vicinity of the EU, such as Iran, Kosovo or Iraq."
"The European Parliament should also not attempt to expand European foreign policy by calling on other countries to develop cooperation and common strategies on terrorism and weapons of mass destruction."
"These are highly charged questions which are best dealt with from the perspectives of the Member States themselves and in cooperation with legitimate international organisations competent for these matters."
"Junilistan also has strong criticism for that part of the resolution which seeks to allocate large parts of the EU and United States budgets to the sponsorship of agricultural research."
"in writing. - British Labour MEPs are delighted to have voted in favour of this resolution in advance of the EU-US summit on the 10th of June."
"We hope that this resolution will aid in making this Summit a productive one."
"In particular Labour MEPs welcome the call made for the EU and US to work closely together on a wide range of common policy challenges; the call for the EU and US to place the Millennium Development Goals at the heart of international development policy is also one which Labour MEPs wholeheartedly support."
"British Labour MEPs voted to abstain on amendment 8, as we believe that this text does not offer a balanced approach to this issue."
"We believe that discussions must also focus on Russia's obligations, and include wider international disarmament efforts, as explicitly recommended in the successful Socialist Group amendment to the European Security and Defence Policy report, also voted today."
"in writing. - The upcoming US presidential election is an opportunity to move away from the type of foreign policy practised under the Bush administration."
"Such a change should involve Europe and the EU should be looking to strengthen the EU-US partnership, especially when addressing global challenges such as climate change and poverty."
"I support Mr Wiersma's motion for a resolution."
"We, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE), are voting against the joint resolution for the following reasons:"
"• it calls for the imperialist cooperation between the United States and the EU to be strengthened by boosting NATO in order to manipulate and exploit peoples and states;"
"• it confirms the strategic anti-popular EU-US alliance against 'terrorism'."
"However many hypocritical appeals are made to respect human rights, the alliance is nothing more than a pretext for jointly waging a relentless war against the people;"
"• the resolution uses the excuse of the effects of climate change on countries and peoples to prepare the way for new imperialist interventions in league with the United States;"
"• through its policy of treating all sides equally, the resolution in fact supports the occupying Israeli forces and their crimes at the expense of the Palestinian people."
"It accepts the continued occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan and suggests practical cooperation measures between the United States and the EU in the Euro-NATO protectorate of Kosovo."
"The resolution is yet more proof of the irreversible strategic agreement between the EU and the United States at the expense of the people."
"The resolution flaunts political might to show that the EU is supposedly a rival of the United States, which it feels inferior to."
"in writing. - (PT) One of the most surprising facts of European policy is the way in which relations between Europe and the United States are treated, particularly when compared to the methods used to present our relations with other partners who are more politically and culturally different."
"It is clear that there are differences of opinion, disagreements, competition and interests, particularly legitimate economic interests, which put us in different places and positions."
"However, it is essential that we have control over the tensions and divergences between partners in the same project."
"It is important to recognise this so that we can act and react to whatever we are facing."
"In this respect, properly removing the barriers to trade which are unnecessary and unjustifiable between partners such as Europe and the US is one of the first steps to be taken."
"Likewise, if we truly want to respond to the threatened rise in poverty, which is an unnecessary result of increased global demand, it is important that we cooperate among ourselves and in particular with the rest of the world, to ensure that struggling countries can achieve the commercial openness needed to build their own wealth."
"A more prosperous world can be constructed on the basis of a solid alliance between free societies which stimulate creation."
"in writing. - British Conservatives are strong supporters of the Transatlantic Relationship; however, we do not agree on redefining this as a relationship between the EU and the US, particularly in defence matters, and we therefore reject much of paragraph 16."
"in writing. - (PT) While clearly revealing its inter-imperialist contradictions, this resolution reaffirms the cooperation between the EU and the US and the aim of reinforcing their partnership - particularly in light of the forthcoming US presidential election - in sharing 'responsibility' in the world."
"The resolution reaffirms the EU as a European pillar of NATO, as indicated in the 'European Security Strategy', and urges the EU and the US to 'work more closely together on a wide range of common policy challenges, notably in the Middle East, Iran, Iraq, Kosovo and the Western Balkans, Afghanistan and Africa'."
"Looking forward to 60 years of NATO, the resolution calls for the launch of 'a redefined and stronger EU-NATO partnership' and points to the adjustment of the 'European Security Strategy' to the new strategic concept of NATO under discussion."
"In line with the militarism of the Treaty 'of Lisbon', it looks forward 'to a reassessment of the security dimension of EU-US relations in the light of the outcome of the NATO Strategic Review, the update of the European Security Strategy and the arrival in office of a new US Administration'."
"In other words, it establishes and affirms the EU as a political-economic-military bloc which hopes to share control of the world (by seeking to rebalance its relations) with the US."
"The world and the people who are looked after ..."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the joint resolution tabled by five political groups on the Union for the Mediterranean."
"The Mediterranean region and the Middle East are of strategic importance for the Union and it is essential to implement a Mediterranean policy founded on solidarity, dialogue, cooperation and trade in order to tackle the common challenges and achieve the declared objective, namely the creation of an area of peace, stability and shared prosperity."
"I welcome the initiative of the President of the French Republic, Nicolas Sarkozy, to whom this Union for the Mediterranean owes a great deal, and I wish him every success with the inaugural summit, due to be held in Paris on 13 July."
"I support the political proposal to give this future Union a parliamentary dimension on the basis of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly."
"I welcome the examples of proposed initiatives such as the coastal motorways, the linking-up of the Arab Maghreb Motorway (AMA), the de-pollution of the Mediterranean, civil protection, the Mediterranean Solar Plan, high-power solar thermal electricity generation in the North African desert, the desalination of seawater in order to facilitate access to drinking water, etc."
"in writing. - (FR) I welcome the adoption of the joint resolution on the 'Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean'."
"This resolution rightly highlights the strategic interest of the Mediterranean region and the Middle East for the European Union."
"Our policy towards these countries must be based on the principles of solidarity, dialogue and cooperation."
"The Barcelona Process warrants being re-launched today in order to make it as efficient as possible."
"To this end, the Commission's initiative is a step in the right direction and has the merit of concentrating on specific regional projects, which will make it possible to provide an effective response to the needs of the citizens of this region."
"The Commission proposal also recommends the establishment of a Barcelona Process co-presidency, a Joint Permanent Committee and a secretariat, which will help to improve cooperation and dialogue between the various partners."
"In addition, it states that the main objectives of this policy must continue to be promotion of the rule of law, democracy, respect for human rights and political pluralism."
"in writing. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is not done with disowning hyper-President Sarkozy: rejection of the proposals on fuel tax, warnings against the budgetary slides and, now, transformation of the proposed Union for the Mediterranean into a re-launch of the Barcelona Process, which has been a failure for more than 10 years."
"This is the death of the project concerning cooperation between the countries bordering the mare nostrum, led by France."
"From now on the entire Union will be involved and it is the Commission in Brussels that will be at the controls."
"That is what was decided by the real boss: Mrs Merkel's Germany."
"This matter perfectly illustrates two realities: Mr Sarkozy's agitation and media hype only serve to mask his powerlessness;"
"France's interests are in the hands of the officials in Brussels and dependent upon those of the European Union."
"We sincerely hope that Ireland, a nation that has such a great love of freedom and that has paid dearly for it in the course of its history, will be the country that delivers us from this Eurocratic construction that is increasingly unfounded and increasingly tyrannical."
"in writing. - (PT) If you only read the resolution adopted today, you would tend to believe in the most genuine and benevolent intentions of the EU with regard to the 'Union for the Mediterranean'."
"Its careful language reveals only a few hints of interference and the omnipresent objectives of the 'establishment of a Euro-Mediterranean free-trade area' and 'free trade', accompanied, of course, by 'social' and 'environmental' palliatives and rhetoric."
"However, the European Commission makes it clear that 'the Mediterranean region is an area of vital strategic importance to the European Union in both political and economic terms'."
"It talks about the 'significant progress [that] has been made towards the establishment of a Euro-Mediterranean free-trade area by 2010', pointing to the need for the EU's Mediterranean partners to pursue 'further and faster reforms'."
"The Commission puts forward a series of priorities such as transport (pointing to the possibility of setting up a concession scheme of interest to the private sector and accompanied by governmental measures to ensure free trade and abolish the various non-tariff obstacles preventing trade) and increasing the integration of the energy markets."
"The EU wants to economically, politically and militarily control the whole Mediterranean region and is seeking to dominate its markets and exploit its immense resources."
"That is capitalism, you fool!"
"in writing. - (FR) The very title of the resolution underlines Mr Sarkozy's failure."
"Not content with being the President of the French Republic, he was trying to become the designer, then the president, of a Euro-Mediterranean Union, open only to the countries bordering the Mediterranean."
"Even before his European presidency begins, his house of cards is collapsing."
"Germany has imposed its positions: all the EU Member States will participate in this project, designed to be a simple expansion of the Barcelona Process, managed by the Eurocrats in Brussels."
"This fiasco illustrates the debasement of our country in the European institutions."
"The Europe of Brussels, far from strengthening France, as the UMP and PS claim, is making it weaker in all sectors: in the economic sector, with the destruction of our small farms, the collapse and relocation of our industries; in the military sector, with the dismantlement of our army, now required to dissolve into a Euro corps; in the demographic sector, with immigration that is threatening our national identity."
"Only a new Europe, a Europe of nation states, founded on the sovereignty of the nations and on the founding values of our European and Christian civilisation, will enable France to become a major player once again and implement in the Mediterranean a major cooperation policy aimed, inter alia, at ensuring that the immigrant populations return to their home countries."
"For some time now the European Union has been working to develop special cooperative relations with the countries on the African and Asian shores of the Mediterranean Sea."
"This cooperation constantly raises the question of whether it means that we support the dictatorship in Syria or that we approve of the way in which Israel is delaying the creation of an equal and internationally recognised Palestinian State."
"The idea of the French President, Mr Sarkozy, for a special union between the EU and all the countries of the Mediterranean, calls especially for support among the public of the EU Member States that border the Mediterranean Sea."
"The establishment of such a union could contribute to the EU building up spheres of influence in the region with unequal partners, following the example of the traditional agreements between the US and parts of Latin America."
"It could also serve to legitimise the dictatorships in Tunisia, Libya and Syria, and to a lesser extent Algeria and Egypt."
"It would make it easier to send refugees back to such states."
"It would also give us the chance to upgrade contacts with Israel now, instead of waiting until after the recognition of a neighbouring Palestinian State."
"It is only because of these underlying problems that I am not voting for this resolution now."
"The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) have voted against the joint resolution."
"The Union for the Mediterranean does not in the final analysis have equal, mutually profitable relations with the states of the region."
"Instead, it supports the EU's imperialist plans for the wider region of the Mediterranean and the Middle East."
"The aim of this Union is to liberalise markets in order to enable them to be more easily accessed by European monopolies, whose position in the monopolistic fight for control of the markets will be improved."
"The energy and wealth-producing resources of the region will be plundered."
"The Union for the Mediterranean will be achieved by intensifying threats, blackmail, and political or even military pressure on states and the people."
"The resolution is also revealing."
"The primary objective of the Union for the Mediterranean policy is purportedly for democracy and human rights to be exported from the EU to the Mediterranean countries."
"This is the pretext the EU uses to justify its imperialist interventions everywhere."
"In fact, what is being promoted is the imperialist US-NATO-ΕU plan for the 'New Middle East'."
"That is why there is no reference to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories or to the genocide of the Palestinian people."
"The people should have no illusions about the nature and aims of the Union for the Mediterranean; they should fight against it."
"in writing. - (PL) Mr President, the percentage of young farmers in the European Union continues to fall."
"Currently, only 7% of farmers are under the age of 35."
"In many cases, young people leave farming because of the high cost of investment, which means that it is impossible for them to compete on the market."
"We should therefore help young farmers to draw on Union funding for this purpose."
"Young farmers would benefit from low-interest loans enabling them to implement their plans without running the risk of becoming heavily indebted."
"In addition, care should be taken to ensure that the criteria for accessing Union funding are not too demanding and do not exclude small farms focusing on specialised products rather than on large-scale production."
"The majority of the farms in southern Poland and in the Lesser Poland and Swietokrzyskie Voivodships fit this description."
"Mr Veraldi's report deals with all these matters and I therefore voted in favour of it."
"in writing. - (FR) In the light of the difficulty in finding new generations of European farmers, the European Parliament decided to look at the ways to promote the installation of young farmers, which should guide the CAP Health Check."
"As the shadow rapporteur of the PSE Group, I put forward the following proposals:"
"it is a priority to respond to the food, energy, environmental and territorial challenges,"
"the new farmers must benefit from support measures, especially those who do not inherit a farm and those who are based in areas with permanent natural handicaps: higher installation aid, subsidies for agricultural loans and accompanying measures following installation,"
"these support measures must be compulsory under the second pillar of the CAP and the aspect of access to agricultural property must be examined,"
"living conditions in rural areas must be improved: equal access to public services, social amenities, etc.,"
"we must develop access to vocational training (replacement during training and access to agricultural research),"
"we must promote the farming profession and the standards respected by farmers at European level."
"The EU should not concern itself with everything."
"The principle of a leaner but keener EU implies that the EU should only deal with questions for which there is authority in the founding Treaty and, where demarcation problems arise, proportionality, effectiveness and relevance should be taken into account."
"I have chosen to abstain in the final vote on the report on the future for young farmers under the ongoing reform of the common agricultural policy."
"The report contains many proposals which improve the situation for newly established young operators as well as proposals which can contribute to the increased production of food."
"But at the same time the text also covers matters which are quite definitely of national significance and should be decided at national level."
"in writing. - (PT) Many of the proposals contained in the report, to which we have suggested a few amendments, are on the right lines, particularly those referring to the 'continuing difficulties' facing young farmers, such as high installation costs, a heavy burden of debt and too few available holdings."
"We have made various proposals to which we would draw the European Commission's attention for the future, in particular:"
"the need to adopt the necessary measures to support, accompany and advise young farmers under the initial setting-up scheme with the aim of increasing the success rate and at the same time minimising or putting an end to situations where farmers give up or even become bankrupt;"
"the creation of a land bank on the basis of land freed up as a result of early retirement;"
"the need to introduce support for the joint acquisition of expensive machinery and equipment which is used infrequently by each individual farmer."
"However, we regard as inadequate those measures adopted to tackle the existing problems which make Portugal the EU Member State with the lowest percentage of young farmers (less than 4%)."
"It is essential that, within the current review of the common agricultural policy, productive activity is duly valued, with fair prices for production."
"in writing. - (PT) In recent decades, European rural areas have been increasingly abandoned, a trend which has been accompanied by a gradual ageing of the population."
"This ageing of the agricultural population is worrying for the future of European agriculture."
"That is why I consider the Veraldi report to be very important as it looks at various aspects connected with the expectations and opportunities of young farmers who have a key role to play in the sustainable development of European rural areas."
"I believe that young farmers are particularly important to the development of a dynamic agricultural sector in order to achieve the Lisbon Strategy objectives."
"Under the new common agricultural policy, the generational change must therefore be regarded as one of the priorities."
"in writing. - (PL) We should welcome the fact that by a large majority, the House has adopted the report on the future of young farmers under the ongoing reform of the common agricultural policy."
"The statements on increasing European Union aid for young farmers are particularly significant."
"One of these statements is a declaration concerning easier access to preferential loans for this group of farmers."
"Further practical aid is essential in terms of creating real opportunities for young farmers wishing to continue the family tradition in the Lesser Poland Voivodship to obtain a reasonable income."
"If the promised aid has the desired effect, the situation whereby villages in Lesser Poland are inhabited solely by older people caring for their grandchildren whose parents feel that the only opportunity open to them is to seek work abroad may become less common."
"This report therefore has a social dimension as well as an economic one."
"Young farmers wish to preserve traditions, but they also understand that if they do not draw on other experiences and technology they will be unable to transform their family farms into modern, competitive and profitable enterprises."
"Support for the development of modern methods and agricultural production tools is therefore a particularly important feature of the resolution adopted today."
"As usual, we in Junilistan note that in this case it is fortunate that the European Parliament does not have powers of codecision on the EU's agricultural policy because, if it had, the Union would be caught in a trap of protectionism and heavy subsidies to various groups in the farming industry."
"This own-initiative report contains a number of absurd proposals, such as yet another 'European Year', this time for 'urban-rural dialogue'."
"If every European Year proposed by the European Parliament were to become a reality, every year from now to the end of the century would probably be booked up in advance."
"The affirmation in paragraph 35 that rural development measures should be aimed directly at farmers strengthens Junilistan's impression that the old, overburdened 'common agricultural policy' has now merely changed its name to 'rural development' in the EU budget."
"It is with disquiet that we note that the European Parliament now calls for the recognition of non-trade concerns as import criteria in the WTO context."
"We consider that to be nothing more than a preliminary to the introduction of barriers to trade and protectionism against the rest of the world."
"I have therefore chosen to vote against the report."
"in writing. - The Veraldi report on the future of young farmers highlights a number of important issues which are of relevance across the EU's rural areas."
"The report also recognises that farming methods rooted in specific geographical areas and cultural traditions in Europe should be conserved, improved and promoted."
"I wholeheartedly endorse those sentiments and consider that they can be applied across the EU's workload."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of this report, as I consider that the measures stipulated therein are complementary to the national programmes in this field."
"The National Programme for Rural Development of Romania provides a measure that offers grants from the rural development funds of the European Union of up to EURO 40.000 per person."
"Yet, there are difficult conditions to be fulfilled and, consequently, we still have a small number of requests in this regard."
"The report we are adopting today provides for a series of significant measures, both in terms of the financial support of young farmers, and in terms of certain essential legal aspects, like the facilitation of succession upon agricultural property or easy access to bank credits."
"The professional education and training component offered to young people in rural areas is also important."
"Thus, I consider that future legislation should provide for the huge disproportion between the younger population aged 35, active in the agricultural sector (only 8,5% of the total number of farmers in Europe) and the other age categories in this field."
"These measures will definitely contribute to the success of the national programmes, as is the major axis of supporting the young farmers, stipulated by PNDR of Romania."
"in writing.- (DE) What questions do young people nowadays ask themselves when deciding on a career?"
"Do they ask about the nature of the occupation, the prospects it offers for the future, or making a fast buck?"
"The answer to all these questions is often negative when farming is one of the options."
"Only 7% of farmers are under the age of 35, with the result that this occupation is an alarming state of decline."
"There are many young people who would enjoy farming: working in the open air and close to nature, surrounded by plants and animals."
"So what deters young people? Is it the lack of prospects, or the general insecurity surrounding the profession?"
"Once, inheriting the family farm provided a very good and very secure living, but today, the heirs are often at a disadvantage due to the many burdens and conditions imposed on them."
"We know that only well-trained and highly motivated farmers can guarantee our high standards of healthy food and a healthy natural environment here in Europe."
"However, we must also be aware of the challenges facing young farmers today."
"We must involve young farmers in political discussions and decision-making to a greater extent."
"They are the bearers of Europe's hopes!"
"They are the ones who are facing up to the numerous economic and ecological challenges and ensuring a good and well-balanced social environment in the rural regions."
"They therefore need reliable policies to support them."
"in writing. - (FR) I welcome the adoption of this report, which highlights the fundamental challenge generation change in the agricultural sector poses for the European Union."
"Young farmers are those who are best placed to respond to the new agricultural challenges."
"Having benefited from the experience of their elders, they have the necessary dynamism and enthusiasm to carry out the crucial environmental, technological and economic changes that will enable tomorrow's European agriculture to retain a prime position in the world."
"We now need to reconcile an increasing level of agricultural production with constant respect for product quality and safety, within the framework of a global approach based on the preservation of natural resources and the environment."
"However, these requirements mean ever-increasing financial and personal investments from young farmers."
"In addition, the acquisition of adapted physical and intellectual tools must receive greater support from the Union, as stated in the report, especially in the area of access to technological innovations."
"The CAP cannot afford to neglect those who will ensure that the Community has sustainable food sovereignty that respects man and the environment."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by Mr Veraldi because I fully support the initiatives aimed at ensuring the future of sustainable, competitive and productive agriculture in the EU."
"It is essential to encourage and facilitate young people's access to the agri-food sector in order to promote generation change and ensure the dynamism of the sector."
"In order to enable young farmers to cope with the numerous challenges and expectations, such as the production of quality food, food safety, environmental protection, and preservation of biodiversity and the countryside, it is crucial to review the amount of the setting-up premium, which has not changed for years."
"In addition, we need to ensure that this premium is accompanied by a business plan so as not to curb the innovative spirit of young farmers."
"Nonetheless, we must also be aware that middle-aged farmers are facing the same challenges."
"It is important to ensure that we do not place them at a disadvantage or harm their existing operating methods."
"in writing. - Encouraging young people into the farming sector is essential to guarantee the future of the farming industry."
"Support should be given to newcomers in the farming sector including young farmers."
"I support the general direction of the Veraldi report on the future for young farmers under the ongoing reform of the CAP and voted accordingly."
"in writing. - Statistics show that rural populations across Europe are simultaneously decreasing and ageing."
"Moreover, the percentage of farms currently managed by young people is extremely low."
"This is a worrying trend which is affecting all Member States."
"Young people are not considering farming as a career option because, in many cases, issues such as the succession of farms and difficulties associated with obtaining credit simply outweigh the benefits of starting out."
"This insightful report addresses the most important issues which are deterring young people from entering into farming and suggests some practical solutions for dealing with these problems."
"After all, if we wish to secure the stability and development of Europe's agriculture sector, we must provide young people with incentives to enter into farming and remove the obstacles which they face."
"The report also recognises that, like any other modern industry, farming needs to be competitive, efficient and able to respond and adapt to market demands."
"We need to take measures which support and encourage young people in this context, as the next generation of farmers are the key to a dynamic and innovative European agriculture sector."
"in writing. - (SK) Slovakia, just like other new EU Member States, has a high proportion of rural areas."
"Rural areas comprise almost 80% of the country's total area, and according to the statistics this is where more than 44% of people live."
"The present situation in the food industry, high food prices and the production of quality food are the major challenges for European rural areas."
"It is good to see that young farmers in particular are interested in the ecological farming system."
"It gives some guarantee of the growing importance of farming aimed at promoting rural development."
"Entrepreneurial spirit in farming has its typical features and carries far greater risks than entrepreneurial spirit in other economic sectors."
"Many young people think that setting up a farming business is impossible because of the high costs."
"Introducing various incentives can help young farmers either to set up in business or (later) modernise their enterprises."
"I voted for the report by the rapporteur, Mr Donato Tommaso Veraldi, on the future for young farmers under the ongoing reform of the common agricultural policy, because I am convinced that by supporting young farmers we can significantly help to improve the employment rate in peripheral European regions and prevent young people from leaving rural areas."
"in writing. - I will vote in favour of this report but I must highlight that Amendment 35 is unacceptable to me and I and the British Labour delegation will vote against this particular amendment."
"Sustainable rural development is the key to maintaining our countryside and the traditional way of life enjoyed by our rural communities."
"Indeed, on the issue of modulation, Members may recall that it was only British Labour MEPs who supported concerted efforts to change our priorities away from direct payments and into sustainable rural development."
"Farmers have a key role to play in delivering rural sustainability and development, but they are not the only people involved in that delivery, which is why I cannot support Amendment 35."
"This Parliament has developed a habit of constantly demanding direct payments to farmers and no doubt it will do the same when we discuss the CAP Health Check in the near future."
"I think those of us who believe that things need to change in this regard, away from a system that rewards inefficiency at the expense of efficient agriculture, are those who truly believe in sustainable rural development."
"The ageing of the agricultural population, the abandonment of cultivated land and the constant reduction in the number of young people working in farming are recent developments that have occurred during the past 20 years."
"Throughout these years the EU has failed to tackle the problems faced by small and medium-sized farmers, particularly young people."
"The EU's measures are part of its anti-agricultural policy, which aims to reduce production and concentrate land in the hands of a few large-scale farmers."
"This will result in the shrinkage of the agricultural population and the abandonment of the countryside, particularly by young people."
"The report limits itself to findings."
"The measures it puts forward are within the framework of this policy, so they hide the real reason behind the problems: the EU's confrontational policy."
"This policy, together with the anti-farming CAP, aims to promote and increase the profits of the multinational monopolies and attack the incomes of small and medium-sized farmers."
"The report actively supports the partial review carried out on the CAP in 2003, the proposed CAP 'health check' measures and the inclusion of the agricultural economy within the framework of the EU's anti-popular Lisbon Strategy."
"Overturning the EU's anti-agricultural, anti-popular policy is the only solution that will enable farmers to remain on their land."
"It will guarantee a decent income rather than further the aims and interests of the multinational monopolies."
"in writing. - (PL) As a member of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly I should like to congratulate Mr Hutchinson on his report, which I fully support."
"The workings of this Assembly, and in particular the opportunities it provides for direct contact between parliamentarians on both sides, do much to make the Union's presence felt in the most distant regions of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific."
"The Assembly does not focus exclusively on a rigid plan of action."
"It is also capable of reacting swiftly to crisis situations and to events as they unfold."
"After all, the Assembly adopts resolutions and makes decisions, all of which result in mobilising material and financial Union aid."
"Such aid is very much needed and eagerly awaited, especially in regions affected by natural disasters."
"I should like to say how pleased I am with the organisational arrangements."
"Meeting alternately in Europe and in countries of the ACP region in turn allows members of the Assembly to familiarise themselves with the situation on the ground and understand it better."
"I also support the arrangements for workshops and fact-finding and research missions associated with the Assembly."
"In particular, I should like to express my strong support for the idea of a forum for women as an opportunity for discussion and exchange of good practice regarding equal treatment of men and women."
"I believe that if the European Parliament wishes the ACP countries to perceive it as an institution promoting democracy, it cannot turn a blind eye to the injustices so often experienced by women in those regions."
"in writing. - (PT) While welcoming the involvement and participation of national parliaments and parliamentarians in the negotiations on the EU's Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, we consider that the political position adopted with regard to these EPAs must not be restricted to the 'process', with no mention being made of their contents."
"If this approach were taken, it would represent a devious attempt to draw attention away from the fundamental issue, which is that the proposed EPAs aim to establish neo-colonial relations by setting up free trade agreements."
"Through these agreements, the EU, the major powers and their main financial and economic groups will force these countries to open up their markets and will be able to sell their goods and services, exploit the raw materials of these countries and impose an export-oriented production model, thus removing the sovereignty of these countries and making their development dependent on the interests of the EU."
"This is in the DNA of capitalism..."
"In terms of reaping what we sow, our capitalist intentions will lead, for the vast majority of humanity, to price increases, unemployment, poverty, hunger and so on."
"As a result, we need to say no to the EPAs and to neo-colonialism."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the Hutchinson report."
"The work that this Parliament has done over the decades together with the ACP countries is something that we as an institution can regard with some satisfaction."
"in writing. - (FI) I have been a member of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly since my first term of office."
"Mr Hutchinson's report on the work of the Assembly in 2007 is, I believe, a comprehensive account of both the progress made over the last year and the challenges that we have faced."
"I think that the fact that the standing committees will now also be responsible for following up resolutions is definitely a move in the right direction."
"It has provided an opportunity for far more in-depth dialogue than was previously available to them in the more formal follow-up that took place in plenary."
"Furthermore, the Assembly has had a key role in monitoring negotiations on Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs): interaction between parliamentarians has fostered the transparency of the process and made it easier to take grass-roots issues into account."
"It is because of the very nature of the work that the Parliamentary Assembly has, to my mind, become an important actor in EU development cooperation."
"Strengthening the parliamentary dimension and close cooperation in the follow-up process will do more and more to enable EU funds to be channelled directly to serve the needs of the people and, for example, to achieve the Millennium Development Goals on health and education."
"in writing. - I welcome Alain Hutchinson's report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2007."
"Greater involvement of parliaments and civil society can improve and help intensify the ACP-EU relationship."
"It is through such cooperation that we can improve the quality of development assistance and its targeting."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report's recommendations."
"in writing. - (GA) I was very happy to support Mr Hutchinson's report last year on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA)."
"I would like to refer to some aspects of this report that really impressed me."
"It is fortunate that the rapporteur referred to the Economic Partnership Agreements(EPA)."
"The European Union needs to keep a close watch on EPA talks and developments and the JPA has done this."
"As has been stated by the rapporteur, the JPAs have a central role in monitoring talks and creating links between the two sides: the EU and countries of the South."
"I would also like to praise the rapporteur for the reference he made to Somalia as 'a crisis that has been forgotten'."
"Somalia is not alone, however, and we in the EU and the ACP are obliged to support, help and direct attention on these regions."
"Above all else, however, this reports highlights the good work that has been done by the JPA, work that is sometimes not respected enough."
"in writing. ? (PL) The rapporteur rightly draws attention to the need to establish an appropriate framework for an open, democratic and content-based dialogue aimed at negotiating Economic Partnership Agreements between Member States of the European Union and ACP countries."
"A further important aspect is increased participation of the national parliaments and societies of individual countries in order to strengthen ACP-EU cooperation."
"Particular importance should also be ascribed to regional cooperation and integration."
"Actions aimed at strengthening peace should receive strong support too, especially in those ACP countries where the political situation remains unstable."
"in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of the report on the activities of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly."
"I believe it is a good idea for the standing committee of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly to follow up resolutions by meeting with Commission officials responsible for the relevant areas."
"To date this follow-up has only taken place in plenary sessions."
"The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly has many tasks before it, all of which aim to promote the economic development of the ACP countries."
"in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am voting in favour of this report, which makes another significant contribution to Europe's economic development."
"I therefore welcome the excellent work done by Mr Pittella, who has clearly spelled out the proposals and principles which should regulate this very important sector."
"Harmonisation of the credit market constitutes another step towards an extremely important goal: the completion of a truly integrated internal market which attempts to overcome the existing legislative differences between Member States."
"Financial services are of general economic interest, in that they play a key role both in terms of economic development and in terms of properly implementing the Schengen objectives."
"I am thinking of citizens who have huge difficulties in obtaining accurate information, and of the exit penalties - often in the form of high abandonment costs - which confront users wishing to switch from one credit institution to another."
"in writing. - (PT) While there are certain positive aspects to the report adopted today, namely information on, and facilitation of, certain banking procedures for consumers, access to these services still lies within the context of a liberalised financial market where the aim, by nature, is to pursue maximum profits and not to protect consumers."
"That is why we abstained from voting."
"It is not enough to guarantee the right to a bank account."
"We must ensure that fees or any other types of penalty are not charged to customers for any services, particularly where the people hardest hit would be those who are financially weak, those with accounts with limited funds and transactions or simply those who hold bank accounts."
"It is essential to guarantee the public service which also exists in the financial sector, without which we will worsen social inequalities, dramatically affecting those people with fewer financial resources, social solidarity institutions and other social organisations, including small and micro-enterprises."
"in writing. - The Pittella report, which I supported, highlights the importance of culture, habits and languages in consumer choices and protection for financial products."
"The diverse cultures, habits and languages of the EU deserve respect in all areas of the Union's work and are essential if the European Institutions' work is to gain public support."
"in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the work done by the committee responsible and the rapporteur, Mr Karas, has taken our parliamentary debate a stage further and is helpful in clarifying what problems need to be tackled and resolved in this field."
"Furthermore, I am pleased that particular emphasis is at last being given to small operators and not just to large movements of capital."
"The financial services sector does not just serve large companies operating at European or intercontinental level; it is likewise a vital tool for anyone wishing to take new ideas and ways of doing business beyond their own local market."
"High-level legislative action by the European Union will undoubtedly lead to greater competition and lower costs for consumers, with a positive impact on increased choice and wider access to such services by users."
"Given the importance of this sector and the advantages which would stem from better legislation in this field, I am happy to see that, thanks to this report, Parliament will finally be able to put forward appropriate measures of direct benefit to consumers."
"in writing. - (PT) The liberalisation of retail financial services in the single market is the most recent proposal from the European Commission following on from the liberalisations set out in the Lisbon Strategy."
"The aim is to take another step towards achieving full liberalisation of services in the European Union."
"As a result, and following on from other initiatives, the liberalisation of various retail financial services is now proposed, in particular banking products, insurance and pensions."
"The aim is to remove anything which might be regarded as an 'obstacle', using the old arguments of lower prices and greater choice for consumers, when experience actually shows precisely the opposite."
"It is the large companies which gradually increase their profits at the cost of more expensive services for consumers."
"Although we are pleased at the adoption of the amendment tabled by our Group, given that a particular duty of care needs to apply to the marketing of savings and old-age pension products as the decisions that consumers take in that regard are normally decisions of great importance to them and generally taken only once in a life, the fact is that most of the report is negative."
"That is why we voted against it."
"in writing. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the rapporteur quite rightly points out, for there to be a market, there must be supply and demand."
"That does not seem to be the case for a cross-border retail financial services market, however."
"The report is in fact based on the premise that allowing the supply is bound to encourage the demand."
"Even though we all might like to benefit from cheaper credit or more profitable investments, it is unlikely that tomorrow an Italian will go to a Danish or Cypriot bank to get a loan to buy his house or his car."
"We all know why: linguistic problems, justified apprehension about the risks, uncertainty about the tax arrangements, etc."
"This desire to artificially create such a market does not manage to conceal one of the main aims of the manoeuvre: forcing the states to harmonise their taxes and regulations so as to be prepared for all contingencies or imposing a 28th legal order, a supranational order, accompanied, for good measure, by the adoption of the euro by the countries that rejected it, thereby enabling them to participate fully in this hypothetical market."
"We cannot support these proposals."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the Karas report on retail financial services in the single market."
"My own country, Scotland, is home to a number of world class financial companies and they can benefit from access across the internal market."
"Nevertheless, respect must be had for the different financial cultures and traditions of the EU's nations and I believe that the Karas report strikes the right balance in recognising the need for subsidiarity in this area."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted for the Report ""The Green Card for the retail financial services on the single market”, because the access of the consumers to the retail trans-border financial services represents an important factor of the reinforcement of the single market, under the conditions of insuring a high degree of protection to consumers."
"With united efforts on a national and European level, it is necessary to develop consumer awareness campaigns regarding trans-border financial services."
"Romania must promote consumer awareness and knowledge of the FIN-NET system, that has a key role in the coordination of information designed for the public with respect to access to legal appeal mechanisms and the alternative solutions, mainly in terms of the trans-border financial services."
"I fully support Mr Karas' and Mr Pitella's reports in respect of their efforts to ensure that the operation of the banking sector is more effective and accessible to individual customers and small enterprises."
"I agree, especially, with the article in Mr Karas' report which emphasizes self-regulation instead of introducing new legislation."
"Legislation is not always the answer; each case must be examined and considered carefully and the competitiveness and sustainability of each sector must be closely watched."
"It is often the case that something that is of benefit to the sector will also be of benefit to the customer."
"I have an enormous problem with one article in Karas' report, however, in which he refers to the differences between taxation laws in various Member States."
"It would appear to me that this article criticizes the principle of subsidiarity and there is no truth in it."
"It is up to individual countries to decide their own tax bands and these bands encourage competition in the single market and not the opposite."

"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 12.20 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 5 June 2008."
"Statements by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to make two statements."
"The second of these is made on behalf of the Conference of Presidents at its request."
"The result of the referendum of 12 June 2008 in Ireland confronts the European Union with one of the most difficult challenges in its history."
"The Reform Treaty of Lisbon, born of the Constitutional Treaty which was drafted by a convention comprising Members of national parliaments and the European Parliament, meeting in public, serves to make the European Union more democratic, more effective and more transparent."
"It strengthens the European Parliament, gives national parliaments more responsibility for shaping EU policy, enables citizens of the European Union to present initiatives to the European institutions and guarantees the role of local government."
"The Treaty of Lisbon is the response to public criticism of the shortcomings of the European Union."
"The Treaty brings the European Union closer to its people."
"There can be no doubt that the application of the Reform Treaty is absolutely imperative if the European Union is to defend its values and interests in the 21st century."
"Without the reforms made possible by the Treaty of Lisbon, the accession of other countries to the European Union is scarcely conceivable."
"We call on the participants in the EU summit in Brussels this coming Thursday and Friday to take every appropriate step to implement the Reform Treaty."
"The ratification process must be continued without restriction."
"We urge the Irish Government, for its part, to propose ways in which we can work together to emerge from this difficult period in the political life of Europe."
"The European Parliament will strive with all its might and with passionate commitment to meet these challenges."
"We expect the European Commission and the Governments of all Member States of the European Union to do likewise."
"We also expect them to involve the European Parliament fully in their efforts."
"Our goal remains the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon in time for the elections to the European Parliament in June 2009."
"With your agreement, I shall resolutely defend these principles before the European Council in Brussels on 19 and 20 June."
"(Applause)"
"The debate will take place on Wednesday morning with the Council and the Commission."
"The intention is not to discuss the matter now."
"The debate on the preparation of the European Council meeting is on Wednesday morning, and that is the logical time to discuss the issue, when the heads of the Council and the Commission will be present."
"We must conduct a highly structured debate, and I have presented you with my firmly held views on this issue."
"Another reason why I have done so now is that a former President of the European Parliament, Simone Veil, who will be presented with a distinguished award in Spain on Wednesday, has asked me personally to deliver the laudatio."
"I could not but accede to her request, and I wanted to ensure that you were aware of my personal views on the events in Ireland and on the challenges that face us."
"The Conference of Presidents has asked me to make a statement on the Middle East."
"A 14-member delegation from our working group on the Middle East, headed by Veronique De Keyser and Annemie Neyts-Uyttebroeck, visited Israel and Palestine from 30 May to 2 June 2008."
"During its visit, the delegation assessed the practical implementation of the objectives that were publicly proclaimed in a joint statement by all parties to the Annapolis Conference six months ago as part of the effort to achieve a two-state solution by the end of this year."
"Among the main focal points were the strengthening of the security forces by the Palestinians themselves, the issue of the development of settlements, especially around Jerusalem, economic development, restricted freedom of movement in the West Bank and, lastly, the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, which is cut off and subject to international sanctions."
"The report, which the delegation adopted unanimously - and it was a representative cross-party delegation - was presented last week in the presence of the Commission and the Council, then transmitted to the Conference of Presidents, and it paints a depressing picture."
"While some encouraging advances have been made, these have been sectoral in scope and limited in their effects."
"The general sequence of events gives no grounds for optimism."
"As things stand, the ambitious Annapolis targets are scarcely achievable."
"The delegation was unanimous in its view, which the Conference of Presidents endorsed, that the blockade of the Gaza Strip must be lifted, that controlled cross-border movement of persons and goods must be reinstated and that the violence must be curbed."
"In the West Bank too, a new course must be pursued, in which the credibility of the Palestinian Authority is bolstered and the conditions for sustained economic development are systematically established."
"Israel's policy of constant division and geographical separation must be opposed."
"Like the US Administration, which expressed this view yesterday through Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, we call for an end to the spread of settlements, particularly in East Jerusalem."
"We believe that no one has the right to evade the obligations agreed in Annapolis."
"The Israelis and Palestinians committed themselves to negotiations in good faith and in a spirit of reconciliation."
"They must resume the rigorous pursuit of this path."
"They need to show the courage and strength to engage in political renewal."
"It is up to us Europeans to accompany and support our partners in this process."
"The European Parliament will exercise its responsibility with determination."
"The European Union's relations with Israel and the Palestinian Authority must be developed in such a way as to promote the overall peace process."
"The Barcelona process - a union for the Mediterranean - could be an additional factor in the effort to foster peace."
"The European Parliament expects to be duly consulted in the framework of the European quest for peace in the Middle East."
"While we are meeting here, the fishermen of the Gaza Strip are putting out to sea."
"Because of the blockade, environmental pollution is rife to an alarming degree. It is threatening the livelihood of the fishing crews, and they are protesting about it."
"They have been demonstrating for their right to catch fish, to earn their living and to live in freedom and peace."
"Our delegation promised to support the fishermen."
"On behalf of all of us, may I therefore convey to these fishermen the solidarity of the European Parliament."
"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for listening to my own statement and this second statement which the Conference of Presidents asked me to make."

"The final draft agenda for this part-session has been distributed."
"The following amendments have been proposed:"
"Monday/Thursday:"
"No amendments"
"Wednesday:"
"The IND/DEM Group has moved that the debate on the preparation of the meeting of the European Council be named as follows: 'Preparation of the European Council after the Irish referendum'."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I should like to propose that the title 'Preparation for the European Council' be expanded to: 'Preparation for the European Council after the Irish referendum'."
"(Parliament approved the request.)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, we have just amended the title of the debate, and because of the implications - on which there are divergent views - of the decision in Ireland, it would be reasonable to give the House some time to discuss these problems."
"For this reason we move that the second item on the morning agenda be moved to the afternoon."
"Now I know that we shall be pushed for time in the afternoon, but in view of the urgency and the importance of this meeting of the Council, postponement makes good sense."
"We would have no objection to one item or other being deferred to a later sitting, but our motion at this instant is that we devote the entire morning to the substance of the renamed debate to give us enough time to discuss the issue."
"Mr President, having been rapporteur on the Lisbon Treaty, I should like to support this proposal."
"We must have a wide-ranging debate to show that we are listening both to the views expressed by the Irish people and to the views expressed in every other Member State, most of which, if not all of which, wish to proceed with this Treaty."
", on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, the Treaty of Lisbon and events in Ireland are very important, but should not prejudice discussion of an issue like fishing."
"I have to say that many deputies are not very interested in fishing. However, if ever the fishing industry suffered a real crisis, it is the one it is going through right now."
"On 23 June, the European Union Council of Fisheries Ministers will take a series of decisions on the crisis in the fishing sector, which is conjunctural and structural."
"I think that the European Union fishing sector would not understand it if this Parliament did not take the time to examine this issue and take a position on it."
"I therefore ask the political groups to show some sensitivity and, once and for all, to contribute to a good debate on the crisis in the fishing sector."
"(Parliament approved the request.)"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, I would like to put two questions."
"The first is the same question put by Mr Swoboda, who asked for more time for the debate on the European Council and the issue of the referendum."
"The second question is whether we should separate the debate on oil prices from the fisheries debate or hold a single debate on both."
"Those are two separate questions."
"I suggest you should take the question of speaking time for the debate on the European Council first, and only then take the question about fisheries."
"(Parliament approved the first request and rejected the second.)"
"(The order of business was thus established.)"
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"(EL) Mr President, I have listened most attentively to your message about the Irish 'no' vote."
"I fully endorse your statement on the need to continue the ratification process."
"It is indeed perplexing that the Irish 'no' comes at a time when the EU is increasingly democratic, transparent and effective."
"However, Mr President, we need to decode the message from the factors supporting the 'no' vote."
"Irish citizens have made their decision and exercised their democratic right; however, this 'no' also calls on us to engage in some constructive self-criticism."
"I suggest focusing this self-criticism on two points: we are bombarded, Mr President, by the Commission's over-regulation; we, the European Parliament, cannot concern ourselves with every detail of this legal technicality and over-regulation."
"Mr President, I know your dedication to European affairs, and I call on the European Parliament to rise to the occasion as a political body, a corps politique, a rallying point for the declared directions of the course of European unification."
"Thank you for your words of encouragement, Mr Papastamkos, but I must also ask you to adhere to the time limit of one minute that is assigned to explanations of vote."
"Moreover, I was informed that you wished to speak on a different subject."
"(ES) Mr President, although there was no time for my speech in the last sitting and a month has gone by since then, I feel I must mention that 12 May was World Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Day, two diseases that mainly affect women."
"They are both gender-specific diseases, difficult to diagnose and for which few resources are available for research and treatment. They usually cause problems at work because people do not understand the way they reduce the capacity of sufferers and make them unfit for work."
"We should take this situation seriously and urgently try to find out the causes of these diseases, provide more intensive treatment and compare the results, as well as raising social awareness and providing more information about their social, legal and employment impact."
"Sufferers must not feel they have no protection."
"We owe this to our citizens."
"(BG) The upcoming French Presidency of the European Union comes at a critical time for the European intergration process on the Old Continent."
"Topics such as the Sustainable Development Strategy, the European Immigration Pact, Europe of Defence and the reform in the Common Agricultural Policy are crucial for Europe."
"But the main question now is how to continue the Union reform and deepen the integration process in the aftermath of the Irish 'no'."
"Ireland's rejection of the Lisbon Treaty has once again put to the test the common will of Europeans to overcome the challenges of globalisation together."
"As a founder of the European Union, France and its president, Nicolas Sarkozy, have the task to pool the efforts of all twenty-seven member states together again, and come up with a legal formula and an action plan to find a way out of the Lisbon crisis because unless we overcome it, we run the risk of centrifugal and nationalistic passions taking the upper hand and putting a freeze on the process of further enlargement of the European Union."
"This watershed moment calls for us to realise these threats and deliver on our responsibilities and the expectations of the majority of European citizens for whom the Ode of Joy has already become a second national anthem."
"(PL) Mr President, today I would like to speak of an incident that recently took place in Warsaw."
"A person closely associated with the Chinese Embassy in Poland attacked a woman distributing the opposition periodical The Epoch Times."
"Similar incidents have been observed for some time now in New York, where groups organised by the Chinese Consulate have been attacking Falun Gong believers as well as people demonstrating peacefully in favour of Tibet."
"If similar practices start occurring in other countries, we shall be faced with a glaring breach of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations that was adopted in 1961."
"What is more, despite the fact that the Chinese regime is doing all it can to show its positive side during the Olympic Games, it is continuing to persecute any groups that represent non-Communist ideologies."
"It is going even further, in that it is redoubling its efforts and is exporting this activity to the territories of democratic Western nations."
"For this reason I am calling on the EU authorities and on Member States to monitor the situation with care and to react decisively if the circumstances I have described should be repeated."
"(EL) Mr President, the General Affairs Council is meeting today."
"I do not yet know the result, but among the topics being discussed is the proposal to upgrade the EU's relations with Israel."
"Furthermore, the fishermen of the Gaza Strip are today demonstrating against the inhuman measures the Israeli Government is imposing on them."
"Israel not only forbids them to fish in their open marine waters, but also deprives them of adequate fuel, so that they are forced to fish in the shallows where raw sewage is discharged without check."
"This situation threatens, immediately and alarmingly, to lead to epidemics."
"I submit to you, Mr President, the request of these fishermen that under such conditions the EU should not go ahead and upgrade relations with Israel."
"A further reason why this upgrading should not happen now, especially for us MEPs, is the fact that Israel recently showed, once again, that it does not respect even our human rights."
"Its forces tried to violently suppress peaceful demonstrations against the racist dividing wall from being built; they injured demonstrators, including our fellow Member Mrs Morgantini."
"(BG) In this House, at the Commission, and in Bulgaria, there is a lot of talk about fighting corruption at the top levels of government."
"Yet 'corruption' is not just a word that exists in and of itself."
"There are real people behind it."
"I want to show you the face of official corruption at the top in Bulgaria."
"Yesterday, the largest Bulgarian daily published photos of the leader of the Turkish ethnic party, MRL, Ahmed Dogan, who, three years ago, was granted a mandate to form the Bulgarian government."
"These shocking pictures reveal that Dogan lives in a huge seraglio which is registered as a four-star hotel, and there he indulges in luxury."
"This same individual, Dogan, authored the phrases that his party was surrounded by a circle of companies and that buying votes is an European practice."
"He told the Trud Daily that his main occupation was to run his business, something which he cannot do legally while a member of Bulgarian Parliament."
"Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen of this House, Commissioners, Dogan is one of the heads of the lamia of corruption in Bulgaria."
"The destruction of this monster begins with investigating Ahmed Dogan's circle of companies and his business."
"Mr. President, I submit to you the newspaper so that you can read about this yourself."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the 862 415 Irish people who voted 'no' to the Lisbon Treaty in last Thursday's referendum."
"They voted for freedom, democracy and common sense."
"Were the British people to be allowed a referendum, they would undoubtedly vote 'no' in even greater numbers than the Irish."
"Given the chance, many of the other European nations would also vote 'no', just as the French and the Dutch proved in 2005."
"With breathtaking arrogance and disregard for democracy, the European political elite intend to bulldoze onwards with the ratification of the Treaty."
"The Treaty is dead but the EU refuses to bury it."
"The EU's ongoing love affair with the Treaty is an act of political necrophilia."
"But the body is beginning to stink and, the longer it is unburied, the worse the stench is going to get."
"We must bury the Treaty."
"It is polluting the political atmosphere."
"Mr Batten, your comparison is entirely inappropriate, if I may add my own comment."
"You are in a Parliament that is very much alive."
"If this Parliament did not speak, you, as a living being, could not have addressed it."
"(Applause)"
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"I will speak in Hungarian."
"In Slovakia a new education act has been passed by Parliament, and all that is needed for it to enter into force is the signature of the President of the Republic."
"The new act means that from now on, names of places and historic figures in history books intended for students whose mother tongue is Hungarian will have to conform to Slovakian spelling rules, thereby ignoring our centuries-old historic and linguistic traditions."
"The new act seriously infringes the rights of the Hungarian community in Slovakia to use their language."
"Slovakia signed and ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in 2001."
"Commissioner Leonard Orban himself believes that fostering national minorities' mother tongues is a matter of strategic importance."
"In this European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, it is lamentable and unacceptable that Slovakia is acting in a manner that runs counter to European practice."
"Instead of broadening minority rights, it is doing the opposite and curtailing them."
"As a result of the Treaty of Trianon, several thousand Hungarian-speaking settlements ended up outside the country's borders, and we have a right to call these places by their Hungarian names."
"Linguistic diversity is part of Europe's cultural legacy and a unique treasure that we all have a responsibility to protect. Thank you for the opportunity to speak."
"(ES) Mr President, in the early morning of 8 June, the terrorist group ETA attacked the offices of the daily newspaper El Correo while 50 staff were in the building and preparing the Sunday edition."
"Fortunately, no one was injured but there was significant material damage."
"I would be grateful if you would send a message of solidarity. However, I would also like to comment on and have recorded in this Chamber the urgent need to eradicate the terrorist violence perpetrated by ETA against the media and guarantee the full exercise of freedom of expression."
"This is a good reason for Europeans to support the Treaty of Lisbon, which will make it possible to develop common policies for justice, security and anti-terrorism and not to depend exclusively on bilateral and intergovernmental cooperation."
"Our solidarity should therefore also be expressed in support for ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Mrs Ayala Sender, since you addressed me personally, let me say that we are a community based on solidarity, and that solidarity applies in every case, including the present one."
"I am grateful that you appreciate this point."
"(HU) Ladies and gentlemen, at the previous plenary session the Leader of our Group, Graham Watson, addressed this Parliament in a one-minute speech because of the anti-Roma atrocities taking place in Italy."
"Today, too, I regret to have to inform you of similar incidents, this time in my own country, Hungary."
"A few weeks ago, 70 kilometres from Budapest in the village of Pátka, three vigilantes threw a dozen Molotov cocktails at three houses where Roma people lived."
"On 16 April in the village of Fadd in Hungary's Tolna district, unidentified individuals threw Molotov cocktails at two homes."
"A week ago my own colleague was attacked in Nyíregyháza by extremists yelling: 'Filthy gypsy, get out of our country!'"
"Most of the residents of Pátka stand by their claim that the vigilantes are innocent, although one of the suspects has confessed that he was involved."
"Despite this, on Friday a demonstration was held by around 150 uniformed individuals proclaiming Nazi principles, and later on a number of unidentified persons wearing hoods again tried to mount an attack in the presence of 100 riot police."
"I too was present."
"At the same time, the police covered up the identity of the person injured in the Pátka incident."
"In Italy, our fellow EU citizens are living in prisons reserved for refugees; they too are Roma, of course."
"Commissioner Barrot, I hope that once your new cabinet is formed we Roma, too, will be able to enjoy the security provided by European Union democracy, and that the definition of EU citizenship will apply to me and my children as well as to my non-Roma fellow citizens."
"(PL) Mr President, even in situations where the issues are completely clear, the solutions that should be adopted should take into account the context and relations between different objectives, the importance of the issue in question and the costs involved in achieving the objectives."
"In every issue, especially one that affects the lives of billions of people in the way that climate change does, it is important to act with moderation, common sense and some degree of fairness when trying to resolve the problem."
"I do not see any fairness in the proposal to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide."
"There are two solutions that are particularly offensive in this regard: treating highly developed countries that have been responsible for a large proportion of carbon dioxide emissions to date and for much pollution, but have better technological capabilities, in the same way as less developed countries, especially those whose economies are based on coal; and secondly, treating manufacturers of large vehicles, where reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 20% is easier, the same as manufacturers of vehicles with small engines and low levels of emissions, so that reductions incur higher costs."
"It looks as if the issue of climate change is not what is important here, just business issues."
"Mr President, Europe's bees face extinction within a decade."
"Diseases and viruses have already wiped out one third of the colonies in America and now threaten our own."
"The American situation offers a dangerous snapshot of what we potentially face in Europe unless we act now."
"At least 70 crops that contribute significantly to the overall economy depend directly on pollination by the bees."
"The US is having to import bees to make up the losses."
"In the current climate there are serious questions over the EU's capacity to produce enough food to satisfy demand, and the implications of a similar outbreak here would be disastrous."
"Beekeepers across Europe already know about the threat caused by the varroa mites that have decimated bee colonies."
"They are having to deal with Colony Collapse Disorder, which is when hives are systematically abandoned and the bees effectively disappear off the face of the earth."
"We need to provide funding and proper scientific research in this area."
"The UK Government currently provides just GBP 250 000 towards bee research."
"That is a drop in the ocean for such an important issue."
"Bees are an integral part of the food chain: without bees, beekeepers, crops, fruit and nuts will be adversely affected."
"(FR) Mr President, I see from the agenda that we will be considering a codified version of the directive on static testing of roll-over protection structures of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors."
"I feel that following the Dublin vote history dictates that we consider other, more urgent issues."
"We cannot subcontract a matter such as the Lisbon Treaty to the European Council alone."
"We MEPs may legitimately become involved, especially if we know the necessary ingredients for finding solutions."
"First of all, the key questions must relate to certain vital institutional aspects and not cover several hundreds of pages."
"We need validation by European referendum, with an opt-out for countries that do not wish to follow that course and, finally, as the President said, we need a very tight timetable - 2009 - otherwise the electoral campaign will become impossible."
"Let nobody tell me such a scenario is impossible; it is no more improbable than the one on which the chancelleries are currently working."
"In any case, I, for my part, am ready."
"Mr President, the Commission is currently examining complaints made by certain private businesses in Spain, France and Italy against cooperatives, and against the cooperative movement as regards its statute and tax treatment."
"I would urge the Commission, in examining that complaint, to take due account of the particular needs and characteristics of cooperative movements."
"They are not like profit-making shareholder organisations."
"A cooperative is owned by its members and profits are distributed equally, not paid out simply to shareholders."
"The European Union recognised the particular nature of the cooperative movement in 2003 in adopting the Regulation on the Statute for a European Cooperative Society."
"I would urge the Commission to take due account of that and thereby earn the gratitude of the 55 million people in Europe employed by cooperatives and the 163 million people who are members of them."
"(DE) Mr President, last week China demanded an end to the Tibet protests as the condition for further talks with representatives of the Dalai Lama."
"According to the Chinese Foreign Minister, the Tibetans must ditch their attempts to ruin the Olympic Games."
"The protesting Tibetans, however, surely cannot be expected to accept meekly the crushing of their demonstrations in March."
"The Chinese Government has the opportunity to change the situation in Tibet radically."
"Given an honest dialogue without prior conditions, the Tibetan people will take part in a constructive process of change."
"The first priority is to send out a clear signal, not least by allowing foreign observers into the country to assess the situation for themselves."
"Thank you, Mr Horáček!"
"May I also refer to our resolution of 10 April, in which we called on all EU politicians not to attend the opening ceremony on 8 August unless the rights of the Tibetans had been guaranteed."
"I once more commend that statement of 10 April to everyone."
"(HU) Mr President, when Pope Benedict XVI spoke to the Hungarian bishops regarding the burdensome legacy of the long era of Communist rule, it was most apposite."
"His comments are particularly topical today, which is the 50th anniversary of the execution of Imre Nagy, the martyred Prime Minister, and 60th anniversary of the start of the brutal religious persecutions and imprisonment of Cardinal József Mindszenthy."
"The ghost of this painful era, in which state violence was coupled with militant anti-religious sentiment, was raised by Magda Kósáné Kovács, post-Communist Member of this House, in her most recent intervention here in plenary, in which she sought to defend European values from Pope Benedict, or rather from the Catholic Church."
"A few years ago, former party chairman Mrs Kósáné Kovács made the defamatory claim that the Vatican, then under the leadership of Pope John Paul, was keen to get its hands on the whole of Europe and bring it under its control."
"As a bishop of the Reformed Church, knowing that the Christian churches themselves have helped shape genuine European values in this European Union which has its roots in the Christian Democrat movement, I reject every manifestation of anti-religious ideology and intolerance."
"Let us invite Pope Benedict to the European Parliament."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, fifty years ago today in Hungary, on 16 June 1958, Imre Nagy, Prime Minister of Hungary's 1956 revolution and struggle for freedom, was sentenced and executed following a summary show trial along with defence minister Pál Maléter and colleagues Miklós Gémes and József Szilágyi;"
"Géza Losonczi, meanwhile, was killed while still in prison. Their corpses, tied with wire and wrapped in paper, were buried face down."
"Their trial was one of the most shameful events and biggest injustices of the twentieth century."
"Imre Nagy was a fervent Communist, and yet he opted for his country to return to free Europe rather than remain in the Soviet camp."
"This made him a national hero, a martyr of the revolution, a politician of European standing."
"His moral stance made him an emblem of freedom and of a European Hungary."
"The reburial Imre Nagy deserved did not take place until 16 June 1989, but by then the Communist regime had come to an end and Hungary was able to rejoin the family of free European nations."
"The message of these events is clear: freedom and national independence were what Hungary aspired to as it shook off Communism."
"This is what those who died fifty years ago gave their lives for; their sacrifice was not in vain."
"(DE) Mr President, I listened very attentively to the Member who spoke before Mr Szájer and attacked my colleague Magda Kósáné Kovács in a totally inappropriate manner."
"Mrs Kovács is my deputy on the executive of the Socialist Group."
"She is not present here, which means that she cannot defend herself against that attack."
"I know that Mrs Kovács is a convinced democrat and a committed campaigner for European unity."
"She certainly does not deserve to have any Member abuse the privileges of this House in order to settle some domestic score or other that may exist between them in Hungary."
"I consider the remarks in question to be totally inappropriate and a grievous slur on the character of Magda Kovács, a slur which I reject with the utmost repugnance."
"(FR) Mr President, first I want to welcome the Commission's initiative to grant fishers emergency aid."
"Even if that aid is certainly not enough to resolve the problems in the sector, it does at least seem necessary at this point."
"The current situation is indeed critical: in the space of a year, the price of diesel oil has risen from 35 to 73 centimes a litre."
"So there is a heavy bill to pay for the oil price rise and in my constituency, the Baie de Somme, professional fishers are very much concerned and very bitter."
"Aside from the question of oil prices, fishers want above all to sell their fish at the right price and are opposed to the unjustified margins taken by intermediaries."
"This is more than a crisis; it is a structural issue for the fisheries sector that we must tackle at European level."
"As we have seen, the protest movement has taken on a European dimension."
"That is only logical given the fact that the fisheries policy is one of the oldest European policies."
"We must help the fisheries sector to modernise so that it can rid itself of the constraints imposed by the price of diesel oil, while respecting our obligation to protect the environment and manage fishery resources."
"With that in mind, I hope the plenary debate scheduled for Wednesday will conclude with a resolution that benefits the European fisheries that are now at risk."
"Mr President, Chee Soon Juan was released from Queenstown Prison in Singapore two days ago."
"He has been convicted and imprisoned several times in the last few years."
"Chee Soon Juan is not a criminal."
"His 'crime' is very simple: he is leader of the democratic opposition."
"He is constantly struggling for freedom and democracy in his country."
"Since his last release, the state-controlled media in Singapore started to discredit him, to destroy his credibility, with baseless personal attacks and character assassination."
"We have a strong solidarity with Mr Chee Soon Juan and his fellows, who are struggling and fighting for democracy and human rights in Singapore."
"We call on the Singaporean authorities to stop harassing the democratic opposition, to stop the violation of human rights and to start respecting the basic right of free expression."
"We hope very much that Singapore will go along with our strong wish to respect basic rights."
"Mr President, last week the Irish people made a democratic decision on the Lisbon Treaty which must be fully respected."
"While many of us who voted or campaigned for a 'yes' vote are disappointed in the result, I think it is important that we reflect on that result."
"In response to Mr Batten's remarks, I want to emphasise that Ireland is not anti-European."
"Ireland remains completely committed to the European idea."
"We are mindful of the fact that Ireland is one of 27 Member States, but this is not just an Irish problem."
"It is a problem for all Member States."
"Europe has faced many challenges in the past and it has overcome those challenges through mature and wise leadership."
"I would ask for the same to be shown here on this issue and on the challenges that we face."
"We are in uncharted waters and I think it is very important that we avoid knee-jerk reactions or hasty decisions."
"We need some reflection and maturity to make sure that we can fully address the present situation and try to get Europe back on the road so that it is fully accountable to the citizens of Europe."
"(EL) Mr President, the European Parliament's offices in the Member States are the line of communication between Parliament and the citizens."
"One of the main purposes of these offices is to inform public opinion, through various activities, about what is happening in the European Parliament."
"One such activity involves inviting journalists to come to Strasbourg to cover proceedings in plenary."
"On 24 January 2008, Mr President, I submitted a question to the European Parliament about the decision to reduce the budget for inviting the press."
"In spite of this, about five months have passed and I have not yet received an answer."
"Something similar is happening to other committees, so that legitimate questions put by MEPs remain unanswered."
"I wonder whether this policy can have any positive effect on the operation of Parliamentary institutions and the competent departments, at a time when the EU is in need of fully functioning procedures as provided for in its Rules."
"(FR) Mr President, I want to draw MEPs' attention to Sami Essid's expulsion from Italy to Tunisia on 3 June, in total violation of Italy's commitments under the European Convention on Human Rights and, in particular, Article 3 thereof."
"Why?"
"Because Mr Essid is accused of terrorism and the European Court of Human Rights has established without any doubt that any person accused of terrorism was without fail tortured in Tunisia."
"That is why the European Court asked Italy to suspend the expulsion measure."
"Nonetheless, Italy expelled him on 3 June, in total violation of its commitments."
"I ask both that Italy be reminded of its obligations as a party to the European Convention on Human Rights and as a Member State of the European Union, and for assurances that Mr Essid, now deported to Tunisia, will not suffer inhumane and degrading treatment there."
"(Applause)"
"(GA) Madam President, the Irish vote last Thursday against the Treaty of Lisbon was not a vote against Europe."
"Ireland's place is in the European Union, where it has obtained social and economic benefits - both north and south - due to its Membership."
"People were concerned about the weakening of Ireland's voice, and that of other small countries, in the European Union; about neutrality and military affairs; about workers' rights and public services."
"Not only were those concerns raised on the doorsteps, but they were also voiced in the opinion polls published throughout the campaign."
"Their automatic right to a referendum on future significant changes is also important."
"Some of those issues have already been raised in France and the Netherlands."
"We must address those concerns."
"(HU) Madam President, I speak now as a Member representing a country whose Parliament, supported by all the political parties, was second to ratify the Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe and first to ratify the Lisbon Treaty."
"In this capacity I would like to remind you that the greatest danger in Europe today is national egoism, or nationalism."
"We must give some thought to whether we should be rewarding those who constantly demand more, or should we instead be sanctioning this kind of behaviour?"
"Protecting national interests is a fundamental duty of every country's government and its representatives in the European Parliament, but the European Union cannot function unless sober compromises are reached among the various national interests, and unless there is solidarity among its nations and peoples."
"I therefore strongly urge our Polish friends to lend their support, as the other twenty-six Member States have done, to establishing the European Institute of Innovation and Technology in Budapest."
"In the case of Frontex in Warsaw, Hungary too seemed to be in the running for a while, but did not use its veto."
"It would therefore be unfair if our Polish friends did not reciprocate with a similar gesture."
"Hungarian and Pole are two good friends; as the saying goes, 'Magyar and Pole, two friends so fine; together they fight and drink their wine'."
"That concludes this item."
"Revision of the framework directive on waste (debate)"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading by Caroline Jackson, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on waste and repealing certain Directives (11406/4/2007 - C6-0056/2008 -."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, following your ruling that there is no time for points of order, I will continue with my speech on the Waste Framework Directive."
"It is a little difficult to do so against this background, but I will persevere."
"Since certain comments have been made on this point in the British press recently, may I begin by drawing attention once again to my declaration of interests, which I made on the record, and which cites my membership of the Environmental Advisory Board of Shanks plc."
"That company operates a wide range of waste technologies in Britain and on the continent, and the primary purpose of its Environmental Advisory Board is to provide independent audits of the operation of its plants."
"My fellow board members include the chairman of the EU Scientific Advisory Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks and a member of the Green Alliance."
"Like many Members, I value the opportunity this kind of experience has given me to learn at close hand about the issues and problems facing this industry and those who work in it."
"Turning to the Directive, it has been a long and tortuous road to this second reading and I congratulate those of my colleagues who have accompanied me on it to the very end."
"The issue is a very important one."
"Various judgments in the Court of Justice regarding the status of waste destined for treatment in energy-from-waste plants needed to be clarified."
"New definitions were needed."
"Two existing directives on hazardous waste and on waste oils were repealed and their provisions transferred to the Waste Framework Directive."
"However, the committee was not content with those original proposals, and went on to transform the Directive from a technical one into a campaigning one."
"I congratulate my colleagues on that."
"I have to say that the mood in the Council was very bleak, possibly mirroring our economic times."
"There was much resistance to what we wanted to do and the Council drove a very hard bargain, but we achieved the following."
"Firstly, we have added recycling targets to the text."
"That is a very significant achievement since these were not in the original proposal, and this is the first time that recycling targets for household waste have appeared in EU legislation."
"It is entirely due to Parliament that they are there."
"The new Article 8a requires Member States to take the necessary measures designed to achieve an overall recycling rate of 50% by 2020 for paper, metal, plastic and glass from household and similar waste."
"There are some Member States, such as Germany, for which this is a conservative target, but there are many for which it is very demanding, and we need to take them into account too."
"The same article also requires that by 2020 70% of construction and demolition waste be recycled."
"The Greens and their supporters are putting it about that the targets are not enforceable."
"They may even believe that, but they are - extraordinarily - rejecting their own achievement."
"The Commission has issued a statement to help them, and Mr Dimas will confirm this."
"The statement says quite clearly that if in 2020 the targets are not achieved, this will be a serious indication for the Commission that a Member State has not taken the necessary measures designed to achieve the targets."
"On this basis, supported by conclusions in the tri-annual national progress reports, the Commission can take Member States to court for non-compliance with the requirements of the Directive."
"It may be important to the Greens not to be happy, because Greens are eternal campaigners, but they should take some account of what the Commission has said in that statement."
"Secondly, we have added new provisions on the prevention of waste, in Article 8a."
"These will mean that the Commission has to report on the evolution of EU waste generation and the scope for waste prevention by 2011, and by 2014 must produce proposals for waste prevention, and decoupling objectives for 2020."
"It proved impossible to get the Council or the Commission to agree to quantitative waste prevention targets in this Directive, partly because the data necessary for those targets is missing, but Parliament has, through its amendments, created momentum for future policy that may contain waste prevention targets."
"The new article therefore represents a significant achievement."
"It is something for our successors to build on."
"We cannot do everything in this Directive, but have to hand things on to our successors in the next decade."
"Thirdly, we have firmly placed the famous EU waste hierarchy in EU law for the first time."
"We have been talking about this for years, but if you look at EU law it is not there."
"However, it will be soon, and we can celebrate a minor victory in getting the Council to agree that the hierarchy shall apply 'as a priority order' in waste prevention and management legislation."
"Fourthly, we have secured agreement to place better emphasis on hazardous waste management, as several colleagues wanted."
"Fifthly, we have also ensured that priority will continue to be given to the regeneration of waste oils - although there was no support for a policy, which I know some colleagues wanted, that would have made regeneration mandatory in all Member States."
"We secured Council support for the amendment put forward by Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges and colleagues designed to make it easier for SMEs to use the waste list, and we also obtained support for a new article on biowaste."
"In conclusion, the Directive specifies the energy efficiency criteria for incineration, with energy recovery to be classed as a recovery operation rather than disposal."
"That is the best deal available."
"Anyone who thinks that we could get anything better by going to conciliation would be deceiving themselves."
"In the famous words of Jack Nicholson, 'this is as good as it gets'."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me first thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Jackson, on her excellent contribution to the revision of the Waste Framework Directive, and the shadow rapporteurs and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for their positive and constructive contribution."
"With this Directive, the Community is taking the first substantial step towards creating a recycling society."
"The Directive introduces a modern approach to waste management, treating waste as useable raw materials and providing clearer definitions, simplified regulations, and new, ambitious targets."
"Thanks to the incorporation of the provisions of the Directives on Hazardous Waste and Waste Oil, this Directive contributes to the broader effort in improving legislation and simplifying the acquis communautaire."
"The next step, of course, will be its successful implementation."
"Parliament's considerable efforts and perseverance have been rewarded."
"It was not easy to persuade the Member States to accept the new recycling targets and agree to the waste prevention objectives."
"Nevertheless, this aim has been achieved in full."
"Some doubts have been expressed regarding whether these targets will be implemented by the Member States."
"I should like to underline that with the current formulation of the quantitative targets, the Commission has the ability and the political will to refer Member States to the European Court of Justice if they have not taken the measures that are essential for achieving the recycling targets."
"Parliament has incorporated many other significant points into the text of the Directive."
"Among these are the hierarchy of five categories of waste, new provisions on the separate collection of biowaste and hazardous waste, and many useful clarifications."
"These points enrich the Commission's original proposal and improve the text, so that it becomes an ambitious legislative instrument for future generations."
"The fact that it has been possible to achieve agreement at second reading is, of course, particularly satisfying."
"I should like to emphasise once more the European Parliament's constructive role in this process."
"This Directive creates a new framework for waste management and provides a solid foundation for other Community policy initiatives."
"The European Commission is in a position to support the compromise package in order to achieve agreement at second reading."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, Caroline Jackson referred to a quotation I think from Jack Nicholson."
"Knowing her golfing prowess, I thought it might have been from Jack Nicklaus, but no doubt they would have had the same sort of quotation: 'This is about as good as it gets'."
"That is a great tribute to our rapporteur and I salute her on behalf of our Group."
"It is necessary that we support her and take action."
"It is not as good as we might have envisaged it being at one point."
"However, we have made enormous progress."
"Commissioner, it is up to you now to ensure that it is implemented and to bring forward the subsequent provisions on prevention with your target of 2014."
"I know you will put this process in motion and that is important too."
"It is important because we have had a whole raft of waste proposals in my time in this Parliament: we have dealt with vehicles, electrical and electronic equipment, batteries, packaging and so forth."
"It grows fastest in some areas like municipal waste, and that is why we need to take action."
"My own country sets one of the worst examples in terms of waste."
"The Netherlands we salute as setting the best example."
"However, we all need to catch up."
"We all need to have more recycling so as to meet the terms of the hierarchy: we need to meet the recycling targets and prevention targets and so forth."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am helped by the fact that Mrs Jackson and Commissioner Dimas have given a full explanation of the main elements of this compromise, which I also support."
"Let me therefore put forward some eminently political thoughts."
"I am a negotiator and I always ponder whether or not the compromise that has been reached is valid."
"I therefore read the texts again with a fresh mind, following the night of the negotiations."
"Goodness only knows why negotiations always have to end at night."
"Is an agreement reached in the morning of less value?"
"There is food for thought there as well."
"In all sincerity - and I say this to our Green and GUE colleagues, and to Karl-Heinz Florenz who I see has re-tabled an amendment from the Environment Committee which bore my signature and which I cannot therefore but support - in all sincerity, looking at both the compromise and the Environment Committee texts, we have achieved - and the main credit goes to you, Mrs Jackson - a really amazing result."
"Are we aware that there was nothing about recycling in the Commission proposal and then in the common position?"
"Nothing apart from a recital which mentioned the recycling society without going into further detail."
"There was nothing!"
"Now we have precise targets; we have a review in 2014 when other materials, not covered at present, could be included; we know for sure, as Commissioner Dimas has just confirmed it, that legal action can be taken against States failing to implement the measures planned to achieve those targets."
"That seems a very important fact to me."
"It is also very important that a political and legal process has finally been set in motion to compel States to draw up genuine waste prevention plans, and that a hierarchy of waste disposal which respects the environment has finally been included in European law, and is legally binding, making waste no longer just a problem but a resource."
"In all honesty, therefore, and shouldering our full responsibility, I believe that rejecting this compromise and heading for a risky conciliation would not be in the interest of European citizens, but would turn the achievement and establishment of these targets, set out here in a clear and absolutely incontrovertible way, into a kind of Russian roulette."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, with this text we hope to reverse the trend of producing more waste than we recycle."
"It is the result of several years of debates and taking account of the reality of two major groups of Member States as regards waste management systems: recycling states and landfilling states."
"The achieved compromise must be seen in this light."
"For the first time, prevention and recycling have been given a central role in the Directive."
"Furthermore, the text includes the necessary dynamics to adapt higher targets as well as targets for new waste streams It is a carefully balanced compromise: achievable and realistic."
"Amendments: we do not consider that in their entirety they endanger the general agreement."
"With regard to by-products - the article in the body of the Directive and the article on end of waste - most critics fear sham recovery."
"As the issue is not internationally agreed, the danger is real."
"It must, therefore, be made clear that the Commission will use the guidelines from February 2007 in order to prevent this."
"I would much appreciate it if Mr Dimas would give us today an assurance that a substance or object will be shipped as a by-product outside the Community only once the conditions of Article 4(1) are met in the Community."
"Similarly for end of waste."
"When certain waste ceases to be waste, the substance or object resulting from it can be shipped as such outside the Community only once the conditions of Article 5 are met in the Community."
"It would make it easier for many MEPs to vote for the compromise."
"To conclude, I wish to extend many thanks to the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs for fruitful cooperation to the benefit of the citizens of Europe."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I would also like to thank Mrs Jackson."
"We may have ended up in disagreement about the tax, but I think that there is no doubt that there has been excellent cooperation throughout the discussions."
"We are not happy today - I wish we were - and I would like to give some of the reasons why we are not happy with the compromise."
"We have supported 30 of the compromise amendments and we have tabled others to try and strengthen the compromise in the areas of hazardous waste, end of waste, by-products and separate collection of biowaste."
"But from the very start, the main issues for us were the adoption of binding targets on waste reduction and recycling and opposition to the reclassification of incineration as energy recovery."
"The final compromise does not have a legally binding target for waste reduction."
"A study on waste prevention is no alternative to stabilisation measures; the continuous growth in waste is unsustainable and without this measure it will continue to grow."
"Although recycling and reuse targets have been set at 50% and 70% and the Member States are legally obliged to put measures in place to achieve these targets, the targets themselves are not binding."
"I am grateful for the explanation that we have had from Mr Dimas, but why was there such a debate over the wording of this?"
"The reason was to avoid making those targets binding."
"Manufacturing and industrial waste, which have a huge potential for reuse and recycling, have been left out altogether."
"Incineration cannot be viewed as a waste management option on a par with recycling and reuse; this will just attract further investment into incinerators and directly undermine the waste hierarchy."
"If the weak compromise is adopted, we will have missed the opportunity to ensure real EU action and leadership on waste policy when we so desperately need it."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (GA) Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Jackson for her work."
"We have worked well together to make some improvements to the original Commission proposal, although we do not agree on everything."
"Many people throughout the Union will be concerned about the proposal to 're-brand' incinerators as a form of recovery if they meet certain efficiency criteria."
"We remain opposed to the 're-branding' of incineration and have put down an amendment to have this deleted."
"With regard to recycling, the latest proposed deal sets out targets which may be very difficult to enforce due to vagueness in the wording which states that, ""member states shall take the necessary measures designed to achieve recycling targets.”"
"Good legislation demands that we be more precise in our wording on targets and do not leave interpretation to the European Court of Justice."
"Therefore we want to defend and keep the wording as voted by the committee."
"Proposals on waste prevention have weakened to the point where they will not be able to make a substantive enough contribution or to clearly help Member States in stabilising and reducing their waste."
"The weakness of the reference to prevention targets means that a harmonised prevention initiative and indicators is not yet enshrined in legislation"
"Therefore, we can be cosignatories to some of the work we have done together."
"However, regarding other parts of it, we believe that we must table amendments."
"I would like, once again, to thank Mrs Jackson for the open and inclusive way she corresponded with the shadow raporteurs."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has produced a very good report as a recommendation for second reading."
"I am thinking in particular of the prominent place given to the waste hierarchy, the scrapping of the by-products category, the careful handling of the end-of-waste concept, the protection rules on hazardous waste and the prevention, reuse and recycling objectives."
"The only negative aspect of the report by the Committee on the Environment was the amendment to encourage waste incineration by regarding it as efficient use if enough energy is recovered."
"In the negotiating result achieved after two months, not all that much remained of the recommendation by the Committee on the Environment and that was due not to the rapporteur, but to the uncompromising position of the Council."
"The article on by-products was not amended and Member States can decide on their own initiative when waste ceases to be waste, with all the disruption to competition that that entails."
"Furthermore, no prevention objectives have been set and the reuse and recycling objectives are considerably weakened."
"It was for those reasons that I did not support the compromise package."
"However, I hope that we still adopt the better parts of the Committee on the Environment report when we vote tomorrow."
"I am referring in particular to the amendments by the GUE/NGL Group and the Greens."
"The environment deserves that we go through a further mediation procedure to that end, in which we actually get the Council to make the necessary improvements."
"If we, as a Parliament, are convincing, it should be possible, with the leadership of Mrs Jackson, to do more than is the case at present."
"I should like to thank Mrs Jackson and the other shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation and I hope we shall see a successful outcome from the vote tomorrow."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome and support all the amendments intended to introduce targets which are indispensable for prevention with a view to improved recycling."
"Naturally, I also support the insistence on a clearly defined and clearly structured waste hierarchy."
"It is also indispensable to be able to draw on sound and comparable statistical data if further progress is to be made as regards both prevention and recycling of industrial waste."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I consider that we in Parliament must staunchly support the application of the hierarchy principle as a general rule, and not as a guiding principle as preferred by the Council."
"The directive must clarify in detail the criteria to be used for any departures which, in my view, must where necessary be framed in an ordered and distinct way, so that there can be no doubt about what is considered as recovery and what is considered as disposal of waste."
"I agree with the rapporteur that energy from waste plants can play an important part in dealing with residual waste and that we are now faced with an important choice in this respect, bearing in mind the European Union's dependence on insecure imports of energy from so many other parts of the world."
"I would conclude by saying that I also welcome the amendments relating to the regeneration of waste oils, which had initially been taken out."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, may I say to Caroline Jackson that I am unhappy with the compromise, but that is not because of any flaw in Mrs Jackson's negotiating skills."
"On this occasion, I have to say to Stavros Dimas that my displeasure is directed at the Commission for a change."
"In the case of aircraft, industry and motor vehicles, the Commission is extremely strict, haggling for every gramm by which it can reduce CO2 emissions, and rightly so."
"In the case of waste-management policy, however, CO2 does not enter the equation at all."
"The evidence points to a potential cut of 100 million tonnes of CO2."
"That is a golden opportunity, but it has been squandered in this document."
"My second cause for regret is that we have become a kind of concreting firm."
"We concrete over the divergences in Europe instead of aiming for harmonisation."
"Although we define targets, they are not binding."
"Over the next 20 years we shall not obtain any genuine harmonised targets in Europe."
"That is what disturbs me about this report."
"Twenty years is almost half a generation."
"We ought to have been far more innovative, and we could have been."
"I believe, Commissioner, there is only one major problem, namely Article 14."
"I would be delighted if you could say some more about that provision."
"In a federal state, it may be a highly complex matter."
"It is about the question of mixed or unmixed waste management and how it is dealt with in accordance with the principle of self-sufficiency."
"I beg you earnestly to comment on this matter again in your concluding explanations."
"At the present time, of course, one or two people are saying that we shall secure a large majority, but, if these questions are not resolved, some of the large countries will undoubtedly agonise over their vote."
"Please consider that we do not only have tomorrow's reading; we have a third reading too, and 64 amendments on the table are quite a lot for a conciliation procedure."
"So if you take the opportunity, Commissioner, to explain one or two things about these unresolved issues, I could imagine that we might reach a successful outcome."
"Madam President, in Europe we are currently recycling only 27% of our waste and almost half of our waste ends up in landfills."
"This shows that we have to fundamentally change our waste management."
"Most importantly we should encourage waste prevention, strengthen reuse and recycling and minimise the amount of landfill waste."
"Therefore I welcome the fact that the waste hierarchy remained in the new compromise text after some debate."
"As regards prevention - the main aim of the legislation - I miss the waste stabilisation targets in the latest text, but we had already adopted them in the first reading."
"In the old Member States one person generates almost twice as much household waste - 570 kg per year - as a person in the new Member States - 300 to 350 kg per year."
"So the rich nations should start to decrease waste production first."
"The amount of generated waste is increasing on a European scale."
"Therefore prevention programmes, as proposed in the compromise, are not enough: we must set binding targets to halt the growing waste generation."
"That is why I consider supporting Amendment 48 which reintroduces the waste stabilisation target."
"I welcome the mandatory waste reuse and recycling targets, but I am afraid that the new text, which says that Member States 'shall take the necessary measures' to achieve the targets is not enough."
"We need concrete, enforceable and binding targets, both for household and industrial waste."
"Therefore I propose to support Amendment 82, to ensure the enforcement of the recycling targets."
"Having made these comments, I welcome the report and the work of Mrs Jackson, my friend Guido Sacconi and others."
"Madam President, this agreement is as good as it gets, the rapporteur says, and I pay credit to what she has achieved."
"There are gains to be made at 3 o'clock in the morning during a conciliation session that cannot be achieved at other times during the negotiating process."
"We all recognise that the size of our waste mountain needs to be reduced."
"One British supermarket has recently announced that by 2012 it intends to reduce the use of packaging by 25% and its use of carrier bags by 33%."
"It wants to ensure that waste food is converted to energy by anaerobic digestion."
"It wants to restrict the number of materials used in packaging to just four which are easy to recycle or compost and it wants to print simple symbols on all packaging to make it easy for customers to recycle or compost their waste."
"Now all this is a matter of political will."
"Reducing waste is a matter of political will and that will can be strengthened by European Union law."
"I suspect that we could have got the Council to at least agree to bring forward the date by which it will publish proposals for waste reduction from 2014 to a few years earlier."
"Parliament has done well."
"It could, perhaps, have done better."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal is a disappointment."
"It is nothing short of a failure to meet the need for more efforts to tackle climate change and conserve resources."
"We know that the European Environment Agency has predicted a 50% increase in the volume of waste by 2020."
"In this respect, the fact that binding stabilisation levels or binding recycling targets have not been prescribed represents a flop, a caving-in to pressure from the Member States."
"The instrument that was needed has unquestionably been watered down in response to that pressure."
"It is also disappointing that waste incineration is increasingly becoming the ultima ratio at the expense of waste avoidance."
"It was precisely to redress this imbalance that these recycling quotas and the stabilisation of waste volumes would have served."
"I hope that, by adopting amendments, we can still make some improvements to this draft and actually do what is necessary, namely to formulate the sort of ambitious waste-management policy we need in the European Union."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry but I have to criticise some of the compromises reached as, in some cases, they run the risk of undermining what Parliament very rightly voted for at first reading."
"I am also sorry because these changes for the worse have been imposed by the Council and are mistaken and dangerous."
"I say this from my own standpoint, living, as I do, in Italy."
"In this case, Italy unfortunately offers a bad example of waste management, failing to respect the spirit and the letter of European law under which a virtuous hierarchy, ranging from reduction to recycling, has for some time been consolidated."
"That hierarchy has to be strengthened by quantified and certain targets - for reduction and recycling - for industrial waste as well, and not weakened, as is to some extent the case, by leaving scope for disposal policies which undermine its philosophy."
"Italy has, for instance, offered billions of euro in incentives for waste incineration in recent years, with results that are evident to all and can in no way be seen as positive."
"Madam President, across Europe, every Member State is struggling with runaway energy prices."
"Therefore seeing waste as potentially important fuel is, I believe, both sensible and necessary."
"It is surely a win-win situation - both dealing with our massive stockpiles of waste and providing an alternative energy supply source, particularly as we face an energy crisis and increasing dependence upon insecure foreign supplies of oil."
"I therefore do not therefore understand the reticence of some in facing up to the obvious advantage of promoting energy from waste."
"I fear some colleagues feel so precious about their recycling and anti-incineration dogmas that they would sacrifice the opportunity of heat and power from waste."
"In that, I have to say, I believe they are profoundly mistaken."
"On a related note, could I say that I very strongly favour maximising the definition of 'recovery' under the Directive, making it indisputably clear that energy from waste represents recovery, not disposal, of waste."
"We should particularly apply that to our agricultural sector, where there is much opportunity in that regard."
"(FR) Madam President, first I want to offer warm thanks to our rapporteur, Caroline Jackson, for the remarkable job she has done, which reflects the quality of her expertise on the delicate issue of waste management."
"I also congratulate her on listening so attentively, which she has done throughout the negotiations, and thanks to which we have achieved this difficult compromise with the Council and the Commission."
"We have a new directive that endeavours to clarify a number of points."
"We welcome the waste management and hierarchy and the ambitious recycling targets set for the Member States - 50% for household waste by the year 2020."
"Waste management must be based on prevention, reuse, recycling, recovery and, lastly, disposal, and this hierarchy must be a guiding principle."
"It is also important for incinerators to be subject to energy efficiency criteria, as set out in the text, provided of course that incineration is used only when no other method is feasible."
"On that basis, I regard it as very positive that the text also provides for very tight controls on hazardous waste and more stringent traceability measures."
"This is, of course, a compromise and we would have wished to go much further on certain points, such as adding environmental criteria in the definition of recovery and setting more stringent conditions for departures from the status of waste; then there is the issue of by-products, where the definition poses some problems."
"Nonetheless, we absolutely must support this compromise because we know full well that it was difficult to reach and that if we want to go to conciliation we would be taking the risk of defeat and delaying matters hugely."
"We must realise that since our European waste policy has been a failure to date, it is far preferable to agree a solution that seems reasonable, and the European Commission must be very vigilant in ensuring that this directive is implemented properly."
"We will see if we can go further in a few years' time."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for my part I am not satisfied with either the form or the substance of this compromise text."
"On the form, I believe we cannot do our job properly when, after spending two years working on drawing up a text, we find that the final decisions - which are more than just adjustments - are taken on the quiet and go far beyond what was adopted in the Committee on the Environment and only land on Members' desks a few hours before the vote."
"On the substance, this compromise text is a cop-out that fails to give a clear definition of recovery, no longer tries to stabilise the volume of waste, no longer sets out ambitious recycling targets and unfortunately reflects the inability of the Commission and the Council to translate the highly ambitious declarations made at European and international level into actions."
"No, I am not satisfied, and I am in fact concerned at our political incapacity to take genuine environmental action or action to improve our health, which is also why I have voted against the text."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I want to pay tribute to the work done by our rapporteur, Caroline Jackson, and by Mojka Drčar Murko, rapporteur for our ALDE Group."
"The question of hazardous waste raises vital issues of traceability, non-dilution, homogeneous storing of information on waste movement over a long period, i.e. five years for all parts of the chain; yet all those issues have been treated rather lightly."
"That is more than regrettable in terms of health and the environment."
"In regard to by-products, I am most disappointed."
"I am not against the concept of by-products: on the contrary, I recognise their importance; but I do feel that the definition given in the Council's common position does not offer enough guarantees and that at the end of the day it risks destroying the very concept as a result of the possible abuses."
"Other questions, such as the status of end of waste and the recovery of waste, seem to me to have been sacrificed in the name of an agreement at second reading."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Jackson, we shall be tabling a cross-party amendment that attracted majority support in this House at first reading."
"It addresses the following problem: in many countries of the EU untreated, unsterilised food scraps are repeatedly fed to livestock or fly-tipped."
"Time and again, this kind of behaviour poses the risk of diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease."
"It is therefore essential to ensure that food waste is sterilised and safely disposed of by approved companies using suitable methods."
"Member States should only be allowed to authorise its use in pig feed if it has been sterilised for 20 minutes at a temperature of 133°C and a pressure of 3 bar and if all other requirements of Regulation 1774/2002 have been met in full."
"I firmly believe that, if Parliament adopts this amendment, the Council will incorporate this rule into the compromise."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the compromise that has been reached is a retrograde step from the text approved by the Committee on the Environment."
"The original text said that waste production should be reduced to 2009 levels from 2012, introducing a genuine policy of prevention with measures staggered over time."
"That objective has been rescinded in the compromise, leaving everything vague."
"The Committee on the Environment had set minimum targets for the recycling of domestic and industrial waste, to be achieved by set - albeit far-off - deadlines."
"Those targets have also been watered down, limiting them solely to some types of material and excluding industrial waste."
"Another negative aspect is the promotion of incinerators over a certain efficiency from disposal plant to recovery plant."
"This directive seems to be giving in to what powerful lobbies want."
"The outcome of the Irish referendum has shown that you are either on the side of citizens and their concerns, or you run of risk of rejection of the idea of Europe and paralysis of the integration process."
"Parliament must take heed of the thousands of emails from European citizens calling for greater commitments and binding targets, otherwise we risk losing another major opportunity to enhance the credibility of the European institutions."
"(HU) Thank you very much, Madam President."
"I welcome the compromise package, but at the same time I would like to emphasise that the compromise is a rather fragile one."
"It is therefore vitally important that each of the Member States behaves responsibly and does not go looking for any loopholes that might have remained in the legislation."
"In Hungary at present, separate collection of waste accounts for 2% of the total."
"In my view, there is nothing more to say about this other than to express the hope that the impact of the Directive will finally help to shift the situation forwards from this low position."
"In the eastern half of Europe, investment in waste management has increased in recent years, largely thanks to funding obtained from the Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession (ISPA) and the Cohesion Fund."
"Construction of landfill sites has been a major activity, but in a number of communities waste separation programmes have been initiated, including measures aimed at separate collection of organic waste in some instances."
"On the other hand, genuine measures and investment aimed at waste reduction have not been forthcoming at all, and a distinct industry for processing recyclable materials has yet to emerge."
"The nature of the guidelines set out by the European Union will therefore be crucial, not least for Hungary."
"According to the statistics, every community could basically achieve a 50% reduction in the waste it produces as soon as it introduces dry waste recycling and separate door-to-door collection of organic waste."
"When setting out the new obligations, however, we must also consider their enforceability and associated costs."
"For example, can the additional investments be put in place in the same areas as the ISPA projects?"
"Can the original contracts be amended?"
"If not, then it makes little difference whether demand exists to expand waste separation or whether legislation is in place to reduce the amount of waste that goes to landfill; under the twenty-year contracts the waste collected must be taken to the landfill sites that have been constructed."
"In addition to approving this directive, therefore, we must not delay in getting to work on potential ways of amending the existing contracts."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on her outstanding work. Thank you very much."
"(DE) Madam President, I believe we can congratulate the rapporteur."
"She has certainly managed to achieve an acceptable outcome with the Council."
"I particularly wish to emphasise the inclusion of the divergent waste hierarchy."
"There are, however, minus points, which are truly incomprehensible and which were put into this document by the Council."
"The first of these relates to animal by-products."
"We had established in committee that animal by-products would be dropped from this framework waste directive."
"What the Council has now done is to erect the sort of bureaucratic obstacle that drives farmers to the barricades."
"It lays down that slurry processed into biogas suddenly becomes a waste product."
"Do you know what this means?"
"It means that farmers will need a waste-treatment licence and will have to specify the precise volume and nature of the waste to be treated and the place of treatment."
"The Animal By-products Regulation lays down explicitly that exceptions apply to slurry."
"It would now therefore be easier for a farmer to spread slurry on his fields than to process it into biogas."
"In other words, we are creating bureaucratic obstacles to a practice we actually seek to encourage."
"The second point concerns waste oil."
"The Waste Oil Directive - which, as you know, is now to be repealed - stipulates that waste oils are to be treated and regenerated."
"There are large volumes being processed under that directive."
"It has already been established, of course, that waste oils need not be treated in cases where regeneration is not economically viable or technically possible."
"It has now been laid down that the Member States are to decide."
"Well, are we now a European Union or have we reverted to a collection of Member States?"
"The fact is that we are quite clearly breaking up the market again."
"I find that very disquieting."
"Let me move on to the question of increased self-sufficiency."
"Local authorities will now determine who may dispose of what and when."
"Needless to say, there was a great deal of pressure from local authorities with spare incineration capacity."
"That, however, is the wrong way to go."
"It is not an option, and this extension is causing the market economy to grind to a complete halt in the realm of waste management."
"(NL) Madam President, I think it is clear that this compromise is an important step forward for European environmental law."
"All the same, I am not entirely happy with the compromise."
"Why not?"
"My own region, Flanders, along with, for instance, the Netherlands, has the best waste policy and is excellent at sorting and recycling, so we find the proposed recycling and prevention targets totally inadequate."
"It really does not give us any encouragement at all to do better in the future."
"We are also not entirely happy about the possibility of household waste incinerators being regarded as an efficient use on the basis of the energy efficiency formula, which we believe might, in practice, create a great deal of confusion."
"All the same, I am certain that the overall result has to be seen as very positive and I therefore want to thank Mrs Jackson sincerely for her huge contribution."
"We shall be supporting the compromise."
"(HU) Madam President, in its present form, unfortunately, the Waste Framework Directive threatens the expansion of biogas use."
"I completely agree with our fellow Member Mr Schnellhardt from the PPE-DE Group that the present directive is inadequate with regard to biogas production, as also with regard to the use of slurry or municipal waste."
"In its present form, unfortunately, the Waste Directive will jeopardise expansion of biogas use."
"This calls the Jackson report into question."
"Within the framework of the Waste Directive, the definition of animal manure used for biogas production as waste is ambiguous."
"If the scope of the directive were to include this, it would make it impossible to produce biogas from animal manure, despite the fact that this would have major advantages from the point of view of energy management, the environment and climate protection."
"We must clear up this muddle and restore legislative consistency as soon as possible, and therefore we must adopt the Commission's position on the directive as regards biogas."
"(PL) Madam President, congratulations to the rapporteur on a realistic appraisal of the growing waste problem."
"The basic assumptions in the proposed regulations are waste prevention and material recycling."
"Recovery of energy is simpler, but it should not replace material recycling, which is more difficult."
"For this reason it is necessary to create the conditions to enable material recycling to take place and to make more precise legal distinctions describing, for example, when scrap metal does not constitute waste, but becomes a raw material."
"We need better and cheaper material recycling technologies."
"Products should be designed in such a way as to simplify recycling."
"Selective collections are needed and these need to be adapted to the market in such a way that both households and potential users of secondary materials can benefit."
"Without these solutions we face the risk of a repeat of the present situation in Naples, where, unfortunately, the incineration of waste may turn out to be the only option."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank all the speakers in this debate for their positive contributions."
"On the basis of the agreed text, Member States will now have to take a number of measures in order to improve their waste management."
"The Directive lays down clear definitions and waste management principles, which I trust will resolve the existing interpretation problems, reduce the number of court cases and set a sound legal basis for the functioning of the waste treatment sector."
"A number of key elements have been included in the overall compromise package that is now proposed."
"The most important are these."
"Firstly, the environmental objective of the Directive is now clear and ambitious."
"The level of environmental protection has not only been maintained but also strengthened in several cases, such as hazardous waste."
"The co-legislators have agreed on a number of cornerstone definitions, including definitions of waste, prevention, recycling and recovery."
"These definitions are clear and understandable."
"In addition, the Directive successfully incorporates the provisions of two other directives to make the legislation more accessible while maintaining the high standards of environmental protection."
"A distinction between recovery and disposal has been made clear, with a possibility for the Commission to further delineate this distinction should there be such a need."
"A clear five-step 'waste hierarchy' has been set up which promotes waste prevention and allows for disposal of residual waste only as the last resort."
"At the same time, it allows for the necessary scope of flexibility justified by sound life-cycle considerations."
"I would like to recall the importance given by Parliament during the negotiations to strengthening the upper levels of the 'waste hierarchy' by introducing the recycling targets."
"If these targets are not met in 2020, the Commission can take Member States to court for non-compliance with the requirements of the Directive."
"In addition, the current formulation introduces a more regular and thorough process of monitoring the measures taken by Member States to attain the required targets in advance of the 2020 deadline, instead of a simple check of the actual compliance levels in 2020 when waste management systems are already in place."
"Such an early enforcement process can help to avoid unpleasant surprises in 2020."
"Last but not least, the Directive introduces a completely new dimension on waste prevention which the Commission is keen to pursue immediately after its adoption and transposition."
"The Member States will now have to establish their national waste management plans and networks which need to reflect the principles and new obligations set out in the revised Directive."
"Article 14 of the Waste Framework Directive does not prescribe whether private or public authorities should participate in the setting-up and in the operation of such networks, nor does it affect in any possible way the ownership - public or private - of waste-management operations and infrastructures."
"The division of responsibilities between the public and private sectors is an internal matter that can only be decided by the Member States."
"If an adequate network of disposal and recovery operations is already in place - be it private, public or mixed - there is no need for additional measures to set it up."
"Regarding the concerns relating to the lack of a recycling target for manufacturing and industrial waste, my services will look into the possibility of setting such a target as the first priority within the context of the 2014 review, which is foreseen in Article 8a (point 4)."
"Regarding the issue of feeding animals with animal by-products such as catering waste, this is regulated by the Animal By-Products Regulation, which is currently under review."
"It should be addressed in that regulation as the Waste Framework Directive is not the right place to regulate the use of catering waste."
"Concerning the question of whether by-product requirements and end-of-waste criteria must be fulfilled in the European Union before shipment to third countries, the Commission confirms that this is the case."
"Regarding the question of whether manure should be excluded from the scope of the Waste Framework Directive, manure is not considered waste when it is used as a fertiliser."
"However, it is considered waste when it is destined for further treatment or disposal operations, for instance incineration, production of biogas or compost and landfilling."
"Excluding manure from the scope of waste legislation would create a serious gap in environmental protection, since there would be no legal means to control issues such as emissions to air and water, landfilling requirements, noise, odour etc."
"Finally, the European Union should promote the production of biogas and the composting of waste."
"However, biogas and composting plants are not environmentally neutral."
"They also emit to the air and water and can be a source of nuisance, for instance in terms of odours or noise."
"Excluding manure destined for biogas production or composting plants from the scope of the Waste Framework Directive would result in excluding such plants from the scope of the IPPC Directive."
"To conclude, I should like once again to congratulate and thank Mrs Jackson for her excellent work."
"The Commission is very pleased with the outcome of the negotiations and can accept the proposed compromise amendments in full."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, just briefly I would like to thank all those colleagues who took part in the debate."
"There is only one colleague that I want to respond to, and that is Mr Davies - hereinafter known as 'Chris 'Newsnight' Davies', for the programme that he likes appearing on - who said that I gave in too easily in the Council."
"I hope that my colleagues will reinforce me when I say that I did not give in too easily and that I have never given in easily on anything."
"As Mrs Laperrouze will attest on the water issue, the Council is getting increasingly difficult to negotiate with. As the recession bites, it realises that this legislation is going to cost money and it is reluctant to accept Parliament's amendments."
"We have a choice tomorrow morning."
"We can agree to the package of amendments before us and I hope very much that is what will happen."
"We can vote through some major amendments, for example on by-products, which will mean that the package falls and we all go into conciliation."
"Won't that be fun!"
"Or we can agree perhaps to some minor amendment, or to an amendment which is characterised by its movers as minor, such as Amendment 88 on which I await the Commission's opinion, perhaps overnight."
"I think it is very doubtful indeed as to whether the Council will accept any amendments, however minor, so I am in favour of the package itself, unamended."
"After all, the package must mean something, otherwise why did the Council fight so strongly over it?"
"It is not a meaningless package as the Greens are trying to make out; it is a package with teeth."
"I would like in conclusion to thank the shadows - Caroline Jackson and the Shadows, it sounds like a 1960s band - for their cooperation, without necessarily wishing to see them again and again and again in conciliation."
"I think we ought to try to put this issue to bed tomorrow morning."
"in writing. - (DE) With the new framework directive on waste, Parliament has now won acceptance for the establishment of high and binding recycling quotas."
"There was, indeed, an urgent need for these, and I look forward confidently to a future in which waste separation and recycling will be practised to an ever-increasing extent throughout Europe."
"I believe that 50% recycling of household waste and 70% recycling of building and demolition waste by 2020 are very good targets that pave the way towards a functioning system of environment-friendly and climate-friendly waste management in the whole of Europe."
"Precisely because the Austrians are already exemplary in separating and recycling waste, I am delighted that all the other Member States will now be taking part in these operations, thereby bringing us another step closer to efficient protection of the environment."
"We should not forget that waste products are also raw materials and that more efficient use of these materials can help to combat climate change too."
"It is now a matter of waiting for the Commission to make its specific proposal as to how we can ensure that economic growth does not mean growing volumes of waste."
"Environmental quality standards in the field of water policy (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading by Anne Laperrouze, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on environmental quality standards in the field of water policy and amending Directives 82/176/EEC, 83/513/EEC, 84/156/EEC, 84/491/EEC, 86/280/EEC and 2000/60/EC (11486/3/2007 - C6-0055/2008 -."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are presenting today at second reading is the outcome of teamwork, thanks to which we have reached an agreement with the Slovenian Presidency and the European Commission."
"For me, it was a real pleasure to work on seeking a compromise with my co-rapporteurs from the political groups."
"I was fortunate to have competent and experienced colleagues, who listened carefully and were present at the negotiating meetings."
"I would like to offer them my warm thanks, and I also want to thank the secretariat of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the political group advisers and my assistant, Sylvain Maréchal."
"I am using the phrase teamwork because we did excellent work together with the representatives of the Slovenian Presidency, who took account of Parliament's recommendations, and with the representatives of the European Commission, who gave us answers that made it easier for us to understand this proposal for a directive."
"I think we can all recognise the fruits of our cooperation in the compromise amendments that will be tabled for the vote tomorrow."
"So I thank everybody for having helped me in my job as rapporteur on this technical dossier."
"I come now to the substance."
"The framework directive on water sets out a strategy to combat the chemical pollution of water."
"This proposal for a daughter directive aims, by establishing environmental quality standards, to guarantee a high level of protection against the risks that certain substances pose to the aquatic environment."
"Let me highlight the main advances of this compromise text."
"We have introduced two major principles: the polluter pays principle and the principle of priority correction at source."
"The most significant aspects are practical ones."
"For example, the transitional areas of exceedance - redefined as mixing zones - are no longer simply zones that are established but now serve as a tool for underlining a problem, and it follows that it is up to the Member States to describe the corrective measures."
"The main object of this directive was to harmonise standards at Community level."
"As a matter of course, it would therefore be up to the Commission to define the guidelines for harmonising inventories, emissions, discharges and mixing zones."
"We achieved that."
"We have also managed to ensure that more account will be taken of the situation of transboundary surface water bodies between Member States but also from third countries."
"In regard to additional substances, Parliament had hoped to add a consistent number."
"On the basis of a preliminary filtering, the Commission has selected 13 substances it regards as giving cause for concern."
"The compromise clearly stipulates that on the basis of scientific data the Commission will have 24 months to pronounce on the final classification and to propose the relevant limit values."
"That represents fairly considerable progress, because in the main these substances are PCBs, free cyanide, EDTA, dioxins and bisphenols."
"On the thorny question of sediments and biota, in the absence of scientific consensus, the compromise provides that Member States must monitor them in order to assess the long-term trends of the substances that accumulate there."
"Finally, surprised that the proposal contained no new measures to monitor emissions, MEPs secured the compromise that stipulates, in Article 7, that the Commission shall, on the basis of reports from Member States, evaluate the effectiveness of existing legislation and progress in the reduction of the extent of the mixing zones, and then make amendments or propose the relevant legislation."
"In view of those advances, I would ask Members to support this compromise package."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are a discussing one of the most crucial challenges of environmental policy: the protection of our water resources for our own benefit and that of future generations."
"Let me begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Laperrouze, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the excellent work they have done, and their collaboration on this directive."
"As you will remember, in the Water Framework Directive, the main legislative instrument for EU policy on the protection of water, allowance was made for further legislation being necessary on two issues: EU quality standards for groundwater and EU quality standards for priority substances in surface water."
"The Groundwater Directive was approved at the end of 2006 by means of the conciliation procedure."
"Today the European Parliament is to decide at second reading on the proposed directive on environmental quality standards for priority substances in surface water."
"The directive lays down harmonised quality standards for the 33 listed substances, so that the basic concept of good water quality is expressed in fixed numerical values based on the best available scientific data and knowledge."
"The directive will thus contribute towards achieving a high level of protection of the aquatic environment and human health."
"This is, moreover, the aim of the Water Framework Directive."
"The Commission is determined to keep a close eye on the enforcement of this directive and the Water Framework Directive."
"It also aims to monitor and evaluate the available information on the presence and impact of substances not included in the priority list or the list of priority hazardous substances."
"It intends to submit proposals for the adoption of further necessary measures, as appropriate."
"Throughout the negotiation process, Parliament's interventions on various important issues have contributed towards securing the ambitious level of targets originally proposed by the Commission."
"This applies especially to key points such as: the future revision of the priority substances list, which is now clearly linked to environmental quality standards and will be proposed within two years of the entry into force of this directive; the list of candidate substances to be examined when the existing list is revised; and the criteria for the inventory of emissions, discharges and leaks, and for mixing zones."
"Let me also briefly mention the issue of pollutant emission control."
"As you know, the Water Framework Directive provides for an approach linking emission controls and environmental quality standards."
"Emission controls are to a large extent covered by existing Community legislation."
"In addition to emission controls under the directives on urban waste-water treatment, pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources, and integrated pollution prevention and control (directives that were already in force when the Water Framework Directive was approved in 2000), more than 30 Community legislative instruments have in the meantime been enacted or proposed by the Commission."
"Let me mention some of these by way of example: the REACH Regulation, the Regulation on Persistent Organic Pollutants, the Mining Waste Directive, and the restrictions on use of substances under the Pesticides Directive, and the Directive on Restriction of the Circulation and Use of Certain Hazardous Substances."
"We therefore believe that the Member States have sufficient legislative tools at their disposal to achieve the aims of the Water Framework Directive."
"In addition, the Commission will assess the need for further control measures at Community level and, if necessary, submit proposals when revising the list of priority substances."
"The Commission will also assess the need to class priority substances as priority hazardous substances, taking into account the new information that will be available, and the latest developments within the scope of the REACH Regulation."
"Let me end by once again expressing my satisfaction with the work that has been jointly accomplished, particularly by the rapporteur."
"I reaffirm the Commission's full support for the compromise package of measures that has been agreed on this very important legislative instrument at second reading."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Laperrouze."
"She has been an outstanding rapporteur and I have very much enjoyed working with her."
"I am delighted that the Commission has said that it will endorse this report."
"The proposed directive - and I will not go over all the ground that Mrs Laperrouze has covered, but I have to add some of my own comments - a daughter directive to the Water Framework Directive - ensures the final piece of legislation for good-quality water for different Member States."
"Together with the rapporteur, the Council and Commission, we have had a lot of discussions, and I think we have finally agreed on a compromise package on which we are all in agreement."
"I urge - as did the rapporteur - everyone to vote in favour of it."
"I believe it is a balanced package: the environment will be protected, the water quality of our citizens will be increased, and the burden on the economy will be reasonable - and I think that is also important."
"Through the negotiations we had many discussions with NGOs and industry and came up with a proposal which is excellent."
"The proposal limits the concentration of chemical substances, hazardous groups including heavy metals, some pesticides and other hazardous chemicals in surface water."
"It is based very much on the principle of preventative actions."
"The Member States may designate - as the rapporteur said - mixing zones, where concentrations of chemical substances may exceed the relevant environmental quality standards under certain circumstances, but of course they will have to reach and be monitored with great care."
"We have zones which may be designated as mixing zones in transboundary water bodies - an excellent piece of legislation."
"It says here that Member States shall collect information, including maps."
"I think we might have difficulty in getting the maps, but nevertheless we will sort that out."
"It provides for the establishment of a river basin management plan, dredging and shipping - even this leads to discharges and emissions."
"Losses of priority substances can now take place, providing it reaches the Water Framework Directive."
"Ladies and Gentlemen, I leave you with one last thought."
"Water is the staff of life - this directive is so important."
"Even on Mars, it is the staff of life."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me in my turn thank Mrs Laperrouze and all the shadow rapporteurs, as well as the Slovenian Presidency, for the work they have done."
"This is the last daughter directive under the framework directive on water, and it was very important for us to reach a compromise that represents genuine progress in terms of our ambition to combat pollution, and in particular the chemical pollution of water."
"It is clear from the news every day how much the presence of PCBs damages our Community's water resources."
"Mme Laperrouze has listed all the points on which we have made progress."
"Of course, as ever with compromises, we would have preferred to achieve more, but I believe we have secured a good basis."
"Quite simply, we will remain vigilant because much will now depend on the Commission, and we hope that when it takes measures to support the findings of scientific experts, it will prove to be very ambitious in classifying future priority substances and priority hazardous substances, the famous 13 substances that are to be classified in the very near future."
"We will also take care to ensure that the current scientific uncertainty as regards sediments and biota will not create a kind of soft focus that will in the long term exempt the European Union from endeavouring to understand and improve the quality of those biota and sediments."
"Lastly, there is a need to improve the mixing zones and the knowledge of pollutants and sources of pollution, together with the monitoring of emissions."
"We will ensure that Parliament remains vigilant, and I thank the Commissioner for pointing out that alongside the provisions in the compromise on which we will be voting, the Commission wanted to provide information on the implementation of the framework directive on water and, if necessary and if any delays build up in the Member States or any doubts need to be raised, to present complementary measures to ensure that we do indeed achieve environmentally acceptable water in 2015, in line with our vote in 2000."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, as the rapporteur is a member of my group and a close colleague, the House will understand if I defend her agreement."
"Perhaps we could have done more, perhaps another chemical here or there could have been included in the package, but scientific opinion is divided; political will is not always strong."
"In the words of the previous rapporteur, this can reasonably be described as 'as good as it gets'."
"I think water policy is one of the successes of European environment policy."
"I think that we should pay tribute to the work of the Commission over the years and indeed to Mrs Lienemann for her work on the Water Framework Directive some seven years ago."
"Even when no transboundary issues are involved, the collective determination to address the pollution of both past and present years has brought about levels of investment to secure improvement in water quality that have far exceeded what would have been achieved if Member States had been left to act in isolation."
"The laws we have put in place are clear in this instance."
"Pollution is identifiable and measurable."
"The requirements to prevent it are enforceable and this legislation takes us a step forward by introducing further prohibitions on a range of chemicals, pesticides, pollutants that present a risk to aquatic and indeed human life."
"But we also see reports from the European Environment Agency that there are many instances of Member States still failing to enforce the legislation as effectively and as adequately as should be the case."
"So on this note of agreement across the House about the nature of this legislation and the positive direction in which Europe is going when it comes to water quality, let us also look to the Commission to say, 'You have the powers to investigate, to act and to enforce - please use them'."
"Mr President, I should also like to thank Mrs Laperrouze for her friendly, obliging cooperation."
"It did prove possible to retain a vestige of the positive outcome of first reading in spite of everything but, all the same, what we have here today is a poor show."
"Most of what had been achieved has been lost following lobbying by the agrochemical industry and the less efficient among the public regulatory authorities."
"What we are discussing today are the sad remains."
"Our overarching aim is to progressively improve water quality in European rivers and lakes."
"Copious pesticide use in agriculture and toxic industrial discharges must be curbed, and tough requirements must be enforced regarding the quantity of the priority substances or priority hazardous substances permitted in water."
"The weakness of the present report is that there is no real political will to scrutinise any more substances."
"It has already become clear that the present system, under which substances on the list are to be examined and new ones added, at best works too slowly."
"If the precautionary principle were to hold force, a number of other substances would have to be examined, but we are letting that possibility slip through our fingers."
"In addition, it is not clear what it takes for a substance to be declared so hazardous that it has to be banned completely."
"We have ended up with a number of substances that are in all likelihood extremely hazardous, yet the Commission balks at finally banning them."
"This is unacceptable: if a substance is hazardous, it is hazardous."
"We must monitor whether the Commission gets going with the examination of these substances or whether it just continues to put off taking a position on the grounds that it does not have enough data."
"If that is the case, it should go and get the data."
"There are some improvements."
"For example, countries must now chart sources of pollution and also include concentrations in sediment and biota."
"In addition, the Commission is not permitted to wait until as late as 2025, as it had wished, to review the situation."
"It must produce such a review in 2018."
"Yes, we shall be voting in favour of this report."
"We are thankful for small mercies following a downturn of the kind seen after first reading."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, there are thousands of sources of contamination of surface and ground water, not just agriculture and the agrifood industry, mines and chemical factories, but also residential homes."
"Wherever there is no water treatment plant, we are putting ever-increasing amounts of poison into our scarce water resources."
"Landfill sites are a source of many poisonous substances, and biological wastewater treatment plants cannot purify the waste coming from them, as the bacteria themselves get poisoned."
"Deposits on the bottoms of lakes and artificial reservoirs also store poisonous substances."
"How to clean them - this is the problem."
"If they flow into the seas or the oceans, they will poison the whole globe; and this is what is happening over time."
"Cleaning reservoirs of these deposits will be very costly and there are no technologies to do this."
"I would also like to speak once again of the thousands of tonnes of outdated pesticides that are systematically poisoning our water and have already reached depths of 1 000 metres."
"For this reason our group believes that despite the cost, the Directive should pay more attention to protecting water."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (SV) The intention of this directive was to lay down environmental quality standards for a number of hazardous chemicals and thereby protect watercourses from chemicals and other harmful substances."
"Unfortunately the lobbyists have been adept at influencing both the European Commission and the Council of Ministers."
"Now that this matter has come up for second reading, regrettably the good intentions have been thoroughly watered down."
"One example of this is that only 11 of the 29 chemicals over which we wanted Parliament to have monitoring powers are now classified as hazardous substances."
"There will be no concrete requirement for Member States to meet reduction targets."
"Nevertheless this compromise is better than what the Commission had originally proposed."
"Hence we in the GUE/NGL Group support it, but you may be sure that we shall be following the matter closely and seeking to ensure that watercourses do get better protection in future."
"When the time for a review comes, we hope that there will be some further tightening up."
"I have a question for Commissioner Dimas, who is here this evening: how would you feel if individual Member States wanted to go further and adopt more extensive measures than are stipulated in this Directive?"
"If individual Member States wanted to classify more substances than those listed under this compromise, would you let them go ahead and thus adopt more stringent legislation?"
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Laperrouze, for all her work in the negotiations with the Council."
"I think what we have is a very good compromise package for water quality standards."
"I am particularly pleased that the concept of mixed zones is retained."
"On that subject, I have a question for Commissioner Dimas."
"From the point of view of feasibility it is an important concept, provided, of course, that it does not significantly damage the environment."
"The framework water directive calls for the drinking water purification effort to be reduced."
"Drinking water standards are strictly than water quality standards."
"There are various collection points for drinking water in surface water, and it can happen in practice that the collection points are fairly close to a source of pollution, so that a collection point might be in a mixed zone and the purification effort for water purification companies is increased."
"Can Commissioner Dimas assure me that he will do everything possible to prevent mixed zones creating problems for drinking water collection points?"
"(DE) Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur and the Commission for the very constructive work that has been done on this proposal."
"I wish to remind the House that this is a compromise package."
"It is a very sound compromise that has been negotiated here, and it is certainly another piece in the jigsaw of excellent water quality in Europe."
"I do wish to stress that Europe is the continent, or the political entity, that sets great store by its environment and imposes very high standards."
"It may be that our goal could be achieved more quickly but, if we compare Europe with other parts of the world, we can claim to have attained a very high standard, and that standard must be maintained and further improved."
"In this context, I would also like to remind the Commission that we need to be effective in selling these successes that we have incontestably achieved in the field of European environmental policy, and especially water policy."
"The Irish referendum in particular, however, shows that we have not managed to convey this success story."
"Europe is highly successful in the environmental field, but very few of its population are aware of its leading role."
"It may well be that lobbyists have watered down the compromise to some extent, but there are also other lobbies which have helped to ensure that the compromise does indeed impose the need for strenuous efforts on the part of industrial firms, farmers and other polluters."
"In this context, let me remind you that water is certainly one of the elements on which we shall have to focus more political attention in future."
"I must ask the Commissioner to keep his eye on the future development of water policy, because climate change in particular is set to confront us with new problems, and the importance of water to the economy and to human life is set to increase sharply."
"On the whole, it is a balanced compromise, and I ask all my fellow Members to endorse it."
"It was not possible to achieve any more."
"(NL) Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Laperrouze, for her work, which has led to a satisfactory agreement at second reading."
"Clean surface water is, of course, very important."
"There are regular reports of excessive mercury and other harmful substances in fish."
"That is unhealthy for people and the environment and we definitely have to do something about it."
"The result we have here is a good balance between protection of the environment on the one hand and, on the other hand, cost effectiveness for businesses, water companies and governments."
"The European Parliament has successfully pressed for a number of improvements."
"Thus mixed zones close to discharge points where a higher level of pollution is allowed have to be clearly demarcated and Member States have to indicate how mixed zones can be reduced in the future."
"Parliament also has a policy for the future: substances that might be harmful have to be put on a separate list for further investigation."
"I am strongly in favour of that."
"I also support the question that Mr Blokland put to Commissioner Dimas on discharge points and drinking water collection points in mixed zones."
"I should also like to draw attention to a number of source measures, particularly near hospitals, and to leftover medicines."
"That is another important point to look at in the future."
"(DE) Mr President, as we know, water is the most precious of all resources, and we must not let our water drain away by choosing not to adopt an ambitious water policy."
"It is very regrettable that the momentum imparted by the European Parliament at first reading to the protection of our water resources has been dissipated by the doubling of the list of hazardous substances subject to control and the obligation imposed on EU Member States to reduce their pollutant emissions."
"The result is therefore a missed opportunity to do more to protect our water."
"In the context of water protection, it is important to ensure consistency across the various fields of legislation."
"We need a ban on carcinogenic, mutagenic and reproductively toxic (CMR) pesticides and endocrine disrupters."
"That is why I find it regrettable that the Commission constantly plays the role of a shunting yard at the expense of the environment and public health."
"In 2006, the Commission said that, in its draft instrument on environmental quality, it did not intend to make any proposals on the reduction of the volume and toxicity of priority hazardous substances."
"They should be made in REACH and in the framework of pesticides legislation."
"But what actually happened?"
"It was a parliamentary report, our proposal from this House, that established consistency with the Water Framework Directive and with pollutants legislation."
"Parliament did that, not the Commission, which had promised to do it."
"Our demand, then, is that no pesticides that feature on the list of priority hazardous substances should be authorised."
"The simplest solution is to ensure that these hazardous substances cannot get into our water in the first place."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Laperrouze, who has worked extraordinarily hard with other colleagues in my Group, and with Parliament as a whole, to reach agreement and form a consensus."
"I am very pleased with this Directive, which deals with several important issues."
"First, as Mrs Lienemann said, sustainability is a process, and water treatment, improvements in the quality of water and water policy form part of a process that we began many years ago."
"Above all, it is a process that has to be realistic, because it has to be put into practice."
"It is much easier to legislate than implement. It is much cheaper to legislate than implement."
"It does not cost anything to ban something. However, implementation means that companies, farmers and local councils have to put policies into practice, which is not always easy."
"I think that this is an important step forward, but we have to be realistic, because, as we saw yesterday, for example, in the referendum, it is sometimes not easy to be European. It costs money and effort and that is something we are doing right now, especially considering that this is a policy that applies Europe-wide."
"The entire water policy has to be implemented throughout Europe, and we therefore have to deal with enormously complex situations, with many factors, including extremely important geophysical factors."
"I would like to mention two other aspects of this directive that I think represent progress."
"First, it requires much more transparency from governments."
"Water has always been rather opaque."
"In the European Water Forum, one of our objectives is transparency in providing information to the public, and we are now seriously addressing our commitment to transparency of information to the public."
"The same is true of the indicators, including molluscs, and I want to emphasise the importance of water analysis for health."
"(LT) I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and express my full support for the idea that we need more stringent regulations on the quality of surface water and the effectiveness of the assessment of Community legislation."
"The small EU countries situated at the outer borders are facing a very sensitive issue - water contamination from neighbouring EU countries."
"It is neither the wish nor the intention of the EU to fence itself off with an 'iron curtain' as far as ecology and other issues are concerned."
"Therefore, it is equally important to reduce contamination both within the EU countries and in the neighbourhood."
"Amendment 26 points out the Commission's obligation to present a detailed report on the situation regarding pollution originating from third countries, one year after the date of entry into force of the Directive."
"The Commission should do more to encourage further implementation of environmental obligations during the course of negotiations with neighbouring countries."
"This issue is of the greatest importance to the countries that share river basins with neighbouring EU countries."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 'Water is life' or 'Water - valuable as diamonds': those were the headlines and the motivation when we launched the Water Framework Directive in the year 2000."
"The directive on environmental quality standards in the field of water policy is now the last major daughter instrument to the Water Framework Directive."
"Its purpose is to set environmental quality standards for priority substances and priority hazardous substances so as to ensure that our water, the source of life, receives a high level of protection from risks, by which I mean the highest possible level of protection - the protection that is necessary and possible on the basis of the latest scientific knowledge."
"In my view, however, this also means that the protection of water is a permanent task."
"We shall have to keep a constant political eye on scientific studies and findings with a view to assimilating new discoveries and guaranteeing the protection of water at all times and in all circumstances in accordance with the latest science and technology."
"It must never happen again that - as in the present case - the Commission does not fulfil its mandate and allows time to elapse without acting."
"The list of priority hazardous substances must be constantly reviewed and checked without delay."
"The Commission's failure to act prompted us in Parliament to take action and propose a second list - a list containing substances that require checking on the basis of the latest findings."
"This list must not pre-classify or prejudge substances."
"It should also provide an opportunity to clear substances of suspicion."
"Substances must not, of course, be included in such a list on a mere whim."
"The PPE-DE Group has called for a faster and more prioritised treatment of the substances on which data are already available that indicate high risk levels."
"Six months will suffice, in our view."
"I do very much hope, Commissioner, that full use will not be made of the 24-month period which is currently prescribed, for it must always be possible to act on safety findings without delay."
"We shall support en bloc the compromise worked out by Mrs Laperrouze."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"Most of Europe's rivers are shared by several countries, which benefit from the river's resources and share in the responsibility this entails."
"The water quality each Member State receives depends on the country upstream."
"The Danube, for example, flows through seven countries, the Drava six, and the Rhine and the Tisza five."
"This poses a major challenge and calls for cooperation on a large scale."
"Hopefully the adoption of this legislation will help to bring an end to the foam that has been present on the River Raba for the past seven years."
"At the moment, bathing in Hungary's only genuine river wetland is only to be recommended if you are wearing one of the swimsuits shown in the pictures distributed to Members of this House, and which are also to be seen on flyers and posters."
"The River Raba of course merely act as a kind of litmus paper, showing that something is amiss with the current legislation, because if everyone is adhering to all the legal limits and there is still thick foam on the river, then something must be wrong with the legislation in this regard."
"This is why we must change it, and I therefore ask you all to cast your vote tomorrow in support of the compromise package."
"(HU) My fellow Members have already stated that fresh water is perhaps the most valuable resource of the 21st century, and one cannot disagree with this."
"It is also true that in Europe the situation is basically good, in terms of both fresh water quantity and quality."
"I would like to draw your attention to an issue that has not been raised so far, namely the fact that as a result of climate change the precipitation curve, and with it the distribution curve of fresh water recoverable from it, is becoming increasingly extreme."
"This means that we are having long, hot summers and torrential rainfall events throughout Europe."
"Over and above all the environmental considerations we have discussed, therefore, we also need a system for managing water resources that, unlike the present system, basically captures this water and enables it to be stored for use in dry years."
"It is also vitally important that this should be made European Union policy, because this would enable us to maintain the quantity of fresh water in Europe; its quality, meanwhile, will be assured by the legislation."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, water pollution takes place in rivers, in lakes and in the ground, but it can also take place during transportation."
"This risk has been aggravated recently with the drought we are having in southern Europe, where a large number of oil tankers are now being converted for the transportation of drinking water."
"This is an area where, perhaps, expertise is lacking."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner to make sure that such transportation will be totally safe and devoid of any pollution by aromatic hydrocarbons, which, as we all know, can cause serious damage to both humans and animals."
"Mr President, in addition to the points I mentioned in my introductory statement, the proposed directive also contributes to the process of simplifying EU legislation on water."
"You will remember that the Water Framework Directive already includes provisions on the repeal of seven previous legislative acts dating from the 1970s and 1980s."
"The present directive will repeal five more directives and will at the same time simplify the submission of water reports under the WISE framework, the newly established Water Information System for Europe."
"In this way, we shall gain a better knowledge base for decision-making at political and technical level."
"You will also remember that Parliament attached particular importance to the target of eliminating or phasing out certain substances included in the Water Framework Directive."
"The planned inventory, which will include maps, will be a necessary source of information for everyone."
"It will serve as an assessment tool for investigations by the Commission into whether the environmental target of progressive reduction or gradual elimination is being met."
"The Water Framework Directive and its 'daughter directive' will provide a firm, predictable and long-term basis for decision-making at every level, from river basin and local level to European level."
"This is particularly important for drafting the river basin management plans and the programmes of measures to be submitted by December 2009."
"Last year the Commission submitted its first report on the implementation of the Water Framework Directive."
"The report included an assessment of achievements and shortcomings."
"Now it is up to the Member States to meet their obligations in time."
"I should like to take this opportunity to remind you that EU financial aid is available under the regional development and cohesion policy and the rural development policy."
"It is the Member States' right and also their responsibility to choose their priorities and projects."
"Article 7 of the Water Framework Directive has already laid down the obligations for drinking water, and this compromise does not alter the relevant procedures and provisions."
"I should like to point out that Member States must report their compliance with Article 15 of the Water Framework Directive and the measures they are taking to reduce the spread of mixing zones, as well as the international coordination on defining mixing zones."
"In addition, if a Member State wishes to impose stricter environmental standards, the Commission will have no objection."
"To conclude, the Commission is in the happy position of expressing full support for the compromise package in order to achieve an agreement on this directive at second reading."
"At this point I should like once again to thank the rapporteur for the excellent work she has done."
"On the problem raised by Mr Matsakis about transporting water to Cyprus, I know the problem exists and I shall answer this question later."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your contribution to this debate."
"You may ask what our final objectives are with this directive."
"They are, of course, to improve the quality of bodies of surface water."
"We do not want to find any more lead, cadmium, nickel, mercury, solvents or other highly toxic and carcinogenic substances such as PCBs in our waters."
"Mrs Lienemann referred to a news report a fortnight ago that showed that PCBs were bio-accumulated in fish and that man then ate those fish."
"We can no longer accept such a situation, and I believe that the citizens of Europe may also expect Europe to send out a strong signal that it is protecting our environment, protecting our health."
"I believe that we will be able to get that European message across if we respect this framework directive on water, together with its daughter directives."
"Some Members have said that not enough substances were listed, that Parliament had backtracked in relation to the first reading."
"At first reading we had proposed 33 + 28 substances in total, i.e. 61 analysed substances."
"At second reading, we have a total of 33 + 13, i.e. 46, but we must point out that these are hazardous substances of particular concern that should no longer occur in river waters today."
"The other point of interest in this directive is that it allows us to check compliance with European legislation - I am thinking here of the implementation of the REACH regulation and of the IPPC."
"We now have an instrument to verify that."
"The Commissioner has heard my colleagues say that if the Council and Parliament approve this text, the ball is in its court."
"It has an enormous amount of work to do, it has a great many analyses to conduct and inventories to draw up."
"I wish it all the best."
"In any case, we will continue to monitor this legislation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 17 June 2008."
"Reinforcing the Union's disaster response capacity (debate)"
"The next item is a statement from the Commission on reinforcing the Union's disaster response capacity."
"Mr President, last year, thanks to the Community Civil Protection Mechanism, the EU mobilised en masse to help the Member States stricken by the catastrophic forest fires."
"We have identified certain points that require immediate attention in a bid to avoid similar disasters in future."
"Firstly, we need to overcome the lack of available technical resources for disaster relief."
"This was noted during the operations in 2007."
"Secondly, there must be an integrated approach to dealing with forest fires, and prevention, readiness and response."
"Thirdly, the operational capability of the Commission's Monitoring and Information Centre should be strengthened."
"The Commission has already adopted some practical operational measures, the main ones being:"
"the establishment and training of a network of forest-fire experts;"
"interoperability training for national firefighting teams;"
"a large-scale exercise organised in Sardinia in April, with the participation of forces from five Member States;"
"the formation of three civil protection units for aerial forest firefighting."
"Funds have already been secured for the transport of aid equipment."
"In addition, under the 2008 pilot programme for forest fires, we are cooperating with Member States to create tactical reserves that will be on standby for emergencies in Europe."
"In addition, between 2007 and 2013, approximately EUR 5.8 billion will be available under the cohesion policy programmes, for risk prevention and response to various types of disaster, including forest fires."
"A further EUR 1.6 billion will be available from the rural development funds to restore forest resources and initiate preventive actions."
"Lastly, for the most devastating natural disasters, the option of support from the European Solidarity Fund is retained."
"In the Communication it presented in March, the Commission underlined the need for an integrated approach to disaster management, which must include prevention, readiness, response and restoration."
"It examined all types of natural and man-made disasters, within and outside the EU, and also all the Community resources available for disaster response."
"In addition to civil protection, the Communication examined three other areas of Community action:"
"strengthening European humanitarian aid;"
"improving the coordination of intervention capability for disaster response;"
"upgrading interinstitutional cooperation, i.e. cooperation between European agencies or institutions."
"We are also developing an action plan."
"This will be ready in the summer and will map out a range of specific initiatives over and above those mentioned in the Communication, such as:"
"analysis of the shortcomings in material and technical support capability, for both humanitarian and civil protection actions."
"This will enable us to determine which particular tools are available, which are the most necessary, and which are most cost-effective;"
"support for initiatives to limit disaster risks in third countries;"
"closer cooperation with the UN, the International Bank and various NGOs, with a view to strengthening disaster response capability at global level;"
"better use of science, technology and innovation;"
"an upgrade in the role of our agencies in disaster response throughout the world;"
"a more effective evaluation of disaster damage."
"As regards disaster prevention, there is at present no integrated European approach."
"To address this issue, the Commission is preparing a communication to assess the added value of instituting a Community disaster prevention mechanism."
"The Commission will present possible options aiming at:"
"improving our knowledge of disasters and their impact;"
"improving the interconnection of related policies, e.g. the interconnection between land-use planning and disaster prevention;"
"improving the use of Community resources."
"In addition to this initiative, which will focus on the EU, the Commission is drawing up a strategy for disaster risk reduction in developing countries."
"Lastly, the Commission has taken a series of measures to strengthen the EU's intervention capability to respond to disasters that might occur in Europe."
"In particular, the Commission's Monitoring and Information Centre is being strengthened."
"Since we do not currently have detailed analyses of the gaps and shortcomings in response capability in the event of major disasters, we are in the process of analysing disaster scenarios and testing innovative arrangements."
"This will release civil protection resources and capabilities for operations on a European scale."
"By mid-2009, the Commission also intends to submit proposals for a European disaster response training network."
"To conclude, I would like to thank Parliament for the constant, steady support it is giving in strengthening the Community's disaster response capability."
"This support is reaffirmed in the draft resolution that is to be put to the vote in plenary."
"Mr President, in recent years many EU Member States have been stricken by natural disasters such as fires, floods and earthquakes."
"Human lives have been lost, properties, farms and houses have been destroyed, and the environment has suffered devastating damage that will take many years to repair."
"One of the key principles on which the EU was founded is that of solidarity."
"This means that in the event of a natural disaster, it is extremely important that the EU should be able to provide not only coordinated technical assistance, but also, through the European Solidarity Fund, financial resources to stricken areas."
"I have listened with interest to the Commissioner's analysis of all the elements of prevention and coordinated intervention, and we expect to see corresponding action on the part of the European Commission."
"Allow me to focus attention on an issue concerning the European Solidarity Fund."
"I consider it unjustifiable for the Council decision not to adopt the regulation on the European Solidarity Fund, and this decision should therefore be revised."
