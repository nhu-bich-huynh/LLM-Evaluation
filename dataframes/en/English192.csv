"We can now sketch the outlines within which a compromise will have to be reached."
"Personally, I do not rule out a phased solution."
"In fact, some of our financing mechanisms were devised at a time when enlargement to include Central and Eastern Europe was no more than a distant prospect."
"We therefore have a very difficult task on our hands."
"In recent times, and in particular in connection with the launch of the single currency, the Union has shown that when faced with important occasions, it is able to overcome national differences."
"Each time, the political will of the College has been there to see us through."
"The Berlin summit is another such important occasion."
"Agenda 2000 is essential for the future of the Union and for the future of the European continent."
"Day after day, the conflicts around us show just how important it is to make progress on the path towards the peaceful reconciliation of our continent."
"It is something I have said frequently but I will say it again to you here today: for the first time in 500 years, we have the unique opportunity to achieve this objective while our people live in peace and freedom."
"I am confident that this process, guided by the Community method, will be crowned with success."
"Applause"
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to thank the President-in-Office and the President of the Commission for the detailed accounts they have given us of the current situation."
"However, I do not believe that they have told us anything new."
"All three institutions are concerned about the need to reach a political agreement this month if we want to fulfill the objective of approving all of Agenda 2000 during the German Presidency."
"The Socialist Group naturally shares the concern of the President-in-Office and the President of the Commission that we have not as yet reached a definitive agreement. Nevertheless, we hope that we might be able to lay the foundations of such an agreement, particularly after Chancellor Schroeder's tour of the capitals which begins on 15 March."
"Our main concern in the Socialist Group is to ensure that we do not destroy what we have already achieved, namely Agenda 2000 itself."
"The Commission's document was supported by a broad majority in this House and we still believe that it is the key element for the future funding and the future financial perspectives of the European Union."
"Within the Agenda 2000 package, the financial discussions should not allow us to forget that there are certain basic aims forming part of the European Union's policy which we must not renege on."
"The first is the principle that there must be sufficient funding to develop Community policies."
"I do not know of any type of policy that can be implemented without funding."
"It may be that in recent years we have devoted too much time to discussing exclusively financial issues and that this has tarnished the Community's image in the eyes of the public. There is the risk that all we appear to do is haggle between governments over what each must pay, despite the fact that this clearly forms part of politics too."
"However, it is absolutely clear that no policy - be it national, regional or local - can be implemented without sufficient funds."
"I therefore believe that the principle of having sufficient resources for Community policies is a key element."
"Parliament has set out a series of priorities that, in my view, are similar to those of the Member States and the Commission. For example, we all believe that employment is a priority and it is a major concern of our citizens."
"In a Europe where 18 million people are unemployed, the issue of employment is extremely important. In fact, this priority was marked by an extraordinary European Council, the Luxembourg European Council, and I imagine that it has not been forgotten in the Council's deliberations."
"My second point - and this is no less important - concerns the question of cohesion."
"A community cannot be built at two different speeds where some countries or regions are more developed and others are less so."
"The last report by the Commission on cohesion policy highlighted the fact that the Community policies have been effective in reducing the differences between various regions in terms of the level of development."
"The creation of a community where there are different levels of development would harm not only the less developed regions but also the more developed regions and sectors, as they would find that the levels of consumption would be too low in the regions with a lower purchasing power."
"Finally, one very important issue for the European Parliament's Socialist Group is the environment."
"It is clear that we need sustained and sustainable economic development."
"There is no point in pursuing economic development that cannot be maintained in the long run, and one of the elements or pillars of that economic development is, in fact, the preservation of the ecological balance."
"This is something that all our people are calling for at the moment."
"There was a time when ecological issues were perhaps only raised in the more developed countries. However, today we can say that all Europeans are 'green' and that the 'green' label can no longer belong to a single political group because, at least within the Socialist Group, we are naturally very concerned about environmental issues."
"Therefore, I believe that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is aware of the same contradictions as the Council."
"We have exactly the same ideas as those you have to discuss within the Council."
"Moreover, we fully understand the difficulties the Council faces and our concern is to ensure that the timetable is met."
"The Socialist Group believes - and the President of the Commission also highlighted this - that it is extremely important to meet the timetable set for 1999."
"Our group is doing all in its power to adjust to that timetable and if the Council fulfills its duties, the European Socialists will make every effort to ensure that the European Parliament can do the same."
"In short, we are now at a stage where we are doing the hard work in the engine room to further the construction of Europe."
"The German Presidency has had some thankless work to do, but without it the European Union would not move forward."
"The Socialist Group hopes that once this hard slog is over, once this work has been done properly - which is what we expect of the German Presidency, and this German Government in particular - we might be able to strike off on a new path."
"The end of the German Presidency should mark the end of these lesser discussions on strictly budgetary issues and a new beginning along a path set out by the Presidency of the Council and by the Presidency of the Commission in Agenda 2000."
"This path should lead us to a wider Europe into which we can welcome the millions of Europeans who are currently facing enormous difficulties and whose problems are much greater than our own."
"Indeed, our reach should also extend even further, as it is not only the countries of Central and Eastern Europe that have expectations of us, but also the Mediterranean countries, Latin America, Africa and the third world in general."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, I hope that the President-in-Office was right when he said that he had a feeling that the German Presidency was close to the mark."
"I hope that he is not mistaken, because of course the German Presidency did not make life very easy for itself from the very start."
"It made grand speeches at the end of last year setting itself high standards."
"It also said what Germany ought to gain from all this, and we will see how this measures up."
"In any case, there has been no improvement on the initial position of finding a compromise solution for the negotiations."
"We in the European People's Party will be prepared to play a constructive role in this process - despite all that has been said - and to help to find a solution which will allow us to steer the European Union forward."
"If you are to bring about an agreement which will benefit the European Union, you will of course also need the support of our group."
"But this has to be a good agreement, not an agreement for its own sake, not an agreement at any price, but an agreement which makes sense, which respects budgetary discipline and which contains the necessary reforms, if we are to be able to support it, and if at the same time we are to retain scope for enlargement within the 1.27 % which you mentioned."
"I believe that this is of crucial importance."
"In addition, we must of course also say that the debate on rural areas and agriculture is a very important one for our group."
"If degressive models are agreed which mean that farmers' income is reduced and if appropriations can only be spent in certain areas without being of benefit to agriculture itself, then this is a point which we will have to consider very carefully in terms of the overall balance."
"This is certainly not something you did not already know."
"Furthermore, it should also be said - and this is in the joint motion - that we are not prepared to put at stake the principles underlying the internal market in the negotiations on structural policy, and that controls on subsidies must continue to be recognised as one of the basic preconditions for the proper functioning of a common market and should not be abolished as part of the structural policy."
"Of course, nor must we allow discussions held in connection with the employment pact to jeopardise the largest project which we have tackled for years, namely the introduction of the euro."
"At this stage, we should stop reducing interest rates - this is also a request to the President-in-Office of the ECOFIN Council - as this will cause the value of the euro to fall still further."
"We must make our contribution to stabilising the euro, and the German Presidency has a particular responsibility here."
"I believe that this responsibility can be assumed in an appropriate manner in the latter part of the presidency."
"With your permission, I will briefly address one final point."
"The Cologne summit will establish a mandate for the next intergovernmental conference, and we should like to know from the German Presidency whether, when it is preparing this mandate, it will engage in a dialogue with the European Parliament about the issues which should take priority and be dealt with at an intergovernmental conference of this kind, and whether it is also prepared to involve the European Parliament in the negotiations on amendments to the Treaty, changes to the decision-making structures and so on."
"Let me draw your attention one last time to one of Parliament's resolutions."
"You will respect democracy in the European Union if you nominate the President of the Commission after the European Parliament elections, because if you make a nomination beforehand, which does not take account of the outcome of the Parliament elections, then you run the risk of the Council proposal being rejected by this House, and that is why we should rethink this timetable."
"Mr President, in a sense of course it is true that the Community is approaching the moment of truth."
"As both President Santer and President Verheugen were saying, if there is to be no agreement by the end of this month then there will be difficulties."
"Indeed it is very useful that there is no speculation about delay."
"In this time of difficulties in the Commission, I would like to say that Agenda 2000, which was put forward two years ago by the Commission should still be the basis of the overall approach."
"It is only on that basis that a balanced approach can be found."
"It is necessary that, irrespective of the haggling about individual finance, that approach should be kept."
"The Liberal Group, especially, will judge the overall outcome on whether or not it deviates from the future development for a viable European Union."
"Against that background we welcome the fact that the President-in-Office of the Council has indicated that already, at this stage, there is an agreement that money available for enlargement will be set aside."
"It is essential that our internal haggling is not at the expenses of the new candidate countries."
"Only in that way can we identify the real political will which was our starting-point."
"We really want to move forward."
"On the CAP, President Santer indicated that there is a basic conflict, on the one hand between stabilisation, and on the other hand a real reform."
"We, in the Liberal Group, accept real stabilisation."
"It has perhaps taken too long for us to become aware that there is a limit to financial growth."
"At the same time, real reform is necessary."
"It is essential that we do not have a make-believe reform."
"The Liberal Group believes that within the overall envelope it is possible to carry out reforms but rural development should be part of a structural policy, which takes a broader view than the purely agricultural."
"That is an essential point."
"Finally, on the question of own resources."
"We still believe that the approach in the Haug report - namely that the corrections should primarily be made in terms of expenditure rather than in the area of revenue - is important."
"Why?"
"Because a special rebate which has now been there for a very long time should not be the model for future financing."
"If I understand the President-in-Office of the Council correctly, the phased approach also means that individual adjustments will finally be phased out and we will arrive at an equitable and balanced approach where all countries can really feel that they are participating."
"That would be the right approach for the future."
"I wish the presidency and the President of the Commission every success for a positive result in Berlin."
"Mr President, the Agenda 2000 negotiations now under way are among the most difficult which the European Union has faced as an institution and political entity since the foundation of the European Economic Community."
"The Union can take credit for the bold and innovative initiatives which it has taken over the last 10 years in order to improve the competitive performance of European economies."
"European leaders and European Union institutions can equally point to the fact that an internal market has been put in place, allowing free movement of goods, persons, services and capital, as well as the creation of a new single currency regime which commands so much influence within the European Union itself."
"The negotiations which brought about the internal market and the single European currency were difficult but were always based on the premise that stability of the European Union is paramount at all times."
"This must be the overriding consideration of European Union leaders as they search for agreement on the key aspects of future EU policies under the Agenda 2000 programme."
"The EU governments must look to the issue of reforming the EU budget, the common agricultural policy and the EU structural funds in a balanced, even-handed manner."
"The partnership approach involving all European governments and all the institutions in order to develop and formulate key EU policies must always be preserved."
"We should remember at this time that the European Union budget only amounts to a little more than 2 % of the overall spending undertaken by the 15 Member States of the Union in any given year."
"One option to reform the European Union budget which is not acceptable is the renationalising of the common agricultural policy back into the remit of the individual Member States."
"The common agricultural policy is a uniform European-wide programme."
"Its operation will clearly be fragmented and distorted if national governments within the EU have to contribute 25 % of all CAP payments to their respective farmers."
"From an Irish perspective, I welcome the recent support given by the Commission for Ireland to continue to receive cohesion funds until the year 2003."
"17 % of all expenditure carried out on improving our roads, water treatment and transport networks under our capital programme originates from the European regional cohesion funds."
"Mr President, the decision on the Union's financial perspectives is becoming extremely difficult politically, giving the impression of a confrontation of national interests without a common vision of European integration."
"Moreover, the economic outlook is not positive. Economic growth is lower than expected, exports and investment have fallen, and inflation has reached an all-time low, forcing us to consider the problems that affect a deflationary economy."
"I might add that we share some of the concerns expressed by Mr Lafontaine."
"The previous enlargements of the European Union were always preceded by a considerable increase in the budget, but the Agenda 2000 budget is so inadequate that it does not allow us to guarantee internal solidarity and cope with the new members."
"When we talk about enlargement, what we are really doing is endangering the economic and social cohesion of the Europe of Fifteen, without any thought to the future, with less solidarity, without a social dimension and without a genuine employment policy."
"Regardless of how much rhetoric we use, it is not possible to enlarge Europe with this budget."
"The Commission's initial proposal was better in that it reflected a possible and reasonable balance, with the contributions from the Member States more in proportion in terms of the Community's gross domestic product. However, the Council disregarded this proposal and focused the debate on reducing expenditure."
"As a result, the approach adopted by certain governments, who are calling for a reduction in their net contribution to the Community budget without taking account of the commercial advantages of the internal market, is making the negotiations very difficult."
"The German Presidency is at fault in that it has not helped to solve the problems in a situation where the Commission no longer has the ability to mediate."
"In that respect, we must point out that we cannot accept the philosophy of net balances. We should instead move towards reaching a solution that we can all support."
"In our view, it would not be acceptable to make drastic cuts in the Structural Funds and agricultural spending, thereby unfairly penalising certain countries and certain production sectors."
"As far as the agricultural policy is concerned, we have already rejected the negative proposal to cofinance expenditure. The best economic and social solution would be to introduce a fairer differentiation of aid: the current system is unfair as 20 % of farmers receive 80 % of the aid distributed."
"With correct differentiation, we could ensure that aid was distributed more fairly and we could provide specific solutions for producers of milk, beef and veal, and cereals. We could also reduce budgetary expenditure."
"The financial perspectives must be approved unanimously in the Council and by a sufficient majority in Parliament."
"It would therefore be better to reach a balanced solution."
"The agreement must be acceptable to all, not only a majority."
"Moreover - and I would like to address this specifically to the Council - we want to see very practical political deliberations."
"We are convinced of the importance of a strong and legitimate Commission for the future of the Union."
"We would therefore call on the European Council to postpone the nomination of its candidate for the Presidency of the Commission until after the European elections, and we would like a response on this matter."
"In conclusion, I would point out that the extraordinary European Council on 25 March in Berlin will coincide with the anniversary of the Treaty of Rome."
"Given the uncertainty that exists, we call on the German Presidency and on all the Heads of State and Government to unite once again and commit to a common political project."
"We urge them to fulfill their responsibilities."
"And an essential condition is to reach a fair agreement on Agenda 2000 so that no government or country is the winner."
"The only winners should be the European Union and all its people."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Berlin summit must succeed in tying up the Agenda 2000 package."
"A delay would send out a fateful signal to the EU and the outside world and would only encourage nationalist forces."
"We must not allow this to happen."
"If next year we are to continue to provide structural support - the internal bridge between poor and rich regions - then we need an agreement on Agenda 2000 which, in small matters and in large, is characterised by solidarity, will be workable in the future and leaves no room for national egoism."
"Outwardly, the failure of the summit would mean the failure of the great pan-European project of eastward enlargement."
"That is why there is no room here for exaggerated national demands."
"We make this plea to the Council: all the Heads of State and Government must travel to Berlin prepared in all earnest to close the gap between them."
"That applies just as much to the German Government as it does to the southern countries."
"Because when huge efforts have been required of the applicant countries for years, it would be a fateful sign if the EU were simply not to hand in its homework."
"The European Parliament has proved through the compromises in its reports that an agreement is possible, including on the crucial points."
"The demands are balanced and they are before the Council."
"So it is possible!"
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Minister, in his speech to Parliament of 12 January, Mr Joschka Fischer sketched the framework for a vast and ambitious European policy and led us to hope for an active and effective German Presidency, which is what we need."
"We have become somewhat concerned over recent weeks, the difficulties seeming more serious than expected."
"In such a climate, the Berlin summit assumes great importance."
"It is essential for Berlin to provide new momentum and to demonstrate that the initial differences are now being overcome."
"A European Union without optimism and without the will to act would be in very poor shape to tackle forthcoming key events such as the parliamentary elections on 13 June."
"I would stress one point: budgetary resources."
"We are perfectly aware of the need to reform the public finances of our Member States but, for all that, and even if it is not exactly what certain governments state, it would be a dangerous calculation to refuse the Union sufficient resources to succeed in doing what is requested of it."
"By this I am not of course speaking of the waste and malfunctioning in the Commission's management practices, which have already been denounced."
"Leaving aside these errors, which must of course be corrected, I am speaking of deep-rooted problems, for example, the preservation of the European agricultural model, the policy of cohesion and solidarity, and Europe's competitiveness in the high technology sector."
"I am also referring to the success of enlargement, as without a minimum of resources the tension will jeopardise European integration as a whole."
"Finally, I am referring to the Union drawing up and implementing economic, social and employment policies - within the framework of the Treaties of course - which are worthy of the name."
"This also calls for a minimum level of resources."
"It is a good thing to manage the Union's finances with care."
"But it would be dangerous to manage them sparingly."
"Not only do the Union's policies risk running out of steam, but there is the danger that the Community spirit might weaken."
"Today we are again discussing renationalisation and direct national contributions."
"Fortunately, the German Presidency seems to have abandoned this dangerous idea with regard to the common agricultural policy."
"We are also again discussing net contributors, positive and negative balances, British cheques, and so on. I do not deny that it is sometimes necessary to have a close look at the accounts and to seek new balances, but we must not recreate the climate of 1984."
"Mr President, the Berlin summit will largely decide the survival and even the strengthening of the Community spirit."
"I hope that we will be heard."
"The road to hell is paved with good intentions."
"I am not sure whether this excellent and instructive proverb is also found in the other ten official languages."
"It exists in Danish at least, and I am reminded of it almost every day in the institutions of the European Union, because these institutions - the Council, the Commission and this Parliament - have never grasped the wisdom, the very simple wisdom contained in the Norwegian handbook for mountain walkers, which says: 'in the event of disagreement between the map and the terrain, you should follow the terrain'."
"In this Parliament - and in all the EU's institutions, including the Commission and the Council - people consistently and with an almost religious zeal follow the once adopted map and ignore the terrain."
"The terrain will have its revenge, and I shall mention three points without going into detail, because my speaking time will not allow that."
"Firstly, in our opinion - and in the opinion of many Danish andNordic citizens - the enlargement project is heading in the wrong direction."
"On the one hand, the process which is taking place is humiliating for the applicant countries and, on the other hand, it has - to put it mildly - not been properly thought out in political terms. It is not a project which is based on democratisation, but one which is about empire-building."
"Secondly, the political conditions have at best not been properly thought out and the financial conditions, which are the subject of the extraordinary summit in Berlin, leave the gigantic money machines which the European Union has built up over the years in total chaos, in particular the common agricultural policy and the Structural Funds."
"This is a sharp reminder that you cannot ignore the terrain without the terrain taking revenge at some stage."
"Thirdly, this summit is taking place only days after we in Parliament were discussing the most serious constitutional crisis the institutions have yet faced, and I can imagine that - as so often in the past - the agenda of this summit will be different from the one which reflects the current political reality."
"Mr President, the extraordinary Berlin summit has been convened to unravel a complex tangle and solve a fairly knotty problem."
"Budgetary adjustment, the cost of enlargement, the future of the CAP and structural policy reform are all on the agenda."
"We shall never tire of repeating that the complexity of the problems and solutions would have been less traumatic if the institutional structure had been overhauled prior to enlargement and, consequently, the balance of power within the Union redressed."
"But now the thorny problems already on the table are compounded by the bombshell of Germany's call for a reduction in its budget contribution."
"Forgetting the overall input from Community coffers to the development of the five ex-Communist Länder , the German Government is now playing the card once used by Mrs Thatcher, a tactic which blocked Community activity for quite some time and has left an unpleasant aftertaste."
"Our first request to the German Presidency is that it should spare the Union a repeat of past performance, whereby problems are bounced from one summit to the next and resolved to the disadvantage of one group or another, one country or another, poisoning minds and keeping the public away from the ballot box next June."
"There is a risk that agricultural reform will be confined to a mere cost-cutting exercise, rather than aiming for quality production and safeguarding the certificate of origin, the sole guarantee that a product is typical and meets consumer demands."
"Extensive, American-style agriculture, rather than intensive farming as preferred in Europe, would destroy all that is distinctive about our specialities in the various production sectors."
"Germany's point that agriculture accounts for only 4 % of EU GDP is too narrow-minded: we must not overlook related sectors, the agri-food industry, processing and farm machinery."
"But even if the contribution to GDP really were so minimal, let us not forget that farming in Europe also represents a civilisation, a way of life and tradition which it would be criminal to abandon in favour of canned foods from the hypermarket shelves and futuristic transgenic products."
"Why not set up a European agency to manage any surpluses generated, dispatching these to countries experiencing production shortfalls or lean years?"
"By the same token, monetary donations to humanitarian associations could at least partly take the form of foodstuffs, thereby indirectly compensating for market fluctuations."
"Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, a few days before the EU summit in Berlin, where a decision will also be taken on the future of policy in rural areas, it is timely to repeat two demands made by the European Socialists."
"Firstly, Europe needs a socially responsible support policy which assists the weak and demands practical solidarity from the strong while also giving them the necessary freedom."
"Secondly, through its structural and support policies in rural areas, Europe must also make determined efforts to safeguard existing jobs and create new ones, because for Socialists throughout the Union, labour market policy must be the number one priority."
"The decisions made in Berlin must and will be positive for the EU."
"Given the diversity of the issues and the fact that they are crucial to the EU's future, compromises are obviously going to be necessary, as they are in any democratic system."
"Anyone announcing to the House here and now, for the benefit of the media, that they alone will come back a winner is certainly about to become painfully isolated."
"Those who are already talking in terms of a crisis, dispensing advice in the manner of a schoolteacher and heavily criticising the way in which the German Presidency is conducting the negotiations should recall, Mr Brok, that many of the problems which are having to be tackled here have been put off for years, and that there are a good many who watched without a word of protest while two thirds of the agriculture budget of DEM 75 billion disappeared for entirely economic reasons and was not even spent as we intended, but was instead poured into export subsidies and storage costs."
"This is a policy which is unsocial, if not even antisocial!"
"The evidence is clearer in agricultural policy than in any other EU policy that if the old support system is continued, smaller concerns will be - as they have been for years - the ones to suffer, not to say the foolish ones, and basically this is the way it will stay."
"In the meantime - and this too needs to be stated in this House - lobbyists on the look-out for a convincing policy have hit upon a new idea."
"Suddenly they are saying: away with all subsidies, away with all bureaucracy."
"We only want a regulated market."
"But if you take a look at this system or this new proposal, this regulated market turns out to be a European Union which is closed off to the outside world, managed, as it were, like a sandpit."
"However, a fortress state of this kind, in the 19th century style, would not only mean an end to the common market and the free movement of goods."
"Those who advocate such utter foolishness - because they have run out of ideas and people are running away from them - are also, and with a complete lack of responsibility, leaving the 6 % who still work in rural areas to face the anger of the remaining 94 % of Europeans, who then rightly point out that a 'philosophy' of this kind will not only cause jobs and social security to disappear for ever, but will eventually cause the downfall of the successful model which is the European Union, and which is unique in the history of Europe and the world."
"Mr President, two weeks before the Berlin European Council, I believe it is pointless to try to hide the pessimistic atmosphere that prevails."
"Frankly, I cannot see what progress the Council representative was referring to."
"On the contrary, some of the proposals by the German Presidency have not exactly given us much cause for hope, not to mention the decision to resort to the unusual mechanism of presenting them in the name of the German delegation."
"I do not know if that is what the Council representative calls a happy medium."
"But perhaps the most worrying thing is the confusion that exists, with constant changes of direction and a lack of impetus from those who are supposed to be in charge."
"The European Parliament has the right, not to mention the duty, to demand that the debate be more focused."
"We must remember that what we are discussing is how to finance the European Union until 2006 and how to reform the Structural Funds and common policies in the light of enlargement."
"The debate is not about determining how a specific country might pay less, but rather how to finance a range of common policies in a fairer and more effective manner."
"The aim of this is, of course, to create more jobs and reduce inequalities. In my view, the Presidency would do well to set aside the debate on net fiscal balances and look for solutions to its problems that keep faith with the Treaty."
"I do not think I have to remind you that the final agreement requires consensus."
"In other words, the automatic application of the system of majorities leads us to a dead end, to failure. And nobody - I would imagine - wants this Presidency to be remembered as one that failed."
"It is up to the German Presidency to put forward proposals that bring us closer to a final agreement, that accommodate the different interests involved, but that also set out a future objective of integration that all the people of Europe can identify with."
"The European elections in June will allow us all to measure our representativeness through the exercise of democracy. Only then should the Council propose its candidate for the Presidency of the European Commission as provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Mr President, on the eve of the year 2000, it is commonplace to hear of the need to breathe new life into Europe."
"The least that can be said, unfortunately, is that the Berlin Council is not part of this approach."
"There is no question of a more social, more democratic Europe, nor of a Europe of solidarity, as budgetary discipline and reduced contributions for some - and not the least important among us - are at the centre of the debates, and this at a time when we are preparing for enlargement."
"This is very worrying, as any rejection of the notion of financial solidarity in Europe can only favour increased globalisation, dominated by American ambitions."
"I note that there now seems to be movement on the question of cofinancing agricultural expenditure, demanded by some and rejected by others, including France."
"I welcome this, without being entirely reassured."
"In order to arrive at an agreement which is global, positive and acceptable to all, we must move beyond complicated calculations and develop financial solidarity on new bases in order to promote economic and social cohesion, which is under pressure from unemployment and growing poverty."
"The ceiling of 1.27 % must therefore remain so as to respect the constraints of the stability pact, although it would be better to replace it with an employment pact and find new sources of finance, based on a corporation tax or a capital gains tax, for example."
"To arrive at a more balanced budget, the share of each Member State must be in proportion to its share in the Community's GNP."
"A limit must be placed on farming subsidies and they must be designed to be of more benefit to small and medium-sized farms, as well as to employment."
"Mr President, I listened with great interest to the President-in-Office of the Council when he said that central questions have not been resolved."
"I think that will go down as the understatement of the day."
"Quite clearly the Council and Commission have been able to make no progress in the whole area of the reform and everything that goes with it."
"Everybody talks about reform and says that reform is needed and required."
"I think we all accept that change is always necessary and we have evolved with that change."
"What I want to make very clear to both the Commission and the Council here today is that if they are going to have reform it must not be at the price of destruction of our rural communities throughout the European Union."
"There is a grave danger as we go forward that is what will happen."
"We must defend European Union farmers against the threats of the Americans and everyone else in the world who want to destroy the European agricultural industry."
"If you destroy the European agricultural industry you will destroy vast parts of the whole rural community and the whole infrastructure throughout Europe."
"This reform will be like all the reforms in the past."
"It will not save one ECU."
"It will not save one D-mark or one pound."
"In fact, by the time it is finished, it will cost more."
"The real truth is that the time has come for some of these countries who have benefitted very well over the past years from membership of the European Union, and who tell us that they are great Europeans, to begin to delve into their pockets and pay their way."
"I think that is the challenge."
"I noted with interest President Santer's comment that he will take note of certain specific situations within the European Union."
"I hope he will do that."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when Jacques Santer and the European Commission presented Agenda 2000 in July 1997 with a view to preparing for enlargement towards Eastern Europe, they did not think that they would be jeopardising Europe's cohesion, and the Franco-German axis in particular."
"It is true that just a few months before the European elections, national concessions are difficult to win amidst this vast bargaining process of European reform."
"Germany is both judge and interested party as for six months it is presiding over Europe's fate while at the same time itself demanding a substantial reduction in its contribution to the Community budget. But it is finding it very difficult to impose sacrifices on its partners, each one being more or less agreed to support the idea of stabilising expenditure."
"Even the euro is showing signs of weakness against the dollar, proof if ever there was that a single currency is not something which can be forced upon us."
"Of the three reforms included in Agenda 2000 - reform of the CAP, reform of the Structural Funds, and the review of the financial perspective for 2000-2006 - only the first has been discussed at length by the ministers, and the only tangible result is that Germany has abandoned the idea of national cofinancing of direct subsidies to agriculture."
"In these difficult negotiations, France has made two enormous mistakes."
"First, it put its cards on the table much too early, the others keeping their joker for the end of the game."
"Also, it is very dangerous for France to try and reach agreement on the CAP without reforming the Structural Funds and Europe's future financial framework since, with 23 % of the EAGFF Guarantee appropriations, it is Europe's leading agricultural nation and most vulnerable to budgetary restrictions."
"Do we blame the United Kingdom for defending the annual rebate granted to Mrs Thatcher in 1984, or Spain, Portugal and Ireland for defending the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds, or Germany for defending a reduction in its contribution, or Italy for defending the system of own resources, in particular VAT, which is to its advantage?"
"We certainly do not."
"The France of Mr Chirac and Mr Jospin is the only one not to clearly defend its national interests, to sacrifice its farmers, its regions and its tax-payers to the European illusion."
"I must say here very solemnly that the phased reduction in direct agricultural subsidies as proposed by France is a bad idea because it will lead to a further decrease in farmers' incomes, but also because these subsidies only partially compensate for the price reductions."
"In the name of what principles should farmers alone bear the cost of this technocratic Europe which is responsible for their extinction?"
"As for the reform of the Structural Funds, Corsica and French Hainaut will see their regional aid cancelled, while fragile rural areas that enjoyed Objective 5b status will only receive the minimum share of a new inconsistent package."
"Given these conditions, ladies and gentlemen, the Berlin European Council on 24 and 25 March is likely to produce a fool's bargain."
"In 1918, France said that Germany would pay."
"Times have changed."
"Now it is France that will pay for the new eastern Länder, for southern Europe's infrastructures, and even for Ireland, which has a growth rate that is much higher than our own."
"Later, it will pay for the Eastern European countries."
"The National Front, which I am honoured to lead, rejects the federalist excesses of Agenda 2000 which lead to destructive free trade and reductive globalisation."
"We call for a Europe of nations, of peoples and of national identities, a Europe which gives renewed hope to our fellow citizens who have been exploited for the last 40 years."
"Mr President, it will come as no surprise that my main plea today is for the Council to make the effort to meet its timetable to enable Parliament to fully exercise its democratic mandate and add democratic legitimacy."
"But let me repeat what I believe is now coming loud and clear from our regions, municipalities and partners: those on the ground who are using these funds will continue to need funds, but they need to have the certainty and security that agreement can be achieved in Berlin."
"Programmes will not start on 1 January 2000, but we need to minimise delays in order not to fall into the problems and traps of the previous round of funding where late starts led to problems of underspends, delays in projects, project cancellations and difficulties in sustaining matched funding."
"We need to avoid this for future programmes."
"But precisely because of these potential programming delays it is important that in Parliament's priorities the idea of transitional programmes are the same length for all objectives: six years to allow regions coming off regional aid adequate time to put into place self-sustaining programmes by using financial opportunities of loans and venture capital."
"This takes time."
"That is why we again make the plea for the same transitional period."
"This will give these areas a soft landing, when they come off regional support."
"Last week I was engaged in my own tour and mini-summit, as it were, in Berlin."
"I was there to speak on urban policy."
"I was even more convinced of the need to retain the URBAN initiative in the European Union."
"Across the European Union, even in areas of relative wealth, we encounter severe deprivation, and communities which are not getting fair access to opportunities."
"While we acknowledge the need to continue to concentrate our resources on the poorest and declining areas, some of which are in my own region Merseyside, we still have to have solidarity as a two-way process."
"We have to retain the capacity to invest and support in our marginalised groups and communities which are not necessarily in Objective I or Objective II areas."
"The URBAN initiative is a small programme with a big impact."
"I make the plea that we continue to support this."
"I was also in a northern industrial suburb in Milan."
"We took the opportunity to look at a steel restructuring works."
"You know of course, that the Resider funds will no longer be there to support these kinds of areas."
"They will probably not qualify for Objective II."
"This means that we also have to have a crisis initiative in order to enable us to support the future crisis sectors."
"We need an initiative to enhance our credibility and to prove that Europe is capable of responding to economic and social crisis."
"Which of us knows today what will be the crisis sectors of the future?"
"I thank the President-in-Office for the continuing support, particularly for investment in Northern Ireland."
"My latest visit indicated that the peace process there is incredibly fragile, but people take tremendous heart from the fact that Europe is supporting their cause."
"There is an imperative to continue to invest."
"I am pleased that the German presidency has also made a priority of support for Northern Ireland."
"We need to have partnership."
"The partnership principle is fundamental to enhancing the democratic credibility of the funds that we use back in our regions."
"I know that the presidency has accepted that partnership is a key principle."
"We do not want to be prescriptive."
"We simply want evidence that a partnership pact is going to be an operation with local authorities, with NGOs and, indeed, with the social partners."
"Let me commend your efforts to try to meet the timetable."
"We know it is no easy task to achieve a fair, equitable and acceptable outcome for 15 Member States, but a fair and equitable outcome has to have democratic legitimacy in the European Parliament."
"The final package must perforce reflect Parliament's priorities."
"I look forward to seeing these reflected in the final regulation."
"Mr President, I would endorse Mr Santer's opening remark, to the effect that the decisions now facing us are vital to Europe's future."
"I also concur that an agreement, compromise or meeting of minds must be found in Berlin."
"The European Union must be given a new lease of life on the eve of the elections and, as Mr Galeote has just said, we cannot ignore the scepticism and pessimism currently pervading Europe because of the difficulties confronting the euro: the disagreements, the uncertainties, the misguided statements being made on the stability pact, the wrangles over the autonomy of the European Central Bank and the pressure for a further drop in interest rates are all creating a climate of uncertainty and gloom at the very start of the euro's life, raising some extremely serious, inescapable problems such as the completion of institutional reform."
"The ECB President, Wim Duisenberg, recently stated in an interview that he had been asked to defend the value of the euro, our common currency, and price stability."
"If he is to pursue these aims single-handedly using monetary means alone, he will undoubtedly create more unemployment."
"There is a need, therefore, for economic and political governance: the Central Bank can only be independent if a political government assumes responsibility for economic policy-making."
"This is a matter of the utmost urgency."
"This aspiration is not universally shared within the EU at present, nor by this presidency: this morning's speech by its representative was scarcely encouraging in this regard."
"The Berlin Council, and then that of Cologne, needs not only to produce agreements on figures and sums, but to focus on what is important and give centrestage to the issue of job creation - as called for by the Socialist Group."
"Ways to boost employment include the promotion of more liberal labour market policies, progress concerning Mr Monti's proposals, the exclusion of public expenditure and investment from the deficit, and fiscal policy harmonisation: none of these subjects have been mentioned this morning."
"A commitment is required above all to reconciling the need for a redistribution - and not a reduction - of financial contributions to the Union with the need to keep intact the policies of the Cohesion and Structural Funds, since these are geared to generating employment."
"We wish to hear the German Presidency confirm these commitments, and expect them to be followed up at the Berlin summit."
"Mr President, no-one is any doubt that the extraordinary summit in Berlin will be of great importance to the future of European integration and, as a result, to the farming sector."
"I have listened to you, Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, and I must admit that I am not satisfied, as you fail to sufficiently tackle the underlying issues, preferring to make politically correct general statements."
"It is not enough to say that the future of the common agricultural policy will be preserved. You must say how, and why!"
"We all know, President Santer, that we are facing a budgetary problem."
"The question here involves the CAP's future share in the budget."
"Faced with planned price reductions, the Commission's proposals increase direct subsidies to farmers."
"This partial compensation will lead to a progressive and steady fall in the incomes of European farmers."
"And I know that statistics can be used to say anything you like."
"You can say, for example, that farmers' incomes have increased since the CAP reform of 1992."
"But in reality, Europe's farmers have had to adapt and have been forced to increase their productivity either by having larger farms or by adopting more intensive farming practices."
"The 1992 CAP therefore led to the desertification of the countryside, due to the fall in the number of farmers and to an increase in intensive production systems."
"It seems that nobody has learned from the lesson of BSE."
"In future, in their search for productivity, certain producers are going to have no alternative but to use genetically modified organisms, or hormones, or who knows what else."
"Given this budgetary problem, the Commission has proposed a number of paths."
"First, there is cofinancing, which we reject in its present form as it will inevitably distort competition between farmers in the various Member States and cause problems for the only common policy, whose legitimacy - I would remind you - is based on the Treaty of Rome."
"The farmers believed in Europe because they believed in the CAP."
"I ask you not to disappoint them."
"Other Commission proposals are now circulating, particularly that involving the phased reduction of subsidies of up to 3 % a year."
"This proposal fails to take account of the differences between the various types of agricultural production as the farmers most affected by this measure will be those who are most dependent on agricultural subsidies."
"I am thinking, for example, of sheep farmers and of beef cattle farmers, who will have to give up farming altogether if they do not receive a sufficient level of compensation."
"A phased reduction of 3 % a year, in addition to the currency depreciation, which we can now estimate at 2 % a year for the period 2000-2006, means that farmers must increase production by 5 % a year."
"That objective is hardly compatible with the food and health safety of European agriculture."
"We are becoming increasingly dependent on the agricultural production of third countries and will no longer be able to guarantee the quality of the products European consumers buy."
"We are now faced with a budgetary problem and I understand its origins and constraints. The European Union must therefore make a strong political choice."
"It must give preference to those policies for which it is entirely responsible, and in which the CAP must clearly be a key component."
"I would inform the House that I have received seven motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2)."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, reaching a compromise in Berlin which is acceptable to everyone is not only about keeping to our timetable for Agenda 2000; it is also - and this should be made clear to the German Presidency - about our credibility."
"It is about our credibility in the eyes of all the people in the Union, but above all it is about our credibility towards the 27 million who are unemployed, whom we repeatedly assure that both the Member States and the European Union itself will make every effort to combat unemployment as effectively - and above all as quickly - as possible."
"The Social Fund is the only instrument of labour market policy which we have at European level, and that is why it needs to be pressed into service for the employment strategy as soon as possible."
"It is not without reason that we also want, in the future, to use the Social Fund throughout the European Union to combat youth and long-term unemployment."
"Unemployment is not a problem which is only confined to particular regions; it is a problem which extends across the Community and that is precisely why it would be wrong, if appropriations for the Structural Funds were reduced, to cut Social Fund appropriations outside the eligible areas by 40 %, as allowed for in Council plans."
"If you cancel Objective 3 resources in this way, how do you expect people to continue to believe that the Social Fund is going to help to make the employment strategy, which we want so much, a reality across the European Union?"
"In fact, we all know from past experience that it was not least the Social Fund which time and again forced Member States and regions to adopt new and innovative methods, in order, with European money, to get people back to work or indeed to shield them from unemployment."
"Let us take the example of preventive labour market policy, which is today one of the four pillars of our employment strategy."
"In 1994, however, when the Social Fund introduced this prophylactic approach to labour market policy in the Member States for the first time, many Member States - and also the German Länder - fought it tooth and nail."
"But its success speaks for itself, and it really does show once more the significance of European added value."
"The same is true of vocational training in Italy."
"Without the Social Fund, the relevant measures would perhaps still not exist today."
"I am also thinking of the certification system for training courses which has been developed so successfully throughout Greece, and of the support provided by the Social Fund for the disabled, which has moved the United Kingdom from the bottom of the European league to the top in terms of integrating the disabled, or I might think of the school drop-out rate in Ireland, which has been reduced by almost half."
"This is not just progress in terms of labour market policy; the Fund also works to create social change and makes Europe something people can experience in a very practical way in the place where they live, which also increases its acceptance."
"In Portugal, they can tell you a thing or two about this."
"For example, without the Social Fund, illiteracy here would not have fallen by anywhere near as much as it has done."
"Or you only have to consider mainstreaming."
"Here too, and this is long overdue, Europe is forging the way ahead, although - and I am under no illusions here - the path is certainly still a hazardous one."
"That is why we must ensure that no Member State is able to avoid implementing specific support measures for women."
"That applies equally to the four other spheres of intervention: measures to combat youth and long-term unemployment; social integration; general and professional training; and preventive labour market policy."
"I will conclude, therefore, with this urgent plea to the Council: do not free the Member States from their obligation to take action in each of the five spheres of intervention of the Social Fund."
"Cherry-picking does not give European added value; instead, it reinforces national single-track approaches."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have now been discussing the Agenda 2000 proposals for 21 months but never before has our debate been so specifically focused on budgetary and financial matters."
"The debate about the major choices facing Europe has now been overtaken by a debate about budgets and the Member States' 'give and take', in particular the question of how much the Union's most prosperous States should pay in and get back."
"I think it is vital to assess whether one or more States are still contributing too much to the budget while other Member States, equally prosperous, are paying in too little."
"But once that has been established the European Union must decide to reform its system of own resources in which the only fair basis for contributions is that of relative prosperity or gross national product."
"We cannot afford a situation in which major European decisions have to depend on solutions being found to these budgetary matters and, above all, it would be tragic if it were the poorer Member States or regions that ended up paying for those decisions and the restoration of a financial balance."
"On this score, I should like to emphasise three points."
"The first is that the Structural Funds, including the Cohesion Fund, should be strengthened, especially in the Objective I regions, for which at least two thirds of the funding should be earmarked."
"The figure of 0.46 % of GNP for the Structural Fund should be seen as a target but not a ceiling."
"The second point is that the 0.13 % of GNP necessary for funding pre-accession measures for the new Member States must not be obtained by redirecting funds previously channelled into the weakest regions of the current 15 Member States of the European Union."
"The third aspect that I would like to emphasise is that of all the reforms of the CAP that I have witnessed, none of them until this one has been a reform worked out on the hoof - in other words, any old solution, even one that is cobbled together, provided that it brings down farm spending to the level set by the Ministers of Finance."
"Just as we were hoping for a new balance to be struck in the CAP to help producers and crops that so far have barely benefited from it, for stronger rural development benefiting agri-environmental and forestry measures and in particular increasing aid to the less favoured regions, what we now see on the negotiating table of the Agriculture Council are proposals for equal cuts in aid for everyone without the slightest suggestion that any attempt could be made to introduce the principle of fairness into the CAP."
"As if all farmers had benefited equally from it in the past."
"I hope that a solution will come out of the Berlin summit, one that will serve Europe."
"After all, Europe has only made progress when it has been able to demonstrate solidarity and look beyond its ambitions."
"If we are now going to start contemplating our navels and counting every penny to be paid in and taken out, it does not bode well for the future."
"The Prime Minister of my country is always saying that Europe lacks political ambition and leadership."
"How right he is!"
"But perhaps I should add that this is happening at a time when 13 of the 15 governments and 11 prime ministers are all Socialists."
"Mr President, the last comments were about lacking vision - I just want to make a comment about losing sight of something: the interinstitutional agreement."
"Whilst all our minds seem to be concentrated on Berlin, and quite rightly so, the present meeting of the Agricultural Council is a considerable distraction."
"Among all this we have the on-going discussions between Parliament and the Council on the interinstitutional agreement."
"Let me remind Members and the Council President that without an interinstitutional agreement there is no Agenda 2000."
"Without an interinstitutional agreement we go back to Article 203 and Agenda 2000 is dead."
"It is therefore imperative that both we and the Council find an amicable solution to getting an interinstitutional agreement."
"The old process that we are talking about is one of compromise, as President Santer said."
"We have problems, especially in agriculture."
"Those problems are about expenditure and reform but the message that needs to be put across is that without reform of the CAP, as proposed by the Commission, we will not have enlargement."
"Those Member States that are opposed to reform will have to ask themselves whether they are serious about enlargement or not."
"Without reform of the CAP we simply weaken our position in the WTO at the next round of negotiations."
"We should be pro-active and taking a lead."
"Without reform we will just see the United States in the key position and we will be reacting once again to everything the Americans say."
"Without reform of the CAP we end up with food surpluses."
"We are back to food mountains at great cost to EU tax payers - back to the bad old days - and none of us want to see that."
"I need to make a comment to the President-in-Office which relates to what is going on with the Agricultural Council."
"I hope they can come to a solution but if they cannot and it drags on, then quite frankly the General Affairs Council has to start taking decisions for agricultural ministers."
"We cannot allow that item to jeopardise or weaken Agenda 2000."
"On financial matters, we have the situation where Agenda 2000 is linked with agreements on future financing."
"I have said for quite a long time that need not be the case."
"It is obvious why it is the case but there is no need to link a new own resources system with Agenda 2000 and I hope that if that is a problem then we can get an agreement on Agenda 2000 and afterwards continue to look at future financing."
"The options proposed by the Commission on own resources are worthy of long and further discussions."
"The Council should not be rushed into decisions that will not solve deep-rooted problems of such financing and we should not let this procedure distract us from getting the right solution to Agenda 2000."
"What we want from our side are those policies which will stimulate employment, which will build social cohesion and which will protect the environment - objectives we can all agree on."
"They must not be jeopardised by narrow-minded nationalistic attitudes - and that goes for all the Member States."
"Mr President, the German Presidency's report and the way the Agenda 2000 negotiations stand - or perhaps I should say the state they are in - give cause for serious concern."
"The political rhetoric and the financial perspectives are significantly out of kilter."
"We are seeing a repeat, on a large scale, of the complaints made at the last part-session and, on a small scale, of those made during the Socrates debate."
"The Commission comes along with an ambitious proposal: it proposes more tasks, more partners and higher quality."
"And then along comes the Council of savings club ministers and hardly any of it is possible any more!"
"If we take a look at the figures and the proposals on structural and agricultural reform, we are faced with the same dilemma."
"Two weeks before Berlin, we are still a long way from the noble aims of which the Treaty itself speaks - solidarity, cohesion and the common agricultural policy."
"For the current year 1999, for example, EUR 216 billion is budgeted for regional policy."
"In the longer term, the Commission has requested EUR 240 billion and at present a whole series of Member States is offering EUR 190 billion."
"That cannot add up!"
"The gap is almost wider still for the agricultural funds."
"The President-in-Office spoke of austerity constraints, but obviously some see making savings as the true objective of agricultural reform."
"That would be a catastrophe for rural areas."
"Many issues also still need to be clarified in greater detail, in particular those associated with the phasing-out arrangements: how much money will there be here, and for how long?"
"Only sketchy information has been given about the Community initiatives, and we can only hope - and I am also directing this request to President Santer - that the detailed proposals will actually be presented before the end of March."
"You see all of this adds to the importance we attach to a fundamental question."
"On 1 May, the Treaty of Amsterdam will enter into force."
"Parliament will then have full powers of codecision for the ERDF and the European Social Fund."
"How are we supposed to exercise these if the texts are not available in good time?"
"Mr President, in the debates in Council on Agenda 2000 it is clear that there is a certain indecision."
"The reason for this is that there is a discrepancy between the objectives that are being put forward and the funds that are available to pay for them."
"We agree that there must be a policy for farmers."
"We agree that there must be a policy for economic and social cohesion."
"We agree that there must be a policy for enlargement."
"However, no one wants to pay to attain these objectives."
"But there can be no policy without money and I want to be clear on this point."
"Countries which contribute the most to the Community budget must know that they get a lot back in other areas, such as, for example, in increased exports to weaker Member States."
"The Structural Funds were set up as a mechanism to counterbalance the effects of the single market."
"Those who complain that they are paying too much must not forget that the budget of the whole of the European Union is currently equal to that of just one Member State, Spain."
"I have two comments to make, firstly on agriculture and secondly on the Structural Funds."
"It is absolutely clear that the common agricultural policy has created distortions, that agriculture needs to move in a new direction, and that the World Trade Organisation is bringing about a new reality."
"We therefore need a new CAP which can help the really weak Member States."
"These weaker Member States are the economically poorest countries in the European Union which will be badly affected by any partial renationalisation of the CAP."
"Also weak are the small producers, on whom we must focus our attention."
"Mediterranean products have been unfairly treated and we must not deal them any more harsh blows."
"Regarding the Structural Funds, this House approved the financial package which the Commission initially introduced, which is why we are opposed to any attempts to further reduce it."
"I shall reiterate three basic tenets expressed by the European Parliament back in November: firstly, expenditure on the Structural Funds and on the pre-accession funds must equal 0.46 % of Community GDP; secondly, Objective 1 must have allocated to it exactly two thirds of the resources of the Structural Funds; thirdly, the Cohesion Fund must continue to support all countries whose per capita GDP is less than 90 % of the Community average."
"Indeed, this is provided for in the Treaties."
"I want to point out that, especially with regard to the Structural Fund regulations, the agreement of the European Parliament is required."
"It is crucial, therefore, that the Council and the European Council meeting in Berlin consider our proposals seriously."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank the groups and those Members who have spoken for making this debate a very constructive one."
"Valuable comments and suggestions have been made and we will take these on board."
"Overall, I think this debate has been encouraging in so far as we agree on the objectives and also on how they should be achieved, namely to actually conclude Agenda 2000 now so that we are once again free to devote our energies to the major tasks of which several speakers rightly reminded us today - the fight against unemployment in Europe, the fight for a better environment and the fight for greater social justice."
"However, this is not what Agenda 2000 is about."
"All those who are critical of the fact that there was no mention of this in the Council statement are forgetting that this Council statement concentrates - and indeed had to concentrate - on the Berlin summit."
"Agenda 2000 is clearly defined and I warn against weighing it down with major new issues, some of which it is intended should be resolved at the Berlin summit and others at summits thereafter."
"I note with due respect the criticism made of the way in which the negotiations are being conducted and the progress made so far."
"I would permit myself to tell you, however - since some proverbs have already been cited - that there is also a very interesting German proverb which states that you should not praise the day before nightfall, and you should not criticise it either."
"Those who are criticising the progress made in the negotiations are basing what they say on information which is passed out from confidential discussions and channelled to interested parties."
"The presidency knows all about this."
"We are very interested and sometimes also amused to see how events are reported in the individual capitals and in Brussels, obviously with the aim of making particular national interests appear in the right light and improving the starting position for representing those individual interests."
"The presidency's motto in these matters is: a gentleman does not boast of his conquests!"
"We will make no further comment on this, but will simply put in the necessary work on an overall compromise."
"Admittedly, there is a noticeable difference here between the way in which issues can be discussed in Parliament and how they are discussed in the Council."
"That is due to their different roles."
"Parliament can decide with majorities: in the Council, we need all 15 to agree."
"That is why it makes no sense whatsoever for us, as the presidency, to adopt any dogmatic positions or make categorical demands, or at any point to insist that certain conditions should be met."
"Anyone who does that will fail completely when they need the agreement of 15!"
"Please try to understand that. I would be delighted if it were possible to say to the Heads of State and Government: 'My friends, this is not actually about how much money goes to particular regions of Portugal, Spain, Ireland or Italy; it is about the great European vision!"
"Forget the issue of who pays what and who gets what for once, and think instead of our great common goals!' It would be nice if this were the case."
"I do not know a single European Head of State or Government who would be willing to discuss this for even a minute."
"It is a shame that Mr Cunha from Portugal is no longer here; I would like to advise him to say what he said in Lisbon and point out that it is not so important after all who pays what and who gets what."
"It is actually about the great European vision!"
"I understand that; it is to do with our different roles."
"Unfortunately, we cannot operate in this way in the Council."
"As a prerequisite for resolving the issues on which we have to agree, we have to try to reach a consensus."
"This consensus must encompass the financial perspective."
"That includes both sides, the revenue side and the expenditure side."
"It must encompass the reform of the agricultural policy."
"I fully agree with all those who have said that there are many reasons why we need a reform here. And it must encompass the future use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds, and of course the purpose of these funds is to put the principle of solidarity into practice within the European Union."
"No one is calling this principle into question!"
"Those are the points on which we need to reach an agreement, and that creates the framework within which the individual policies can then develop and within which we tackle the problems."
"One final word on net balances, an issue which was addressed several times."
"Firstly, it is wrong to think that this is a German problem."
"It was a group of states which, a long time ago, made this topic part of the discussions."
"Incidentally, all the Member States recognise this."
"When, if not in connection with a seven-year financial perspective, should this subject be discussed?"
"Now is the only time it actually can be discussed."
"The German Presidency is not at all happy that the issue has to be discussed now when we ourselves hold the presidency."
"I can tell you now, as a German politician, that we could have represented our German interests much more forcefully, much more effectively, and probably also with a great deal more success - we would have been able to secure a much better result - if we had not held the presidency at the present time."
"At one point I heard the Presidency being accused of representing its own national interests, and I cannot take note of this without giving a wry smile."
"The opposite is true."
"The reality of the presidency can be described in a classic French expression which was coined many years ago: la présidence coûte cher !"
"That also applies to Germany; we know that very well."
"We remain determined to conclude Agenda 2000."
"The prospects of doing so are good, now that some key benchmark figures have already been agreed."
"Parliament's support is important."
"It will be particularly important after Berlin for there to be very close and trusting cooperation between the Council, the Commission and Parliament."
"At this stage, I can only extend to you the offer of this close and trusting cooperation."
"Applause"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Welcome"
"It is a great pleasure for me to welcome the delegation from the House of Representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina chaired by its president, Halid Genja'c, and colleagues of this delegation representing all major political groups and three constituent ethnic groups of the country."
"Applause"
"Bosnia and Herzegovina has been a special country for this Parliament and since the beginning of its mandate in 1994 we have followed carefully the events and tried to contribute to a just peace and the hope that multi-ethnic coexistence would be re-established."
"May I wish you, on behalf of the European Parliament, all the best in your demanding work for a peaceful, flourishing and democratic Bosnia and Herzegovina where new generations will grow in the spirit of mutual understanding, tolerance and cooperations."
"I should like to express my wish that the discussions you will have today at the first inter-parliamentary meeting with our delegation for relations with South-East Europe will be fruitful."
"Situation in Kosovo"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Kosovo."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you are certainly keeping me busy today!"
"But we now turn to an extremely grave matter."
"In this regard, I should like to give you the following information: in a few days' time, the negotiations on resolving the crisis in Kosovo will resume in France."
"At this stage I should like, on behalf of the presidency, to underline once again the European Union's willingness to do all it can to bring the negotiation process begun in Rambouillet to a successful conclusion."
"All of us would certainly have liked Rambouillet to have produced a more positive result."
"Unfortunately, an agreement was not signed, but nonetheless these negotiations were not in vain."
"They prepared the ground for both sides to give a written undertaking to continue this process, and that is an important step forward."
"Our particular thanks go to the co-chairmen of the Conference, the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom and France, Mr Cook and Mr Védrine."
"I should also like to say how much I appreciated the tireless efforts made by the three leaders of the negotiations: the EU special envoy, Wolfgang Petritsch; the US special envoy, Christopher Hill; and the special envoy of the Russian Federation, Boris Mayorski."
"It was only through the international community presenting a united front that it was possible to bring the belligerent parties to the negotiating table and to lay the foundations for a possible final peaceful settlement."
"In our view, the draft Rambouillet agreement achieves a fair balance between the interests of both sides."
"While respecting the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, it provides for substantial autonomy for Kosovo with a high degree of local self-administration, legislative bodies and its own judiciary."
"Kosovo's final status would then be determined three years later at an international conference."
"An important matter, on which both parties still need to agree, is the military back-up to be provided for civilian implementation."
"In their opening declaration at the Rambouillet talks, the Kosovar Albanians explicitly called for the rapid deployment of NATO troops, while the Belgrade side did at least say that it was prepared to discuss the scale and make-up of an international presence to implement the agreement."
"That is a point on which a final agreement remains to be negotiated on 15 March."
"In the meantime, the moderate political movements of the Kosovar Albanians have stated that they are willing to sign the agreement."
"This is an encouraging sign and, above all, a warning sign to Belgrade not to stand in the way of a peaceful solution."
"Our Foreign Minister, Mr Fischer, has just returned from a trip to Belgrade and Pristina, where, in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, he once again impressed on both sides the fact that they would be the first to suffer if the peace process begun in Rambouillet were to fail."
"The Kosovar Albanians would lose the opportunity for far-reaching autonomy, safeguarded by international troops."
"The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would have to be prepared for increased international isolation."
"At the same time, Mr Fischer reaffirmed the intention of the international community not to stand and watch if the belligerent parties refuse to cooperate."
"NATO's threat is meant seriously and is still real, because this is about the people of Kosovo."
"They are the ones who are having to bear the burden of this conflict."
"Well over 200 000 refugees and displaced persons still do not dare to return home to their villages."
"The persistent local fighting and the Yugoslav army's stepping-up of training exercises in recent weeks have caused further waves of refugees into Macedonia."
"Both sides have to show, in the interests of their people, that they are equal to the political responsibility resting on them."
"The international community is prepared to play its part."
"The European Union already signalled during the negotiations that it would be involved in implementing the agreement."
"This intention was confirmed by the General Affairs Council of 22 February 1999."
"The European Union will therefore take on a leading role."
"The Commission has said that it is prepared to host a donor conference at an early stage, so that the work of reconstruction can begin as quickly as possible."
"According to the Commission's initial assessment, the damage runs to around EUR 330 million."
"Houses which have been destroyed need to be repaired or rebuilt as swiftly as possible."
"Refugees and displaced persons must be able to return home quickly."
"Farmers need seed."
"All of this is a basic precondition for peaceful everyday life to resume in Kosovo and for the situation to stabilise and get back to normal."
"We know that the population will not be able to do this on its own and is dependent on our help."
"We are prepared to give it, provided that the leaders of the Kosovar Albanians and the leadership in Belgrade show sufficient courage and are sufficiently far-sighted to accept the Contact Group's proposals on 15 March."
"In Rambouillet, a decisive step was taken towards reaching a peaceful settlement."
"I urge both sides to follow this road to the end on the basis of the compromises already reached, and to refrain from taking any measures which might put at risk what has been achieved so far."
"It is thanks to the international community's determination and unity that the negotiations in Rambouillet have achieved some degree of success."
"The European Union has made a decisive contribution to this and it will continue - both at the forthcoming talks in Paris and in the possible implementation of the agreement - to play the role incumbent upon it, in order to maintain peace and stability on its south-eastern border."
"Mr President, the President-in-Office, Mr Verheugen, has provided you with a complete summary of the present situation in Kosovo."
"There is no doubt that this is a crucial time and we hope that when the international community and the parties involved meet again on Monday in Paris, they will be able to sign an agreement, despite the news we have received of the recent clashes at the border with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"The Commission is also concerned at the recent news about the separation of men and women in the southern part of the region."
"As the President-in-Office already mentioned, Mr Fischer and my colleague Commissioner van den Broek visited Belgrade and Pristina on Monday, which is why I am standing in for the Commissioner today. Their aim was to put pressure on the parties to sign the Rambouillet agreement and arrange an international military presence to guarantee its application."
"The talks in Belgrade did not give rise to much optimism and the three delegations were warned that they should not underestimate the resolve of the international community."
"A meeting was also held in Pristina with the political leaders, who all expressed their support for the outcome of the Rambouillet Conference."
"The Commission hopes that the Kosovo Liberation Army will overcome its hesitation and sign the agreement."
"Some members of the KLA are perhaps suspicious of the fact that they will have to hand over their weapons when the agreement comes into force under international military supervision. But they must realise that it would be a grave mistake to delay or to reject the agreement."
"Under the agreement, Kosovo's autonomy must be established by promoting economic and social development in the region."
"The European Commission is naturally prepared to fulfill its obligations in this respect, and once the agreement has been signed, reconstruction will be our main priority."
"Measures have already been taken to assess the damage, and the results were analysed recently in Brussels with the international donor community. Although not all of Kosovo could be assessed, it is estimated that a minimum of EUR 350 million will be required for reconstruction work alone."
"As soon as the agreement is signed, the Commission will organise a meeting of donors with a view to raising the funds needed to cover the costs of reconstruction."
"The Commission itself will guarantee an adequate presence on the ground and it hopes to play a prominent and visible role in the reconstruction work."
"At the same time, the development of civil society in all its dimensions must be encouraged, and this is an objective to which the European Union hopes to contribute along with other international organisations such as the OSCE."
"This is therefore the Commission's position on this important issue."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group, I should like to fully endorse the picture presented and the views expressed by the presidency and the Commission on this matter."
"Our biggest problem is, of course, that for peace we need partners, but that we still only have two opponents who are hardly prepared to become real partners."
"It is also difficult to become a partner under pressure, but we have no alternative other than to exert this pressure on both the Serbian and the Kosovar-Albanian sides."
"As far as the Serbian side is concerned, and there is no need to waste words in passingmoral judgement on Milosevic and other Serb leaders, I just have one concern - and I do not know whether the presidency would like to comment on this - which is that the actions, in themselves perfectly understandable, of the High Representative Carlos Westendorp with regard to Republika Srpska, by being taken at this particular time, just a few days before the Conference reconvenes in Rambouillet, might harden the resolve of the Serbian side."
"I am thinking here of the decision made in Brcko, but even more of the decisions on staffing concerning Poplasen, which ultimately also led to Dodic's resignation, who is of course to some extent our 'ally' on the Serbian side in Republika Srpska."
"That is a question I am asking myself."
"I hope that this has been well coordinated and well thought out."
"As far as the Kosovar-Albanian side is concerned, I should like once again to say loudly and clearly here that all of us who hold talks with liberation movements or resistance movements, whether it is the Kurds on the one hand or the Kosovar Albanians on the other, have a duty to insist that they adopt a peaceful, cooperative position, a position on the basis of which a compromise can be reached."
"I believe - as the Commissioner has also said - that some things have already started to happen: on the KLA side too, forces which are more willing to compromise have come to the fore, and I still say that if these resistance movements want the solidarity and support of the international community, then they too must be prepared to cooperate and compromise."
"The final point which I should like to underline clearly once again, and which I would ask to be taken into account in the position we adopt at the talks in Rambouillet, is as follows: without military back-up, the whole initiative does not make any sense, and it will be years - as we have of course also seen in Bosnia - before a real solution is reached here."
"Please, stand firm where the military back-up for peace is concerned!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we discussed Kosovo here four weeks ago, it was clear to those who know the facts that nothing tangible in terms of agreements would come out of Rambouillet."
"The fear that Milosevic is above all playing for time has, of course, proved to be well founded."
"The deadline's being put back three times was also only to be expected."
"Milosevic knows our weaknesses, but he does not know how determined we are."
"This is now also true of the hardliners on the Albanian side."
"Despite Rambouillet and despite the agreement reached in October last year between Mr Holbrooke and Milosevic, Serb soldiers have, in the meantime, moved into Kosovo and are creating a gauntlet which has to be run to cross over into Macedonia and Albania."
"There are 4 500 new heavily armed soldiers on the Macedonian border and 1 500 on the Albanian border."
"This warlike activity is frightening the Albanians and of course putting them to flight, and we are standing by and watching, as is our wont."
"We are not doing anything; we are thinking about reconstruction, but I think that first we need to make sure that there are no refugees before we think about reconstruction and go grovelling in Belgrade."
"At the same time, the inglorious Lord Owen - of whom we all still have painful memories from the war in Bosnia - puts in an appearance and makes the abstruse proposal actually to offer Milosevic compensation for Kosovo by separating Republika Srpska from the State of Bosnia, which is recognised under international law, and allowing him to annex it."
"As long as ideas of this kind lurk at the back of the mind of a good many negotiators, Milosevic will succeed in stalling us and keeping the source of the blaze, Kosovo, alight."
"He will continue to drive the Kosovar Albanians out; he is of course experienced in ethnic cleansing."
"And in the end there will simply be fewer Albanians in Kosovo, in whose minority rights no one will really be interested any more, still less in defending them."
"That, then, is my realistic assessment of the situation and those are the reasons for my fears."
"But against my better judgement, I am still hoping for an agreement in Rambouillet and I have done all I can to influence the Albanians."
"Only it must be clear - as Mr Swoboda has already said - that there should be no agreement unless it includes military monitoring!"
"Unless this is the case, any talk of reconstruction is likewise to no avail."
"I wish the negotiating parties, and above all the Europeans, who thank God are also sitting at the negotiating table, success with all my heart, because the implementation of the Dayton Agreement in Bosnia - and it has already been pointed out that this is, unfortunately, like trying to square the circle - would also be made easier if Milosevic were finally to consider his real duties as a Yugoslav politician and abandon his aim of a greater Serbia."
"However, it would be better for everyone in the region, and in particular the Serbs, if Milosevic were at last forced, as indeed he should be, to answer for his war crimes in The Hague."
"Mr President, many people in Europe, not least in my own country, are opposed to the idea of too far-reaching a process of Europeanisation."
"They are made uneasy by the prospect of national self-esteem being replaced by a far stronger sense of European identity."
"The developments in the Balkans show just how wrong they are, and how important it is to ensure that the process of Europeanisation makes rapid progress in every European country, without exception."
"We all possess our own national historical heritage."
"It helps us to retain our sense of identity in an ever-expanding world, whether we be Bavarians or Germans, Gascons or Frenchmen, Smålanders or Swedes."
"In view of this we need a common European identity, based on a recognition of the freedom and equal worth of individuals - values that constitute Europe's most valuable contribution to the world community."
"In our time, no area of Europe has had more ground to cover in this respect than the Balkan countries."
"They still retain the ethos of national self-interest and intolerance which the European countries, thanks to a deeper level of cooperation, have managed to overcome, although the pace has sometimes been slow."
"It is both right and essential that Parliament and the EU as a whole should concentrate their efforts on reaching an agreement that will put an end to the bloodshed in Kosovo and pave the way for a lasting peace."
"As Liberals, we regard Rambouillet and the continuing negotiations as a step along that road."
"There is no call for an international military operation in Kosovo."
"However, our commitment in the Balkans should go considerably further."
"We have to help the people to overcome their petty, narrow-minded nationalism so that each race can see itself in a broader context than as exclusively Orthodox Serb in the case of the Serbs, or Albanian Muslim in the case of the Kosovans."
"When the guns fall silent and the killing stops, then we will have to face the real challenge, namely to spread a sense of being European throughout the Balkan countries, in order to create a society characterised by tolerance and a recognition of the freedom and equal worth of individuals, so that in the future it will be possible for the people of the Balkans to be part of the wider European community."
"Mr President, I should like to make a few comments."
"Firstly, it is our opinion that there can be no military solution to the problem in Kosovo."
"Secondly, because of their unilateral nature, the threats made by NATO, the USA and the European Union are simply helping to reinforce the most extreme elements and are making it more difficult to find a political solution."
"Thirdly, focusing attention on the acceptance of NATO troops by the new Yugoslavia underscores the priorities of NATO, which is pushing for military presence for its own geopolitical aims in the context of the new order of things."
"Fourthly, the solution that is going to be reached, leaving open the question of the independence of Kosovo, threatens to open up a Pandora's box in the Balkan region and to embroil all the countries in that region."
"Finally, is it not perhaps hypocritical for us to speak about the Kosovar Albanians, who indeed need our support, while ignoring the fact that thousands of Kurdish refugees are facing expulsion in Turkey and we say nothing about this?"
"Mr President, naturally the Greens are in favour of an international commitment to achieving a peaceful solution in Kosovo."
"We also support the presence of a peacekeeping force, should one be required, on condition that it complies with international law and has a mandate from the UN."
"However, it is clear that the really vital work will remain to be done once a peace treaty has been signed. In such a situation, a European civil peace corps, like the one decided on by Parliament on the basis of my report, could play a major role."
"There is also a need for a stability pact in the former Yugoslavia and south-east Europe generally."
"I cannot help thinking of my own region, namely the Nordic countries, where during the last 200 years, in the wake of centuries of warfare, we have managed to find satisfactory ways of cooperating without damaging the sovereignty of the individual countries."
"During the past 200 years, some new Scandinavian states have come into existence, and in all probability there will be more in the future, just as has come about in the former Yugoslavia."
"The setting-up of new states need not pose a threat to freedom, provided there are stable and close cooperation procedures in place."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, I cannot help but detect a whiff of Munich in this whole European approach to the Kosovo issue. We continue to refuse to speak of the attackers and the attacked, placing the Kosovar Albanians and Mr Milosevic's regime on the same footing and believing that they must reach a compromise."
"Yet we know very well that it is mainly Belgrade that is blocking progress. We know and must never forget that there have been thousands killed in Kosovo, that there are hundreds of thousands of refugees and that this tragedy was certainly not provoked by the so-called Kosovar extremists, but was planned by Mr Milosevic, as has been established, both politically and legally, in reports."
"We hope that you will succeed in obtaining an agreement and that you will be able to implement it."
"But we also have serious doubts since we know that as long as that man is in Belgrade, there will be no peace for the Kosovars, nor any democracy for the Serbs."
"We will continue to be confronted with the threats of destabilisation, as we saw once again last week in Bosnia."
"Therefore, the structure you are building with so much skill, patience and imagination is a structure that is not founded on any real principle of democracy or the rule of law."
"It is a structure that ultimately simply serves to shore up this tyrant in Belgrade who has massacred in Bosnia and who has massacred in Kosovo, and who will continue to do so because his power rests on massacres, on the negation of democracy and on the negation of the rule of law."
"I have no illusions, but the Council must finally implement a common European policy and confront this problem of democracy in Belgrade and then clearly confront it in Kosovo too."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his statement."
"I have to say, however, that I cannot agree with Mrs Pack's negative view of what has been achieved so far."
"I believe there has been some considerable progress."
"But I recognise the point she is making that, until we get final agreement, we actually have nothing."
"Therefore the events of the next week or so are going to be crucial."
"We must have an agreement."
"I am not as concerned as Mrs Pack and other speakers have been that there has been delay in the agreement."
"What we must try to get out of these negotiations is clearly an agreement that works and will be enforceable."
"The price for that is a few weeks' delay."
"After all that has gone on it is probably a price that is worth paying."
"But we have to keep to our principles here: firstly, we have to keep the contact group together and on board; we have to make sure there is full solidarity between EU Member States - any weakening by any one of the Member States will undermine the push for a final agreement; we have to recognise again that what we are talking about is autonomy for Kosovo while respecting the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
"Also, we have to make it clear that we will not tolerate war crimes and other criminal activities and that we have the clear intention of bringing criminals to book once there is an agreement."
"We are not prepared to let people get away with some of the activities they have got away with in the past."
"We still very much need to push that message home in relation to Bosnia."
"I have to say, in disagreement with at least one speaker, that I do not believe this agreement will work without a military presence."
"We all have to recognise the sensitivity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to having foreign troops in its territory but, nonetheless, it will not work without a military presence."
"But we must not commit a single fighting man until we are sure we have a peace agreement."
"We must not endanger the lives of European or American troops without that agreement."
"Similarly, the European Community must be prepared to spend not a single penny on reconstruction until we are sure we have an agreement."
"When we are clear that we have agreement then we should push very hard to reconstruct Kosovo and, in particular, deal with the question of refugees and displaced persons."
"If we really want peace then the European Union has to be very proactive once there is agreement."
"But we have to have an agreement first."
"Mr President, I should particularly like to say that I fully agree with my friend, Mr Dupuis."
"The real problem is Mr Milosevic, just as the problem in Iraq is Saddam Hussein."
"To make peace, you need two people: to wage war, one is sufficient."
"We should not forget that."
"In our view, that means two things: firstly, we need credibility on our side, and we need to demonstrate our credibility when we talk about democracy."
"In an international context, democracy is nothing other than peoples' right to self-determination, which is something people love to talk about, but which, once they have won a war, they quickly forget."
"This has time and again proved to be a curse for humanity."
"Secondly, we should not labour under any illusions, and here I agree with Mr Titley: without a military presence, there will be no peace here."
"It is absolutely essential."
"It should not be prolonged indefinitely, but it must be there, it must be perceptible, and it must actually ensure that the commitments or promises signed up to are kept. We certainly do not want to shut out the Serbian people;"
"Serbs are also Europeans and some day they too will have a right to belong to Europe, but that can only be the case under a genuinely civilised regime, and not under a totalitarian dictatorship, which is what Milosevic's system is."
"Applause"
"Mr President, the tension over Kosovo has risen in the last few days."
"It has come to be a kind of political cliff-hanger, and in a few days' time we shall see the start of a new phase in the talks process."
"What will be the follow-up to the conclusions of Rambouillet?"
"That is the question which is naturally exercising people's minds both here and elsewhere."
"The international clock is running, and which of the two parties will be the first to accept the Rambouillet conclusions?"
"What steps will be taken against those who do not accept them?"
"These are the most pressing questions at the moment."
"The Kosovo Albanians appear to be close to accepting the conclusions, but Milosevic is still wrestling with the question of his sovereignty."
"Can he agree to having military forces in his Federal Republic?"
"The Serbian presence in Kosovo has intensified, and that too is cause for concern."
"What is Milosevic's aim here?"
"These are questions which will have to be answered in the next few days."
"My hope is simply that the parties will accept the conclusions of Rambouillet."
"They contain the germ of a solution for the longer term, even though no one will be happy with every aspect of them."
"But it will not hurt anyone in the region to learn how to compromise."
"That has always been my group's line in this conflict too."
"Unilateral solutions lead to unilateral consequences, so they are not real solutions."
"But if Rambouillet is step A, then step B has to be an international military presence."
"And that certainly has to be a longer-term military presence."
"How are we to organise that?"
"As a question, that is at least as interesting as the question of when Rambouillet will be concluded."
"What role will the European Union play in that?"
"I think we have to seize the opportunity to debate how the Amsterdam Treaty is to be implemented and how the European Union can play a part in this kind of area in future."
"That will doubtless require unanimity within the EU."
"And I hope unanimity will be maintained in the immediate future, because without it we shall not be able to play a meaningful role here."
"We must also be prepared to enforce the Rambouillet agreement by military force if necessary, if the Serbs persist in rejecting it."
"But ultimately a political solution must of course be preferably to a military one."
"Mr President, we too hope that the Rambouillet accords will be signed and will somehow bring peace to Kosovo."
"Regrettably the first signs do not augur well, not only because of the troops being deployed around Kosovo by the Serbian Government, but also because of an extremely disquieting episode, namely the issuing of a warrant for the arrest of certain KLA representatives, three of whom have been negotiators at Rambouillet."
"Clearly we cannot turn up with mere aspirations, but must have a proper policy demanding that the treaty be signed and not postponed indefinitely."
"I disagree with Mr Titley, who believes that an agreement must be reached, even if it takes time: more time means more deaths and a further deterioration in the situation."
"The deal must therefore be clinched immediately, and it must be a tough one with peace as its goal."
"One question which must be addressed is the need for the members of the contact group to speak with a single voice, and for there to be close cooperation between the European Union and the USA so as to maintain a united front."
"We must not fall out of step, because Milosevic exploits any gaps to pursue his policy of procrastination in an effort to avoid the day of reckoning when harsh conclusions will be reached."
"What is also needed here is a broader view of the Balkan problem."
"The signing of an agreement cannot be the end of the matter: a more general plan is now needed to bring peace throughout the Balkans."
"A conference should be convened to this end, and I believe that the Council, under the German Presidency, could begin working in this direction."
"Mr President, the Rambouillet peace process should be supported for one simple reason."
"We have nothing better!"
"Nevertheless, we are forced to realise that it has not been possible to square the circle."
"Milosevic is still refusing to allow a military intervention force in Kosovo, and the KLA is refusing to disarm and be satisfied with autonomy."
"The Kosovars' weakness, their political fragmentation, is Milosevic's strength."
"You cannot help thinking that both sides have simply used the break in the negotiations to arm themselves for the forthcoming spring offensive."
"The flurry of political activity, on the part of both the European presidency and the United States, has done nothing to change this."
"Once again, as has been the case so often before in the Balkans, this situation is exposing the weaknesses of the so-called international community."
"NATO is, admittedly, still ready to give the order to go into action, but the credibility of the only western military alliance to remain intact has suffered in Kosovo, not only because of the jealousy which keeps on surfacing between the United States and France, but also, and above all, because of the European partners' hesitation to become involved in a cost-intensive military operation which might last for years."
"We can only continue to note this lack of political will with regret, and call on the Europeans finally to make up their minds about what we call the common foreign and security policy!"
"Mr President, I too would like to stress that the basic condition for a just solution to the problem in Kosovo is solidarity among Member States of the European Union."
"I have to say, however, that reaching an agreement comes first and in this I agree with Mr Titley."
"We must reach an agreement which will guarantee the integrity of the borders in the Balkans, a request that has been put forward by all the Balkan countries: Bulgaria, Albania, Greece and Romania."
"At present, this region is full of memories."
"Today in Greece we have French, English, German and Spanish people who are visiting the cemeteries of English, French, German, Bulgarian and Serb people who died in the First World War."
"I would therefore like to stress the need to reach an agreement which, as I said, must guarantee current borders."
"When this agreement has been reached, the armed forces which are currently massing in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will be able to play a more constructive role."
"In European terms, Kosovo is not another Iraq."
"While we welcome the American presence in the region, nevertheless this issue is essentially a European Union issue, which is why we need solidarity among all Member States of the European Union in dealing with it."
"I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The sitting was suspended at 11.55 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon"
"VOTES"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, I would ask that the reports by Mr Sarlis and Mr Swoboda be referred back to committee pursuant to Rule 129."
"These two reports present the European Parliament with a heavy responsibility: promoting the liberalisation of international goods transport by rail."
"The Commission directives, to which these reports refer, contain no more than technical provisions and do not recommend this solution."
"In the Council, the governments of the Member States are divided on this issue."
"Moreover, the railway workers, their unions and the European Trade Union Confederation expressed their opposition to such an approach through a European day of action and strikes, which was widely respected, and during talks with each of the two rapporteurs."
"For all these reasons, I call on Parliament not to go down this road and to refer these two reports back to committee."
"Mr President, I can oppose this both as rapporteur and on my own account."
"I should like to make the following quite clear: firstly, rail freight has been declining for years, as has employment in the sector."
"That is why it is absolutely essential and high time to reform the railways."
"That is the idea behind my own and Mr Sarlis's reports."
"Secondly, it is unfortunate that the Commission rejected some of our points yesterday."
"That is why it is also high time to explain our point of view clearly to the Commission."
"We are not calling for unlimited, broad-brush liberalisation; we are calling for a sensible approach towards giving the railways more of a European dimension."
"We have to achieve this, and that is why I really do ask that we put this to the vote today."
"We have discussed it at length in the committee; Mrs Moreau was the only one to vote against."
"That is why it is important for us to vote today."
"Applause"
"Mr President, I should like to express my support for Mrs Moreau's proposal."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam includes the concept of general interest services."
"In a field such as rail transport, it is clear that this concept must take precedence over a liberalisation of rail transport services."
"Yet today we have no framework directive that defines what a general interest service actually is."
"We believe it is impossible to liberalise this key sector or open it up to competition. Indeed, it is a sector in which, as Mrs Moreau said, workers are very active in defending not just their jobs but also the general interest."
"I believe it is premature to discuss this subject before we have a framework directive on general interest services."
"Like Mrs Moreau, I would also ask that this report be referred back to committee."
"Mr President, first of all I have to say that I am against referral back to committee."
"Today Parliament must vote on both of these reports."
"The majority opinion of all the groups in this House is that the issue of the gradual liberalisation of rail transport must at last move forward."
"I repeat that, at this stage, we are talking about gradual liberalisation only in respect of the transport of goods."
"We have been debating this matter in the European Parliament since January 1998, when we adopted a special resolution in which we said that we wanted to go forward with gradual liberalisation."
"The majority opinion, if not the unanimous opinion, in the Committee on Transport and Tourism led to the findings that we are putting before the House."
"I must also say that since 1970 there has been a Commission directive which calls for partial liberalisation."
"Nothing has been done in the 27 years since then, while we have liberalised sea transport, air transport and road transport."
"We must now move forward and show the Council and the Commission what we can achieve."
"Applause"
"(Parliament decided against referral back to committee)"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mr President, it is a well-known fact that the construction projects relating to the trans-European transport network are virtually at a standstill as a result of a lack of political will, regardless of the many speeches of goodwill and good intentions."
"That is why we are backing the amendment tabled by the rapporteur, who rejects the Commission's suggestion to revise and amend the guidelines by producing new White Papers."
"We simply cannot accept the proposal that only those seaports with an annual goods turnover of at least 1.5 million tonnes can be considered as interconnection points for developing intermodal transport."
"We are voting against this amendment as it will most likely be detrimental to the seaports in my country and elsewhere, condemning them to isolation and cutting them off from funding that would enable them to create intermodal systems and establish satisfactory links with the major transport networks. It would prevent them from developing on an equal footing with the others."
"Proposals to extend those same criteria to seaports in the ultraperipheral regions are doubly unacceptable. They would affect, for example, the seaport of Ponta Delgada in the Azores."
"The implementation of the single market is leading to a constant increase in mobility, especially in the transport of people and goods."
"The needs of sustainable development and the Union's international commitments in this area make it essential to ensure that production of CO2 and other greenhouse gases falls."
"These two factors are leading to the introduction of an integrated trans-European transport network, including an intermodal dimension which is set to develop."
"Given the ever growing traffic jams that are increasingly suffocating our towns, this approach is ultimately likely to generate substantial savings, not only in terms of environmental costs but economic costs too."
"I share your rapporteur's view that it is very prudent of the Commission to propose the inclusion of inland ports and intermodal terminals in addition to sea ports, as they form interconnection and transshipment points within the trans-European combined transport network."
"Moreover, I fully agree that the motorway or road element providing the initial and/or final transport of goods and passengers within the trans-European combined transport network must be as short as possible."
"In the interests of clarity and coherence, I also believe that Parliament should stand by its opinion that Community aid for the trans-European transport network must be allocated to port infrastructures but not extended to include superstructural investments."
"The latter can be eligible for aid under the Cohesion Fund or the Structural Funds."
"I voted for the Piecyk report both for its intrinsic merit in that it clarifies the issue of the intermodal connections within Europe and, in particular, for Amendment No 13 referring to the intermodal links joining Spain and Portugal."
"It seems to me both appropriate and timely to replace Essen project No 8, the Lisbon-Valladolid motorway, with the new definition to be found in this amendment."
"That would provide central and northern Portugal with rail and port infrastructures as well as a complete road network once extensions have been made to the IP5 highway, which is scheduled for rapid conversion into a motorway, as planned in the annex."
"The objective of this report is to clarify the situation of sea ports, inland ports and airports in the overall framework of the workings of trans-European transport networks."
"For the internal market to operate efficiently and to ensure that all regions within the EU can compete on a competitive basis then the completion of the trans-European transport network must be made a priority for all national EU governments."
"However, it is clear that European Community financing does not meet the requirements and challenges to complete trans-European transport networks despite the beneficial effect that such investments have in developing local and national economies."
"It is clear that the development of such networks will create a higher number of jobs as well as put in place infrastructural projects which could improve the economic competitiveness and productivity of particular regional economies."
"The European Commission commissioned a report on the issue of whether public/private sector partnerships should be given a role in the development of trans-European transport network projects within the European Union as envisaged by the Maastricht Treaty."
"This report concluded that public/private partnerships would be an integral part of such developments."
"The European Commission has now, quite rightly, invited Member States to identify specific projects which will be suitable for the public/private partnership approach."
"Member States are invited to involve the private sector as soon as possible in the development of such infrastructural projects."
"From an Irish perspective, I welcome on a broader level the initiative of the Irish Government which has sought to give private firms the opportunity to fund major public projects under the partnership approach within the workings of the Irish economy."
"We must be realistic about the state of play of European Structural Fund receipts for Ireland after the conclusion of the next Community Support Framework."
"In the year 2006, Ireland will be receiving only 20 % of its present allocation of EU structural funds."
"The Irish Government must be innovative and proactive in devising new ways of compensating for the reduction of EU regional and cohesion fund monies."
"I welcome the opportunity given to the private sector to have a tangible role in addressing how best public project initiatives and programmes which have previously been funded by EU monies can, in the future, be funded by the private sector."
"Commission Neil Kinnock has already noted the role that the private sector can play in the transport sector."
"Representatives of Irish and European businesses from the economic and social sectors which will be receiving a shortfall in EU structural funds should take the opportunities being afforded to them to see how best they can enter into partnership with the state for the development of their respective regions."
"The situation in France is serious: our ports are less and less competitive, shipyards are closing and there are fewer and fewer seafarers."
"The report by my colleague Mr Piecyk forgets that a port can only exist as part of an overall maritime chain, that is, repair, construction and trade itself."
"Yet these three activities have been progressively separated to each die a slow death."
"A good example of this is the independent port of Le Havre."
"This is a jewel among French shipyards."
"It was where some of the greatest ships were built, such as the 'France' and the 'Club Med 2' - a superb cruise ship with five masts, 134 metres long, with sails measuring 2 000 m2 , and steered by computer - as well as oceanographic vessels, cable ships, ferries and, above all, liners."
"But now that is all over."
"Already dealt a blow in 1979 by the sale of the liner 'France', the town, with its 30 years of communist management and CGT co-management, has just lost its port which will be shutting down in two years' time."
"On 9 November, the European Commission deemed illegal the FRF 1.8 thousand million in aid granted by the French Government to Le Havre's workshops and shipyards, demanding that it be returned in accordance with the rules of competition."
"Anybody taking over the port would therefore have to pay this back. As you can imagine, there have been no takers."
"After having destroyed our agriculture and our farmers, our public services, our textile industry, our mines and coal industry, as well as our merchant navy, Brussels has now turned to our ports and our shipbuilding industries."
"Brussels is refusing to adopt a policy of European preference in the building and repair of ships flying a national flag."
"Brussels is banning all state aid and subsidies aimed at bailing out companies. Brussels is forcing any company that takes over a firm that has received aid to pay back all the public funds received."
"Brussels is opening up our ports and shipyards to competition from those with cheaper labour costs."
"Enough is enough; there is no doubt that this sector is going to die a slow and painful death."
"We refuse to accept this."
"That is why the National Front proposes a fundamental reform of the sector, a reform of the tax system for shipowners and investments in port infrastructures."
"We must encourage maritime investment, either through direct aid or fiscal measures."
"We must protect the industrial know-how of our highly skilled workers and re-introduce Community preference for the use, construction and repair of boats flying a national flag - as the United States did long ago - while penalising by means of compensatory taxes those vessels that fail to respect these preferential measures."
"With its moves towards free trade and deregulation, Brussels is trying to drown our seafarers, eliminate our workers and sink our ports."
"We must resist such measures."
"Mr President, we have just voted against a European Parliament report on the liberalisation of the railways, an issue which, judging by what has happened in the UK, could have serious social and economic consequences for the European rail sector."
"For the time being the report deals with the liberalisation of international goods transport, but there is no doubt that the aim is also to liberalise passenger transport, both domestic and international."
"It opens up the possibility for any entity, person or group, not necessarily with previous experience of or links with the rail sector, to gain access to a business, regardless of their national origin and the Member State in which they are applying."
"That business would enable them to use infrastructures built with state money and gain access to profitable parts of the rail network, while maintenance costs - in other words, the unprofitable aspect - would generally remain in state hands."
"Instead of investing in improving the quality of public services in the various countries, linking up regions nationally and internationally - a vital task up to now and one that should continue - instead of accepting the need to modernise and rationalise the management of the railways in general in order to serve communities, instead of considering the very positive experience we have had of cooperation between public services, instead of improving the conditions of competition with other forms of transport, we are opting for unacceptable liberalisation, the consequences of which can only harm the sector as a whole."
"To complement the judicial process of removing frontiers and allowing the free movement of people and goods, in January 1998 we adopted the Commission's White Paper on rail transport in the European Union."
"A number of key ideas were set out in the document."
"The important thing at that time was to implement an ambitious and quality programme for national rail companies which were often in debt."
"A year later, we are calling for the same thing: liberalisation of Europe's railways for international freight transport, then progressively for national goods transport and for international passengers."
"The gradual extension we are calling for is getting off to a very timid start."
"Revitalisation is more necessary now than ever before and the only way to achieve it is by extending the laws of the free market to this vital area of the economy."
"Our networks are finding it very difficult to move to a European scale."
"The interconnection of existing networks poses both material and legal problems."
"The grand axes are not being extended and free access to rail infrastructures is not always fully applied in practice."
"Our national rail companies - together with our respective governments - are finding it very difficult to distinguish between managing transport infrastructures and operating railways."
"We therefore still need to plan new measures and to define additional approaches to complement the existing provisions."
"The ones I see as most necessary are flexible management that is better adapted to customers and open competition in a free market."
"I therefore approve this new Sarlis report because I do not believe that roads should be the only modern and competitive infrastructures."
"Rail has a fundamental role to play, especially on the eve of enlargement."
"After the White Paper entitled 'A strategy for revitalising the Community's railways', the European Commission is now proposing an 'infrastructure' package, that is, a package allowing us to modify existing directives."
"What is its aim?"
"Essentially, it is designed to divide up the railway market and thereby speed up the move towards the liberalisation of goods transport."
"We cannot accept this under the present circumstances."
"Why seek at any price to redefine Directive 91/440 without even agreeing to first assess it?"
"Between 1985 and 1995, 500 000 jobs were lost in this sector."
"How can we possibly believe that the Commission's proposal to liberalise the market will provide an effective solution for the railway sector?"
"We are not fierce opponents of the concept of liberalisation when it is well measured and well considered."
"But in this case it is a matter of advocating blind competition, of opening up the lines to organisations other than the railway companies."
"And what about passenger safety?"
"What are going to be the respective responsibilities of these newcomers and the railway companies?"
"The rail sector needs new impetus and we must encourage what is already taking place, namely, cooperation between national networks."
"With the help of the reports submitted for our scrutiny, the Commission is giving a free hand to the implosion of this sector, and that is something we cannot accept."
"Yesterday's debates on the liberalisation of the railways were particularly important."
"While not denying the solid work done by Pavlos Sarlis and Hannes Swoboda, I strongly oppose the Commission's desire to impose a uniform liberal system on the railway sector."
"It is not for us to question the forced march of the British towards the complete deregulation of their rail network, but the experience has clearly been a failure, from the point of view of both the consumers and the operators."
"For the former, this privatisation has not led to the improvements previously heralded."
"For the latter, the initial birth of several operators is now giving way to the reconcentration of the sector in the hands of a single company."
"Although I accept that certain services cannot be run by the public sector alone, I believe that in the case of rail transport, only the public sector can absorb the costs of this operation which directly affects large numbers of people, falls within the scope of town and country planning and has many consequences for the environment."
"When it comes to freight transport and the transport of certain sensitive goods in particular, the public sector is best placed to guarantee safety due to its status and its ethics."
"Finally, the proposals submitted to us, which threaten to dismantle the very nature of universal service, forget two things."
"The first is that the government will have to bear the cost of infrastructure investments, which means that it is the tax-payer who will initially pay."
"The second is that if the operator is going to be able to satisfy its shareholders, it is going to have to make a profit."
"We are therefore deluding ourselves if we believe that the consumer will see any reduction in fares."
"On the contrary, he will often pay more as a result of higher fares."
"These arguments may perhaps cause some people to smile."
"But I believe that they cannot simply be brushed aside."
"I shall therefore vote against these two reports and would call on the Commission to put forward new proposals that are more realistic."
"There must be no more cursory deregulation."
"As it seeks to increase the share of the railway sector in the transport of goods and persons, the liberalisation of rail transport naturally relates to sustainable development and respect for the European Union's international commitments in terms of environmental protection."
"As our rapporteur pointed out, the European Parliament's wish, as expressed in its resolution of 13 January 1998, is indeed to achieve the widest possible liberalisation of rail transport, even if this should take place in successive stages."
"It is therefore very unfortunate that the Commission is making no proposals to this effect."
"The liberalisation of rail transport principally rests on two pillars, which must be acted on as quickly as possible."
"The first is the need to institutionally separate the business of operating rail services from that of maintaining railway infrastructures."
"The second is the need to open up access to national networks under fair conditions and to grant the right of transit to new operators in order to allow them to face their competitors on an equal footing."
"In this respect, our rapporteur's amendments go in the right direction and are perfectly in keeping with the route outlined by Parliament."
"Liberalisation must not of course result in reduced safety for railway users."
"On the contrary, the very highest levels of passenger safety must be achieved."
"It is therefore essential - and on this point I totally agree with the rapporteur - that those who manage the rail infrastructures take responsibility for operating and supervising the safety systems."
"The challenges linked to developing the single market for rail transport warrant an in-depth analysis."
"Today's debate is therefore very welcome."
"There is indeed a very real need to revitalise rail transport in Europe, and goods transport in particular."
"Among other things, rail transport can reduce the nuisance caused by road transport."
"But ideology - I would not go so far as to say dogmatism or excess - must not result in a total disruption of the rail sector."
"I am thinking in particular of the desire for liberalisation, as proposed or sought by the Commission."
"I am aware of the extent to which the Commission is committed to the virtues of competition."
"But in this instance, excessive development of intermodal competition would most certainly prove damaging to the rail sector as a whole."
"That does not mean that nothing should be done, that the status quo is a solution."
"On the contrary, we should prepare the rail sector to face its own future."
"That is why the market may be opened up, but progressively and between equals who must bear the same responsibilities."
"The provisions relating to authorised candidates, which provide simple intermediaries with the power to reserve capacities, are a threat to the railways."
"They actually introduce discrimination between the players: rail undertakings would continue to bear investment costs, and often the debts of the past, while being relegated to the role of a sub-contractor vis-à-vis these new intermediaries, which would be free to select the most profitable market segments."
"If the Member States want to allow companies other than rail undertakings to reserve rail capacities, then let them do so by means of their national legislation."
"They do not need the authorisation of a directive."
"I would like to end by reminding you that rail undertakings are not just commercial companies. They also fulfil a public service role and play an important part in town and country planning."
"Everyone today agrees that for transporting people and goods over short and medium distances, the railway is an instrument of the future more than ever before."
"That is why it must be developed, modernised and adapted commercially to stand up to the fierce competition from the road network."
"The decline of railways over recent years, and goods transport in particular, is very evident."
"Faced with this situation, European policy has been to liberalise the railways."
"Since the early 1990s, a whole series of first generation directives have contributed to this."
"Some of these have yet to be fully transposed into the legislation of all the Member States."
"Before moving any further in this direction we must therefore take stock of the present situation and assess the effectiveness of the decisions taken to liberalise and internally reorganise public services."
"Yet the Commission is already seeking to take liberalisation even further and to totally open up goods transport by rail to competition, when liberalisation has to date been limited to combined transport."
"The Commission believes that logistics companies should also have access to railway infrastructures."
"Railways must clearly be made more competitive in comparison to roads."
"Their very survival depends on this."
"However, to totally open up the railways to competition risks dismantling the public service, not to mention the fact that the system established by the directives to allocate rail infrastructure capacities is both costly and bureaucratic."
"Those in charge must be independent of the railway company, and there must be a supervisory body to control all elements."
"I therefore share the opinion of Mr Wibe, the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, when he states that 'The cost of increased administrative burden in the Member States could easily outweigh the benefits in terms of increased efficiency'."
"It is for this reason that I am voting against the Sarlis and Swoboda reports."
"We would like to express our satisfaction today with the two texts proposed by the Committee on Transport and Tourism concerning the 1991 directive on the development of the railways and the 1995 directives on the licensing of railway undertakings, and the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the charging of infrastructure fees."
"The two rapporteurs should be congratulated on their excellent work."
"These directives are a step in the right direction."
"After having liberalised air transport and the gas and electricity market, the European Union could not ignore the railways for much longer."
"Rail transport, which is very frequently used in Europe, has been experiencing a serious crisis for some years."
"After having tried planned methods - nationalisation of railway undertakings, public status for employees, inflexibility within the market, significant deficits, and so on - which proved catastrophic in the Member States as a whole, the only way to now revitalise the railways is through liberalisation and a return to the market realities."
"In this respect, some Member States have been able to react quicker than others and we must draw inspiration from the successful experiences in each of the Union's Member States."
"Europe's consumers are demanding when it comes to both safety and also quality, particularly in terms of delays, prices, services, and so on."
"Over recent years they have tended to move away from this form of transport."
"Today we must give rail the means to regain a potentially large customer base."
"This liberalisation must naturally be progressive and take place in stages, as our two rapporteurs have indicated."
"The railways are a form of transport for the future for passengers and goods. But there is more to it than that."
"Rail transport makes a major contribution to town and country planning and plays a very important role in rural and isolated regions, for example."
"Moreover, in the fight against air pollution, rail - and the combined transport of goods in particular - is a political choice that we have always defended."
"I am opposed to opening up rail transport to competition and to the deregulation proposed by the Commission and the Council."
"The Amsterdam Treaty refers to general interest services but there is in fact no directive that defines its framework or guarantees the logic of public service, namely, equal access by people and territories to rail transport infrastructures and services on the one hand, and the adjustment of costs that guarantees the right to transport and movement on the other."
"In the absence of such a framework, liberalisation is dangerous even if it is gradual."
"It will increase the inequalities between the regions and the people of Europe, dismantle public services and, in most cases, be accompanied by a deterioration of social conditions for the workers in question."
"Europe's trade unions representing the rail transport sector were right to express their opposition to this plan."
"Unfortunately, the areas that have already been liberalised have experienced a deterioration in the service to users, particularly the more modest of them."
"I will be voting against the Sarlis and Swoboda reports and the related proposals for a directive."
"Some liberalisation of the rail sector has already taken place, but without any proper evaluation exercise having been carried out."
"Nevertheless, we know that in many cases the experience has not been especially encouraging."
"Before any further steps are taken, the long-term implications of directives that are now in force and the effects they have produced must be considered."
"Without questioning the philosophy of free enterprise in the use of rail infrastructures, we have to be realistic and realise that while agreeing in principle, it is vital to have attractive conditions for the exploitation of those services."
"That being so, the sine qua non for those attractive conditions to exist must be modern infrastructures, and these can hardly be expected to exist in a country like mine where, for decades, nobody believed in trains and road transport won a huge advantage."
"The railways have to be seen as a means of transport that is closely linked to others, since that is the only way to guarantee users satisfactory services and to ensure that all means of transport achieve maximum profitability."
"For example, to take an issue in the news at the moment, it is inconceivable that a new airport is being built that will not be served directly by a major rail link, thus, incredibly, making access for over 10 million passengers a year possible only by road."
"But what is at stake here is not only the existence of railway lines, however modern. It is equally vital to have a regular rail service, one that can only be provided by intercity rail links linking conurbations that have several million inhabitants."
"Otherwise, in the case of a thinly populated hinterland near an airport, we inevitably fall into the vicious circle of laying on fewer trains because of the lack of demand (only or nearly only airport users), which then puts people off using the trains because they are so infrequent (after all, nobody wants to wait an hour for a train after a one and a half hour flight)."
"The three reports being put to the vote this week in the plenary should make it possible for the railways to enter the next millennium as a popular and successful means of transport."
"The railways are an environmentally friendly transport system for goods and passengers which have a promising future, but whose potential is not being exploited adequately at present."
"For it to be possible to take full advantage of this potential in the short term, far-reaching reforms need to be set in motion today."
"There is no avoiding partial liberalisation in the railway sector."
"Firstly, however, liberalisation is not the same as privatisation and, secondly, this partial liberalisation will be introduced progressively and with due consideration of the social aspects."
"In this way, the ground will be prepared for developing the railways into an efficient and reliable mode of transport for the future - not least in Luxembourg, in the centre of Europe."
"The European People's Party and its Luxembourg members will ensure that this process of liberalisation in the railway sector is not half-hearted, but balanced and objective-driven."
"Make no mistake: this is about the survival of the railways."
"Action is needed now."
"We have discussed three proposals for moving towards a liberalised rail system."
"Although I too believe that going back to the railway policies of the past is no longer an option, as a politician and trade unionist the various strategies for moving towards greater liberalisation fill me with fear for the future."
"After all, the heritage of a hundred years is being broken into pieces here, and we do need to ask ourselves whether the Commission's policy - which always sees the liberalisation of the national and international economy as the only answer - is the right one, because where this policy leads is best illustrated by the example of a country with a highly developed rail system, such as Germany."
"There is simply no end to the series of train accidents there; this shows that making savings in the wrong place can be rather expensive and, even worse, that the staffing cuts which the railway companies have been forced to make are being made at the expense of safety."
"Although Luxembourg was one of the countries which had the most to lose from a decline in rail traffic, it has held on to its railways, modernised them and downsized, in the only operation of its kind in Europe, and yet at the same time care was taken to ensure that no social hardship was suffered."
"And is all of this now supposed to have been in vain?"
"We are right to ask why directives such as Directive 91/440, which has not even been transposed in all the countries yet, should now be hastily amended and whipped through Parliament and the Council of Ministers, and why they have not been given a longer trial."
"In general, it seems to me that the Commission has once again been too perfectionist."
"What is the point of having separate accounts for freight and passenger transport?"
"Instead of simplifying matters, this is once again increasing bureaucracy."
"It is true that there are proposals on the independent management of railway undertakings, on debt remission and the improved management of public finances, but at the same time the governments are reminded of their duty to guarantee access rights to international groupings for international rail transport."
"On top of this, even at this early stage when the discussions have not even been concluded, the Commission is also being asked to take action on route pricing."
"Does that mean that in the not too distant future, prices on routes through Luxembourg are to be calculated on the basis of the cheapest supplier?"
"If so, then some interesting pay negotiations are in store for the unions."
"At present, the impact of the new measures seems impossible to assess."
"But a desire to ensure optimal infrastructure use is not, on its own, sufficient to yield improvements."
"The best example of this are the 'freeways', which were announced with great ceremony."
"Large maps were unveiled showing 25 of these lines, only seven of which are in operation, however."
"And that too is only because the smallest railway company, the Luxembourg one, brought all its diplomatic skill to bear in the 'bureau unique '."
"The various railway companies have proved here by their exemplary cooperation that they can achieve something across borders."
"Whether the Commission's interfering in this way will improve matters, I have my doubts."
"In any case, I do welcome the fact that the majority of the European Parliament has spoken out in favour of a more moderate approach and is proposing that the new directives should be introduced progressively - and this in spite of the Commission's negative stance."
"I shall therefore be voting against the Sarlis and Swoboda reports."
"With its new proposals the Commission is delivering a coup de grace to public railway undertakings, while insisting on pushing forward with liberalisation, to the advantage of private interests and to the detriment of transport safety, public service and the rights of transport sector workers."
"These proposals retain the basic philosophy which underlies the liberalisation process and which is characterised by the separation of the provision and maintenance of infrastructure on the one hand and the provision of rail transport services on the other."
"In other words, public budgets are being asked to continue to bear the burden of infrastructure funding, while private railway undertakings are exploiting the capacity of the rail networks."
"The Commission, however, does not stop at that. It has decided that infrastructure managers who will operate along private lines may also be private undertakings, in the context, of course, of the more general move towards privatisation of infrastructure by means of the funding and exploitation of infrastructure by private capital."
"However, there are no safeguards for rail sector workers."
"On the contrary, large-scale redundancies are being forecast and a regime of total flexibility in relation to the number and working conditions of rail sector workers is being promoted."
"The reports under debate go much further than the Commission proposals. They call for the liberalisation of international passenger and freight transport both within Member States and internationally."
"Neither the reports nor the package of proposals put forward by the Commission make any reference to the impact these measures will have on rail sector workers."
"The easier access private undertakings will have to infrastructure is preparing the ground for the privatisation of the profitable activities of public railway undertakings and the overhaul of labour relations."
"Furthermore, the bill that went through the Greek Parliament recently, which aims to bring Greek legislation into line with Community directives, is moving in the same direction and provides for the axing of thousands of jobs over the coming years."
"The liberalisation of rail transport that is being put forward will not lead to the revitalisation of the railways, as has been hypocritically claimed, but it does jeopardise the notion of public service."
"Against this background we can look forward to further increased charges. As one of the rapporteurs put it, 'the main reason why there are so few companies competing in railway operation is (...) that the profitability in railway operation is too low'."
"Closing down unprofitable lines necessarily entails reducing rail networks, to the detriment of regional growth and the environment."
"The repercussions we are already seeing in the other transport sectors that have undergone a process of liberalisation, our concerns for the fate of the public service, for the protection of the environment and regional growth, our diametric opposition to the practices of social dumping and to the policies aimed at overhauling labour relations, lead us to vote against these reports."
"We are calling for a policy in the rail sector to support public undertakings and the development of the network so that it can meet the needs of the national economy, of rail users and of rail sector workers."
"We are calling on the Commission to withdraw its proposals and we are calling on the governments of the Member States to reject these proposals in Council."
"We hope that rail sector workers will make a concerted effort to overturn this unpopular policy, which promotes the profit-making management of the railway to the detriment of transport safety and the rights of rail sector workers and rail users."
"Development of the rail sector and greater cooperation are both desirable and necessary, particularly from an environmental point of view."
"The ever-increasing volume of traffic on our roads brings with it an increase in the number of road traffic accidents and the human tragedies that ensue."
"However, the Commission's proposals do not provide a solution to the problem. On the one hand, they represent further liberalisation and increased competition within the rail sector and, on the other, vice-like control and detailed regulation."
"In my view, it is absurd for decisions on changes to train schedules, the drawing-up of discount schemes, reservation charges and so on to be taken at EU level."
"The railways play a tremendously important role in large and sparsely populated countries such as Sweden."
"For obvious reasons, certain sections of the railway network have never been profitable, but it is still essential for the traffic on them to be maintained if the main objective is to ensure that the whole country 'lives'."
"The future of the rail sector must therefore be discussed thoroughly in the Member States themselves before any further directives are adopted at EU level."
"In view of the fact that transport networks cross borders, there is a need for cooperation in the framing of transport policy, which also includes rail transport."
"However, this report is far too detailed, particularly when it descends to the level of timetables."
"I have therefore voted against paragraph 21 in the report."
"Mr President, the Tamino report is extremely important in that it describes how the increased use of electrical appliances, computers and cellular phones has led to the presence of more sources of microwaves and electromagnetic fields in the environment."
"How radiation from these appliances affects people's health in the short and long term is something we know very little about."
"One might say that we are guinea pigs in our own development."
"Nevertheless, we suspect that radiation can cause cancer, changes in the workings of the nervous and immune systems, cell activity and so on."
"The conclusions reached by the Commission and the committee of experts are clearly at odds with a large number of scientific publications, which have been ignored in the Commission's proposal."
"In its recommendation to the Member States, the Commission states that there is no convincing evidence to suggest that extremely low-level magnetic fields cause genetic damage and that they are therefore unlikely to lead to the onset of cancer."
"In fact, it is not possible to make such an assertion when no one really knows the answers, and when there are others who take a different view."
"In this case, the precautionary principle must be applied."
"According to the World Health Organisation, it is not possible to guarantee that electromagnetic fields do not cause harm, and people are becoming increasingly concerned."
"Italy, Luxembourg and Sweden all have stricter provisions than those proposed by the Commission."
"We should be following this path too, until our knowledge is more complete."
"Therefore, the precautionary principle must be applied."
"We should lay down minimum safety distances from housing and workplaces for the siting of structures which generate electromagnetic fields."
"I sincerely regret that we have not adopted all the amendments tabled by the Greens as well as by Mr Tamino, in particular those relating to safeguards and quality criteria for the long-term effects of electromagnetic radiation."
"The Commission's recommendation for limiting the exposure of the public to electromagnetic fields is concerned with avoiding recognised acute effects of using such things as telephone equipment and electronic equipment, and the acute effect of the growing number of high-voltage transmission lines in residential areas."
"Generally speaking, the June Movement is a great supporter of applying the precautionary principle."
"However, we also think that the application of the precautionary principle should be critically assessed case by case."
"And in this case, we have come to the conclusion that the European Parliament should resist the desire for very restrictive recommendations in this area."
"In his work on the report, Mr Tamino wanted to take into account the possible long-term effects of magnetic fields."
"This topic has attracted the interest of the general public for many years and has been the subject of intense research over the past 20 years."
"However, it has not been scientifically proven that there are health effects, such as the development of cancer, in the long term."
"At the moment, large-scale research projects are being carried out to assess the significance of electromagnetic fields in the development of cancers, for example."
"We therefore believe that it is inappropriate to react to isolated studies, and that the EU should wait for the imminent completion of the WHO's major evaluation project, amongst others, before embarking on legislation dealing with possible long-term effects."
"Research in this area, such as that carried out by the Anti-Cancer Association in Denmark, is very extensive, and on the basis of the results of this research, we unfortunately cannot support Mr Tamino's very restrictive amendments."
"If the research results expected soon from the WHO and others provide supporting evidence, we would of course be glad to assist in legislation to protect people against possible long-term effects."
"But until then, we will stand by the advice we have received from the Anti-Cancer Association."
"Nobody in this House can reasonably dispute the fact that the health of our populations and the protection of consumers and the environment are major concerns which must guide our thoughts and our actions."
"Nor can anyone claim that our societies could do without electrical energy and the electromagnetic fields it creates without suffering catastrophic results."
"Our task is therefore to ensure that its use is nevertheless accompanied by the harmonising and preventive measures needed to protect our populations."
"It is therefore essential that our decisions be accompanied by all the necessary scientific precautions."
"I therefore share the views of our rapporteur."
"Protection measures must be regularly updated and reassessed in the light of the increase in our scientific knowledge and the patterns of usage of energy transport systems and types of device likely to increase the exposure of consumers and the population to electromagnetic fields. This is not to impede technological progress, but to optimise the benefits by constantly reducing the risks."
"Given the current absence of a single Europe-wide system for measuring the conformity of devices and the need to introduce a uniform control system which is not an obstacle to the single market, it is wise to call on the Commission to propose in the very near future a system to continuously review devices that generate magnetic fields which takes account of their relative intensity and the actual length of time they are used."
"I will therefore support the proposal for a recommendation, as amended."
"We voted in favour of the Tamino report on restricting exposure to electromagnetic fields, both because we agree with what it says and because we wish to highlight the importance of laying down rules that will not result in Sweden having to make its own rules any less exacting."
"The Commission's proposal gives rise to such a possibility, since it contains less stringent rules than those currently in force in Sweden;"
"Italy and Luxembourg are in the same situation."
"We should also like to say that we are most surprised that the Swedish Government, in the Council of Ministers, according to the minutes of 5 February, did not support Italy's demand for a tightening-up of the rules relating to both the short-term thermal effects and the long-term risks, for example of cancer, which largely corresponds with the Tamino report."
"On the contrary, it seems that Sweden, in some instances, recommended a watering-down of the Commission's text."
"We find this remarkable in the extreme."
"The report is extremely important from an environmental point of view, but it also contains a great deal of detail."
"Nevertheless, I think that the environmental aspects should prevail, and I have therefore voted in favour of the report."
"Mr President, the Amsterdam Treaty sets new standards for health policy in Europe."
"The Commission has provided us with information on this."
"Some aspects of the approach adopted in the Needle report are good, but in other places it oversteps the mark."
"The fact that there are unsuccessful health policies in some Member States is no reason for shifting the responsibility to European level."
"That is why I have voted against the Needle report."
"We must use the little money we have in Europe for specific projects, and not distribute it here, there and everywhere."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam will reform many previously traditional procedures and, above all, in accordance with the new Article 152, it should make it easier to achieve a level of convergence in the health sector."
"Community public health policy needs to be somewhat adapted in line with new priorities and new structures."
"The serious 'mad cow' crisis unfortunately brought home to us the importance of improving the information distributed when it comes to promoting public health."
"Collecting data on the health of the people of Europe is more useful today than it has ever been before."
"Disseminating the subsequent analyses has become essential, not only for the general public but also for the professionals who need to make changes to their national health systems."
"On that basis, we can promote and consolidate the activities of the Member States in the various fields and disseminate information on the best practices."
"But it is not enough to merely provide information."
"We must also react quicker to health threats."
"Speed is a crucial factor in medicine and one which requires increased monitoring and the introduction of new forms of coordination within the Community."
"This would involve many fields: rare diseases, food safety, blood safety, ecological threats, the side effects of medicinal products, etcetera."
"We could also give more consideration to the unique medical situations in each of the Member States and implement appropriate policies, particularly for problems such as drug addiction, cardio-vascular diseases, nutritional problems, and so on."
"I therefore approve the Needle report due to the way in which it has been able to turn to good account the beneficial effects of the Maastricht Treaty in the crucial field of public health."
"Health protection is a fundamental right recognised in the European Social Charter (Article 11) and an objective enshrined in the Treaty (Article 3)."
"Community action is therefore justified, in so far as cross-border aspects are concerned."
"Just as water or air pollution has consequences which are not confined to one Member State or another, similarly viruses, bacteria, microbes and other pathogens are not discouraged by national borders."
"Just as environmental policy has a cross-border dimension, public health policy has a European dimension."
"The need then is to distinguish clearly between what should and what should not be covered by Community action."
"The relevant articles here are Article 52 (formerly 129) on public health and Article 5 (formerly 39(b)) - plus a protocol and two declarations - on subsidiarity and proportionality."
"Both talk of complementary Community action consisting on the one hand of policy measures and on the other hand of cooperation by Member States and with third countries or international organisations."
"But Member States must fully discharge their 'responsibilities... for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care'."
"This means that the role of public health systems and the provision of medical services as such is not a European responsibility."
"When the rapporteur calls in paragraph 6 for 'a prime objective of Community action to be focused on fostering equality in health', he is overstepping the boundaries not only of subsidiarity, but also the letter and spirit of the Treaty."
"Firstly, there is no legal basis for that kind of measure. Secondly, 'equality in health' is not a Treaty objective."
"The Treaty speaks of 'ensuring a high level of health protection'."
"The Treaty also says that Community action must be directed towards the improvement of public health and the prevention of human diseases, in particular the major health scourges."
"So the stated aim is not maximum equality in public health, but as high a level of human health protection as is possible."
"And that kind of aspiration is dangerous, because equality is attained not only by raising poor standards but also by lowering good ones."
"I would therefore urge the rapporteur to withdraw the first part of paragraph 6 in order to avoid a split vote on this demand, which is meaningless in terms of the Treaty."
"Of course, it could be said that a subsequent Treaty revision may address a problem of this kind."
"But we are not talking today about a mandate for an intergovernmental conference."
"The Commission says after all that its communication contains no new proposals for a new Community policy on public health."
"In the communication it notes 'disturbing inequalities in health status between social classes', but makes no suggestions at all for remedying that state of affairs."
"Understandably so, since the Commission does not have a leg to stand on - legally or politically - when it comes to preventing and combating social inequality in European health."
"We must not be reactionary."
"The Maastricht Treaty includes a separate title on public health, and the Court of Justice, with the Decker and Kohll judgments, has ruled on the Community dimension of certain social security services."
"So there is some leverage in favour of a European health policy."
"But we must not go too far and outrun or circumvent the Treaty."
"Rather than making plans for an intergovernmental conference even before the Amsterdam Treaty has been ratified, we must first of all apply that Treaty in such a way that the European citizen above all benefits by it."
"It is his taxes which are being spent, and it is his health which is at issue here."
"People expect cross-border health hazards to be tackled effectively, and therefore at European level."
"Cross-border health hazards have increased considerably as a result of trade and mobility - both recreational and occupational."
"Food and food poisoning come from factors not only at home but also abroad."
"Thus BSE, salmonella, antibiotics and hormones threaten to invade our food and our bodies too."
"Health protection is therefore unquestionably an issue of consumer policy as well. And consumer policy, like public health, is a title in the Treaty."
"The Maastricht Treaty laid the basis for a European contribution to consumer and health protection."
"The Amsterdam Treaty has broadened and adapted that basis."
"So for the most part, we must make do with what we have."
"An effective health policy cannot reasonably be envisaged without taking a look at all the other policies implemented by the European Union and the Member States."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam is therefore right in stating that a high level of health protection must be guaranteed when defining and implementing all the Community's policies and actions that are likely to affect health, and in subsequently defining the role of the Member States in organising and supplying health services and medical care."
"This issue is so important that it may even be appropriate to set up a directorate-general specifically responsible for managing the various aspects of public health policy, including questions relating to resources and health expertise."
"It is also an area in which the principle of subsidiarity must be fully applied."
"There is therefore no question of the Union replacing the Member States in the field of health."
"Its role must be to support and complement the action of the Member States."
"That is why I am also of the opinion that in addition to the search for greater consistency with socio-economic policies and programmes, Community action in the field of health must also make it a priority to actively promote real equality between people in terms of free movement."
"To achieve this objective it will be necessary to combat inequalities and fight for equal access to health care for all. We will also have to increase the scope for health professionals to improve their knowledge and practical skills, perhaps even by creating priority health areas."
"In addition, we must provide the population with better information on the inherent risks of their lifestyle and diet, while actively preventing the causes of illnesses."
"With regard to public health, according to Article 152 of the Treaty, Community action should 'complement national policies'."
"There clearly seems to be a danger that, in setting its sights so high, the Community believes that it should take over the Member States' responsibility, instead of merely complementing it."
"A telling example of this is to be found in the proposal to appoint a Commissioner and establish a directorate-general with responsibility for health, which would encompass all aspects of public health policy."
"It should be made abundantly clear that overall responsibility for people's health, including the political and economic aspects, rests with the various Member States."
"The European Union should perform a complementary role and not try to usurp the Member States' responsibility."
"In general terms, social policy should be a national responsibility."
"However, health is often an aspect of both social and environmental issues."
"This makes it hard to distinguish clearly between what constitutes a national question and what should be decided at European level."
"I support the report in so far as it sets out to improve public health."
"Cooperation between the Member States, and indeed worldwide, needs to be strengthened in order to improve the health of men, women and children."
"Nevertheless, the relevant legislation and its implementation should in the first instance be dealt with at national level."
"Minimum standards of care can be a way of resolving questions where a clear-cut decision is difficult, but those countries with higher standards should be allowed to keep them."
"The sitting was suspended at 12.50 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m."
"EU Mediterranean policy"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0042/99 by Mr Colajanni, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the Commission communication: 'The role of the European Union in the peace process and its future assistance to the Middle East' (COM(97)0715 - C4-0114/98); -A4-0095/99 by Mr Sakellariou, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a recommendation to the Council on the European Union's Mediterranean policy."
"Mr President, this House, which has always followed events in the Middle East with attention, dedication and passion, does not need to be told how critical the present situation is, not just because the peace process has been on hold for 18 months and because the painstakingly achieved Wye Plantation agreement has not been implemented, but also because of the continued building of new settlements and the non-completion of the corridor which is supposed to link the West Bank to Gaza, not to mention the matter of the airport, the port and the prisoners: the causes of contention are legion."
"I would point out above all that the outcome of the Israeli elections will be crucial."
"It is not up to us to tell that country what type of government to vote in; naturally we hope to see a victory for parties which desire peace or can put together a grand coalition that is not influenced by extremist groups."
"Circumstances in the region as a whole are worrying: nothing has been settled in Lebanon or Syria, and nor is any headway being made on implementing the Barcelona agreement and process, because it is quite impossible to contemplate a massive programme of investment if there is no security for individuals."
"The Palestinians are in an untenable situation."
"Huge efforts have been made by the EU over the past few years, without which the Palestinian Authority could not have been formed; the Palestinian Authority owes its existence to the European Union."
"Our assistance has been vital to the survival of the Palestinian Authority and also to the life of the Palestinian people, especially in Gaza, a tiny patch of land where a million people live as if in a sort of concentration camp."
"Even though our assistance has been granted under extremely difficult and quite abnormal economic circumstances, it must continue."
"Is it fair to demand that the Commission guarantee transparency and combat waste and fraud?"
"Much has been done in this regard, but it is unfair to ignore the fact that any action carried out in that region is hampered by security measures and other constraints which defy economic reason."
"Unless we understand this, we cannot understand what has been achieved there."
"I shall now turn to a particularly sensitive matter."
"We must realise that we have both asked and obtained a great deal from the Palestinians: free and democratic elections which are a model for many free countries in the region; the nullification of the PLO Charter provision pledging to destroy Israel; an intensification of the fight against terrorism; a curbing of Hamas activity."
"We are rightly continuing to demand more democracy and lawfulness within the Palestinian Authority."
"Now, however, we must ask one more thing of the Palestinians, and this is the key point of my resolution."
"The date of 4 May is a landmark which could prove disastrous."
"We must now ask the Palestinians to make one last effort, namely to turn back the clock, to postpone their unilateral declaration of independence."
"But we must give them a good reason to do so, and I believe that a solemn political undertaking must be made by the guarantors, by which I mean the United States, European Union, Russia - in other words, the major Oslo powers."
"We must issue a binding political statement confirming the aims of the Oslo accords and, above all, guaranteeing that the Palestinian people will retain their full right to self-determination beyond the deadline of 4 May 1999, which was set five years ago in Oslo."
"I believe that the Palestinians understand the sensitivity of this situation and are awaiting a move from their main partners in dialogue and international guarantors."
"Furthermore, in my opinion they realise that a unilateral declaration of independence on 4 May could provoke a reaction from the Israelis - as already announced - and that such a reaction would damage the peace process."
"I believe they understand that such a step could bring victory at the Israeli elections for parties hostile to the peace process, and are therefore disposed to put back the date."
"But an initiative is required from the EU, the USA and Russia, and this is the most useful thing that can be done at present for the Middle East peace process."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, which began so promisingly at the Barcelona Conference in November 1995, has today not yet really got underway, having been in existence unofficially for three and a half years."
"I have presented two previous reports to the House on the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, which led to corresponding resolutions by the European Parliament on 11 October 1995, shortly before the Barcelona Conference, and on 13 March 1997, shortly before the Malta Conference."
"I am pleased to say that in both cases the European Parliament voted by an overwhelming majority in favour of the proposals put forward, and I hope that this time too our position will be adopted by a similar majority."
"What we have before us this time is a recommendation to the Council, which has deliberately been kept very short so as not to repeat the proposals of the two previous resolutions, which are already known and have been adopted."
"I would like to draw your attention to four points, Mr President-in-Office, and I would ask you to comment on these."
"Firstly, the deadlock caused by the Netanyahu government in the Middle East peace process has also had a very negative influence on the Barcelona process."
"Mr Colajanni has just spoken about the Middle East peace process, so I do not need to explain this further."
"If we wish to take the Euro-Mediterranean partnership forward we must also take on a more active role in the Middle East peace process."
"I am not referring to our financial role, as in terms of payment we are top of the league."
"I am referring to the political area of the negotiations, where our envoy, Miguel Angel Moratinos, must finally be allowed to sit at the negotiating table in the peace talks."
"Secondly, we must involve the whole of the Mediterranean area in the partnership, leaving no gaps along its shores."
"So I agree with my colleagues from the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Forum that Libya should also be invited to participate."
"In my opinion, the recent developments in resolving the Lockerbie problem have created more favourable conditions which might allow Libya to be invited to the next conference."
"The Balkan states, which were not able to be present from the beginning, should also be invited, at least as observers this first time."
"Increasing the number of participants could prove to be a positive development by providing the conference with fresh momentum."
"Thirdly, we need new impetus not only in terms of participants but also in terms of content."
"In the area of security policy in particular, we could present old proposals in Stuttgart, such as confidence-building measures and a stability pact for the Mediterranean, and new proposals, for example arms limitation and disarmament agreements."
"We could also breathe new life into the Barcelona process in the area of domestic policy by including immigration issues."
"My final point concerns the indebtedness of the countries concerned."
"We were prepared to commit a very considerable sum to this Mediterranean policy, but any investment or efforts here will be fruitless unless we can agree on a reasonable way to write off their debts beforehand."
"I am thinking here of Chancellor Schröder's proposal at the G8 summit that the money repaid as debt write-off could at the same time be used and invested for the development of the countries in question."
"If we try to take this approach, to give the process new momentum, Stuttgart could actually be a success."
"Mr President, the politics of the Middle East have long been a matter of prime concern to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, and I wish to congratulate Mr Colajanni on his excellent report."
"However, the concern in the House extends far beyond the Foreign Affairs Committee, and during the last year the Committee on Budgets has been heavily involved in the future regulations for financing the Middle East peace process and eventually, when Commissioner Marin himself became involved in this process, we saw the results of excellent cooperation between the Commissioner and the Committee on Budgets."
"Equally, the Committee on Budgetary Control has long had a deep interest, a concern that arises from the fact that something in the order of 54 cents in the dollar of the Middle East peace process is financed by the European Union budget."
"In a very difficult political situation it is nevertheless part of our responsibility in the Committee on Budgetary Control to ensure that the European taxpayer gets value for money, as well as the resources put there by the taxpayer having maximum political effect in the peace process."
"To that end, inevitably the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control raises the critical points rather than the complimentary ones."
"I should like here and now to say that we have been more than pleased with the cooperation we have had from Commissioner Marin, who has answered a very detailed series of questions, followed up by a very detailed set of supplementary questions on a number of the problems that arise in the Middle East from the implementation of the process and that we are very grateful for the cooperation we are seeing from the Commission for a small mission from the Committee on Budgetary Control that will visit the Middle East, particularly to see the value-for-money questions in the Occupied Territories."
"It will obviously be at that time that we will make a final judgement on the value-for-money questions and that will be done in the context of the discharge procedure."
"Meanwhile, we congratulate Mr Colajanni on his report, we raise the critical questions about the quality of expenditure and we congratulate Commissioner Marin personally on the way in which he has engaged himself with the Committee on Budgetary Control and with the delegation in trying to ensure that we report properly to Parliament in terms of discharge."
"Mr President, Mr Tomlinson has already mentioned the points that we have been discussing in great detail in recent weeks, particularly in connection with his report on the Palestinian issue and the new rules which we have fortunately been able to put together in a joint package with the Council and the Commission."
"With the exception of the points that we had asked the Commission to change once again, we are satisfied with its proposal, which has now eliminated the problem areas that we raised in the debate."
"Nevertheless, I would like to take this opportunity to mention two points once again."
"Firstly, this is a programme that involves partners whose expenditure in the course of the year is very difficult to estimate at the beginning of the year."
"It is not like the usual Community programmes, where we can calculate exactly what resources are needed."
"As a result, there is a backlog of funds, in other words funds were earmarked which were subsequently not used and these are now left over."
"However, what we need - and I know how difficult this is, as we also attempted to improve this procedure in cooperation with the Commission - is a more reliable procedure, including in terms of the anticipated expenditure in a particular financial year."
"I would therefore ask the Commission to try to provide us with greater certainty in planning and implementation in the course of the year."
"If you look at when the funds were used, you can see that a considerable percentage were not used until the last few weeks of the year."
"However, in accordance with the Notenboom Procedure, October is the latest we can carry over funds not used in the current year."
"We therefore need greater assurance from you in future: immediately after the summer break we need you to give us a summary of how much money is still expected to be spent, as we both know that last year we again had to forfeit funds because they were not going to be used in the few remaining weeks before Christmas."
"I know that this is a big problem, especially for partners whom we simply have to deal with differently than we do within the Community; however, we will not be able to avoid this problem, and we do not want to weigh ourselves down with a huge burden for the future."
"I would therefore urge that this should be taken into account in the report in future, and this is the purpose of the amendment by the Committee on Budgets."
"We have also included it in our opinion on the report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the presidency welcomes the fact that today the European Parliament is looking in depth at the Middle East and the role of the European Union in the Middle East peace process."
"As you know, the European Union is a resolute supporter of the peace process in accordance with the Oslo and Madrid agreements."
"In 1996 the European Union appointed the Spanish Ambassador, Mr Moratinos, as the EU's special envoy for the Middle East peace process."
"Since then Mr Moratinos has dedicated himself with great energy and initiative to the aim of bringing the peace negotiations to a successful conclusion."
"Every presidency has devoted considerable attention to this region."
"From 10 to 14 February the German Foreign Minister, Mr Fischer, visited all the states in the region and the territories administered by the Palestinian Authority, where he took part in the talks on achieving progress in the implementation of the Wye River Memorandum."
"I mention this here because the European Parliament's resolution could give the impression that the EU is not sufficiently represented in the peace process."
"I would like to point out that so far the European Union has rightly decided to support the USA in its various committed attempts to achieve a peaceful solution in the Middle East, rather than to compete with it."
"The USA has for a long time been a partner that is accepted by both sides, and we recognise and respect its role and its importance in the region."
"We must remember that this is a difficult process, and that while progress has been made setbacks have also been encountered."
"The Palestinians' right to self-determination conflicts with the Israelis' right to live within secure and recognised borders."
"In view of the complex history of the conflict, tenacity and patience are of particular importance."
"At this point I would mention that the European Union has already made a vital contribution to the progress of the Middle East peace process."
"The EU has been most generous in its financial support for the Palestinian areas since 1993."
"Not only has it made an important financial contribution, but by doing so it has also allowed the political agreements to be implemented."
"The EU is aware that a number of problems have arisen here."
"The negative economic development in these areas is of course disappointing and sobering, especially in view of the extraordinary efforts we have made."
"It is genuinely alarming that the population's standard of living is lower today than in 1993."
"I believe that the problems are certainly largely due to the deadlock in the peace process and the resulting shortcomings in the implementation of the economic agreements."
"But the Israelis and Palestinians themselves also bear responsibility, and each must ensure that international aid is applied more effectively than before in their own regions."
"We must not forget, however, that there are also very successful EU projects that have significantly improved living conditions."
"Examples include the building programme for schools, water treatment plants in Bethlehem, Nablus and Hebron, and waste disposal in Gaza."
"It is certainly no consolation to imagine the disastrous route that economic development in the Palestinian territories would have taken if aid from the EU and other donors had not been so generous."
"One thing is certain: without this aid the territories administered by the Palestinian Authority would not have been viable and as a result the entire peace process would have been in jeopardy."
"We should bear this in mind in future, since our disappointment at the economic development of the Palestinian territories must not undermine the EU's fundamental financial commitment."
"Financial aid is political aid."
"Without our support the peace process and, accordingly, the people in this area would not have stood a chance."
"I therefore welcome the EU's offer of substantial aid for the period 1999-2003 at the donors' conference in Washington and most recently under the German Presidency in Frankfurt."
"On that occasion, on 4 and 5 February in Frankfurt, details were given of how EU funding is to be more efficiently applied."
"Reference was made not only to obstacles caused by Israeli bureaucracy but also to the difficulties within the Palestinian administration that were rightly addressed in your parliamentary report."
"By taking over the joint presidency of the conference, the EU also illustrated its commitment effectively."
"However, the EU's support for the Middle East peace process also has a further dimension: the Euro-Mediterranean partnership."
"With the third follow-up conference of EU foreign ministers and their twelve Mediterranean partners under the Barcelona process in Stuttgart next month, the EU will be making a further specific contribution to regional integration and economic development in the Middle East."
"We are hoping that this will provide further support for the peace process and open additional lines of communication and dialogue."
"I would like to look at two further points contained in the European Parliament's motion for a resolution."
"The first is the reference to the need to support Jordan."
"The presidency is very much of this view, as economic and political stability in Jordan is a crucial factor in peace-keeping in the Middle East."
"Our Foreign Minister, Mr Fischer, also spoke to the new King Abdullah during his trip to the Middle East and expressed the EU's wish that Jordanian policy should continue as before."
"King Abdullah assured him of this."
"It is very much in Europe's interest that security and stability in this important state should be maintained, and the EU should therefore help Jordan as far as possible."
"The General Affairs Council of 22 February asked the Commission to examine how the EU can help, taking national contributions into account."
"The second point concerns the lack of water resources in the Middle East."
"We all know that this is one of the most serious problems in the region and that all states affected will sooner or later be forced to cooperate."
"Ambassador Moratinos has already held various talks with Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority on this subject, and he has also set up a task force on water issues."
"During his trip to the Middle East, Foreign Minister Fischer emphasised Europe's interest in finding a solution to the water problem."
"Various Member States are involved here."
"I can assure you that the European Union will continue to play an appropriate role in the Middle East peace process."
"We will pursue our policy with commitment and patience, with great dedication and acuity, and in agreement with the United States."
"I am sure that in the not-too-distant future the parties will achieve the peace in the Middle East that all sides would like to see."
"Mr President, today we are discussing two documents which, both with Palestine and with Libya, are going to be of great importance for the future development of the European Union's Mediterranean policy."
"I would like to thank Mr Sakellariou and Mr Colajanni for their reports, especially since both Members are particularly interested in these issues."
"I am only going to give you a very brief political analysis because what the President-in-Office said corresponds exactly to the Commission's position."
"I should therefore like to keep my analysis short, as I have little to add to what the President-in-Office said."
"As regards what Mr Colajanni said, I agree with him that the Stuttgart Conference is very important and comes at a very delicate time politically."
"As Mr Verheugen pointed out, the Commission and the special envoy, Mr Moratinos, accompanied the Presidency and we had the opportunity to witness the atmosphere there and the problems involved in trying to find an appropriate solution in a difficult political situation."
"On the one hand, there is the deadline of 4 May that is laid down in the Oslo agreements; on the other hand, there are the Israeli elections, which are naturally going to play a key role in the peace process and in the implementation of the Wye Plantation agreements."
"There are two positive points that I would like to mention."
"We have worked tirelessly in recent months with the German Presidency - whom I would like to thank publicly - in order to conclude the association agreement with Egypt."
"In principle, I believe that we will be able to complete these difficult negotiations before the Stuttgart Conference, thereby allowing this important country to finally have its own agreement."
"I would like to make a point about the procedure in the light of what Parliament has recommended."
"It is true that the ratification of the agreements is progressing very slowly at national level."
"I would like to take a moment to talk about Mr Samland's proposals both for the programming and also for the programming of the joint agreements."
"As you reach the end of your time in the European Parliament, Mr Samland - as I surely am too, since some people are trying to ensure that I leave before my time - I would like to tell you that the system of joint agreements is being changed."
"If we do not amend that system at the next intergovernmental conference, Mr Colajanni, the average time needed to ratify the agreements at national level will continue to be between two and a half and three years."
"That is not the Commission's fault."
"The problem is that we have a cyclical programming system that needs to be reviewed, and we will have to find solutions for the future through calm and peaceful discussions with the European Parliament and with the Council."
"I agree with you that there are some things that need to be changed as soon as possible and one of those, Mr Colajanni, is the system of ratifying joint agreements."
"However, I have contacted some of the Member States by letter to try to speed up the process."
"You raised a key point: how to resolve the disruption affecting the peace process and the Barcelona Conference."
"We have talked about this on many occasions."
"In my opinion, the solution will involve organising a meeting similar to that held in Palermo, and we are working with the presidency and have had many technical meetings on this issue. The Malta Conference could not succeed because it took place at the height of the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians."
"But in Palermo, great efforts were made and it became evident that the political forum of the Barcelona committee had to be maintained at all costs. It is the only point of political reference we have in the Euro-Mediterranean sphere, given that the multilateral process and the regional process are not working at this point in time."
"I am very hopeful and believe that we will be able to make significant progress in Stuttgart."
"As regards the peace process in the Middle East, we fully agree with what the President said and with Mr Colajanni's philosophy."
"We must make every effort to try to obtain an adequate solution for 4 May and a commitment on the part of the Israeli Government to quickly move the peace process forward."
"In this respect, I have little to add to what was said by Mr Colajanni and by the President-in-Office, Mr Verheugen."
"As far as assistance to the Palestinians is concerned, I would first of all like to point out, in relation to what both Mr Samland and Mr Tomlinson said, that the Commission has taken the fundamental step of following up the Tomlinson report by fixing the timetable for the next few years at the conference of donors in Washington and Frankfurt. I welcome the fact that distinguished members of the Committee on Budgetary Control are soon to visit the Territories."
"But the problem lies in the difficulty of drawing up a financial programme in a situation where there are security problems, terrorist attacks, a lack of dialogue between the Israelis and the Palestinians, closures of the Territories, and obstacles to the distribution of goods. These are all problems that we are very well aware of and they make it difficult to prepare the financial programming."
"That is where the special regulation in the Tomlinson report, approved by Parliament, comes into play."
"As a result, I cannot promise the chairman of the Committee on Budgets that there will be 100 % funding for the financial programme."
"That is impossible."
"I cannot predict whether or not the Wye Plantation agreements will be implemented."
"I do not think that Mr Samland can ask that of the Commission, of the Member States, or of this Parliament."
"If the Wye Plantation agreements are implemented as they should be, we will be able to present the financial programme to the Council and to Parliament."
"If the Wye Plantation agreements do not work, then that will be very difficult."
"And this is something that I want to stress."
"Nevertheless, we are going along with the reasoning put forward by Parliament."
"Mr Verheugen made a very important point."
"In February, at the meeting in Frankfurt, the Presidency and the Commission highlighted the two most significant problems of the last five years."
"To ensure that the Palestinians enjoy economic development, two requirements must be met: there must be greater transparency in the Palestinian budget, and Israel must put an end to its restrictive policies."
"If the Palestinian economy is not transparent, there is the risk of corruption, whereas an open and transparent Palestinian economy would make it more difficult for problems to arise."
"However, in order to achieve this, Israel must accept the fact that a bilateral agreement has already been signed between the Palestinian Authority and the European Union."
"Indeed, the Commission has emphasised this point on many occasions. It is a fundamental element of our cooperation and we must let the Israeli authorities know that it is a mistake to implement such restrictive economic policies."
"Israel has every right to demand security and greater cooperation in the fight against terrorism. However, it is also evident, as highlighted in the Colajanni report and the Commission communication, that economic development in Palestine is also a key element in ensuring Israel's own security."
"Israel will become much more secure as the Palestinian economy grows. If there is no development, there will be more poverty, a greater degree of marginalisation, further difficulties for the Palestinians, and a greater likelihood of extremist tendencies developing."
"This is why we want to complete the financial programming for the next few years and, in conclusion, I would ask Parliament to understand one point in this respect."
"The Commission is going to propose to Parliament and the Council that it should no longer be responsible for the Palestinian Authority's current expenditure."
"I want you to understand this."
"Over the last five years, in order to implement political decisions taken by the Council, for exceptional reasons, and to keep the Palestinian Authority active for political reasons, the Commission has had to finance current expenditure operations that were not included in the economic assistance programme."
"That was a purely political decision and it must be seen as such."
"We therefore do not want the Commission to deal with any more current expenditure."
"But what will happen if the borders are closed in the next few years?"
"Are we going to let the Palestinian Authority fall?"
"No, we will not."
"But what the Commission will propose is that in each instance a joint decision be taken by the European Parliament and the Council."
"We believe that this is a reasonable solution."
"However, Mr Tomlinson, when you present the report on the discharge, I would ask you not to forget that, for political reasons, the Commission has allocated current expenditure that, in principle, was not included in the economic development programme."
"There is nothing to hide here and I am speaking very openly."
"We do not intend to repeat this in the future."
"Nevertheless, what I do want to state very emphatically is that you cannot accuse the Commission and Commissioner Marín - and I say this without any complex - of having acted wrongfully: the only thing I have done is to implement the political decisions of the Council and Parliament."
"The issue of Jordan is an example of a typical problem of political compromise."
"The old MEDA programme, which is being updated, included a special structural adjustment programme for Jordan."
"The Council has stated that the Commission was asked to draw up a special programme for Jordan and that is the case."
"Once again, Mr Tomlinson, Mr Colajanni, we will have to choose between the political option on the one hand, and financial rigour on the other."
"And as far as Jordan is concerned, if we have to act politically, then let us do so."
"As regards Libya, Mr Sakellariou, we have a political problem that must be solved at a political level by means of a political decision."
"You are perfectly aware of that and, therefore, we will first of all have to find a solution according to the formula put forward by the Secretary-General of the United Nations."
"It is, of course, only right that the Libyan dispute should be resolved."
"It would also be a positive step if Libya were to participate in the Euro-Mediterranean Conference."
"But we all know that there is a precondition."
"If we can find an answer to the precondition, we will have resolved a political problem."
"It would naturally be better if Libya's relations with the European Union were to return to normal."
"But there is firstly a precondition to resolve."
"Commissioner, you have spoken at some length, but I understand that you need to express your thoughts on your policy and on how this important problem has developed over the last few years. For this reason the Chair showed understanding, but it needed to show a great deal of understanding."
"Mr President, just this once I really want to talk about the Rules of Procedure."
"Rule 46(3) of the Rules of Procedure gives Parliament the right to make recommendations to the Council in connection with Article J.7 of the EU Treaty."
"This recommendation, which will be adopted by Parliament tomorrow, was addressed to the Council presidency, but the Council presidency has not discussed what was in the recommendation."
"I thank the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Marín, who did discuss the substance of the recommendation and the question of Libya."
"However, the recommendation is addressed to the Council."
"I would therefore like to ask, on behalf of Parliament, when the Council intends to reply to our recommendation, even if only to say 'no, thank you'."
"Mr Sakellariou, I have listened very carefully to what you have said."
"As regards the procedural matter you have raised, I have to tell you that Mr Verheugen, the President-in-Office, had informed us that it would not be possible for him to stay and so he has not heard your recommendation to give a reply on."
"However, the Chair will try to obtain clarification from the Council so that we will have an answer."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr Colajanni and Mr Sakellariou for their very committed reports which really show the direction that Europe should take."
"However, I would also like to thank Mr Tomlinson and Mr Samland, as I firmly believe that the links between foreign policy, the budget and budgetary control must be strengthened in future so that perhaps some of the things that have happened recently could be avoided."
"Being involved in foreign affairs, I know how important financial resources are in conducting foreign policy, but as a Member of Parliament I also know that we in this House and also the public must be sure that the resources are used properly and efficiently."
"I also wish to comment on a point raised by Commissioner Marín."
"It was really very interesting, Commissioner."
"You said that we must decide between policy and financial stringency."
"Perhaps together we can find a way of combining the two, of taking very useful action in the political sphere and yet being at least efficient in financial terms."
"You are right on one point: Parliament itself was probably not prepared to make the link between policy and financial stringency."
"We, at least in my group, are fully behind what you proposed here yesterday."
"We will support you in uniting policy and financial stringency."
"I have two comments on what Mr Sakellariou proposed."
"I support what he said about Libya."
"I have myself visited Libya and spoken to those in charge, and I believe that many people there are ready and willing to become part of the international community once again."
"The conditions you mentioned, Commissioner, will of course still apply."
"Perhaps I could make one further point about the Colajanni report as I and others prepare for a trip to Syria and Lebanon."
"I believe that we must do everything we can to encourage Israel to withdraw from Lebanon, in its own interest and in the interest of the peace process, so that a similar process can then be begun with Syria in relation to the Golan Heights."
"Finally, I would call upon the Commission and the Council to approach 4 May 1999, an important historical date for the Palestinians, in such a way that it does not provoke renewed conflict but instead marks a further step towards peace."
"Mr President, I would like to make a point of order."
"The President-in-Office has left when we are in the process of debating a recommendation to the Council. I think that that was very impolite behaviour before the House, particularly since it was not due to reasons beyond his control: he is currently attending an informal meeting in Room 100."
"It was very disrespectful of him to leave the sitting, especially given the issue we are now debating."
"I would therefore ask you, Mr President, to protest to the President-in-Office about such unaccustomed behaviour during a parliamentary debate."
"Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, as you will have heard, I noted the presence of the President-in-Office at the time when our rapporteurs were speaking."
"I am very sorry but I do not want to make an issue out of this."
"The President-in-Office was here up to and following the speech made by Mr Marín, but perhaps you were unaware of this."
"It would have been better if he could have stayed longer, and I agree with you on this."
"However, I will make a note of that aspect of your comments."
"Mr President, if I may say so, I too find it odd that the Council President merely listens to the Commission and the rapporteurs and then completely ignores the debate."
"One often has the feeling when discussing Mediterranean affairs that the European Union treats them with a certain disdain, as though Libya, the Middle East and the Balkans are really rather a nuisance."
"And yet this is both our most sensitive and most fascinating border."
"Here, different cultures have been in contact for centuries, more often clashing than meshing, but also trading and establishing the principle of communicating vessels in important areas of culture, philosophy and mathematics, to mention but a few."
"It was not possible in the past, and is even less so today, to define the Mediterranean countries merely as those whose shores are washed by that sea."
"The concatenation of problems - one need only think of the Middle East and the Gulf - is such that these borders can no longer be drawn in the manner of the Romans, who wrote on their maps just beyond the southern shore of the Mediterranean: 'hic sunt leones ' - ' here be lions'."
"The first fundamental mistake would therefore be for Europe to think that the Mediterranean area can be confined to countries which resemble it to a greater or lesser extent: the multifarious array of cultures and political systems cannot be narrowed down artificially."
"Europe must foster cooperation with all the coastal states - obviously including Libya - and also, where problems do not stop at geographical borders, with their neighbours."
"My first point, therefore, relates to the Mediterranean countries in their entirety."
"My second is as important as it is insidious, and answers this question: is the problem of the Mediterranean a matter of joint economic development with Europe?"
"It is, but, if we think it is only or mainly that, we shall be making the second fundamental mistake: it is also a matter of joint civil development."
"How?"
"By imposing a common denominator on the whole of Europe?"
"That would be the third fundamental mistake."
"Allow me at this point to quote a highly authoritative speaker from the Islamic world, President Khatami of Iran, whom it would be absurd to ignore."
"According to him, before a people can accept change and evolution, it must first be conscious of its own existence and historical identity, so as to have a point of departure."
"This is just what the West has sometimes misunderstood when following its colonial and post-colonial inclinations."
"Of course, it is not always easy. We are dealing with very different countries, but isolation will not solve problems which should instead be entrusted to the wisdom of politicians: Libya should teach us a lesson."
"True fundamentalism must never make us forget that behind it lie problems on which we can legitimately comment: Islam, for example, is not necessarily intolerant in itself; intolerance is caused by social and economic problems when they are allowed to fester."
"Mr President, the Middle East peace process is deadlocked and the parties are waiting for two things, the May elections in Israel and the declaration of an independent state of Palestine."
"We must persuade the Palestinians to postpone that declaration."
"Something has to be done here."
"And I think we should commit ourselves to recognising that state if it is declared."
"We should not forget that 4 May marks the end of the transitional phase of the Oslo Agreement, at which time the final outcome of the negotiations will become apparent."
"It is clear that a postponement is important in order to stop extreme elements from gaining the upper hand in the Israeli elections."
"The problems in Lebanon are big enough."
"Europe must preach moderation and a willingness to compromise and must hope that the people and government of Israel can find the way to peace and dialogue."
"This peace process is also extremely important to the Barcelona process, which is likewise deadlocked at present."
"Aside from the peace process, the Union must invest in democracy and human rights."
"Good governance is the basis for successful progress."
"The Union can foster these processes by focusing its attention on civil society."
"With luck, all the problems over the legal base for providing funds have been resolved."
"The Union must also support the organising of a parallel meeting of NGOs during the Euro-Mediterranean summit in Stuttgart."
"My group, the Liberals, endorses both reports because they take account of the fine detail and give the European Parliament a voice at a time of such significance in the region - for peace, security and a promising future."
"I want to make a general observation about small groups. A minute and a half is given to group representatives."
"This is totally inadequate for colleagues to express more than a few thoughts and they have to rely on the forbearance of the Chair."
"For its part, the Chair is put in a difficult position and does not want to cut off speakers."
"At some point this system must stop."
"It would be better if fewer colleagues spoke for a longer time to enable them to express their views."
"It is impossible to give just a minute or a minute and a half. It is not enough."
"Mr President, all honour to the rapporteurs who in the last five years have placed passionate and carefully considered visions before us."
"But great as this passion is to move the situation in the Middle East or Mediterranean area forward a little, we are still dependent on developments on the spot, such as elections in Israel and Algeria."
"Moreover, the date of 4 May hangs over us like a sword of Damocles."
"The rapporteur calls on the Palestinian Authority to desist from a declaration of independence."
"If it happens, I fear it may have implications for the financial assistance we provide. That is already the subject of criticism, and we want better scrutiny of it."
"It is clear too that we must ask the Israelis, after the elections, to make serious efforts to move the peace process forward."
"In the run-up to the elections, positive noises have been heard, for example about a possible withdrawal from Lebanon."
"The rapporteur speaks of unconditional withdrawal from Lebanon."
"I cannot go along with that, since Israel can in no way be sure that Lebanon can control the fundamentalist military groups there."
"Nor are things clear with regard to the deeply entrenched Syrian presence in Lebanon."
"Withdrawal from Lebanon without any agreements with Syria is an invitation to violence."
"So we must remain hopeful that a coherent solution will be found, so that part of the external threat to Israel is removed and realistic possibilities are created for further and more specific ties with the Palestinians."
"Restoration of the peace process may help our policy on the Mediterranean, but it is not the only factor."
"The Commissioner mentioned Egypt earlier."
"After three years of talks, it is very important that we should now involve Egypt in the peace process."
"It is a shame that the Council representative is no longer here."
"I echo Commissioner Marín in urging the Council to bring in Egypt as an important country."
"That will be a step forward."
"Mr President, both the Colajanni report and the Sakellariou report take us forward in a very positive direction."
"They were unanimously adopted by our committee and also have the support of our group."
"I would like to make a comment on the Sakellariou report."
"Mr Sakellariou quite rightly highlights four basic areas: finding a solution to the Middle East problem; increasing the number of participants at the conference to include Libya and the countries of the former Yugoslavia; content, and the debt issue."
"However, I should like to ask whether, with the way things are developing at the moment, these are the only issues."
"Perhaps there is a new, important issue - which indeed is not new, judging by the force with which it has emerged - in the Mediterranean area, which threatens to destabilise the whole of the Eastern Mediterranean."
"Is it possible to move towards a Mediterranean zone of safety and cooperation without tackling the Kurdish question?"
"The Kurdish question affects Mediterranean countries, it affects Turkey and Syria, and it affects countries which, as Mr Graziani said, are extensions of the Mediterranean region, such as Iraq and Iran."
"The Kurdish question is closely interwoven with, and is destabilising, relations in Mediterranean countries, such as the relations between Greece and Turkey, Turkish-Cypriot relations, or the wider relations in the Eastern Mediterranean region."
"We cannot afford to ignore the Kurdish question and it must be integrated into issues relating to Mediterranean cooperation."
"Do we want policies to combat terrorism and violence, and to tackle issues which the European Parliament has repeatedly and wholeheartedly condemned?"
"Do we want to take action at international level?"
"Do we want to promote political solutions instead of violence?"
"If this is indeed what we want, I think we must concern ourselves with how to integrate the Kurdish question into our deliberations on achieving peace and security in the Mediterranean region, to which the European Parliament hopes to contribute."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Green Group, I should like to begin by expressing our support for the reports by Mr Colajanni and Mr Sakellariou. Both of them deal with issues - the Middle East peace process and the Euro-Mediterranean process following the Barcelona Declaration - which are currently deadlocked, as colleagues have pointed out."
"We could certainly not disagree with what Mr Colajanni said about the outcome of the Wye Plantation agreement and the significant fact that the 'land for peace' principle has now been accepted."
"We must however acknowledge that the current deadlock is largely due to the ambiguous attitude of the Israeli Government and the obstacles it is raising, and I believe that this must be emphasised by Parliament."
"The Lebanon and Syria questions must be solved too, without a doubt, if there is to be peace in the Middle East."
"Here I would recall Parliament's efforts to set up 'people to people' initiatives; I believe that a more effective response is required from the Commission."
"As regards the deadlock in the aftermath of the Barcelona Declaration, we too should like to see all the countries concerned participating - not only Libya, but also the countries of the former Yugoslavia and Albania - and we should like Macedonia to have special observer status."
"I would conclude by stressing that the present situation was caused largely by the European Union's current shortcomings in tackling common foreign and security policy problems."
"Unless this state of affairs is rectified, the prospects are bleak indeed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the two issues we are discussing this afternoon are in fact one and the same issue."
"As is his custom, Mr Colajanni has produced an excellent report which is balanced, prudent and which searches for even the slightest sign of progress towards peace in order to defuse the many occasions for confrontation and obstacles which arise on a daily basis in Israeli-Palestinian relations."
"Nevertheless, my group has serious reservations as regards the general position adopted."
"It is very diplomatic and seems to take as read the Israeli Government's volte-face on the resolutions on the peace process, to which it is nevertheless committed."
"The rapporteur proposes a further effort by the Palestinians, a degree of procrastination in order to delay any unilateral declaration of independence by the Palestinian Authority."
"But we do not believe that diplomatic efforts are justified when the spirit of peace has been violated and Mr Netanyahu is seriously in the wrong on this point, most probably to the detriment of the long-term interests of the Israeli people."
"The European Union will gain little by not daring to speak its mind."
"It would be making a mistake in continuing to believe that the United States must to some extent be left to act alone on this issue, with the idea that this forces it to be more open to Palestinian proposals and to put up greater resistance to its own pro-Israeli lobbies than if the Union were to clearly state its position and bring pressure to bear."
"In fact, as Mr Sakellariou and Commissioner Marín pointed out, the position we must adopt on this subject is largely determined by the position we must adopt in order to relaunch the whole process of Mediterranean cooperation."
"The position we take will have a determining influence on the consolidation of peace at the gates of Europe."
"Apart from the clauses on human rights and democracy, every option must be envisaged in a flexible frame of mind in order to genuinely relaunch the Barcelona process."
"The solution to the economic and demographic difficulties of the countries in question will clarify, facilitate and anchor the gradual appeasement which time alone can bring to the eternal dispute between fraternal enemies which is undermining the Middle East."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there has been a stalemate in the Middle East peace process since the Wye Plantation agreements."
"We know where the responsibilities lie: with the Israelis for their intransigence, and, for reasons which are all too evident, with the sole superpower, the United States, for the support it is giving to the Israeli policy."
"For electoral reasons, the powerful support the Israeli policy finds in Washington and elsewhere will never be subject to any serious criticism on the part of American politicians, and particularly those who run the federal administration."
"Finally, the responsibility also lies with the servile alignment of European policy with that of the United States, even when US policy is contrary to Europe's most obvious interests and even where we have the political and legal means to oppose it."
"This is true, for example, with regard to Lebanon, whose political subjugation and continued occupation we continue to tolerate."
"It is also the case in Iraq where the blockade and the bombings have cynically continued for years to the detriment of the civilian population, when there is clearly no security consideration to justify such a policy."
"When are we finally going to use France and the United Kingdom's voting rights on the UN Security Council - which could even win the support of China and Russia - in order to put a stop to this scandal?"
"As regards our military interventions, if they are essential, why must they be carried out within the framework of NATO, which has no legal or political justification except to chain us to the decisions made in Washington?"
"We claim to be able to solve the problem of Albanian immigration in Kosovo yet we are incapable of solving immigration problems in Strasbourg, Hamburg, Brussels or Genoa."
"Our inconsistencies in this field will benefit neither our interests nor peace in the Mediterranean."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, two minutes is really a very short time to speak as chairman of the Delegation for relations with Israel on our Mediterranean policy and, in that context, on peace in the Middle East."
"So I must be brief and, after thanking our two rapporteurs, I would like to make five points."
"Firstly, Europe is currently obsessed with its enlargement towards the East and Agenda 2000."
"It should concern itself more with the south, and, as a result, its Mediterranean policy."
"This is ultimately a question of survival, for Europe and thus for us."
"Secondly, in this connection it is now time - behind the statements of principle and the agreements signed - to act, and act quickly."
"There are too many long delays in ratifying agreements between Europe and southern countries followed by further overly long delays before concrete, quantifiable and, above all, visible actions are implemented in the field."
"Thirdly, although we must continue to hold talks with everyone, in the case of Libya, Mr Sakellariou, we must first demand the extradition and trial of the terrorists who blew up aeroplanes and killed hundreds of innocent people."
"The families of the victims demand this and are appealing to us in their suffering."
"Fourthly, everyone agrees that Europe must be more active politically as regards the Middle East."
"Indeed it must, but at the present time it must act without interfering in the forthcoming elections; otherwise, we will be acting contrary to our objectives."
"Finally, Europe must take initiatives to avoid a unilateral declaration of independence by the Palestinians on 4 May, while supporting the principal of a Palestinian state."
"This is a double requirement which anyone with good sense today recognises as a condition for relaunching the peace process immediately after the elections."
"Mr President, the Mediterranean policy of the European Union must be our most effective, high-minded and unanimous policy."
"As all wise men have pointed out - it would be sufficient just to mention Braudel - the Mediterranean is the cradle of Europe from a historical, cultural and ethnological perspective. It is also of major significance in current geopolitical terms, because it connects the continent of Europe with the troubled region of the Middle East and also with the awakening giant that is Africa."
"However, our Mediterranean policy is our most neglected, irresolute and ineffectual policy."
"The events of 1989, with the overthrow of the autocratic regimes of the Eastern bloc, served to highlight the need for an enlarged Europe to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"We have come to realise, rather belatedly, that enlargement must be balanced against the need to meet the challenges thrown up by the South."
"Not until the end of 1995, with the Barcelona Conference, did we attempt to open up prospects for cooperation, though with pre-defined commitments and an unlimited time scale."
"As pointed out by Mr Sakellariou, the rapporteur, the fruits of this endeavour remain negligible."
"In the ensuing three years, the Middle East peace process has not ended the drama in the region, nor has the human rights situation improved. Indeed, in many respects it has deteriorated."
"Nor has the threat or the use of violence among partners ceased to be a political instrument. Also, as a look at the map is enough to convince anyone, the partner relationship is fragmented and ad hoc."
"Many countries that border the Mediterranean remain outside the plan which, in order to be effective, must be cohesive and all-encompassing. Moreover, the lack of an honourable and realistic settlement of the immigrant problem is poisoning relations on all sides."
"We must make a courageous and flexible effort. This effort needs to be coordinated, as we have bitter experience of aspirations that are disjointed."
"The European Union must play a leading role in breaking the deadlock in the Middle East and this particular policy must fall in line with enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. If none of this happens, our Mediterranean policy will remain a cosmetic declaration and an excuse which fails to solve any of the burgeoning problems in the very region where Europe and European civilisation were born."
"Mr President, we support the two reports being discussed."
"I will only refer to the Colajanni report which attempts, among other things, to redefine the role of the European Union in the Middle East peace process."
"I find this report balanced but, given the ever-changing situation, its content is repeatedly being called into question."
"Nevertheless, there are certain elements that do not change."
"The Union's foreign policy in this particularly troubled region of the globe must no longer be limited to simply being the principal donor of economic and financial aid in the form of the vast sums made available to the Palestinian population."
"These sums, however, have still not produced the desired effect: the substantial fall in the average earnings of the Palestinians is proof of this."
"Europe must therefore cease being an economic giant and a political dwarf."
"It is now more essential than ever to have a true European common security policy."
"Only then will we be listened to and have a genuine role to play on the international stage."
"The economic and political situation has deteriorated sharply over recent months and the Lebanese thorn is proving increasingly painful."
"Given its complexity, the situation in the Middle East requires negotiated solutions involving the various parties."
"We must remember that Lebanon is under Syrian supervision and that the south is occupied by Israeli troops."
"The peace process must continue and we must avoid at all costs the useless sacrifice of human lives."
"I should like to mention paragraph 29 of the resolution concerning the occupation of southern Lebanon which is now very much in the news. I believe that a unilateral Israeli withdrawal must be possible, provided it is coupled with guarantees for the Hebrew state."
"In my view, we should therefore eliminate the term 'unconditional'."
"Mr President, the report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy on the Middle East tends to place the Israeli Government and the Palestinians on the same footing in terms of responsibility for the current deadlock in the peace process."
"This does not reflect the reality of the situation."
"It is the Israeli Government which has gone back on its previous commitments."
"I do not accept the way in which the report tries to organise pressure on the Palestinians to postpone their declaration of independence on 4 May 1999."
"Should not the role of Parliament, and of the European Union, be to make every effort to ensure that the peace agreements are honoured, that is, all the peace agreements?"
"These explicitly set the date of 4 May 1999 for the declaration of Palestinian sovereignty."
"Another problem remains in connection with the Mediterranean policy: the situation in Western Sahara."
"Here, too, the peace plan is deadlocked."
"The UN Secretary-General, who is personally committed to resolving the conflict, set a new deadline of 31 March 1999."
"I would call on the Council to intervene speedily in order to ensure that the conditions established by the United Nations are respected by that date and that the Sahrawi people can express their right to self-determination and independence."
"Mr President, the delayed entry into force of the five association agreements signed as part of the Barcelona process is deplorable and significant, as is the fact that - three years on from the Conference that took the name of the city where it was held - not all the Mediterranean countries have been invited to participate in the partnership process which was so loudly applauded in November 1995."
"It seemed to be the dawn of a new age, a welcome opportunity to establish new relations and revive cooperation between Europe and the Mediterranean countries, particularly in the political, economic, financial and cultural spheres."
"The delay is deplorable for two reasons: firstly Europe's lack of a common foreign policy, and secondly the stalled Middle East peace process."
"Until such time as security can be guaranteed in Israel, peace will be nothing but wishful thinking."
"It is vital to step up the EU's relations with Jordan, given the major role played by the late King Hussein in overcoming the stalemate in negotiations."
"A Europe which is incapable of giving itself a political identity cannot claim to have the weight required to play a determining role, both in guaranteeing peace and in fostering cooperation and development."
"And yet the EU has to play an increasingly important part in these processes."
"Otherwise its role will simply be to beat the human rights drum: a noble role, without a doubt, but utterly useless in terms of influencing proceedings, unless our words are followed by deeds."
"Two factors seem to me to be germane to a policy of economic revival and reform: firstly, debt cancellation for countries undertaking to reinvest the amounts involved in development projects; and, secondly, closer cooperation with SMEs andcraft undertakings."
"It is not 'cathedrals in the desert' that will generate growth, but the organisation of a network of small businesses geared to making high-quality, typical and distinctive products."
"Expanding the production base in the Mediterranean countries will help to combat illegal and clandestine immigration, which represents a running sore both for the immigrants and for the European host countries."
"Mr President, let me finally turn to the German Presidency, which is hosting the Euro-Mediterranean Committee in Bonn on 19 March and Stuttgart on 14 April, to say that we hope these meetings will finally lead to tangible progress."
"Mr President, allow me first of all to say that the Council's desire to concentrate all its efforts on foreign and security policy only highlights its disregard for Parliament. It does not listen to us and I would like to thank Commissioner Marín as he has provided us with some of the answers we had hoped to receive from the Council."
"I would very briefly like to say that we are dealing here with an extremely old problem, perhaps one of the oldest problems affecting humanity. But we are faced with a very specific timetable beginning with the Stuttgart Conference on 4 April."
"A month later, there is the possible declaration of independence by the Palestinians, and then there are the Israeli elections."
"I think that we need to take a very practical line in this dual debate, covering, as it does, two issues that are very closely linked. Although we have tried to take them in isolation at times in order to make progress, it is clear that the cornerstone of the Mediterranean process rests to a large extent on finding a successful solution to the peace process in the Middle East because that is the only multilateral forum that exists in the Mediterranean."
"In my view, the European Union should promote something that the Presidency mentioned. Without being too specific, it is basically the fact that, clearly, there is a right that we must recognise."
"Exercising that right is another matter, and that is an area where we can help."
"Indeed, we can also set an example."
"We certainly have the ability to contribute, and I believe that we can actually do so: issues such as water and regional development spring to mind here."
"That is what we have done and I think that that is where our strength lies."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Colajanni on his excellent work and to thank Commissioner Marín for what he has said here today."
"There is one very important point regarding the Colajanni report and that is paragraph 13, which refers to the need for an initiative on the part of the Council to make the new presence of the European Union in the Middle East more visible."
"I very much regret, and indeed it is a great shame, that the Council is not present at this debate, as we are thereby being deprived of the right to obtain answers on a number of points which, unfortunately, lead to false reasoning regarding the content of this new initiative."
"The Council is making a mistake by leaving it entirely up to the United States to formulate proposals for a solution to the Middle East problem."
"The Council is mistaken if it thinks that the presence of a single representative, who is unaided and lacks the support of any form of infrastructure, can solve the problem."
"The Council is wrong if it thinks that the presence of the European Union should be confined to trips and contacts and that it should not include recommendations on the specific issues and problems which make up the Middle East question."
"We call on the President-in-Office to tell us: firstly, what the position of the European Union is on the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Golan Heights; secondly, what the opinion of the European Union is regarding a solution to the problem of Southern Lebanon and, thirdly, what will happen to the agreement between the European Union and Syria."
"Finally, Mr President, in order for us to arrive at that point, the institutional presence of the Council in the Middle East needs to be re-examined."
"This can only be achieved if a decision is finally reached to set up a joint task force comprising the Council, the Commission and, possibly, the European Parliament, which can tackle each of these problems in turn."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to highlight once again the importance of the Mediterranean policy for the European Union."
"We are currently undertaking enlargement negotiations with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"I would like to be sure that this dialogue with the Eastern European states will not prevent the European Union from concentrating on the problems in southern Europe and those affecting the Mediterranean countries."
"In my opinion, this North-South dialogue must work in parallel with the policies being implemented by the European Union with a view to achieving a fair and necessary enlargement towards Central and Eastern Europe."
"These issues were raised at the 1995 Barcelona Conference and the proposal was made to initiate dialogue between civil society in the north and south of the Mediterranean."
"The Euro-Med Civil Forum held in Barcelona a few days after the Euro-Mediterranean Conference also examined these issues and established the foundations for discussion and collaboration between north and south."
"Following that conference, a second conference was held in Naples, and similarly further Euro-Mediterranean Conferences were held in Malta and will this year be held in Stuttgart."
"This dialogue must continue because otherwise Europe will not meet the conditions necessary to ensure that we have a peaceful and friendly future alongside our neighbours in the southern Mediterranean."
"Mr President, I would like to begin with a question of terminology that has me rather worried."
"The report talks about the Middle East."
"But I thought that for us, as Europeans, the area in question was the Near East."
"It is the Middle East for the United States and that is of some importance as it means that European politics are, in fact, looked on as subordinate to US politics."
"That is why I think it is worth making the distinction. The Commission communication is a good one."
"I would even go so far as to say that it is progressive since it presents figures and puts forward arguments relating to the political failings and how the situation of the Palestinians has deteriorated since the beginning of the peace process."
"The conclusion to be drawn from this is very clear if we compare the European Union's contribution with that of the United States and the rest of the world."
"The EU must play a greater role as a joint leader rather than sitting on the sidelines. And in order to do so, the European Union must become an ethical point of reference for what is happening in the Near East."
"We must therefore state clearly that if an international agreement provides the legal authority for the Palestinians to declare an independent state on 4 May, then the European Union must support such an international agreement with all the consequences it entails."
"If we do not, we will constantly be defending the aggressor and exonerating it, while asking the victim to remain calm."
"Clearly, we must do exactly the reverse."
"Mr President, the Colajanni report once again sheds light on a glaring reality, a treachery which many refuse to see: the evident determination of Israel to ignore the agreements concluded and to ignore the UN resolutions, which they do not care about."
"The European Union has a duty to stand up to this."
"The obligation to intervene, invented to support causes that were far less just, must be applied to the Middle East with determination and steadfastness."
"It is time to ensure that Israel can no longer harm the Palestinian people as it has been doing for more than 50 years."
"Europe cannot allow an imperialist and racist Israel on its borders to remain with impunity."
"The Palestinians' aspiration of finally receiving the land promised to them a thousand times over is totally legitimate and the intention of the Palestinian Authority to declare on 4 May 1999 the independence of the territories that are still occupied, must be supported by the EU at a political, financial and, if necessary, military level so that a free Palestine can finally flourish."
"Mr President, here we are, on the eve of the Stuttgart conference, voicing criticism of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership."
"I shall not dwell on the difficulties in the peace process, because the rapporteurs have already done so, or on the need for a more incisive EU role, because most of my colleagues have already done so."
"I would rather refer to the limitations of the instruments in the Barcelona process."
"I think we all now realise that multilateral relations and decentralised cooperation - which were perhaps the most worthwhile of the Barcelona instruments - are faltering, whereas bilateral relations between the EU and the Member States are suffering from all the problems linked to ratification dates which have been recalled by Mr Marín."
"I for my part would invite the Council to react to five very detailed proposals contained in the Sakellariou report: human rights, encouraging active participation by civil society, enabling new states to participate politically in this process, debt and immigration."
"Perhaps, if these proposals are taken up by the Council in Stuttgart, this very difficult and complex process will be revitalised."
"I believe that if the Commission receives much clearer political input, it will be better able to extricate itself from the managerial problems which we all realise are extremely awkward."
"Mr President, the last contribution by Mrs Napoletano obliges me to alter my own, because otherwise I would add nothing new."
"I wish to stress that her position is identical to mine. Obviously, if we are in agreement from one side of this House to the other, it means that this approach, and this one alone, is the right one."
"So I shall use my minute and a half - which, as the speaker before last said, is somewhat ludicrous given the important points needing to be made - to express a few thoughts to Mr Marín, but not without first thanking Mr Sakellariou and Mr Colajanni for their remarkable work, which thoroughly covers every aspect needing to be covered."
"To continue this theme of thoroughness, I would just comment on one of these aspects: civil society."
"Mr Vallvé mentioned it a moment ago."
"After Barcelona, ideas and proposals were put forward concerning civil society, and it does not seem to me that they received due consideration."
"Mr Marín, I agree with you that it is difficult to handle situations of such sensitivity and importance."
"It is also true, however, that where credible external bodies exist - and there are some in Europe and in the Mediterranean - then your hand should probably be strengthened from a managerial point of view."
"And, finally, just one comment of substance: after Barcelona, Palermo, Malta and Naples, let us not be lured into making Mediterranean tourism policy the dynamo of growth."
"That would be quite feasible, but let us confine ourselves to tackling more serious problems, namely those highlighted by Mrs Napoletano and myself."
"Mr President, with this report and its one-sided view of the Middle East peace process the European Parliament is continuing a rather sad tradition."
"While repeatedly denouncing supposed human rights violations in Israel, Parliament is treating human rights violations on the part of Arab dictatorships and the Palestinian administration with much greater caution."
"We consider direct interference in the election to be unacceptable."
"Israel is the only democracy in the region and the political strategy of the democratically-elected government should be respected."
"After all, the peace process did not reach a state of deadlock because the wrong politicians are in power in Israel but because Arab terrorists refuse to end their campaign."
"Critics of Israel have not yet learned very much when it comes to supporting Israel in the fight against terrorism, which costs the lives of hundreds of innocent people every year."
"Finally, I would like to comment on a point made by one of the previous speakers, who described the Gaza Strip as a concentration camp."
"This comparison with the Nationalist Socialist death camps is absolutely outrageous."
"Mr President, I believe that before the next Euro-Mediterranean Conference, the Council should give consideration to Mauritania's desire to participate fully in the Euro-Mediterranean process. Parliament has already done this itself at the Euro-Mediterranean Forum."
"Mauritania is one of the five countries that together form the Arab Maghreb."
"It is important to coordinate the Maghreb as a whole because of its social and economic development, and in Europe's history there are terrible examples of what has happened when a geopolitical Arab region has been divided."
"Mauritania is also involved in NATO's Mediterranean dialogue."
"This suggestion is far from being premature as Mauritania has been participating in the process since it first began."
"As Commissioner Marín is aware, Mauritania has participated as an observer for ten years."
"I think that that is too long to continue being an observer and that it is now time to provide Mauritania with the opportunity to take part."
"The Euro-Mediterranean process is global in nature and includes countries such as Sweden, Finland, Portugal and Ireland."
"Why, then, should we not include this ancient country from the Arab Maghreb?"
"In my opinion, this would be an excellent time to remind the Council that Parliament supports Mauritania's full participation in the Euro-Mediterranean process. This idea was approved and incorporated by Parliament in the Final Declaration of the Euro-Mediterranean Forum."
"The Council is not present here as its representative preferred to attend an informal meeting."
"As a result, I would ask you to forward this speech to the Council because if not, it will not be aware of this matter and the Stuttgart Conference is due to take place at the beginning of April."
"I would therefore ask you to pass this on personally since the Council should have been represented here."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome the fact that these two reports are being discussed jointly here as the problems experienced in this region can only be solved by a joint effort on the part of all concerned."
"However, when it comes to the Middle East peace process, we are repeatedly given the impression that Israel is considered to be largely responsible."
"I also notice that these reports are tolerant towards shortcomings on the part of the Palestinians, but where similar shortcomings are detected on the other side they are accompanied by warnings or criticisms."
"Some of the wording is also reminiscent of the resolutions on countries in Africa which waver between military dictatorships and one-party regimes and regularly have to be warned to observe the principles of democracy."
"But Israel is more or less the only functioning democracy in the whole region and it is also a country that is particularly under threat."
"When Members of this House always demand that the same concessions should be shown to the parties to the conflict, we wonder why the same tolerance is not shown towards Israel."
"Why is Israel required to accept a separate Palestinian state instead of also expecting the Palestinians to appreciate that Israel is currently in a special situation and that allowance must be made for its sensitivity, especially after the repeated terrorist attacks?"
"Now, more than ever, patience is required, as it always is when a country is about to hold important elections."
"This patience will certainly also be required when the deadline of 4 May, agreed in Oslo, expires."
"We cannot then allow one side to create a fait accompli."
"In my view it would not hurt us to be more pro-Israel in our advice."
"It deserves it."
"Mr President, it is well known that the EU's Mediterranean policy needs to be strengthened and overhauled."
"In the Middle East peace process, the United States is jointly responsible for the implementation of the accords, whereas the European Union remains on the sidelines of discussions concerning the political future of that region."
"I hope that the Stuttgart conference will be an opportunity to launch the reform of a policy based on the principle of attentiveness in distinction, which means playing an active role in the Mediterranean Arab world without forgetting the unalterable historical and cultural differences which divide us."
"The best guarantee of stability, especially in international politics, is a healthy, sensible realism."
"That is why I see the need for a common immigration policy: a restrictive policy applying rigidly the principle of Community preference."
"I believe in the effectiveness of well-organised cooperation, but I am suspicious of moves to integrate Mediterranean states into our Union which, I would remind you, is a community of European countries."
"Mr President, I shall focus on Mr Colajanni's report. I would like to congratulate him on his excellent work and on having prepared such a well-structured and comprehensive report."
"I would like to concentrate mainly on the European Union's role in the Middle East peace process."
"I must say once again that I am very concerned at the lack of progress that has been made recently in securing a final peace settlement that is acceptable to both sides."
"In my opinion, the European Union must be very clear and must ensure that its position prevails. As the leading provider of economic assistance to the region, it can no longer allow itself to remain in the background when it comes to political questions as - and I would stress this point, Commissioner - the European Union is the biggest provider of per capita aid to Palestinians in the world."
"As regards the EU's cooperation with the Middle East at a political level, we must continue to make every effort to help build autonomous and independent institutions for the Palestinian people."
"Our aim must be to promote and structure a civil society in Palestine, as was mentioned earlier. We must also ensure that the aid we provide is used to train civil servants who will be the backbone of a new civil administration."
"As far as economic assistance is concerned, the Union must be able to transform its aid into tangible and lasting results on the ground with a view to improving the welfare of the Palestinians and generating an economic fabric in the region that affords Palestine a certain degree of independence from other countries. This is particularly important, for example, in terms of ensuring that they have the ability to export their own products."
"I agree with the rapporteur that it is essential to monitor the way in which the Palestinian authorities make use of the aid donated by means of auditing procedures, and this should mean that all expenditure and all measures taken are totally transparent."
"In order to achieve all this, we need not only the Union's commitment, but also the participation of Israel in order to allow economic development in the region. In that way, both peoples will be able to coexist and respect each other, which is necessary for peace in the region."
"Mr President, I just wanted to say that this has been an excellent debate."
"I see that a large majority of the House is in favour of a certain position and its main points are very clear."
"In accordance with the guidelines set out in the Sakellariou and Tomlinson reports, we will present the programming to the Council and to the European Parliament at the same time. It is convenient to have the Council's decision and Parliament's assent at the same time so that we can take an overall decision and resolve the many issues where improvement is still needed."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Trans-European energy networks"
"The next item is the report (A4-0087/99) by Mr Adam, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision amending Decision No 1254/96/EC laying down a series of guidelines for trans-European energy networks (COM(98)0542 - C4-0556/98-98/0284(COD))."
"Mr President, as Members will be aware, the trans-European electricity and gas networks are an important part of our energy strategy and there is provision in the Community's budget to carry out studies as to how these can be best improved."
"Colleagues should also note that there has been a slight change in the approach."
"Some of the money is now available for the actual construction of these networks."
"The Commission has now come forward with a list of additional projects which are felt to be within the Community interest and therefore subject to the codecision procedure."
"They are summarised on pages 8 and 9 of my report."
"They are: the connection of isolated electricity networks, the development of internal electricity connections and various gas proposals."
"Most of the proposals overall relate to gas, to gas interconnections and underground storage facilities."
"One rather interesting thing about them is the way in which the islands and remote areas of the Community are increasingly considered for linkage to these networks."
"Perhaps as an aside we might note that it gives an indication of the difficulties we have in exploiting renewable energies, which are often seen as the saviour of the remote areas: our main networks are continually pushing to the limits of Community territory."
"Looking at the Commission proposals I am not aware of any particular problem with any of the projects."
"Some of them have been up for discussion for quite some time."
"Many of them take gas into areas of the Community which are not well supplied with it at the moment."
"Of particular importance are the projects which develop gas supplies from Eastern Europe."
"This is important in relation to our growing demand for fuel from that source."
"We have tabled three amendments in committee."
"They have been tabled in order to strengthen the links with offshore islands in the case of Greece and Spain."
"We understand from the discussions in committee that these are not likely to cause any problem for the Commission or for the Council, so the procedures should not be held up because of this."
"There is, however, an aspect of the overall problem which I would like to mention and which the committee feels is important."
"Because this is a legislative text I cannot make reference in the resolution to anything other than the formalities that are laid down by Parliament."
"But the committee feels that we need to have a better link with the broader areas of policy as far as networks are concerned."
"It is all very well providing the networks, but they affect competition policy."
"There is some unease for instance in the electricity sector, and in the gas sector as well, that although we provide networks which in theory can work in two directions, all too often they only operate in one direction."
"There is concern also that the ownership of electricity stations seems to be more easily bought in some countries than in others."
"The way in which the liberalised market operates is certainly more liberal in some countries than in others, and it seems to me and the committee that in approving projects of this type we ought to have more of an assurance that they are in line with the Community's overall competition policy."
"We also feel that we should be looking at how we can extend the electricity grids into Eastern Europe and as far as the former Soviet Union."
"This is the way we ought to be going."
"Not only do technical issues arise in this matter but there are also questions of competition and questions relating to environmental impact."
"We hope that the Commission will look at the whole range of these areas, including oil pipelines - which are not technically part of the network agreement - and bring forward a communication on this subject in the near future."
"We thought we would get gas from the Caspian area very readily."
"We know there are demands from Asia for that."
"The committee welcomes the progress that is being made."
"We look forward to the expansion and integration of these networks with the countries of Eastern Europe."
"Mr President, thank you for allowing me to take part in the Energy Committee's debate."
"There are two things to which I would like to draw attention."
"The first is that there is an inherent conflict in opening the trans-European energy network to former Soviet states."
"These states clearly want to be able to operate in a liberal market and earn money."
"But when, as Parliament's representative, I discuss this with my colleagues in the Lithuanian Parliament, the disagreement is unmistakable."
"They want to earn money and they want access to a liberal market on different terms from those we wish to see."
"This is a conflict."
"Should an Ignalina nuclear power station price-dump on the European market?"
"That is the question my colleagues put to our colleagues in the Lithuanian Parliament, the Seimas."
"And the conflict will intensify later today when we discuss Mr Adam's second report."
"There is an issue of interpretation here when the Lithuanian side maintains that the Copenhagen criteria contain nothing about energy."
"It therefore becomes a debate in which energy is left out of the real negotiations."
"And yet we must maintain the demands for closure, even if our colleagues in the Lithuanian Parliament cannot accept them."
"At the same time, however, we must be realistic, because the funds we are making available and the financing we can offer is peanuts compared to what such an operation will cost."
"I agree with Mr Adam - whom I should like to thank, by the way, for taking part in the meetings with our Lithuanian colleagues - but I stress that we need solutions which take into account the economies of the applicant countries."
"It will not work otherwise."
"I would like to emphasise once again the problem of granting access to a liberal market for some nuclear power stations which should in fact have been closed down a long time ago."
"It creates a conflict in the political situation, in the political negotiations connected with accession."
"Mr President, I do not think that we can combine these reports."
"That is why I have said that it is one thing to talk about trans-European energy networks for gas and electricity, and another thing to talk about the safety of nuclear power stations in Eastern Europe."
"We should not combine the two things because, despite the fact that we are pressed for time, we will not manage to understand anything."
"I would like to say to the Commissioner that, in my opinion, the ongoing activities of the Commission and the Member States in the field of energy are extremely important."
"I particularly welcome the development of the gas and electricity networks as this is essential for the liberalisation of markets, to establish closer relations and to improve the standard of living in the countries involved."
"I agree with all the points made by Mr Adam, which I will not repeat."
"But I would like to point out that it is important to ensure that we have sufficient resources to extend the networks, and we will support all efforts to that effect."
"The 1996 decision, which was reviewed in 1997, included 74 projects."
"The 1999 revision has included a further 17 projects."
"I would like to highlight one of those in particular, which has already been approved by the Council and which was based on an amendment by the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy concerning Spain. It involves strengthening internal connections, which, in turn, will also allow us to improve international exchanges."
"So a great deal is being done, as I mentioned at the beginning, and perhaps some projects are moving too quickly."
"However, all investment in electricity and gas networks will be important, perhaps particularly so in the electricity sector, Commissioner, because it is generally forgotten - or at least, this House tends to forget - that electricity cannot be stored and the service provided has to be immediate, in other words there must be immediate production to meet demand."
"As a result, we have no option but to develop a system of widespread interconnections, to extend our networks and to also include, of course, the countries of Eastern Europe."
"Some people say that we do not cooperate enough with the countries of Eastern Europe."
"We should increase their possibilities of generating electricity."
"We should help them and they should help us."
"I would therefore like to thank you for all your efforts and hope that you continue with them."
"You will have our constant support."
"Mr President, in the short time I have available, I would like to mention one of the key projects of the trans-European energy network."
"I am referring to the project connecting the French and Spanish electricity networks with a high-tension line."
"The line is practically finished and all that remains is to select the connection point to cross the Pyrenees."
"And that is where the problem arises."
"The project involves passing this 400 000 volt electric cable through a natural park, a bird reserve and one of the few virgin valleys in the Pyrenees."
"Naturally, all the political parties in Aragon, the parliament, the government, the trade unions and the chambers of commerce, have directly opposed such a ridiculous plan."
"As a result, this trans-European network project has been paralysed for years."
"I would ask us to apply some common sense, in this case as in others, in order to combine essential energy projects with respect for the environment, sustainable development and, above all, the unanimous wish of those who may be affected, particularly when less traumatic solutions actually exist."
"Mr President, on the subject of using nuclear energy to produce electricity, in recent years we have had two camps: the enthusiastic supporters and the resolute opponents."
"Since the German Government's unambiguous rejection of nuclear power and the announcements by Belgium and Switzerland in recent weeks that they too will not use this technology, we are now faced with a completely new situation."
"This technology no longer has a future."
"In view of the fact that there is also enormous doubt concerning the economic viability of nuclear power stations, as established in the last few days by the Pemelin commission, Euratom loans for the construction of new reactors can no longer be justified."
"For our own safety we must devote all our efforts to setting new parameters in energy supply."
"Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz recognised this clearly."
"Her amendments are a step in the right direction."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Adam, for his excellent report."
"The list of projects of common interest was updated in 1997, when it became necessary to add projects to the list, chiefly to take account of the enlargement of the Community."
"The majority of the amendments and additions that have been put forward by the Commission during the present phase are the result of the rapid development of the situation in Europe, mainly in the gas sector."
"The projects that have been included in the Commission proposal have all been chosen on the basis of their contribution to the general objectives and on the basis of special criteria which determined the direction to be taken in the consultations we had with the industry. Moreover, they are fully in line with the intentions of the Member States, at least insofar as these have been expressed by the experts on energy matters with whom we had the opportunity of holding talks."
"The Commission accepts all the amendments tabled by the European Parliament. In particular, we accept the two amendments for the inclusion of projects concerning the electricity grids in Greece and Spain."
"We fully agree that the additions to this list of plans for projects of common interest are wholly appropriate."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to dwell in particular on the case of Greece."
"We are providing opportunities for the funding of studies and projects to link the islands to each other and also to the Greek mainland."
"I think you will recognise the opportunities that are opening up, not only in respect of the energy balance but also for the use of renewable energy sources and, mainly, of solar and wind energy, which we have in abundance in Greece."
"I also want to highlight the concern expressed in the excellent report produced by Mr Adam regarding the security and the external dimension of the energy networks."
"In the coming months the European Parliament will present a document on the security of the Community energy supply."
"I also want to emphasise that the general issue of the external dimension, especially the issue of connections with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, is a constant concern of the Commission."
"Mr Sindal and Mr Adam had the opportunity to talk about this issue previously."
"Our desire to keep the European Parliament fully informed on all these issues and on all the developments in the years to come remains steadfast."
"Finally, the Commission hopes that the motion for a resolution we have before us will be adopted as soon as possible, so that it will be possible for these projects and especially the feasibility studies to get under way. The latter are necessary to show us to what extent the projects are sustainable and can be incorporated into the energy plans of the European Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, allow me once again to thank Mr Adam for the excellent report he has put before us."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for that clear and concise contribution."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Nuclear sector-related activities for third countries"
"The next item is the report (A4-0088/99) by Mr Adam, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the Commission communication on nuclear sector-related activities for the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the New Independent States (COM(98)0134 - C4-0314/98)."
"Mr President, since 1990 nuclear power has been an important issue for the European Union's relations with the Central and Eastern European countries and the newly independent states."
"This importance is reinforced by the enlargement negotiations."
"The European Parliament has recognised the sovereign right of states to determine their own energy policies, including the nuclear option."
"The European Union has a significant presence in the nuclear activities of the Central and Eastern European countries and the newly independent states."
"There has been undisputed progress in improving the operational safety of nuclear power stations, including the first generation reactors of the RBMK1000 and the VVER230 types."
"These improvements in safety have been achieved particularly by the use of on-site assistance teams, supported by the PHARE and TACIS programmes."
"These have resulted in a radical change in safety culture."
"I would note that this change in safety culture and the increased operational safety cannot be measured in direct monetary terms."
"The fact that these benefits cannot be readily measured, however, does not make them any less real."
"It is becoming increasingly obvious that despite the massive investment of the European Union in the nuclear activities of the Eastern European countries, the European Union cannot dictate policy to other states."
"This includes countries such as the newly independent states as well as those in the first and second wave applicant countries."
"In the case of the Russian Federation, the constant referral to unsafe reactors and the pressure to close these reactors down is somewhat resented."
"To the Russians there are no unsafe reactors; there are only first and second generation reactors."
"The pressure to close down is seen as an unwarranted interference in domestic affairs."
"We should note that all the reactors in the European Union, in Central and Eastern Europe, in Russia and the newly independent states operate to the standards set by the International Atomic Energy Agency and the nuclear conventions which are currently in force."
"It is clear that the use of nuclear energy in these Eastern European countries will continue."
"Many of them have established policies which aim for maximum energy independence and security of supply."
"Many of them do not wish to be dependent on Russia for supplies of oil and gas."
"We must also remember that there are perceived economic advantages to continuing to use existing nuclear stations rather than building new alternatives."
"To add to the complications, some of these countries provide their neighbours with electricity."
"This is true of Lithuania and Bulgaria."
"Bulgaria exports to Turkey something like US $600 million of electricity every year - badly needed currency."
"To press for closure in those circumstances raises considerable resentment."
"Although the European Union has been very active in the nuclear sector, up to now there has been a clear failure of the European Union and G-7 policy."
"Not one unsafe or first generation reactor has been closed as a result of current policy."
"It is clear that the nuclear states of Eastern Europe will continue to pursue the nuclear option."
"Two main factors are responsible for the failure of this policy: firstly, the ambiguity of the agreements and, secondly, the lack of provision for alternative electricity capacity."
"I should also add that there is a lack of consideration of the perceived national security and economic needs of many of these countries."
"Future activity must involve real cooperation and negotiation with the recipients of aid."
"The European Union cannot take a heavy-handed, dictatorial position."
"We cannot impose our will upon those countries."
"We cannot tell them what they must do."
"We have tried this and, I have noted, it does not work."
"It is my profound belief that we can only advance through cooperation and negotiation."
"This negotiation must include an agreed energy strategy for each country in which provision for alternative electricity supply must be a fundamental component."
"Another essential component will be the revision of regulatory standards by the Western European regulatory authorities with the involvement of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the European Commission."
"The ultimate aim of this increased cooperation will be the development of an acquis communautaire for the use of nuclear energy."
"Nuclear safety standards, applicable throughout the European Union, the Central and Eastern European countries and the newly independent states must be the goal."
"We urge the Commission to coordinate its own services much more effectively than it has in the past."
"I hope it will accept that cooperation and not confrontation must underpin our relations with the applicant countries and the newly independent states in relation to nuclear activities."
"First of all, my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Adam, for his first-rate and above all constructive report."
"I would also like to express my appreciation of the intensive debate and positive exchanges of views held in the European Parliament on the difficult subject of nuclear safety."
"The report we are looking at today paints a realistic picture of the scope of the problems and of the difficult task facing anyone working to improve nuclear safety in Central and Eastern Europe."
"Unfortunately, as the report makes clear, change and improvement are not things which can be achieved in the very short term."
"And there are reasons for this."
"First of all, and I heard Mr Adam say the same, the partner countries with which we examine these problems are sovereign states. They set their own energy policy and their own nuclear policy as well."
"Some of them depend very heavily on nuclear energy for their electricity supplies and for export revenue too."
"Mr Adam has also made those points this afternoon."
"A third obstacle is of course the extremely high cost of modernising, not to mention decommissioning, nuclear plants or individual reactors."
"The strategy which has been much discussed, as it was in the report of the European Court of Auditors and the Commission, goes back to the G7 decision of 1992, which was really taken in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster."
"A strategy for nuclear energy was devised at that time to serve as a basis for the Commission's activities in this field too."
"The short-term imperatives were to find practical solutions to the most pressing safety problems which we had identified jointly with the IAEA, for example appointing independent and competent safety authorities and improving reactor safety in both Eastern Europe and the New Independent States."
"For the longer term, emphasis was placed on sustainable improvements to safety, on the one hand by encouraging the decommissioning of the less safe reactors, replacing them with alternative energy sources and improving energy efficiency, and on the other hand by helping to modernise those reactors which could be made safe by modernisation."
"As you know, that was not the case with all nuclear reactors."
"Some of them simply had to be closed down."
"As regards the most pressing safety problems, I am convinced that despite the criticisms which might be made and which have been made, the European Union's efforts have borne fruit and that the money - 800 million or so - was well spent."
"A number of things have been achieved under the nuclear safety programmes."
"To mention just a few: the independent regulatory authorities have been set up or strengthened and the legal framework needed to operate a nuclear safety policy is in place, both in Central Europe and the New Independent States, though the quality of the regulatory authorities varies from country to country."
"Technical solutions have been sought to the most important and most serious design faults in nuclear facilities."
"Exchange and transfer of know-how has led to progress in fostering a culture of nuclear safety in the region."
"This has led to a more formal and regular dialogue between nuclear facility operators and the regulatory authorities, and also to an acceptance of the need to apply high safety standards to the building of new reactors."
"I should also mention the substantial contribution which has been made towards improving operating practice in nuclear facilities and modernising them, in part by the supply of equipment and the promotion of greater awareness of the problem of waste management."
"Lastly, we have helped, and are still helping, to resolve the problems presented by the Chernobyl facility; in addition to the 'shelter implementation plan', the Commission has helped significantly to implement the policy devised by the G7 to achieve closure of Chernobyl by the year 2000."
"In a nutshell, the cost of our work to improve nuclear safety has been between EUR 750 and 850 million."
"The mere cost of building the so-called sarcophagus around the Chernobyl reactor IV, the site of the explosion, is put at between EUR 600 and 800 million."
"This shows the scale of the costs involved, and it has been calculated that the cost of all the modernising and decommissioning work required, just for the dangerous facilities in Central and Eastern Europe, is likely to be between four and five billion euros."
"These are very large sums, so of course the 100 million a year which the Commission has spent on its activities is a relatively small amount."
"Building on the G7 strategy, the Commission will continue its policy of helping the partner countries to modernise those reactors which can be modernised, but it will also continue working towards decommissioning those reactors which cannot be modernised because of fundamental technical or design faults inherent in that reactor type."
"I should stress here that there is a difference in implementation of the policy between the applicant countries and the New Independent States of the former Soviet Union."
"It is obvious that the prospect of Union membership gives us greater leverage over the nuclear policy of the applicant countries."
"We need to realise that closing down rectors is only realistic if broader energy strategies are developed at the same time."
"Mr Adam's report makes that point as well."
"In line with the report's recommendation, the Commission will foster efforts to secure a strategy of this kind as part of the pre-accession strategy for the applicant countries, as well as under the partnership agreement with the countries of the former Soviet Union."
"That is not new."
"We have been working on this with these countries for quite some time now."
"We are also holding talks with Lithuania, Bulgaria and shortly with Armenia."
"These are three countries in which we do not only want to implement these comprehensive energy strategies; they also have nuclear facilities which ought, on the basis of earlier agreements and notably the Nuclear Safety Account, to be closed down."
"We know that these facilities generate much of the electricity in these countries, and we are well aware of the major economic interests which are at stake here if facilities close down, of the loss of important energy export opportunities and of the sacrifices which these countries will be required to make in this area."
"This is why we are seeking, and have sought, to cooperate with the international financial organisations to draw up financing plans which can serve as a basis for international financial aid and the funding of alternative sources of energy."
"And I should emphasis once again that I quite agree with Mr Adam that we must not seek to solve these problems with the countries concerned in a confrontational way."
"Nevertheless, and we are attempting to get this message across to Lithuania and Bulgaria, we are dealing here with earlier decommissioning undertakings which these countries gave in the context of the Nuclear Safety Account, and we are keen to help them face up to the consequences of decommissioning and also to absorb those consequences."
"The Commission has learned a great deal, not only from practical experience and internal audits, but also from the criticisms voiced in various reports of the European Parliament and the Court of Auditors."
"The problems which the programme experienced in the initial phase are now behind us."
"The Commission has drawn on its experience, and on your observations too, to make the necessary changes in the programme's management."
"A propos of that, I should like to offer the following examples."
"Much of the delay in carrying out the programmes was due to the fact that the instruments available were not sufficiently well tailored to the specific requirements of this sector."
"The new TACIS regulation should help to change this."
"It covers the period 2000 to 2006 and has three clear priorities for nuclear safety: to continue fostering the transfer of a culture of safety in the field of nuclear energy; to improve the management of spent fissile materials and nuclear waste, notably in the north-west of Russia; and to contribute to international measures aimed at improving nuclear safety, which is a fairly broad description but naturally has everything to do with further efforts to close down a number of nuclear facilities which are deemed unsafe."
"We hope that Parliament will deliver its opinion on the new regulation in due course, so that it can indeed come into force on 1 January of next year."
"I am more than happy to assure Parliament that we shall report periodically on progress under the PHARE and TACIS programmes on nuclear safety."
"Lastly, it is our firm intention to improve the internal management of the aid programmes."
"The Commission is currently debating a proposal for a nuclear safety task force within the Commission, aimed at better coordination of the ten directorates-general which are concerned to some extent with these issues within the Commission."
"In the light of the discussions during the last part-session, and in order to give a clearer general and more detailed overview of what the Commission has done to date in the field of nuclear safety, we recently sent Parliament's Energy Committee and a number of other committees an 'aide-mémoire' setting out in detail the work already done and further plans for the immediate future."
"I hope that this will in any event have helped to lay a strong foundation for further debate with the European Parliament on this important subject."
". (IT) Mr President, nuclear safety affects millions of people in the European Union and in the Eastern European countries."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, which unanimously adopted my opinion on this report on 27 October 1998, considers that nuclear safety is a crucial element of the pre-accession strategy."
"The Commission stated in Agenda 2000 that nuclear safety was a key objective, given the prospect of EU membership for a number of countries in Central and Eastern Europe. It subdivided nuclear installations into three categories: obsolete reactors of Soviet design which must be closed down definitively; ones which can be upgraded to acceptable levels of safety; and, lastly, the few reactors of Western design, which can remain in service provided that high safety standards are maintained in the long term."
"It emerges from the Court of Auditors' special report that only ECU 300 million of the 850 m made available for the period 1990-1997 were spent by the CEECs on nuclear safety."
"Crucial upgrading and restructuring work must therefore be carried out under PHARE and TACIS."
"The safety standards of these power plants must be inspected by an independent authority recognised by the IAEA and the EU."
"In view of the recommissioning of one of the Chernobyl nuclear reactors, the countries applying for EU membership and the countries formed by the collapse of the Soviet Union must provide Europe as a whole with safety guarantees, in full awareness of the economic and social implications of such statements."
"I repeat that nuclear safety is a crucial element of the pre-accession strategy."
"Unless guarantees are provided, accession could represent a risk to our collective safety."
"It is therefore the hope of the Foreign Affairs Committee that all available financial resources will be used to mount programmes aimed at solving the question of nuclear safety in Europe once and for all."
"I am also speaking directly on behalf of the Liberal Group and not just for the REX Committee, because otherwise I would not have three and a half minutes."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, my compliments to Mr Adam on his report."
"It is in a way his swan song, I would say."
"It is not easy to get everyone to adopt the same line on matters of nuclear energy, but I think in this case he has succeeded very well."
"The Union's energy policy vis-à-vis the countries of Central and Eastern Europe is focused on the safe operation of the existing nuclear facilities."
"Under the objectives of Agenda 2000, Soviet-designed reactors which cannot be modernised at reasonable cost must be decommissioned, because these reactors are unsafe."
"But in fact not one reactor in Eastern Europe has been closed down since 1992."
"Even the Chernobyl reactors I and II, although they have been inoperative for a number of years now, are still not regarded as having been decommissioned by the Ukrainian Government, despite all the resolutions passed by the European Parliament."
"Sovereign states are entitled to determine the main lines of their energy policy, says the rapporteur."
"But that does not mean that the Union has to stand quietly by and see our resolutions ignored."
"If the Union puts money into Eastern Europe through aid programmes and loans, then we may be able to influence the strategy followed and give an advantage to certain forms of energy over others."
"That is one of the few instruments the Union has for forcing unsafe nuclear facilities to close, and we should make use of such instruments."
"The safety of existing facilities should also be used as an essential criterion for accession to the Union."
"My second point concerns the Court of Auditors' report on measures taken by the European Union in the field of nuclear safety in Eastern Europe."
"The Commissioner has outlined these for us in detail."
"The members of the REX Committee were shocked by the report's conclusions. We have said as much previously."
"We appreciate that it is not easy for the Commission to operate in the former Eastern bloc, given the degree of red tape there and the complexity of the nuclear industry."
"But precisely because of that, the Commission should have shown greater care in implementing these programmes."
"Greater use should be made of the specialist know-how available on the spot in Eastern Europe."
"That brings me to my final point, and I have a question for Commissioner van den Broek."
"A few weeks ago, in response to a question of mine, your colleagues told the REX Committee and the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy that they were busy on an inventory of the millennium problem, checking the millennium compliance of the computers in the facilities in Central and Eastern Europe."
"So when, Commissioner, can we expect a report here in Parliament on the millennium compliance of the nuclear facilities in Central and Eastern Europe?"
"I ask this because we are already almost a quarter of the way through 1999, and 1 January 2000 is the crucial date."
"I would be glad to hear your answer."
"In reply to Mrs Plooij, we have made funds available to the IAEA, which is naturally far better qualified to conduct this inventory than we are."
"You are actually asking the Commission to do something which we were unable to do in the past and will be unable to do in the future either."
"We simply do not have the know-how or the people to prepare an inventory of this kind."
"That is why we said we would support the IAEA in all the relevant work it did here, and that is exactly what we are doing."
"I believe the IAEA is organising a forum on these issues, and I promise to report back to you on it."
"We shall adjourn the debate at this point for Question Time. It will be resumed this evening at 9 p.m."
"Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz has a point of order."
"Mr President, would you please be so good as to ask the Commission to be present this evening for the debate on this very important topic?"
"The Commission talked longer this afternoon than all the Members put together, and as a result it is not possible for us to continue the debate now."
"I would ask you to urge the Commission to ensure that it is present this evening so that we can continue."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is questions to the Council (B4-0144/99)."
"As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 1, 2 and 3 will be taken together."
"Question No 1 by Richard Corbett (H-0115/99)"
"Subject: Cost to the taxpayer of the abolition of duty-free sales In reviewing the decision to phase out duty-free sales by July 1999, will the Council consider the loss to national exchequers of revenue arising from duty-free sales and the corresponding benefit of ending duty-free sales?"
"Is the Council aware that, for the UK alone, duty-free sales account for some GBP 1 billion per annum and that this represents a loss in terms of excise duty and VAT of at least an equal amount?"
"Is the Council aware that this represents a shortfall of about GBP 40 per taxpayer?"
"Question No 2 by Mark Watts (H-0135/99)"
"Subject: Duty-free salesThe Commission will present to the ECOFIN Council on 15 March 1999 its report on addressing the employment problems resulting from any abolition of intra-EU duty-free sales."
"This fulfils part of the instructions from the Heads of State at the Vienna Summit."
"If the Commission does not include the possibility of an extension to the transitional arrangements for duty-free sales in its report, will the Council Presidency ask the Commission to bring forward proposals for an extension, in order to meet the reference to a possible extension set out in the conclusions of the Vienna Summit?"
"Question No 3 by John Cushnahan (H-0179/99)"
"Subject: Duty-freeOn 17 February the Commission presented its Communication as a response to the EU leaders' request at the Vienna Summit."
"In the document the Commission shows an aggregate job loss figure of 56 000 based on figures of direct job losses from 10 Member States and indirect job losses from a mere 7 states."
"The document subsequently suggests that any potential job losses arising from duty-free abolition are not 'significant' and are not of a 'macro-economic level'."
"Does the European Council share this view?"
"I should like to welcome Mr Verheugen and ask him to answer these Members' questions together."
"Mr President, in accordance with the conclusions of the European Council in Vienna, in the course of this month the Council will be examining what problems may arise as a result of the abolition of duty-free sales in intra-Community travel by air and sea."
"The Council will at the same time try to find appropriate ways to deal with this situation on the basis of Commission proposals."
"Meanwhile, I can inform the honourable Members that the Council received a Commission communication on this issue on 19 February 1999."
"The Council would however like to emphasise that when examining this communication it will take into account all relevant aspects of the conclusions of the Vienna Council."
"I should like to thank the President-in-Office for that answer."
"When the Council reviews the decision on duty-free it will no doubt be looking at the problem raised, rightly, by several governments about the need to have a workable successor regime in place."
"Does he agree that the review should also look at the cost to public finances if the duty-free regime were to be continued?"
"Duty-free is a tax break, and a costly tax break, largely for the benefit of the tobacco and alcohol industries."
"Surely the President-in-Office can think of some better causes - if the finance ministers have extra money at their disposal - than a tax break for the tobacco industry and the alcohol industry."
"Mr Corbett, I can confirm that the Council will consider all relevant aspects when assessing this issue, as I said."
"This includes not only the effects of the abolition of duty-free on the labour market and the economy as a whole, but of course also the consequences of revoking or changing a decision taken in the European Union."
"So I can reassure you that all aspects will be taken into account, including the question of whether it is correct and justifiable from a social point of view to abolish a privilege that has until now been available to very ordinary people and is the only privilege available to this section of the population. Here I am referring in particular to people who do not have high incomes and usually do not have access to privileges of any kind, be they tax-related or others."
"That will also be included in the full examination to be undertaken by the Council this month."
"I should also like to thank the President-in-Office for his very full answer and, indeed, thank the German presidency for trying to review the whole sorry duty-free saga."
"Would the German presidency explain the details of the German compromise, which we believe is currently under discussion in Council working groups?"
"It would help the House greatly if we could have details of the German compromise proposal tonight, before ECOFIN next week."
"Secondly, would he comment on what the legal basis would be for the possibility of an extension to the transitional arrangements?"
"Finally, would he give a view on how, in view of the very tight timescale until the end of June this year and the fact that we have European Parliament elections in the intervening period, the Council and the Commission will be consulting this Parliament on their proposals - which we hope will be forthcoming from ECOFIN or from Berlin - on a extension to the duty-free regime?"
"Mr Watts, the issue you mentioned has now been discussed twice by the Heads of State and Government."
"So you can see how important it is in political terms."
"Considerable time was devoted to the issue both in Vienna and at the Petersberg meeting in Bonn."
"It is therefore certainly a central issue in European politics."
"The Federal Chancellor did indeed put forward a German compromise proposal which involves examining whether a one-off three-year extension of the duty-free regime - that was the original proposal - would be possible."
"We are currently investigating whether a legal basis exists for this."
"I am not giving anything away if I say that an immediate reaction to this proposal was that we should perhaps also consider extending it for two and a half years or for three and a half years."
"This has to do with holiday periods in Europe and is related to the timing of the decision."
"We are currently looking into whether or not this is possible, and I cannot inform you of the outcome of this investigation as it has not yet been concluded."
"Mr President, it is unbelievable that the Commission rejected our claim about job losses and yet in its communication to the Council when seven Member States supplied complete data on direct and indirect job losses it concluded that about 50 000 jobs would be sacrificed on abolition."
"I would like to remind the presidency that at the Bonn Summit the EU Heads of State and of Government quite rightly rejected the Commission's assertion that job losses could be protected by the application of Community funding and state subsidies and that a 30-month extension would be necessary to identify the problems associated with the post-duty-free regime and to put in place a workable solution to protect employees in that sector."
"I would like to ask the Council to comment on the fact that a growing number of Member States have expressed serious concern regarding the success of the regime, and that the Commission's recent statement that there is unanimous agreement that the current legislation 'provides a clear, simple and easily enforceable solution' is totally misleading."
"The Council, or rather in this case the presidency, is of course aware of the status of discussions in the Council bodies, and it is also aware of the views of the individual Member States."
"I have to agree with you that we have a broad spectrum of different opinions, both on what course of action should be taken and on the consequences of the various possible decisions."
"So there are some Member States who fear enormous negative consequences if we abolish duty-free, and there are others who say that these consequences will not arise."
"There are others who say that there will certainly be consequences, but we must ensure that we come up with a way of softening the blow."
"There is a broad spectrum here."
"I believe it makes sense to gather all the facts first and analyse them, and to attempt to reach agreement, which is always very important."
"We must see whether the facts and figures form a common basis and, if so, we must use this common basis to find a solution."
"You know what the legal situation is: there is a decision in force, and this would have to be revoked or replaced by another if we now wanted to take a different course of action."
"This can only be done by unanimous assent."
"The requirement of unanimity is to be taken particularly seriously in this context as it is a factor that will be relevant in assessing what is to be done."
"This is also why the Federal Chancellor, in his capacity as Council President, made the compromise proposal I just described, as he recognised or believed it likely that unanimity probably cannot be achieved for an amended decision."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his reply to the questions so far."
"I am grateful to him for reminding us that any prolongation of duty-free would require unanimity and I sense that unanimity is not likely to be forthcoming."
"May I also remind him that the job losses referred to are widely exaggerated."
"The figure of 56 000 was referred to in Mr Cushnahan's question."
"That appears nowhere in the Commission's study and it contrasts with the figure of 120 000 job losses put about by the duty-free lobby."
"So, would the President-in-Office please give us an undertaking that he and the Federal Finance Minister and the Federal Chancellor will not be persuaded by the powerful lobbying of what Mr Corbett has referred to as the 'cigarette and alcohol' lobby?"
"Mr Cassidy, if your question was whether I believe that I can persuade the German Finance Minister to do something, then my answer has to be that I do not know."
"Laughter"
"Mr President, it is quite obvious that there is a strong, powerful lobby on the side of those who are against abolishing duty-free, while there is no-one on the other side because it is made up of small groups and small businesses."
"I wonder whether account will be taken of the consequences that will arise if duty-free is allowed to continue."
"Will that not destroy many more jobs in small businesses that are not in the right place and do not have the opportunities available to all the other large firms?"
"Mr von Habsburg, I cannot disagree with what you said."
"It is one of the aspects of a controversy that we could now almost describe as ideologically charged."
"You noted this yourself very clearly in your question."
"There are profoundly different views here, including on the structural impact. I do not deny that by any means."
"I do not believe I can tell you anything other than that it appears to be necessary, before a final decision is taken on whether to extend the transitional arrangements, to ensure that the economic and social consequences of these decisions are clearly identified, in detail and very precisely, so that the decision can be taken responsibly."
"This must be examined for both options, and in my opinion the examination must include, as you suggested, the actual consequences of the continuation of duty-free on the SME-based retail sector, for example, in certain Member States and in the areas in question."
"There is no doubt that this is necessary."
"The question is very difficult to answer, Mr von Habsburg, because some people claim that the sales in question are impulse buys or purchases that are only made because they are available."
"They will not be substituted by purchases elsewhere."
"I do not know if it is correct that pensioners will only buy butter and coffee on ships if they are slightly cheaper."
"But these are all just theories, and we have market research and all sorts of things here, all of which must be examined."
"I hope that the results will soon be available so that the issue can be resolved before it begins to seriously disrupt European politics."
"Mr President, I would like to reassure Mr Cassidy that there will be many thousands of job losses, not least, regrettably, in my own constituency of North Essex and South Suffolk because of the airport at Stansted and the seaport at Harwich."
"My question to the President is this: is he aware of how unbelievably complicated the scheme is going to be if the decision goes ahead to abolish duty-free sales from 1 July?"
"It will, in fact, mean that different prices for the same product will be charged depending on which airspace or which territorial waters the flight or the vessel is travelling through."
"What does he propose?"
"I cannot believe he means this regime to be in place in the manner intended."
"Surely there must be a temporary delay until such time as proper rules have been brought in; otherwise it will make complete nonsense of the application of the decision."
"Mr President, Mrs McIntosh, I freely admit that any future rules will probably be complicated."
"However, I do not envisage the complication you have just described, particularly not in air travel."
"We board a plane in A and disembark in B, and if A and B are both within the European Community the problem does not arise, as in this case there can be no duty-free sales."
"If B is outside the European Community this opportunity does exist; it is relatively simple."
"If a ship travels from one EU country to another and in doing so crosses the waters of a third country, it may be somewhat more complicated, and I am not currently in a position to say how we should deal with this problem."
"However, I do not see a problem for air travel."
"As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 4 and 5 will be taken together."
"Question No 4 by Paul Rübig (H-0116/99)"
"Subject: Increase in parliamentary powers of control through the next amendment of the Treaties Discussions in recent weeks have shown that both the EU's institutional order and the actual policies pursued call for a modern system of checks and balances."
"The European Parliament has proved that it is willing and able, as the Community's only directly legitimised institution, to perform the control tasks demanded by its citizens."
"The requirement that the Commission resign as a body if a vote of no-confidence is passed and the European Parliament's lack of authority to dismiss a Member of the Commission from office no longer seem in keeping with the times."
"The need for individual political accountability requires an adjustment of the legislation concerned."
"How does the Council's representative view the prospects for eliminating these shortcomings at the next intergovernmental conference on the amendment of the Treaties?"
"Question No 5 by Karl Habsburg-Lothringen (H-0194/99)"
"Subject: Responsibility of CommissionersBy what means is the Council planning to make provision for the individual responsibility of Commissioners?"
"When in its view will it be possible for Commissioners to be confirmed individually by the European Parliament and, where necessary, also to be called to account individually?"
"I give the floor to the President-in-Office to answer these questions by Mr Rübig and Mr Habsburg-Lothringen together."
"The questions posed by both honourable Members contain proposals whose implementation would require an amendment of the Treaties."
"Such possible amendments of the Treaties do not fall within the Council's field of competence."
"In accordance with Article N of the Treaty on European Union, or Article 48 of the EU Treaty after the Amsterdam Treaty comes into force, the government of any Member State or the Commission may submit proposals for the amendment of the Treaties to the Council."
"After consulting the European Parliament and, where appropriate, the Commission, the role of the Council is confined to delivering an opinion in favour of calling a conference of representatives of the governments of the Member States, which is then convened by the President of the Council."
"Treaty amendments agreed jointly by the representatives of the governments of the Member States only enter into force after being ratified by all the Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements."
"Mr President, at the next Council following the report by the Committee of Independent Experts - which has apparently been published in the Belgian press today - will the Council institute compulsory retirement proceedings for individual Commissioners in accordance with Article 160, or will the European Parliament have to pass a vote of no-confidence in the Commission as a whole, including the majority of Commissioners who do excellent work?"
"Mr President, Mr Rübig, I regret that I am not in a position to answer this hypothetical question."
"The question is hypothetical because the Council presidency does not yet know the contents of the report, which is due to be published next week, and without knowing the content, structure and recommendations of this report it is absolutely impossible to comment today on whether and how the Council will deal with it and what conclusions it might draw."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, I will try not to ask a hypothetical question. Instead, I wish to ask about your personal views."
"You cited the paragraphs that need to be changed."
"Now I would ask you whether you really see the need for the Treaties to be amended in this way in view of recent events."
"Mr President, I do not believe I am authorised to answer this question."
"I have been asked about my personal views, but these are of absolutely no relevance to the European Parliament."
"It is only what I can tell you about the opinion of the Council, in my capacity as President-in-Office, that is of relevance."
"I regret that I cannot tell you my personal views."
"I can only give you answers that must be agreed with all the Member States, and for this reason my answer to this question must be no, I cannot give you my personal views."
"Mr President, I hope the President-in-Office of the Council will indulge us in putting forward possibilities for the next IGC even if he is not yet in a position to react formally to them."
"Surely one of the questions coming out of the recent events is whether the President of the Commission should have the right to dismiss individual members of the Commission."
"In a national government, if a minister is guilty of serious misconduct or mismanagement but refuses to resign, then the leader of the government concerned can dismiss him or her."
"In the European Commission, were that situation ever to arise, the President of the Commission does not have the possibility of asking that member to resign or leave the Commission."
"Surely that would be the appropriate Treaty amendment to bring forward in the next IGC."
"If the circumstances arose and then the President of the Commission did not use that power we could then censure the Commission as a whole."
"Mr Corbett, I will be very specific."
"The presidency does not so far intend, in its proposal for the European Council in Cologne in June, to go beyond what was left over from Amsterdam."
"To date, the position of the presidency has been that we must now make a procedural proposal on how these remaining issues are to be dealt with, in other words on how and when the next intergovernmental conference will take place and with what agenda."
"The agenda we have hitherto envisaged includes the composition of the Commission, qualified majority voting in the Council and the weighting of votes in the Council."
"The presidency does not currently intend to make any other proposals to the Council in Cologne."
"To Mr Rübig, I would first like to say that I do not believe Parliament fulfilled its responsibilities, because we should have sacked the whole Commission in January, but that is by the way."
"To the President-in-Office, I would like to say that I do not think Mr Rübig was asking a hypothetical question."
"The question can easily be answered, regardless of the outcome next month of the investigation into the Commission which is currently in progress."
"We know the answer very well."
"We cannot fire the whole Commission."
"You must also be able to give that answer."
"I seem to remember that in his speech Mr Fischer said the German Presidency was in favour of giving Parliament increased powers, which would in fact be equivalent to it becoming a real parliament and the Commission becoming a real government."
"Have I understood correctly?"
"Is that really what Mr Fischer said in his speech here in Parliament?"
"Mrs Sandbæk, I can explain that very easily."
"There are two separate issues which must be distinguished here. Firstly, there is a long-term process of change in the European institutions and in relations between them, with greater democratic legitimacy, improved democratic control and increased transparency."
"This is the constitutional process - as I would like to call it - that is ongoing in Europe and with which we will be dealing for many years to come."
"The decisions that have to be made at various stages must be seen as a separate issue because they are related to other decisions."
"This is the case with the famous 'left-overs' that I mentioned, which are directly linked to the process of enlargement."
"There was a general consensus in the EU that these remaining issues would have to be dealt with before the accession of the first new Member State."
"The question of when this will happen is of great political importance, since the speed with which we act on this, or our failure to do so, will send out a signal to the states wishing to join the Union."
"If we now say that we will deal with these remaining issues at the same time as the far-reaching constitutional matters, which you addressed and I touched upon, then it means that they will not be resolved for some considerable time, which will be too late for the states wishing to join the Union."
"This is why we want to restrict ourselves in Cologne to saying how and when and to what extent we want to make the decisions that need to be taken in relation to enlargement, but also to start broader discussions on the issues that you mentioned."
"Of course the question of strengthening the role of Parliament in the European Union is crucial here."
"I would also point out that the rights of Parliament will already be increased considerably with the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, which is scheduled for 1 June."
"But we see that as an ongoing process."
"I am very concerned by Mr Rübig's supplementary question."
"Mr Rübig referred to today's Belgian newspapers and asked the President-in-Office if the Council had any reaction to what appears in the Belgian newspapers today."
"I am concerned because I have not read today's Belgian newspapers and I do not know what they say."
"I do not normally buy them here."
"I would like to ask the President-in-Office if Belgian newspapers form part of Community law or if the President-in-Office intends to incorporate them into Community law at the next intergovernmental conference."
"It is hard enough work for me to follow Community law through the Official Journal and if I also have to read the Belgian newspapers, I will have even more work to do."
"Mr Medina Ortega, the presidency will not make decisions on the basis of publications in the Belgian press, nor on the basis of publications in any other newspapers. Instead, it will base its decisions on documents."
"We do not consider a document to be something that is written by a newspaper but something that we receive officially from a European body, from Parliament or from the Commission."
"Newspapers play an important role in Europe."
"They are essential in a Europe of freedom and democracy, but they are not an EU body."
"It is also better both for them and for us that they do not become one."
"So I can assure you that your fears are unfounded."
"Thank you for making that clear, Mr Verheugen."
"Question No 6 by Michael Hindley (H-0124/99)"
"Subject: Visa-free access for Hong Kong passport holders In the context of the EP report on Hong Kong, the European Parliament adopted a resolution urging the Member States to grant visa-free access to Hong Kong passport holders."
"In response, the Commission noted that, pending the introduction of a common visa list, the Commission had no direct responsibility over EU visa policy but that it strongly supported Hong Kong's efforts to secure visa-free access for HKSAR passport holders."
"Would the Council inform us what action has been taken in response to Parliament's resolution?"
"When will the question of visa-free access for HKSAR passport holders be considered by the Member States?"
"Furthermore, what are the attitudes of Member States on the subject?"
"Has any Member State indicated unwillingness to grant visa-free access to HKSAR passport holders?"
"I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer this question tabled by Mr Hindley, which has been taken over here this evening by Mr Newens."
"Mr Newens, I would like to say firstly that the visa system for Hong Kong residents continues to be governed by Regulation (EC) No 2317/95."
"The regulation was declared invalid by the European Court of Justice, but its legal effects were expressly maintained."
"As Hong Kong inhabitants are not included in the common list of nationalities requiring visas for entry to the European Union, under Article 2 of this regulation it is the Member States alone which decide the entry requirements."
"On the basis of information supplied by the Member States, the Commission has drawn up a summary of current visa requirements for nationalities not included in the common list, which was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 3 April 1998, page 4 et seq ."
"According to this, only Ireland and the United Kingdom currently do not require a visa from holders of passports of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region."
"The other Member States have announced that they will apply the same visa requirement rules that apply to China to residents of Hong Kong."
"The Council intends, with the involvement of the European Parliament, to adopt an amended regulation on the common visa list, so that Hong Kong residents would no longer be subject to a common visa requirement in the EU Member States."
"The Member States would continue to decide themselves what entry rules to apply to Hong Kong residents."
"I hope you will understand that I cannot comment on the national visa policies of the Member States, nor, in particular, on what their future policies are likely to be."
"My colleague, Mr Hindley, apologises for his inability to be present."
"From what we have heard, a decision on Hong Kong is being held up."
"Is it realistic to hold this up, when there is no threat of a large-scale influx of illegal immigrants, merely because there are fears as far as other countries are concerned?"
"In view of the fact that the Hong Kong authorities have made strenuous efforts to make their travel document difficult to forge and that there is the issue of reciprocity, from which European travellers to Hong Kong benefit, is there not a special case at this point to make progress on this issue, which would strengthen relations between the European Union and Hong Kong and, for that matter, between Europe and China?"
"Mr Newens, we could spend a long time discussing whether the decision that has been taken is realistic or not, and whether the concerns or considerations that led to this decision are correct or not."
"The fact is that it has been decided in this way."
"The current rule will continue to apply, so visa-free access or visa requirements for Hong Kong residents entering the European Union will be decided at national level by the Member States."
"It is the exclusive right of the Member States to decide what criteria they apply in reaching this decision, and they should most certainly use all the information available to them, including the information you mentioned regarding the problem of forgery and security."
"President-in-Office, I want to support the initiative of my colleague, Mr Hindley, and the remarks of my colleague, Mr Newens."
"As Parliament's rapporteur on Hong Kong, I am fully behind what they are asking in the House today."
"Bearing in mind the President-in-Office's comments about the exclusive right of Member States, would he not also accept that the policy of the European Union is support for the concept of one country, two systems?"
"Respecting the right of individual Member States, would the Council not coordinate a policy which grants visa-free access, which, in my view, is the total implementation of the concept of one country, two systems?"
"Yes, I have to answer that question in the affirmative."
"On the whole, it is true that we should aspire to a common entry policy and, more generally, a common immigration policy within the European Union."
"We have that for the Schengen Area, and I hope that it will be extended."
"However, this does not change the situation that now exists in relation to Hong Kong."
"The legal situation within the European Union is such that the issue of whether Hong Kong residents require a visa for entry to an EU Member State is a national one."
"It is not something that can be decided at European level because the Member States are not currently willing to transfer the decision to European level."
"We can only guess at the reasons for this, as I am sure you are aware."
"Question No 7 by Arthur Newens (H-0126/99)"
"Subject: The EU banana regime Would the Council make a statement about the latest developments in the dispute with the United States and other parties over the EU's banana regime?"
"I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mr Newens's question."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 4 March the Permanent Representatives Committee noted with approval the condemnation by Sir Leon Brittan, the Commissioner responsible for trade policy, of the unilateral measures taken by the United States on 3 March."
"The Council supports the Commission in taking all possible measures within the framework of the WTO to protect EU interests, and is to discuss the developments further."
"The Council has regularly discussed current developments in the banana dispute."
"Between Council meetings there has been constant close cooperation with the Commission in the 113 Committee and in particular with the ambassadors in Brussels."
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his reply which is in support of the position of the Commission."
"However, does the Council accept that it will be regarded as an acid test whether the European Union is prepared to stand by poor producers in developing countries, in particular the Caribbean where they have no effective alternative means of livelihood, or give in to United States pressure on behalf of the large multinational companies who already control most of the market and have used their wealth to lobby major American parties?"
"Its attitude on this issue could be a precedent for other cases."
"Can the President-in-Office therefore assure us that there will be no climb down whatsoever on this very vital issue?"
"Mr Newens, I would like to inform you that the Council has always held the view, and still does today, that this problem can only be solved within the framework of the WTO."
"The European Union has therefore asked a WTO panel to examine whether its banana regime complies with WTO rules, and the EU is prepared to accept and abide by the panel's decision."
"Only when this decision is announced can the WTO arbitrators decide on the US request for authorisation to impose sanctions, for example."
"Mr President, if the WTO panel does not decide in our favour, what will the consequences be for the firms that have had to pay the tariff sanctions?"
"Will you ensure that claims for compensation made by these firms against the US Government are pursued?"
"Mr Rübig, I am not yet aware of any definite position on this issue."
"As far as I know, no decision has yet been taken."
"I will have to give you a written reply to this question."
"Question No 8 by Nikitas Kaklamanis (H-0131/99)"
"Subject: 'Euro-tax', social dimension of the EU and environmental protection There are certain misgivings within the EU about the level of Member States' financial contributions to the Union budget."
"Has the Council considered the possibility of imposing a 'Euro-tax' as a levy on the movement of speculative capital and on a number of luxury goods consumed by high-income groups in the Union?"
"Might such a 'Euro-tax' be an option for consideration when the EU's system of own resources is revised, with the resultant revenue being used as a source of funding for the social dimension of the EU and for environmental protection?"
"I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mr Kaklamanis's question."
"As you know, Mr Kaklamanis, the Council can only consider adopting new legislation on the basis of a proposal from the Commission."
"No Commission proposal has yet been submitted to the Council on the issue you mentioned."
"Mr President-in-Office, your reply related to the formal aspect of the matter, which I am well aware of, but my question was more on a political level."
"You belong to a body to which 14 other governments belong, 13 of whom declare themselves to be Socialist governments."
"They declare that they are Socialists, but in fact they are neo-Liberals."
"A few days ago I read the election manifesto of the Party of European Socialists which talks of a social Europe."
"Are you aware that this year budget spending on a social Europe has fallen?"
"Can you tell me what the political strategy of the Council is to find money for the social face of Europe and for the protection of the environment?"
"Can you tell me whether you intend to debate with the Commission the imposition of tax on speculative capital, so that, with this money, we can help to produce a social Europe and protect the environment?"
"Please do not answer me on the formal procedure, which I am already aware of."
"Mr Kaklamanis, I have to agree with you."
"Because of the current political landscape in Europe - which I need not describe further as you have already done so - it has fortunately become possible to develop fresh momentum in the areas of social justice, employment policy and the environmental market economy."
"A huge effort is being made in all these areas, and in all these areas the German Presidency is extremely active."
"One example is the European Employment Pact that is to be adopted at the summit in Cologne."
"Another is the development of a European charter of fundamental rights, in which special attention will be paid to social rights."
"I could add many more to this list."
"My answer to your question is therefore emphatically yes: in European politics today we are seeing a clear trend towards focusing on social and environmental matters."
"As the author is not present, Question No 9 lapses."
"As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 10, 11 and 12 will be taken together."
"Question No 10 by Mihail Papayannakis (H-0141/99)"
"Subject: Abduction of Öcalan After his futile attempts to find political asylum in any Member State of the European Union or to be tried by an international court (which was a desirable objective according to statements by the Italian and German Foreign Ministers reported in Agence Europe No. 73530), the PKK leader, A. Öcalan, fled to Kenya from where he was abducted and taken to Turkey."
"Does the Council consider that Mr Öcalan's human rights have so far been respected, regardless of its views on his representativeness or his political opinions?"
"Does his abduction without his consent (statement by the Kenyan Foreign Minister of 16 February 1999) not constitute a violation of international law - and even an act of state terrorism - and what view does the Council take of such an act being perpetrated by a country which has applied for membership of the EU?"
"In the light of these events, can it be guaranteed that Mr Öcalan will remain alive and receive a trial worthy of a country governed by the rule of law?"
"Question No 11 by Alexandros Alavanos (H-0163/99)"
"Subject: The Öcalan case and the Kurdish problemIn the light of the latest developments in the Öcalan case and on the basis of its resolutions and decisions on applications for the granting of asylum (Council Resolution 20/6/1995, Agreement 97/C254/01), will the Council say how it judges the obstructive policies pursued by Member States of the European Union and their essential refusal to grant political asylum to the Kurdish leader Abdullah Öcalan?"
"Was it not incumbent upon the Council to adopt a clear position on this matter before Öcalan fell into the hands of Turkish 'justice'?"
"What pressure does the Council intend to exert on Turkey to ensure that the Kurdish leader receives a fair and public trial and that his life is spared?"
"What initiatives does it intend to take to convoke an international conference aimed at finding a solution to the Kurdish problem?"
"Question No 12 by Ioannis Theonas (H-0184/99)"
"Subject: Conditions of detention and threat to the physical and mental integrity and life of Abdullah ÖcalanSerious misgivings have been expressed about the conditions in which the Kurdish leader, Abdullah Öcalan, is being held in custody; it is also feared that his physical, mental and intellectual integrity, as well as his life, are under threat."
"Recently, moreover, the Turkish authorities themselves announced that Mr Öcalan had serious heart problems, possibly as a result of the conditions under which he is held."
"The fact also that he is being subjected to legal proceedings while under the influence of psychoactive drugs which prevent him from acting and speaking freely, rendering him unrecognisable, is a blatant mockery of justice. Will the Council, therefore, say how it will react to this flagrant violation of the rights and dignity of the prisoner and what measures it will take to enable Abdullah Öcalan to be examined by independent medical experts in order to guarantee his physical and mental integrity throughout his detention and trial, safeguarding the right of the prisoner to his dignity and his life?"
"I give the floor to the President-in-Office to answer Questions Nos 10, 11 and 12 together."
"Mr President, I would like, if I may, to answer the questions separately but in summary form."
"I will firstly answer the various questions raised by Mr Papayannakis."
"The Council would refer to the statement issued by the European Union on 22 February 1999, in which the European Union notes the assurances of the Turkish Government that Abdullah Öcalan will receive a fair trial."
"The European Union expects this to include fair and proper treatment and a public and legal trial before an independent court, access to a legal adviser of his choice and the admission of international observers to the trial."
"It is not currently possible for the Council to judge whether Öcalan's abduction from Kenya constitutes a violation of international law, as you stated in your question, or, as you also said, perhaps an act of state terrorism."
"The Council does not have access to any clear and definite information concerning the way in which Abdullah Öcalan was brought to Turkey."
"It is therefore not possible to assess this."
"As to whether it can be guaranteed that Mr Öcalan will remain alive and receive a trial worthy of a country governed by the rule of law, I would refer you to the first part of my answer - the EU's demands in terms of the nature of the trial - and I would also point out that the EU has once again expressed its total rejection of the death penalty in the statement I mentioned earlier."
"Moving on now to the question raised by Mr Alavanos, the first part of your question refers to the asylum problem."
"I must point out that the implementation of asylum procedures falls within the competence of the individual Member States and the Council cannot comment on them."
"In reply to your second question I would refer to the EU statement of 22 February 1999 which notes the Turkish Government's assurances that Abdullah Öcalan will receive a fair trial."
"I must reiterate what I said in my answer to the first question concerning the demands being made of Turkey on this point, and I would also repeat what I said about the death penalty. I would add that the European Union expects Turkey to solve these problems by political means and with full respect for human rights and the rule of law in a democratic society."
"In this context, the European Union welcomes all genuine efforts to combat terrorism and to approach political solutions in such a way as to allow the reconciliation of the people concerned and a solution to the conflict."
"In reply to the question raised by Mr Theonas I would say that the Council has not received any information that Abdullah Öcalan's rights are being violated in the course of the investigation and legal proceedings."
"According to a press release by the Council of Europe on 4 March 1999, a delegation from the anti-torture committee was allowed to visit the prisoner in private."
"The Council has not been informed of the outcome of this visit."
"In its statement of 22 February 1999, the European Union said that it expects the Turkish Government's assurances about a fair trial to include fair and proper treatment."
"I would like to apologise for being late, but in this House we sometimes have to attend two meetings at the same time."
"Let me begin by thanking the President-in-Office for the information he has provided. However, one issue has yet to be dealt with."
"I would point out first of all that we are also opposed to terrorism."
"One of the most serious problems affecting our country, Spain, is terrorism, although the situation there fortunately seems to be improving. So we too are opposed to terrorism."
"However, a group of Members went to Turkey last week to visit Mr Öcalan's lawyers, whose lives are in danger. They learnt there that Mr Öcalan is not as well as he should be physically and that his personal safety is clearly not guaranteed."
"Mr President-in-Office, how does the Council plan to develop the general conditions needed for a political solution to the Kurdish problem, a problem that is not going to end with Mr Öcalan?"
"Thank you, Mrs González."
"I must tell you that, some years ago, a well-known Cuban singer had a hit with a song that could almost be applied in your case: it was about how to have two meetings at once without going mad."
"So, be wise and only have one meeting at a time."
"Mr Verheugen, I would ask you to respond to the supplementary question by Mrs González."
"Mrs González Álvarez, I would like to divide my answer into two parts, discussing firstly the Öcalan case and secondly the broader question."
"With regard to the Öcalan case, you may rest assured that the Council will keep a constant eye on this case and will comment or take action as developments require."
"The Council will also take careful note of all information concerning the progress of the trial and the treatment of Öcalan, and will consider whether this information requires it to take action."
"So I can assure you that this problem will be given regular and continued attention."
"With regard to the broader issue, I have to point out that, as you know, Turkey has always rejected what it calls the internationalisation of the Kurdish problem."
"Turkey also regards comments made on this subject as inadmissible interference in its internal affairs and has to date not been prepared to talk to the European Union or anyone else about the Kurdish issue."
"You probably know better than I do that the official Turkish position is that the Kurdish issue does not exist."
"I must therefore say that I see very, very few ways of exerting a positive influence on Turkey."
"However, in terms of the position of the German Presidency - which has given greater prominence to Turkey's status as an EU applicant country than did previous German governments - I would like to make it very clear that the same requirements for membership of the European Union apply to Turkey as to all the others. This means that Turkey is not at an advantage because of its particularly important strategic position, and it is not at a disadvantage because of the fact that it is an Islamic country."
"Turkey must meet precisely the same conditions as the others, which means that it must be a fully-developed democracy."
"We must be certain that human rights are respected and we must be certain that everyone in the country enjoys the same rights."
"I do not wish to use the term 'minorities' in relation to the Kurds, as in my opinion this is completely inappropriate in this context."
"The issue here is full equality for all people living in a particular country."
"This is something we can and must impress on Turkey in relation to its progress towards Europe."
"If relations develop in such a way that it is possible to discuss a solution to the Kurdish problem in direct talks with Turkey, I have no doubt that we will be prepared to do so, but unfortunately such talks have simply not been possible so far."
"Mr President, my allotted time is really very short."
"I would nevertheless like to ask the President-in-Office how she can be sure of the assurances and guarantees given by Turkey."
"I was present at the trial of Leila Zana and the 16 other convicted members of parliament."
"Leila Zana was sentenced to 16 years in prison."
"In front of the international observers, including our group, as well as the international media that was present, Leila Zana, a small and frail woman but a great democrat and a great politician, was beaten - there is no other word for it - by the rifle butts of the soldiers who were there for the trial."
"And this took place before our very eyes."
"So I do not believe these verbal guarantees for one moment."
"Equally, I do not believe that we will help achieve a peaceful solution to the Kurdish problem by continuing to sell arms to Turkey."
"I should like to know what you base these assurances on. I would also like to know if it would be possible to introduce economic sanctions, especially having seen how pointless it was to believe that approving the customs union would help the country return to democracy."
"There are many other things I would like to ask you, but unfortunately I have run out of time."
"Mrs Pailler, unfortunately I have to say that in such cases we cannot be sure that promises will actually be kept."
"There are no guarantees."
"I could give you dozens of examples of this from recent history, not only in Europe but in other parts of the world."
"That is simply the problem we have when we are dealing with countries in which there are certain constitutional shortcomings, and we all consider this to be the case in Turkey."
"So there are no guarantees."
"However, what we can do of course is to judge the implications if, for example, Öcalan were not given unrestricted access to lawyers of his choice, or if international trial observers were not given full and unrestricted access."
"Then we could form an opinion."
"But I must add that even if that is done there is no absolute guarantee that a trial will really be conducted fairly and properly in all respects."
"Unfortunately I have to say that there is no guarantee of this even in states where the rule of law is fully developed."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"Unfortunately I am unable to thank the President-in-Office as well. I wonder whether he has seen the blood-curdling images of cruel torture, the repression suffered by the leader of an entire nation and the excessive pride with which these images were broadcast throughout the entire length and breadth of this planet by Turkish television and by all the media."
"He says that the Council has no information."
"Is this of no concern to the Council?"
"Does the Council believe that the state security court in Turkey will conduct a fair trial?"
"The President-in-Office has told us that there is no Kurdish problem, that there is no Kurdish nation, that there is no Kurdish minority, and this, simply because Turkey does not accept that there is!"
"Has Mr Milosevic been persuaded that the problem in Kosovo is an international problem, that NATO is threatening to drop bombs and that NATO forces are preparing to enter Kosovo?"
"Will the Council give us answers to these questions, convincing ones at least?"
"It is precisely because the Council is of course aware of the emotions that you have just described, in particular the video recordings and television footage, that is has made the statements and demands that I have repeated here today."
"I was in Istanbul on Thursday and Friday and met Mr Öcalan's lawyers. They informed me that they had no precise documentation relating to the charges."
"They also said that had only been granted one brief visit to Mr Öcalan and that he was expressionless and totally under the influence of drugs. They have not been allowed to visit Mr Öcalan again and this all leads us to fear for his life, as has already been pointed out today."
"Our trip there was a spontaneous one as Members of the European Parliament and it was very difficult for us."
"I would like to ask the Council if it intends to send European Union lawyers to Turkey to attend the trial and to help ensure that the trial is in fact fair, as you quite rightly said."
"As I mentioned earlier, the Council put forward this demand and also supports similar demands from the European public that international trial observers be admitted to the trial."
"These are generally legal experts."
"The question is whether the European Union as an institution should take part in observing the trial if it is given the opportunity; this question has not yet been discussed and must be decided in due course."
"Mr President, I should like to ask the Council representative, as he did not answer Mr Theonas, what he has to say to those who believe that a policy of double standards is being applied, depending on whether it is the Kurds or the Kosovars."
"In both cases, it is matter of stopping the repression and granting fundamental rights."
"What do you say to those who believe that the European Union is applying double standards in these two cases?"
"As far as I know, the Council has to date made no comment on this; so far, it has never linked the Kosovo issue with that of the Kurds."
"I do not intend to do so either."
"Question No 13 by Astrid Thors (H-0142/99)"
"Subject: Coordination between the EU and the Council of Europe as regards policies for mutual assistance in criminal matters The Member States are negotiating an EU Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters."
"The Council of Europe is negotiating a Second Additional Protocol to the 1959 European Convention on Mutual Assistance."
"The two drafts largely deal with the same issues but lack any kind of coordination."
"Have the EU Member States done anything to ensure that the same judicial solutions would be reached within the two fora?"
"If not, what is the reason for pursuing different policies within the EU and the Council of Europe?"
"I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mrs Thors's question."
"The coordination of negotiations on an EU Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters and the Council of Europe's draft for a Second Additional Protocol to the 1959 European Convention on Mutual Assistance has been discussed in detail at EU level."
"The working party on mutual assistance in criminal matters, which is drawing up the new EU convention, last examined the question of coordination at its meeting on 17 and 18 February 1999."
"The need for coordination between the European Union and the Council of Europe has been discussed on several occasions at the regular meetings between the troika, the K.4 Committee and representatives of the Council of Europe."
"Particular emphasis was placed on ensuring that their respective objectives in the area of mutual assistance are consistent and that overlaps between the legal instruments are avoided as far as possible."
"One of the concrete results of this coordination process was that the Council Secretariat drew up a technical comparison of the EU draft and the Council of Europe's text."
"This document has proved to be a useful aid in the current discussions, and is currently being revised."
"Certain overlaps between the draft EU convention and the Council of Europe's draft protocol are unavoidable given that the objective of both new instruments is to improve rules for mutual assistance in criminal matters."
"The EU convention will impose stricter mutual assistance obligations on the 15 Member States than the Council of Europe protocol, which can be applied to over 40 countries with very different legal systems."
"This is true in particular of the rules concerning tapping into communications links."
"It is gratifying to hear that there has now been some coordination between the EU and the Council of Europe."
"At the beginning of February, I happened to hear one of the Council's representatives, amongst others, say that there had been no coordination."
"Consequently, I think the time has come for us to consider the principles that are to be applied in the new agreements on mutual assistance in criminal matters."
"It looks as though supervision of the Internet and e-mail is one of the areas where there has been no coordination in either of the agreements."
"It would appear that under one of the agreements, the Commission would like to compel the authorities to immediately hand out information about all e-mail correspondence."
"Can that be right and is it consistent with European principles, given that no one has yet defined the infringements that will be looked out for or established a corresponding legal requirement?"
"However, it is good to hear that there has been some coordination on the basis of this initiative."
"Mr President, unfortunately I cannot do so."
"The question initially asked by Mrs Thors did not refer to this special problem, so the Council Secretariat could not provide me with any documentation on this matter."
"I would very much like to answer your question but simply cannot do so; I must therefore ask you to accept a written answer."
"As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 14 and 15 will be taken together."
"Question No 14 by Esko Seppänen (H-0143/99)"
"Subject: Pensions of members of the ECB Executive Board According to reports in the Finnish media, Mrs Sirkka Hämäläinen, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, receives in addition to her salary at the ECB a special pension amounting to some FM 10 000 from the Bank of Finland, which is a member of the European system of Central Banks."
"Was the Council aware of this before the salary levels of the ECB Executive Board were set, and does it know whether the other members of the ECB Executive Board also receive income apart from their salaries?"
"Question No 15 by Heidi Hautala (H-0157/99)"
"Subject: Rules applicable to ECB officials and Executive Board members on incompatibility and financial relationsThere has been a storm of protest in Finland about the fact that Sirkka Hämäläinen, a member of the ECB Executive Board, is not only paid a salary, but is also drawing an early retirement pension of some FM 60 000 from the Bank of Finland."
"Can the Council therefore say whether the ECB has drawn up rules applicable to senior officials and Executive Board members in particular on incompatibility and financial relations, bearing in mind that, where such circumstances exist, the independence of the persons concerned may be jeopardised?"
"Has the ECB heeded the call from the Ombudsman and drawn up rules governing the release of documents into the public domain in the exercise of its tasks or the right of citizens to gain access to documents produced by and in the possession of the ECB?"
"If the answer to the above questions is 'yes', is information about the income, assets, and secondary occupations of senior officials and Executive Board members made available to the public under all conditions?"
"If that is not the case, will the Council use its influence to ensure that a requirement to do so is laid down?"
"I give the floor to the President-in-Office to answer these questions by Mr Seppänen and Mrs Hautala together."
"Article 11.1 of the Protocol on the Statute of the ESCB and of the ECB provides that no member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank shall engage in any occupation, whether gainful or not, unless exemption is exceptionally granted by the Governing Council."
"The Protocol thus prevents the members of the Executive Board, in the interests of independence, from receiving remuneration for any activity other than as a member of the Executive Board."
"However, this rule does not prevent the appointment of an experienced person who may perhaps have a pension from a previous job."
"It is not up to the Council to lay down the terms and conditions of employment of the members of the Executive Board, which under Article 11.3 of the Protocol are the subject of contracts with the ECB and are fixed by the Governing Council on a proposal from a committee of six members, three of whom are appointed by the Council."
"Mr President, the Council has not answered my question at all."
"I asked if the Council knew, before the salaries of the members of the board of the European Central Bank were determined, whether they also received a pension in addition to that from the European Central Bank, and whether, besides Sirkka Hämäläinen, who is a member of the board, any other board member receives additional pay."
"The Council must answer these questions, as these matters are its responsibility."
"The European Central Bank and the national central banks which report to it are part of the EU scheme."
"The same rules for personnel apply to them as to any other EU institution."
"Under Article 232 of the Treaty, the Council must ensure that the rules of the Treaty and those relating to staff are implemented, and the Council must be responsible for ensuring that the rules that apply to the European Central Bank carry the same weight as those applying to other EU institutions."
"I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council to answer my question."
"Mr Seppänen, I did answer the question, although you were not happy with what I said. I would draw your attention again to the relevant part of my answer."
"I said that the provision that a member of the ECB Executive Board may not receive any other remuneration does not prevent the appointment of an experienced person who perhaps has a pension from a previous job."
"To clarify this I would say that, according to the Council's understanding of the legal position here, there is a difference between remuneration and a pension that someone receives for work done previously."
"Mr President, like my colleague, Mr Seppänen, I am surprised that the representative of the Council is not answering certain questions."
"I think it is important that the European Central Bank should operate transparently."
"It may be relatively autonomous and independent when it comes to monetary policy, but it must have some rules on transparency and, inter alia , automatic ineligibility for certain posts and financial impartiality on the part of its senior officials, such as the members of the board."
"Mr President-in-Office, you have not answered these questions."
"Instead, you said there is no conflict in a situation where a person of experience receives a salary from the European Central Bank and a pension from some former position."
"Is it not the case that, in the context of the European Central Bank system, this former agency, the Bank of Finland, and the European Central Bank are in fact part of the same organisation?"
"The representative of the Commission did not want to take a stand on this issue either."
"Who will?"
"Mrs Hautala, I must also say to you that I answered the question precisely, indeed very precisely."
"It is not possible to answer it any more precisely."
"I will say it once again. There is a difference between an additional remuneration that a member of the ECB Executive Board might receive and a pension that a member of the ECB Executive Board receives from a previous job."
"Legally, they are completely different."
"In the Council's opinion, the rules are completely clear."
"There is nothing to stop a member of the ECB Executive Board, who is paid by the ECB, from receiving a pension from a job he or she did previously."
"I should like to know why an exception has been made for the European Central Bank, since according to my understanding of the matter, it is not possible to receive at one and the same time a pension from another appointment and a full salary from either the Commission or the Council."
"Consequently, I should like to know why an exception has been made in the case of the European Central Bank."
"I must say quite honestly that I did not understand the question."
"What am I supposed to say?"
"The honourable Member says that she does not understand something."
"She has not asked me a question."
"I can only repeat once again how the Council views the legal situation."
"It is clear."
"The question of whether it is possible to receive a salary as a member of the ECB Executive Board and to receive at the same time a pension from a previous job has been answered three times with a definite 'yes'."
"That is the Council's understanding of the legal situation."
"Thank you, Mr Verheugen."
"You are asking to speak, Mrs Hautala, but I cannot give you the floor."
"You know very well that Members can only speak once during Question Time."
"Question No 16 by Maj Theorin (H-0146/99)"
"Subject: Global solidarity 1.3 bn of the world's population are living in acute poverty, and the number is increasing."
"In 1997 the OECD countries' aid to developing countries fell to 0.22 % of GNP."
"The indications are that it has continued to fall in 1998."
"The flow of private capital from the industrialised to the under-developed countries also declined sharply in 1997 and 1998."
"The United Nations' target is for the wealthy countries to set aside 0.7 % of their GNP for aid."
"What does the Council intend to do within the OECD to ensure that this UN target is met?"
"I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mrs Theorin's question."
"Mr President, Mrs Theorin is quite right to point out that development aid from Member States represented in the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD has fallen as a percentage of GNP."
"A comparison shows, however, that the figures for EU Member States, averaging 0.33 % of GNP, are much higher than the average figures for the DAC donor countries as a whole, where the corresponding figure is 0.22 % of GNP, whereas the contribution of such an important donor country as the USA is less than 0.09 % of GNP."
"Some states are seeing a reverse of the negative trend."
"With regard to the flow of private capital to the developing countries, the European Union is very much aware of the importance of private investment and developments in the private sector in general."
"Directing private investment to developing countries can best be achieved by strengthening the private sector and creating conditions - particularly economic, legal, administrative and regulatory conditions - that promote investment."
"This was also the view stated by the European Union recently at the ACP-EU Ministerial Negotiating Conference on 8 and 9 February 1999 in Dakar, and it was a view which our ACP partners entirely shared."
"The Council is also devoting greater attention to the problem of poverty which the honourable Member mentioned."
"It should be noted here that one of the fundamental points on which agreement was reached in Dakar was that the reduction and possible eventual elimination of poverty must be among the main objectives of the new partnership, along with sustainable development and the gradual integration of the ACP countries into the world economy."
"With regard to Mrs Theorin's question concerning concrete measures to be taken at OECD level, I must point out that the Council, unlike the individual Member States and the European Commission, is not represented in the DAC and cannot therefore propose any concrete measures."
"Thank you for answering my question."
"I was somewhat surprised to be told that some countries have been hiding behind the fact that the USA has given very little assistance to third world countries - that has been a well-known fact for some time."
"Nevertheless, there are also some EU countries whose aid budget comes to considerably more than 0.33 %."
"However, the goal of 0.7 %, established by the UN, serves as a useful target for all countries to aim at, regardless of whether they are in the Council or the OECD."
"Since I first heard that poverty and its repercussions were being given the recognition they deserve - although it is not enough simply to recognise the problem - I have been wondering what measures the Council is proposing to take in order to deal adequately with the problems posed by poverty."
"What exactly are we willing to do to help third world countries?"
"Private capital flows naturally play an important role, as do trade agreements."
"I would remind the Council that the Trade Agreement with South Africa comes within that category, and I hope it will be signed on 22 March, thereby making it possible to provide assistance."
"Mrs Theorin, I fully agree with you that helping to combat world poverty must be a central aim of European Union policy."
"Poverty is truly one of the most terrible scourges we are faced with today."
"As we in Europe are in a better position than most people in the world, it is also in our own interest to ensure that large parts of the world do not decline into ever worsening poverty."
"This ever widening social divide is bound to lead eventually to political and social conflict that may even end in violence."
"Here our analysis is entirely in line with yours."
"It is also something we need to get across to people in our own countries, that development cooperation costs money but is in the end an important investment in our own security, an investment that is at least as important as what we invest in our military security."
"I fully agree with your basic views on this."
"Mrs Theorin, you know what possibilities are available and what instruments we employ."
"The development cooperation provided by the European Union itself is geared towards these objectives, and the same applies to the development cooperation of most Member States."
"It applies to your country, my country and many others."
"We are on the right track."
"But I fully agree with you that a great deal more can be done and in particular that we must shed the notion that development cooperation consists of sending money somewhere in the belief that that will do."
"It is indeed necessary to go for an integrated approach, and part of this involves integrating the developing countries' economies into the world economy, directing the flow of capital and investment to these countries using the measures available, and helping to build structures that are necessary and attractive for investment."
"All of this is included in our policy."
"There is never anything that cannot be improved upon."
"I am therefore grateful for any support we can find in terms of improving our policy's aims and the opportunities available."
"Question No 17 by María Izquierdo Rojo (H-0148/99)"
"Subject: Participation of Libya in the forthcoming Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Stuttgart Will the European Union make it possible for Libya to participate in the forthcoming Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Stuttgart?"
"I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mrs Izquierdo Rojo's question."
"This issue has already been discussed today, and the answer is that the Council has noted the Final Declarations of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Forum of 27 and 28 October 1998 in Brussels, which included the recommendation that the participants of the Third Euro-Mediterranean Conference should take whatever measures are necessary to allow Libya to participate fully in the Barcelona process."
"On this issue the Council confirms the position it has adopted since the beginning of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, namely that the door is being kept open for Libya and that Libya may participate in the partnership as soon as it complies with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council."
"The Council is following developments very closely."
"It has noted the recent positive developments and encourages the continuation of others' efforts in this area."
"I gather from the reply by the President-in-Office that we have now reached the stage where we can actually welcome Libya since, as he knows, there is already an agreement between the parties involved, as was announced by the Secretary-General of the United Nations a few days ago."
"Therefore, if he is telling me that the door will be open as soon as there is an agreement and he knows, as I do, that there already is an agreement, surely we can take it as read that Libya will finally participate in the coming Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Stuttgart as a full member. This was requested by the Euro-Mediterranean Forum held in the European Parliament in November and I believe that it is a wise move."
"If that is, in fact, the case, can I assume, too, that Mauritania will also be able to participate?"
"The Final Declaration here in the European Parliament also supported the idea of inviting Mauritania to become a full member."
"Mr President, this afternoon Commissioner Marín said what needs to be said on the subject of Mauritania."
"Mauritania does not currently pose a problem for us in this context."
"As far as Libya is concerned, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I would be thankful if I could reach the same conclusion as you; I would be pleased if I could say that all the conditions we laid down had been met, so that Libya could take part in the Barcelona process."
"However, I do not share your optimism."
"The requirement is that the Security Council resolution must be implemented in full, and this will not be the case until the suspected assassins have been extradited."
"Thank you, Mr Verheugen."
"Ladies and gentlemen, exactly one and a half hours after the start of questions to the Council, that concludes Question Time."
"Questions Nos 18 to 40 will receive written answers."
"The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m."
"Nuclear sector-related activities for third countries (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on nuclear sector-related activities for third countries."
"Madam President, the fewer of us there are, the more we need to keep to our speaking time, and I will do my best!"
"Firstly, I would like to thank Mr Adam very sincerely for his report."
"The more I read through it, the more it strikes me just how excellent it is. I urge Parliament to treat this subject very seriously and to read the Adam report in detail."
"The message is clear: we need cooperation, not refusal."
"Older reactors, especially first generation reactors, need to be decommissioned as quickly as possible, while modern plants need to be upgraded, and we particularly need to cooperate with the CEECs and the New Independent States to develop an all-embracing energy policy."
"The more the eastern electricity network is connected to the western network, the more important this issue is becoming, as these countries will use their nuclear power stations to sell power to the West as a means of earning income."
"So it is by no means irrelevant to ask how this power is produced."
"What is more, the applicant countries - this is what I wanted to say during the debate just now - must also observe other environmental regulations."
"Not only nuclear power stations but also large combustion plant, cars and every single factory will have to adhere to the EU's environmental legislation."
"We cannot make any exceptions for nuclear power stations."
"Nevertheless, there is one point that I would like to make, and I shall address this primarily to the Commission."
"It is not just a question of telling each other here in this forum how important all this is - we also need to draw attention to deficiencies."
"I was recently told about this by a German nuclear power station, Neckar-Westheim, which has been working with Zaporazhye for 10 years on improvements to valves."
"As you will be aware - and if not, I am telling you now - an accident took place there on 20 April 1995 along the lines of the Harrisburg incident."
"Similar incidents have also taken place at two other nuclear power stations in Russia."
"They should have reacted pretty quickly - it was only a problem with valves, a simple technical matter."
"Yet it has taken four years, and up to now nothing has happened, although an application has been made."
"Now there has to be an invitation to tender."
"If your house was on fire, can you imagine getting quotes to see which fire brigade was the cheapest? Your house would have burnt down by the time they got there!"
"We need to apply different procedures in this case, and Gordon Adam is quite right in drawing attention to paragraph 20, which states very clearly what we should be doing."
"That is why I am asking for swifter action before the whole thing packs up!"
"Madam President, we in the Liberal Group tabled an urgent resolution a few weeks ago, also signed by Mrs Plooij and Mr Frischenschlager, on the K2 and R4 nuclear power stations in Ukraine."
"We have withdrawn this resolution now that the Adam report is on the agenda, but we would nevertheless like to say something about this issue."
"I entirely agree with the rapporteur that optimum use must be made of the capacity of the safe power stations that are now ready or under construction, at least where this is the least expensive option."
"I have read various reports that the K2 and R4 power stations in Ukraine are to be decommissioned using EBRD and Euratom money, but we feel very uneasy about this."
"We originally asked for the Court of Auditors to produce a report on this use of Euratom funding, but Mrs Aelvoet has tabled two amendments that go even further, and we in our group intend to support her."
"We think that Euratom and the EBRD should not be providing money to decommission these two power stations."
"Furthermore, the ESPOO Convention requires Ukraine to keep its neighbours informed about its nuclear power stations, which it has not done."
"Ukraine is not a signatory to the ESPOO Convention, but as Western European institutions we are perfectly entitled to insist that it should meet the ESPOO requirements, in order to guarantee that Ukraine's neighbours have some say in the future of its nuclear power stations."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the context of building Europe, and also with enlargement in mind, we need to have an energy policy in keeping both with market trends and the real needs of consumers."
"There is an ever-increasing role for the EU here."
"This is the context of Gordon Adam's two reports, and he has prepared them with all the rigour and insight that we have come to expect from him."
"The point at issue is to optimise electricity distribution throughout the whole of Europe, taking into consideration the ineluctable development of the market for gas, of which there are still substantial reserves."
"The objective is not only to interconnect the electricity networks of central Europe and the EU, but also to facilitate natural gas imports from third countries."
"The task before us now is to diversify sources of energy supply by continuing to use fossil fuels, whilst endeavouring to minimise CO2 emissions."
"Given the rapid growth in energy demand, we need to develop a realistic percentage of renewables and at the same time exploit Europe's nuclear know-how."
"Gordon Adam's second report is about improving nuclear safety in eastern Europe."
"In this context, fuel reprocessing is just as important as operational safety."
"Improved safety at traditional nuclear power stations is an objective of the PHARE and TACIS programmes, which new regulations have improved for the period 2000-2006."
"We are not talking about a replacement for government strategy in third countries - this is about using dialogue and cooperation to achieve essential improvements in the safety and energy efficiency of their reactors."
"It is particularly important to achieve better management of waste from civil power stations, as well as eliminating 50 tonnes of military plutonium in Russia."
"The European Union cannot stand by and allow Russian military plutonium to accumulate as a result of implementing nuclear non-proliferation treaties."
"An integrated energy policy bringing together national governments and the European Union is essential."
"It should steer industry towards rational use of energy and greater use of renewables, including improvements in the nuclear energy sector as a whole, with a new generation of reactors and management of the fuel cycle, in particular the end of the cycle, in other words nuclear waste."
"We need an ambitious yet pragmatic and responsible programme under which the European Union can use its powers to achieve both short-term and long-term benefits."
"In the short term, we need to make rapid progress with the EPR, the European pressurised water reactor, which is both safer and more profitable, as it will reduce the cost per kWh by over 10 %."
"Whilst by using MOX fuel nuclear waste can be eliminated in part, we still need to be making preparations for the long term now, and - at the same time - to initiate a study to evaluate the technology involved in hybrid reactors, such as the reactor recently proposed by Carlo Rubia."
"However, work is also needed on high temperature reactors, which are notable both for their energy efficiency and for their capacity to eliminate 90 % of military plutonium."
"Work needs to be done under the EU framework programme, in Member States and in third countries, to develop the necessary technology."
"Improvements in nuclear safety and the elimination of waste, coupled with diversification of energy supplies, will enable us to meet the increase in demand throughout Europe and to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases."
"This makes European energy policy a model for others to follow."
"Madam President, when you look at the Commission communication on nuclear sector related activities for CEEC and NIS states and at the Court of Auditors' report, you could be forgiven for thinking that they were about two totally different subjects."
"Given that the Commission claims that its communication gives an overview of funding provided and successes to date, together with new guidelines on programme implementation, the document we are considering, with just 13 pages of text and 17 pages of annexes, really is an outrage."
"Nebulous statements such as - and I am quoting now - ' the European Union has undertaken a great number of activities in the nuclear sector since 1990' and 'special programmes were created with considerable budgetary appropriations' are not what I would call an evaluation!"
"The passage in the communication about radioactive waste management is a real gem of vacuity."
"Let me quote the following: 'The radioactive waste programme is giving many CEEC/NIS organisations and institutes a wide insight into western technology and safety culture, and this has helped to specify problems in this area and to better define concrete implementation projects'."
"I think these gentlemen must have been peering into a very deep hole indeed!"
"What projects, what problems?"
"What form does the EU participation envisaged take?"
"Bearing in mind that we do not have a permanent storage solution anywhere in the EU, but just shift waste around from one country to another and then dump it at some interim storage facility, that really is rich!"
"Participation by eastern European countries in EU research programmes is portrayed as being highly successful, but we are not given any evidence of this alleged success."
"Or do we call it a success story when despite the agreements entered into under the Nuclear Safety Account for the closure of high-risk reactors, all of these reactors are still operating?"
"The Commission and the Council have specifically stressed the importance of this agreement on closures, so I find it all the more amazing that the rapporteur has simply ignored this, instead of stepping up pressure on these states."
"It is simply not acceptable for us to be using EU tax revenues to increase the danger, instead of minimising it!"
"The rapporteur's assumption that building new nuclear reactors increases pressure to close down older ones is spurious."
"On the contrary, as history has shown, old reactors which should have been scrapped will continue to operate and export power until they blow up in our faces. And what is more, the disposal problem has not been solved in these countries and the risks of proliferation are mounting."
"We should not be using EU tax revenues to create new markets for EDF."
"It is generally accepted that it is cheaper to build combined-cycle gas turbines and to encourage energy efficiency measures."
"There is no evidence that the money spent so far has in any way had the desired effect, and it is high time that the Commission recognised this and changed its policy."
"So, although Mr van den Broek has already left again, I would like to ask when we can expect a new communication based on the real facts."
"And I would like to have an answer this evening!"
"Madam President, we have been looking at the issue of nuclear safety in the CEECs and the New Independent States for well over 10 years now, and a solution is still not in sight."
"Not a single one of the reactors which are today euphemistically called first generation reactors has been closed to date, although there has been a substantial flow of EU funds to the CEEC and NIS countries and various agreements have been concluded. The aim of all this has been something which I believe everyone in this House wants: to close down these dangerous rust-heaps known as reactors as soon as possible, or, even better, yesterday!"
"I would like to thank Dr Adam for what I am sure was the very difficult task of preparing his report. In it, he says it is necessary to agree energy plans and strategies with the applicant countries, with the other Central and Eastern European countries and with the NIS, with the objective of closing down nuclear reactors ready for the scrap-heap, ceasing work on unsafe reactors already under construction, and at the same time meeting the energy requirements of these countries, which are at present to a very large extent covered by nuclear energy."
"In drawing up such a strategy we will of course need to respect the sovereign right of these countries to decide at national level whether or not they wish to continue using nuclear energy. We will also need to involve regional and local authorities in this process as far as possible, and I believe that an energy plan of this kind will pave the way for renewables, making this an important opportunity for these countries."
"Although there are to be various transitional arrangements for the applicant countries in the environmental field, there should be no transitional arrangements where nuclear safety is concerned!"
"Madam President, environmental protection measures will only have a significant impact on competitiveness where a company is directly competing with companies in regions where such measures are not in force."
"If we apply the same principle to the nuclear power sector, this means that it is absolutely essential for nuclear safety standards in the applicant countries to be brought into line with those in the EU."
"However, if in addition to closing down nuclear power stations, funds are to be made available for upgrading nuclear power stations still operating, these funds should come from the operators themselves, in keeping with the liberalisation of the electricity market and the polluter pays principle. The source of these funds should therefore be the proceeds of electricity sales and not subsidies or EU funds."
"Otherwise, the market will be distorted to the advantage of nuclear power in applicant countries, which we mostly certainly do not want."
"So it is only logical to demand that EU funds from the PHARE and TACIS programmes intended to improve nuclear safety in eastern Europe should not be used to finance upgrading, but rather that they should be used solely for supporting nuclear regulatory authorities in eastern Europe, for nuclear safeguards and to create a state-of-the-art regulatory regime."
"I would ask the House to vote for my amendment on this subject, which has already been approved in committee."
"Madam President, as all the other speakers here have pointed out, the safety of nuclear power stations is the most important issue when the EU is dealing with the nuclear power sector in the applicant countries and the New Independent States, and it is unacceptable to grant these countries transitional arrangements."
"Safety requirements mean that some power stations will have to close. The reaction to this is often that new nuclear power stations will be built instead."
"It is this response that is unacceptable."
"We cannot export views that we ourselves no longer hold to other countries. And the truth is that the peoples of Europe do not want any new nuclear power stations."
"Therefore, the most important thing in the Commission's communication is in fact that it emphasises the need to draw up energy plans for the whole energy sector, and not just the electricity sector, with particular emphasis on energy saving, developing alternative sources of energy and using energy efficiently."
"All too often, we see that the answer to a growing demand for energy is simply more power stations."
"What is needed is something else, and not least in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"Madam President, because of the procedure for the accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the partnerships that have been formed with the New Independent States, the European Union has to take initiatives regarding nuclear safety."
"In these regions, there are 50 plants with obsolete Soviet nuclear reactors which must be decommissioned, simply because they are extremely dangerous."
"It is well known that the first generation RBMK and VVER 440/230 Soviet reactors are dangerous, since they are unable to withstand accidents."
"Reactors such as these still exist and still operate in Bulgaria, Lithuania, Slovakia, Armenia and Russia, while those in the former German Democratic Republic have been closed down for good."
"In particular, the Commission is called upon: firstly, to abide by the agreements to decommission first generation reactors, such as the Kozloduy reactor in Bulgaria, the Ignalina reactor in Lithuania and those in Slovakia; secondly, not to give financial assistance for first generation reactors; and, thirdly, not to grant Euratom loans to modernise later generation reactors, unless a guarantee can be given that agreements to decommission first generation reactors are pushed through, because these are a threat to the people of Europe."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr van den Broek had the opportunity today to speak on these matters."
"I think that he fully covered the difficulties which have arisen and which are set out in the report by Mr Adam."
"I should like in turn to assure you that the Commission will continue its attempts to achieve the maximum level of safety in respect of nuclear reactors."
"As regards the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, we will of course incorporate the issue of nuclear safety within the framework of bilateral agreements, and above all within the framework of the attempt to prepare these countries for their adoption of the acquis communautaire and subsequently their accession to the European Union."
"In other words, this will be an important aspect of the pre-accession strategy for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"Finally, as regards the efforts of the Commission to decommission nuclear reactors in those cases and in those countries where safety problems have been identified, I wish to assure you that the Commission, regardless of the respective strategies of those countries, is continuing to stand firm on the agreements that have already been concluded with them."
"For this reason, we are doing our utmost to coordinate the efforts made by EBRD and, of course, by Euratom, to provide the necessary loans for nuclear reactors."
"Against this background, I wish to tell you that this morning, in Ukraine, a task force was put into operation with exactly this objective in mind, that is, to help the Ukraine Government to move swiftly towards reorganising its energy sector and to meet all the necessary conditions for these loans to be granted."
"In the other countries, such as Bulgaria, and in other countries with which the Commission is collaborating, we are trying to use all the possibilities at our disposal to help these countries to achieve a complete reorganisation of the energy sector, so as to give them the opportunity to use other energy sources."
"For this reason, we are attempting to move the banking sector towards helping to support such plans."
"I should like once again to reassure the House that, in line with the principles supported by the European Parliament and restated in the report by Mr Adam, the Commission is continuing its efforts to ensure the safest possible operation of nuclear reactors."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Mr Eisma, we really are so short of time that I would prefer not to take any further questions; otherwise we shall not get through our business for today, and we are already behind schedule."
"Madam President, I very much regret that Commissioner van den Broek is not here for this part of the debate."
"It is not true, as the Commissioner present says, that Mr van den Broek dealt with all our comments this morning; that would have been impossible."
"The debate is still continuing, and we would have liked to have had an answer from the Commissioner responsible."
"Perhaps the report could be passed on to Mr van den Broek."
"That concludes this item."
"Multiannual energy programmes"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0085/99 by Mr Robles Piquer, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the proposal for a Council Decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community (1998-2002) (ALTENER II) (COM(97)0550 - C4-0071/98-97/0370(SYN)); -A4-0084/99 by Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the proposal for a Council Decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency (1998-2002) (COM(97)0550 - C4-0072/98-97/0371(SYN)); -A4-0086/99 by Mr Stockmann, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the communication from the Commission on energy efficiency in the European Community - towards a strategy for the rational use of energy (COM(98)0246 - C4-0316/98)."
"Madam President, in 1916, Thomas Edison, who knew a thing or two about electricity, wrote the following: 'We should use the forces of nature to obtain our energy."
"Light from the sun, wind and the tides are forms of this energy."
"But no, we burn forests and coal as if we were burning the door to our house to keep us warm."
"We live like savage invaders of the earth and not as if these resources were ours forever.'"
"In my mind, these dreadful words, written over 80 years ago in the middle of the First World War, are clearly an appropriate starting point for the debate on the three reports the European Commission is using to help fill the gap left by a lack of a Community energy policy. The Member States do not want this policy, even though the Members of this House and the Commission are in favour of it."
"I am referring initially to the report by Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz and to the report by Mr Stockmann - the first on energy efficiency and the second on the rational use and saving of energy."
"We will discuss these later."
"My report, Madam President, is a report on the section of the new Framework Programme for Action in the Energy Sector that attempts to establish a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources. If we look closely, we find that this is the key element of the whole programme."
"In short, it is an attempt to strengthen, extend and improve the effects - I would say the positive effects - of the Altener programme, which has now become Altener II."
"The programme covers activities that seek to naturally maintain the ecological balance, to respect the environment, and to ensure security of supply while reducing energy import dependence, as the percentage of such imports is growing rapidly in the European Union. Also, by exploiting these renewable energies, it seeks to reach a certain balance with the technological advances made and to create jobs."
"There are forerunners to these reports and to this situation."
"Firstly, there was Altener I, from 1993 to 1997, then the provisional form and the final version of Altener II that should take us up to the year 2002."
"Let me also remind you of such important documents as the Green and White Papers from the Commission and, if I may make a slightly more personal reference in this case, the 1994 Madrid Conference. In a week's time we will reach the end of the first five-year period since this meeting was held."
"I should like to remind you that the relevant authorities from Spain and many other countries were present, and also that my friend and, Commissioner, your predecessor, Commissioner Matutes, was present at that meeting and was actively involved. Mr Mandelis, now a minister and one of your fellow countrymen, was also present and, at the time, held the Presidency as it was the turn of the Greeks."
"We are talking here about wind energy, thermal and photovoltaic solar energy, biomass, small-scale hydroelectric schemes under 10 megawatts, geothermal energy and, perhaps in the future, harnessing energy from tides."
"Recently, interest in all these forms has clearly increased, not decreased."
"A few days ago, a pun in a major French daily paper said that wind energy had the wind in its sails."
"Fortunately, t is not only wind energy that is doing so well, although this is the form that is experiencing greatest growth."
"I believe that on this matter you must choose between three attitudes."
"Either you believe that our efforts concerning these forms of energy are useless, or you think that these energies could replace conventional forms in the near future, or, and in my opinion this is the sensible position, you believe that we should slowly increase the percentage of energy consumption from renewable sources under the terms that have been laid out in all these documents. Of course, we still cannot describe such documents as satisfactory or definitive but they are an important first step."
"Many countries are already aware of the fact that this situation is changing."
"It would be difficult to list them here due to a lack of time but I will mention one simple figure: at this moment in time I can tell you that, in 1998, the amount of wind energy produced and consumed in the European Union increased by no less than a third in relation to 1997."
"I should like to finish by saying that we must continue along these lines and that, as rapporteur, I recommend that we all vote in favour of my report as well as in favour of the other two."
"In the case of my report and that of Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, we should vote in favour of the amendments already accepted by the Committee on Energy, Research and Technological Development."
"I do not think that we need to include the others."
"In conclusion, I should like to congratulate my two colleagues whose reports we are about to consider."
"Madam President, together with the Altener programme, the SAVE programme is our only weapon for achieving the 8 % reduction targets to which we committed ourselves in the Kyoto Protocol."
"This makes it all the more amazing and incomprehensible that we only intend to spend ECU 68.45 million on SAVE II over five years and ECU 281.1 million on Altener, also over five years, whilst in the same year we are throwing ECU 170 million at nuclear fusion for just one year!"
"There is also something else that I find puzzling: how is it that when the Commission was evaluating SAVE I it came to the very firm conclusion that only legislative measures would help us to achieve our objectives, yet such measures are quite absent from SAVE II?"
"I have also failed to find a clear list of what we actually want to achieve."
"However, one thing is certain: in Germany, for example, equipment in permanent stand-by mode in homes and offices consumes the equivalent of the output of two 1 000 MW power stations."
"Furthermore, no one denies that if we finally started using energy rationally this would be an innovation that would create jobs, give us a competitive edge and preserve the environment. And I am talking about baseload electricity, because you would be saving power morning, noon and night, as everyone knows and as everyone keeps saying."
"We hear this day in, day out, like a hawker's sales patter, but no one is actually doing anything about it!"
"I find myself becoming suspicious that big industry just does not want this to happen - they simply do not want it!"
"If we could reduce baseload power consumption, and it would be quite a simple matter to save 30-40 % straight away by using electricity rationally, and we could also generate a lot using renewables, that would enable us to decommission a good many nuclear power stations only used for baseload."
"This demonstrates how woolly this policy is, and how much waffle there is: there is more talk than action."
"This policy will not enable us to achieve the reduction targets we are committed to, nor will it equip us with the sort of technology for the next millennium that would allow us to really boost our exports and achieve a presence on the world market, which in turn would allow us to create jobs and preserve our environment. This meagre programme really is not enough to achieve all that."
"If there is no money available, we should at least adopt legislative measures, quite apart from the fact that if we could finally agree on an EU-wide energy tax that would be a real success story."
"There is no incentive to save with energy as cheap as it is now."
"So I would like to ask the Commission when it finally intends to take some action - we have had endless discussions about this in the House, and we have repeatedly said that we need intelligent programmes for rational use."
"We cannot just carry on using the same old Stone Age methods as if they were good enough for us."
"We know something needs to happen, and we have the means to achieve it, and yet nothing is being done!"
"What can you hope to achieve in five years with ECU 68.1 million?"
"And that is supposed to include the EFTA countries as well!"
"Surely we cannot really intend to classify incineration of municipal waste as renewable energy, as proposed in the Altener II report."
"What does that suggest?"
"Renewable energy means solar, biogas, hydro and wind energy, used rationally of course, the two things go hand-in-hand. The Altener and SAVE programmes are like brother and sister, but we need to have the political will to act and not hold back."
"The Commission has our full support on this."
"Why is it not making progress in this area instead of letting the Council dictate to it all the time?"
"We all know that the Council does not want anything to happen."
"I have already explained to you why no progress is being made - there are many other parties involved who have nothing to gain from savings in baseload!"
"That is why I am asking you today to make a little bit of progress in this field, Mr Papoutsis."
"SAVE and Altener are token programmes with very good intentions, but we both know that you can achieve nothing with so little money, none of us can achieve anything!"
"We not only have our post-Kyoto commitments, we also have a duty to future generations."
"So I hope that Parliament will accept my amendments to the legislative proposal, including the further 1.5 % annual saving that I have included, and not just the ridiculously low 1 % that the Commission has proposed!"
"I must apologise, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, I wielded my gavel after just three minutes, but I thought you were speaking as rapporteur and then I had the impression that it was no longer a rapporteur who was speaking, but someone who was presenting their own views, and that rather confused me."
"What I have just said reflects exactly what the committee agreed, including the 1.5 %, it is all in the explanatory statement."
"I have not invented anything new!"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate my colleagues, and I think that we are all pulling in the same direction on this subject."
"The issue of energy efficiency seems to have lost its importance in the public's eyes in recent years, as confirmed by the International Energy Agency."
"This subject is regarded as irrelevant, quite simply because despite population growth and increasing energy consumption, there are sufficient fossil energy sources for the foreseeable future."
"And I believe that another reason is that the market has gone quiet - it is not giving any price signals."
"Quite the opposite in fact, crude-oil prices are lower than before the oil crises."
"So who has any interest in improving efficiency?"
"Certainly not energy producers, consumers scarcely at all and industrial consumers only within limits."
"It is we politicians who are most concerned, because we understand the link between energy consumption and CO2 emissions."
"And that is why we have committed ourselves to reducing Europe's CO2 emissions as compared with 1990, as has already been highlighted at Kyoto and Buenos Aires under the Convention on Climate Change, the Framework Convention."
"Another political motivating factor is that if we carry on in this way, the share of imports will rise from 50 % to 70 % by 2020, and with it our dependency on third countries."
"Yet there are enormous opportunities available to us."
"Of course, opinions differ on the extent of the technical and economic potential for energy savings over the next five years, but whether we aim for 18-20 % or higher, the potential is still very great indeed."
"If we take our political role seriously, it becomes apparent that we need annual efficiency gains of at least 2.5 %, instead of just 0.6 % at present."
"If we want to be consistent, these gains are necessary, and they are possible as well."
"The Commission is calling for 1.6 %, but there is scope for more."
"We can only achieve this if we agree upon a comprehensive strategy at European, national and regional level, and that is indeed what the Commission is proposing."
"This strategy must require Member States to commit themselves to binding national overall targets, it must include guideline targets by energy type and economic sector, and we ourselves want reports at three-yearly intervals, starting in 2001."
"That brings me to certain priority individual measures."
"We need a directive on energy efficiency standards in public procurement."
"We need guidelines for the renovation of existing buildings."
"We should start with the European institutions themselves."
"We need guidelines for the award of contracts for buildings maintenance and for new buildings."
"And while we are on that subject - and this has already been mentioned - a consistent policy on renovating old buildings would also create new jobs."
"Second, we need more targeted campaigns aimed at specific occupational groups and comprehensive labelling of all electrical consumer and capital goods."
"A start has been made, but something more comprehensive is needed."
"Third, we need to increase the use of combined heat and power, and we must be careful that this option does not lose out because of the liberalisation of the internal energy market."
"An 18 % target is sensible and this also has the Commission's support."
"We need a financing programme for energy service companies or ESCOs."
"They have great potential for the future and could assist energy conservation."
"Fourth, there is great potential for transport systems, leaving agriculture aside for the time being."
"Concepts such as logistics and intermodal transport serve to demonstrate just how much could be done in this field."
"Some initial steps have been taken under the fifth framework programme on research, but more needs to be done."
"Fifth, stand-by losses need to be reduced."
"Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz has touched upon this already."
"We expect the Commission to bring forward a communication on stand-by losses as soon as possible."
"My sixth point is that we of course need an EU-wide energy tax."
"We need to tackle this old chestnut yet again, and I hope that the next Parliament will do something about this at some point. I hope there will be sufficient insight to achieve this."
"I am all too well aware of what happened to the Cox report."
"Even if no one is going to win any political medals by fighting for energy conservation, increasing energy efficiency is and will continue to be the cleanest and safest source of energy that we have, and we should be focusing on that."
"Madam President, the Committee on the Environment has drawn up opinions on two areas within the multiannual framework programme for measures in the energy sector."
"These are renewable energy and energy efficiency."
"From an environmental viewpoint, they are two sides of the same coin."
"There is a need for both, because if the current trend continues, global demand for energy will double by the year 2020."
"We therefore need good plans and programmes if we are to meet our Kyoto targets."
"On the whole, it can be said that the Commission's proposal does not contain enough new thinking."
"It focuses too much on conventional energy solutions rather than renewable energy ones; on centralised systems rather than decentralised ones; on traditional, economic tools rather than new thinking; on purely technical measures rather than an holistic approach."
"That is just not enough, so it is wonderful to see the reports before us, which up to a point pull in the same direction as I have described."
"There are a number of areas which I would like to highlight."
"Firstly, the administration of the programmes."
"There is a problem with these programmes like so many other EU programmes, which is that they are far too confusing for applicants, so many people have difficulty getting involved in them."
"The reason I am emphasising this is because the second point - involving ordinary consumers - is absolutely essential if we are to achieve the results we wish to see."
"Only through consumers can we get adequate local initiatives."
"On the subject of local initiatives, I would also like to mention the organisation of the tariff systems, which have to be adapted to the decentralised structure and cannot simply take priority over a large number of major areas and ideas."
"It is essential that the programmes are controlled at national level, where people have the greatest knowledge of their own environment."
"It goes without saying that different conditions prevail in different areas."
"Solar energy should be exploited where the sun shines and windmills should be placed where the wind blows, and the Member States themselves know that best."
"Madam President, the only thing you can say about these three reports is that they are acceptable, and we can vote for them - but that does not solve our problem."
"We have already made a great many declarations of this kind in the House."
"We always agree."
"It is hard to think of another issue on which Parliament and the Commission see eye to eye to such an extent as on promoting renewables."
"That is not the problem."
"And yet I feel powerless when I look at the figures, which almost drive you to despair."
"Let us take Mr Seppänen's report, for example."
"Mr Seppänen quite rightly says that if you exclude hydro-electricity, renewable energy's share is only 1.3 %."
"If you include hydro, it is 6 %."
"We want to increase the renewables' share to 12 %, but there is little scope for a major increase in hydro - you cannot rape nature, there are limits."
"The other aspect of renewable energy is biotechnology."
"Hydro and biotechnology combined account for 95 % of renewable energy."
"Hydro is chiefly found in the northern countries and in the Alpine regions of Austria and France and so forth, and biomass is found in the same countries, but you cannot extend these sources of energy at will, unless you are willing to pay the price."
"Extending the use of biomass, on the other hand, is bound up with agricultural policy."
"The fact is that a key omission from the proposals on agricultural policy in Agenda 2000 is a chapter on renewable energy."
"That really should have been included."
"I know that the Commission did some work on this, but in the end it was not incorporated, because the finance ministers did not of course want to pay for it: it would cost money."
"That is the crux of the matter."
"Fine, we want renewables, but we have to introduce them despite current market trends, because as a rule they are more costly than the cheap energy we currently have."
"That is why Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz is quite right: nothing will happen without legislative measures."
"The market will not achieve this by itself, otherwise this would have happened long ago."
"So we need prefinancing."
"In the longer term renewables will pay for themselves, but at this stage we need to prefinance them, and I therefore think that our biggest problem is not the technology itself - of course we want better and better plants, that goes without saying - but prefinancing."
"How can we mobilise private capital and public funds and persuade the banks to play a more active part in this field?"
"To my mind, that is the central issue with renewable energy."
"We once had a debate about feeding in electricity from renewables here."
"You will recall that the proposal I made at that time was rejected by a majority of Parliament."
"Well, perhaps that was not such a disaster, perhaps there are better suggestions, but we have not heard them yet."
"I would also like to ask Commissioner Papoutsis when a proposal along these lines will be brought forward, because at that point we were promised such a proposal before the end of the year."
"It is now March and we still have not seen a proposal."
"I grant you that this is a complicated field, and I do not envy you your task."
"I tried it myself and had no luck in this House."
"I wish you more luck, but we must do something."
"Do something better than I proposed."
"You will have my full support, but we must do something."
"We cannot wait for the market to solve this."
"There is also a link with energy prices."
"According to the Commission documents, energy efficiency has been increased by just 0.6 % per annum over this decade, because energy prices are so low."
"In the 1970s and 1980s the rate of increase was 2 %, because energy prices were high."
"That is an economic fact, so we need to get a hold on this problem."
"We have suggested energy taxation, which I know is not very palatable, but we need an honest debate about these issues, mere declarations are no longer enough."
"Madam President, the framework programme now under discussion combines all the elements of the EU energy policy and will hopefully help to coordinate the EU's work and make it more effective."
"It is important that different sectors within the Commission move in the same direction, to conserve energy and exploit renewables."
"Even to achieve the aims of the White Paper, not to speak of the still more challenging aim put forward by the committee, there has to be growth in the biomass sector in particular."
"At present there are considerable amounts of biomass in certain regions, especially in northern areas of the EU, in the form of logging waste, for example, which remain totally unexploited."
"However, these areas lead the world in developing the kind of logistics know-how for gathering this material, and growth in the industry is forecast."
"I would like to emphasise two points."
"Firstly, it will be vital, in my opinion, for us to be able to use the Structural Funds for projects relating to renewable energy in the future too, as there is a dearth of resources for other EU actions."
"Secondly, I would like to stress, as others have, how important the issue of taxation on energy is."
"Madam President, saving energy is the cleanest energy source."
"Some of those here today have also come to the same conclusion."
"We should therefore have additional energy taxes at EU level."
"To me that seems obvious, and I am waiting patiently for a proposal from the Commission and for the Council of Ministers to approve it."
"Tough economic measures are required in order to promote renewable sources of energy, the efficient use of energy and, in particular, to ensure that the traditional, conventional, environmentally unfriendly, reactionary energy society becomes a thing of the past."
"Many fine words have been uttered tonight on the desirability of promoting renewable sources of energy, but nothing ever actually happens."
"Consequently, it is absolutely essential that we introduce tough economic measures to set us on the right track."
"Both the Commission and the Council of Ministers, together with an unholy alliance here in Parliament, continue to support the nuclear power industry and refuse to recognise that the modern sources of energy are renewable ones - a rational use of energy - which mean more jobs, a cleaner environment and healthier long-term economic prospects."
"So why are so many people opposed to such an outlook?"
"My generation and my political group most decidedly are not!"
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say at the outset that I support Mr Robles Piquer's report on the promotion of renewable energy sources, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz's report on promoting energy efficiency, and Mr Stockmann's report on the rational use of energy."
"All three reports demonstrate that Parliament has the will to make progress with a diversified energy policy which would encourage environmental protection."
"As I see it, that is the direction we should be heading in today."
"We need to encourage the development of energy sources which, although they at present only offer partial solutions to the various major challenges currently facing the European Union, nevertheless offer very real solutions."
"The first challenge is of course the environment."
"New energy sources, and in particular wind energy, hydro and solar energy, are clean sources of energy."
"In this respect we need to remember the commitments that we entered into at Kyoto in 1997."
"Furthermore, these new energy sources should also allow us to reduce our dependence on third countries for supplies of oil, gas and other energy sources."
"Fifty per cent of our energy comes from outside the Union."
"This percentage is due to rise to 70 % by 2020, which is not without its risks."
"What is more, although technological developments have certainly reduced the prices of these new energy sources, this reduction is still not enough, and we must therefore finance RTD programmes in this field."
"The recently launched fifth framework programme on research should enable us to do this."
"In conclusion, Madam President, I would like to remind Members, at a point when unemployment has been called the main enemy of the European Union, that these energy sources will generate many new jobs."
"That is a point that it was also important to mention this evening."
"Madam President, Mr Stockmann sounded rather resigned when he said that the issue of energy efficiency is not exactly centre-stage in political debate at present."
"However, I believe that energy efficiency is very much uppermost in the minds of people who are concerned about saving money."
"I have many contacts and discussions with industrial leaders who say that energy efficiency - and this applies particularly to the basic goods sector - makes it possible to use less energy, and to cascade energy, that is to use it two or three times. This does not just mean saving a great deal of money, but also making technological advances which ultimately mean that we develop new methods and that, as Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz said, we remain competitive on the world market and can create new jobs in new industries."
"We have discussed the promotion of renewables in Parliament at length and in great detail, and I think that there is little new that I can add."
"We need to invest in renewables if we want to achieve the Kyoto objectives to which the EU has committed itself."
"I also expect, Commissioner, that during accession negotiations you will pursue a strategy of increased use of renewable energy sources, because the other countries have signed up to the European Union's Kyoto objectives and the first six applicants, which will already be Member States at the relevant point in time, will have to comply with these objectives in exactly the same way."
"In addition to these reports, on which I congratulate the respective rapporteurs, we will also have to make further efforts."
"Mr Linkohr has already mentioned that we are waiting for a proposal from the Commission on how renewables can be promoted now that the directive on feeding in renewables, which Mr Linkohr himself proposed, has failed to find majority support in Parliament."
"We need a proposal along these lines because it is necessary, when bringing renewables onto the market, to create a certain buffer, and to offer some support until they become commercially viable."
"We need to start by discussing energy taxation again, because the present situation is that the costs associated with energy production - and above all electricity generation at power stations with high emission levels - are spread equally, and not borne by those whose actions give rise to these costs. This cannot be allowed to continue if we wish to observe the polluter pays principle."
"I hope that in future the sun will play a greater role in determining where our energy comes from than it does today."
"Madam President, I am pleased to see that there is a large measure of agreement on the importance of developing new forms of energy among all of us here in Parliament and at the Commission."
"That is why demonstration projects are incredibly important."
"The good results we obtain in demonstration projects are made available not only to our Member States in the EU, but also to the applicant countries and the third world, where the fastest growth in energy consumption is taking place."
"It is therefore amazing that so little money has been allocated to creating good, solid demonstration projects which can really show others the best way to do things."
"The most capable countries, the most capable institutions and the most capable industries are the ones who will show us the direction in which to go."
"We all know that today we are emitting twice as much CO2 as plants can break down."
"And we know that the use of fossil fuels will double by the year 2020."
"We are heading for a very difficult period, and we should be deeply concerned about how our climate will develop and what burden will be placed on our ecosystems."
"I see increased research and the development of new technology as the only way forward."
"In many places today, taxes aimed at modifying behaviour, or so-called 'green taxes', have simply become new taxes, thus creating a negative attitude towards them among the general public."
"In the long run, only an increased awareness of the problems through information and education will lead to responsible use of our limited energy resources."
"Madam President, on behalf of my group, I should like to say that perhaps there is no real need to be as pessimistic as some of our colleagues have been."
"I have just returned from northern Austria, where 30 % of energy already comes from renewable sources and where there are more solar panels than the whole of Spain, despite the fact that there is less sun."
"At the same time as this meeting on solar energy was taking place in Wels, which followed on from the Madrid and Milan meetings, a major conference of the European Wind Energy Association was being held in Nice, which hundreds of people attended."
"Moreover, as German magazines are reporting, we know that there is now something called the 'German, Spanish and Danish model'. This simply means that some governments are becoming aware of the issue and are beginning to grant significant amounts of aid to renewable energies."
"For example, anyone who has read the latest Spanish Royal Decree from the end of December will know what I am talking about as there is now something called a 'feed in' system, to use our usual jargon, that redistributes the various renewable energy sources according to different scales."
"And there are many countries that take wind energy very seriously, such as Holland, Sweden, Finland and Greece, a country that is also covered in solar panels."
"A few days ago, I was in my home country where a day seminar on wind energy was being held, for the second time, in Santiago de Compostela."
"This form of energy is experiencing tremendous growth in Navarre, for example, a region that already meets 20 % of its needs in this way."
"The Commission now wishes to begin an experiment with 100 local authorities that hope to be fully supplied and served by some form of renewable energy. I believe that this so-called 'campaign for take-off' is proof of the fact that, in spite of everything, some governments are becoming aware of this issue and that binding legal provisions are beginning to emerge."
"And of course, the joint action of the Commission and Parliament has played an important role in promoting these new forms of energy and I believe we should be proud of this."
"Madam President, I would first of all like to congratulate the three rapporteurs, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, Mr Robles Piquer and Mr Stockmann, on their reports and on their excellent work."
"All three reports are part of a broader Community initiative to achieve a cleaner and sustainable future energy supply."
"The promotion of renewable energy sources and increased energy efficiency are the keystones of our policy to tackle environmental pollution and to reduce CO2 emissions."
"As you know, the Altener and SAVE programmes will make up by far the largest part of the framework programme for energy, which has been adopted and is already in operation as regards the remaining programmes."
"Following the adoption of the Altener and SAVE programmes within the next few months, the framework programme for energy will be able to operate as a unified whole and as an overall energy plan."
"I should now like to talk about each of the reports in turn, starting with the report by Mr Robles Piquer on the Altener programme, which concerns renewable energy sources."
"The Altener programme is a fundamental instrument for the implementation of the Community strategy and action plan for renewable energy sources, through which we aim to achieve our objectives."
"Our aim is to double the share of renewable energy sources in the gross domestic consumption of energy in the European Union by 2010."
"In the context of the Altener programme, the development of standards for the equipment needed in connection with renewable sources will continue, as will the development of strategies and the strengthening of those methods which will promote the market penetration of renewable energy sources."
"New production activities will strengthen the contribution of Altener to the 'Campaign for take-off', which was announced in the White Paper on renewable energy sources."
"In addition, thanks to the Altener programme, projects will be undertaken on a broad scale which will include technologies for renewable energy sources which are now ready to be implemented."
"Participation in this programme will also be open to the countries belonging to the European Economic Area, as well as the countries involved in negotiations to accede to the European Union."
"Before I move on to the amendments, I should like to thank Mr Robles Piquer, not only for his report, but also for his continuing support for the Community strategy on renewable energy sources over the last few years."
"As regards the amendments, the Commission is able to accept 14 amendments as they stand."
"These are Amendments Nos 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23 and 24."
"In addition, the Commission is able to accept seven further amendments, but only after they have been specifically reworded to bring them into line with the White Paper."
"These are Amendments Nos 2, 6, 11, 14, 16, 21 and 22."
"Amendment No 3 refers to the putting in place of a Community plan of action which, however, has already been established."
"We would prefer a reference to the implementation of the action plan which was formulated in the Commission proposal."
"Amendment No 15 provides for a new programme objective 1a which is already covered by Objective 1, and also relates to the actions that are to be taken under Objective 2e."
"As regards Amendment No 26, I believe that Parliament has in mind here the Commission's attitude that the committee procedure should not be changed."
"Amendment No 12 cannot be accepted because it refers to indirect costs and competitiveness, whilst the internalisation of the profits from renewable energy sources and the different ways and means of improving the competitiveness of renewable energy sources have already been elaborated at some length in the White Paper."
"In addition, the Commission is unable to accept Amendments Nos 27 and 28, because they go beyond the scope of this programme. Nor can we accept Amendment No 29, since we feel that the organic part of urban waste is a renewable energy source."
"Finally, we accept Amendment No 30 in principle, but we believe that this is already covered in the monitoring of progress of renewable energy sources which is provided for in Article 2."
"Madam President, I should now like to move on to the equally important report by Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz on the SAVE programme, which refers to the rational use of energy."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur warmly for the quality of her report."
"We all agree that the contribution of the SAVE programme to the rational use of energy and to reducing CO2 emissions in the European Union is especially important."
"The SAVE programme does not serve that objective alone; it also aims to secure the Community's energy supply."
"The European Union will continue to import large amounts of primary energies."
"The measures which aim to improve the way in which we use our energy sources would seem to have important implications for the lifetime of finite sources of mineral fuels, and will clearly reduce our dependency on imported energy."
"The SAVE programme will continue to support energy labelling and also the development of standards of energy efficiency for appliances which consume energy."
"We shall also continue to underpin the efforts of Member States to improve their energy efficiency, by exchanging information on the one hand, and by closely monitoring the performance of energy efficiency on the other."
"A significant share of the budget will continue to be channelled towards setting up local and regional SAVE offices, and its effects will be multiplied in conjunction with investments from the Community Structural Funds."
"The countries belonging to the European Economic Area as well as the countries involved in negotiations to accede to the European Union will continue to be able to participate in the programme, using their own financial resources."
"At this point, I would like to express my agreement with the rapporteur, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, on the level of budgetary funding."
"I agree with her entirely that, for renewable energy sources as a whole, and for the saving of energy and energy efficiency, we need more resources."
"It is clear, however, that we are moving in an area of financial austerity and, unfortunately, the European Parliament and the Council have not allowed the appropriations for these particular objectives to be increased any further."
"As regards the amendments, I would like to say that the Commission is able to accept five amendments exactly as they stand, and these are Amendments Nos 2, 3, 7, 10 and 16. We are also able to accept Amendment No 8, subject to it being reworded."
"The Commission will put forward new legislative measures where these are fully justified at Community level and in cases where other means, such as self-regulating agreements with the industry, have not yet proved effective."
"Moreover, initiatives by the Commission to take new legislative measures do not depend on the SAVE programme being adopted."
"Amendments Nos 1, 6, 9 and part of No 11, which provide for the number of legislative initiatives from the Commission to be increased, are not appropriate in this specific context and, as such, cannot be accepted."
"Amendments Nos 13, part of 15, 9 and 20, in which additional areas of study and pilot actions are proposed, substantially limit the scope of the programme and also the flexibility of the initiatives, and cannot therefore be accepted."
"The part of Amendment No 15 which talks about improving energy efficiency by switching from one energy source to another cannot be accepted either, because it goes beyond the scope of the programme."
"The Commission is unable to accept Amendment No 4, because an evaluation of the SAVE programme by independent assessors has shown that the programme has contributed to a large extent to improving energy efficiency in the Community."
"Amendment No 5 and part of No 11 also cannot be accepted because the objective of 1.5 %, although desirable and although we could agree to it in principle, is nevertheless over-optimistic in practice."
"Amendment No 18 cannot be accepted because it creates confusion between the SAVE and Altener programmes, and nor can Amendment No 12, because it too creates confusion between the SAVE programme and the fifth framework programme for research and technology."
"We are also unable to accept Amendment No 21, because we feel that the call for complementarity with the programmes that are being developed in the Member States makes our action more effective."
"By the same token, we do not accept Amendment No 22, because we consider it to be unnecessary."
"We want the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Cyprus and Malta to participate in the programme, but it is clear that funding their participation cannot be covered by the SAVE budget, because this would render the programme completely impossible to implement."
"As regards the call made by Mr Linkohr for a directive on the use and promotion of renewable sources of energy within the framework of the internal market in electricity, I should like to assure you that we are continuing our efforts and our consultations both with the German Presidency and the European Parliament to achieve the best possible outcome which the Member States could accept immediately, and which could be adopted immediately by the Council."
"I am bound to say that the Commission was prepared to put forward a directive. However, following discussions with the presidency, with certain Member States and also with the European Parliament, we realised that our proposal was a more ambitious one than the Member States were able to accept at this particular time."
"For this reason, we are proceeding apace with our efforts to devote all the time we have available to putting forward a proposal which could be accepted by the next Council of Energy Ministers."
"Finally, I would like to deal with the equally important and comprehensive report by Mr Stockmann on the Commission communication on energy efficiency."
"The importance of taking measures in the area of energy efficiency is set out using powerful and persuasive arguments, and the various actions are clearly defined."
"I would like to stress that the Commission agrees to a large extent with the principles and the bases of the report by Mr Stockmann, and also with the measures he proposes."
"There is also a complete convergence of opinion as regards the importance the report attaches to measures to disseminate information in the most effective way possible, to improve and bring into line with existing guidelines the standards and guidelines for public procurement, and to promote combined heat and power."
"This is also true in respect of the priority given to energy efficiency guidelines which relate to the renovation of existing buildings and the awarding of contracts for buildings maintenance."
"The measure proposed to promote energy service companies will be examined with particular care by the Commission's services, especially now that we have a new sphere of activity as we move towards the liberalisation of the market."
"Against this background, your proposal could best be examined in the light of these new developments."
"The Commission also agrees with Mr Stockmann regarding the regular evaluation of the Member States' plans for energy savings."
"We must encourage Member States to promote national energy plans in this direction."
"I would also like to point out that the possibilities for improving energy efficiency which are put forward in the report by Mr Stockmann are to some extent greater, and the objectives somewhat more ambitious, than the corresponding objectives contained in the Commission's communication."
"These greater possibilities and ambitious objectives are, of course, very laudable, but the Commission feels that they will be difficult to achieve with the existing Community funds."
"However, there is no doubt that they reflect the high priority given by the report to promoting action for energy efficiency."
"Madam President, I would once again like to thank the three rapporteurs for their excellent reports, which were of considerable help to us when we held our discussions, and which have brought us one step closer to attaining our common objective, which is nothing more than a sustainable future energy supply."
"Madam President, have I understood correctly? Is the Commissioner refusing to accept Amendments Nos 6 and 11?"
"If that is so, we might just as well go home now."
"If we just have your ECU 68 million over five years and no legislative measures - because you do not seem to want to take those on board - we will not get anywhere at all."
"That is quite obvious!"
"So when are you finally going to present some legislative measures, because without them this charade will go on forever."
"Madam President, indeed I do not accept those amendments, and for no other reason than that the legislative initiatives which must be taken by the Community and the legislative initiatives which must by taken by the Commission do not depend on the SAVE programme."
"We must move forward in this direction in any event."
"I do not accept them for that reason, and not because there is opposition to them in principle."
"It is not necessary to include the legislative initiatives in the SAVE programme."
"Thank you, Mr Papoutsis."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Bank charges"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions:"
"B4-0146/99 by Mr Hendrick and Mrs Randzio-Plath, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on bank charges; -B4-0149/99 by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on bank charges in the euro area; -B4-0150/99 by Mr de Lassus Saint Geniès, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, on exchange rate costs in the euro area; -B4-0151/99 by Mr Wolf, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on bank charges following the introduction of the euro; -B4-0152/99 by Mr Gallagher, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group, on bank charges in the European Union following the introduction of the euro; -B4-0153/99 by Mr Herman, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on bank charges following the introduction of the euro; -B4-0154/99 by Mrs González Álvarez, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on bank charges."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, monetary union has been with us for over ten weeks, but consumers in the EU are still finding it difficult to see the day-to-day advantages of monetary union for them."
"People travelling on business or as tourists who need to change their own national currency into another national currency - both of which after all simply represent the euro, which does not yet exist in the form of coins and banknotes - have discovered that the commissions charged on such transactions are still high, too high in fact. Their opinion is shared by the Subcommittee on Monetary Affairs, following its hearing involving banks, buildings societies and consumer associations."
"I would like to put the following question to the Commission: was it not a fundamental mistake to ignore the European Parliament's proposals during initial consultations about what should be covered by the euro regulation?"
"What strikes me is that the fee structure in the various Member States is remarkably similar."
"Yet in some Member States we now have commission rates of 6 %, and many people have reported different commission rates when exchanging from one national currency to another."
"This applies to the French franc, for example. I have also heard, for instance, that it is more expensive to change German marks into Italian lire than into French francs."
"I also have to say that both colleagues and members of the public have reported that there are banks and building societies which have ceased to offer exchange facilities, especially for certain currencies."
"I have heard that there are even central banks which have stopped making no-fee exchange transactions."
"The Commission needs to carry out a thorough investigation of all these issues to put a stop to these practices. And I mean an investigation by the Commission itself, not one under the aegis of the European banking associations."
"It is simply unacceptable that the introduction of the euro has not created greater confidence in monetary union on the part of our consumers, but just the opposite, it is breeding a climate of mistrust."
"It is high time that we had transparency."
"We need to know how high costs and charges were before the introduction of the euro and how high they are now after its introduction."
"We need an initiative from the Commission."
"What is more, what effect is competition having in reducing costs and charges for exchange transactions?"
"It is scandalous that Italian banks have been given advance warning of an investigation!"
"And can anyone claim that the Commission's investigation of only eight banks in connection with a possible cartel agreement is adequate?"
"That is why I think it is really important for the Commission to launch an initiative or take some other measures, perhaps even in the form of legislation, on maximum charges."
"The Commission's actions on cross-border transfers also really leave a great deal to be desired, given that there was a political undertaking to do more than just reduce the cost of cross-border transfers as from 15 August and to make such transfers more secure."
"As Members of the European Parliament were are deeply concerned about all these issues, and the public expects the Commission to take some action instead of dilly-dallying."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the banks claim that changing coins and notes from the euro zone costs them more for transport, insurance, staff and so on."
"I find this hard to believe. Why?"
"Because changing money within one and the same currency does not cost anything."
"For example, I do not have to pay to change a BEF 10 000 note into ten BEF 1 000 notes."
"Now, the exchange rates for the euro zone currencies have been fixed against each other and against the euro since the beginning of the year, which means that they form part of the euro and are thus part of one and the same currency."
"So what is the difference?"
"The House has been calling for there to be no charge for changing national currencies into euros because it is a compulsory exchange."
"We have not insisted on the same thing for exchanges between the euro zone currencies because these are voluntary."
"What we need, in any event, is complete transparency, which should in itself lead to lower costs both for exchanges and for cross-border payments."
"This must happen by 31 March this year, otherwise our group believes that we must consider introducing binding legislation so that the credibility of the euro is not undermined and consumers can enjoy the full benefits of monetary union."
"Madam President, even though not all the questioners are present for the discussion, the large number of oral questions on the subject of bank charges proves the importance and, if I may say so, the seriousness of this matter."
"Allow me to begin by summarising the situation before dealing with some specific issues."
"Since the Commission is being asked to take an initiative, I should like to explain the various initiatives already undertaken by it, all of them complementary with one another."
"First of all, the Commission fully agrees that one of the main arguments used to convince the EU's citizens of the benefits of the single currency was the fact that the introduction of the euro would bring down costs for tourists and for businesses trading across borders."
"We remain absolutely convinced by the soundness of this argument."
"Prior to the introduction of the euro, as the honourable Members know, the Commission adopted Recommendation 98/286 on banking charges for conversion to the euro."
"It provides that banks should not charge fees either for the conversion of accounts from the national currency of a Member State participating in the euro zone, for example from the French franc to the euro in France, or for the conversion of payments from the national currency into the European currency and vice versa."
"By the same token, banks may not levy different charges for services denominated in euros: in particular, they may not levy charges higher than those applying to identical services denominated in the national currency unit."
"Finally, for services such as the conversion of banknotes, the recommendation establishes rules on the transparency of the fees charged."
"On 8 December 1998 the Commission published an initial assessment, revealing that banks throughout the euro zone were intending to abide by the recommendation."
"It is true that the recommendation does not specify what constitutes an acceptable level of charges, but the volume of charges currently being levied on the services in question is undeniably a cause for serious concern."
"As you know, we must distinguish between two types of operation: the conversion of euro zone banknotes and cross-border payments."
"Let us begin with conversion transactions."
"Prior to the introduction of the euro, as Mr Hendrick and Mrs Randzio-Plath stressed in their question, conversion charges - covering the exchange-rate risk and the costs of handling foreign banknotes - were partly concealed in the spread; clients therefore had the impression that they were paying less than was really the case."
"Now that the conversion rates have been set officially, banks must indicate - separately from the conversion rate - every charge that is made."
"The elimination of the exchange-rate risk, deemed to represent around 15 to 20 % of the charges levied, and greater competition resulting from transparency should lead to a reduction in conversion charges, which has already happened to some extent."
"But this process must be accelerated."
"The Commission has been monitoring recent developments in this field very carefully, and has taken a number of measures to ensure that the cost of converting banknotes in the euro zone really is competitive."
"On 12 January 1999, I wrote to the European banking associations requesting the necessary information to compare the level of fees before and after the introduction of the euro."
"On 5 February, the Commission - that is, Mr de Silguy, Mrs Bonino and myself - issued a statement to the press inviting all the banks to publicise the changes they had made, before and after the introduction of the euro, to the total level of charges for banknote conversion in the euro zone and for cross-border payments in the form of cheques, credit transfers and paper."
"We asked the euro-zone banks to forward this information to the Commission by 31 March, via their European associations."
"Similarly, the press release of 5 February invited users of financial services to inform the Commission - by e-mail or fax - of cases where the banks have failed to respect the legal framework of the euro or the Commission's recommendation on the transparency of bank charges."
"My department has so far received some 200 messages."
"These relate to the level of fees, or to the continued existence of fees, rather than a failure to respect the legal framework or the recommendation."
"Mr Van Miert has since begun to investigate possible violations of the rules on competition, so as to ensure that there is competition between financial service providers in respect of exchange-rate fees and other bank charges. This matter was specifically raised by Mr de Lassus Saint Geniès."
"However I would also make it plain - to Mr Gallagher and Mrs González Álvarez in particular - that there is currently no intention of taking legislative measures in this area; after all, direct intervention in the establishment of banknote conversion costs in the euro zone would be incompatible with market principles and with contractual freedom."
"That is the situation for the time being."
"If I may, Madam President, I should now like to answer some of the specific questions raised by the honourable Members, implying that the present levels of charges for cross-border services indicates that the recommendation is being ignored."
"As I have explained, the recommendation states that such charges must be transparent, without specifying an acceptable level."
"Concern over the level of charges would rather seem to indicate the opposite, namely that the banks are abiding by the recommendation on transparency, which has raised awareness about the level of charges that were previously completely or partly hidden."
"The honourable Members wonder, furthermore, whether or not the disappearance of the exchange-rate risk has affected the level of the charges made for such services."
"We have received some partial data in response to our enquiry of 12 January; we publicised these on 29 January, but by 31 March we expect to have a complete picture of the situation on the basis of the requested information. We shall report back to Parliament accordingly."
"Finally, as regards cross-border payments - a topic raised by Mr Gasòliba I Böhm - this is a matter of great importance, which will not disappear automatically with the introduction of euro banknotes in 2002."
"In a single-currency area, it will be increasingly difficult for the public to understand why cross-border payments in euros should be more expensive than national payments."
"Therefore this problem must be addressed as a matter of urgency."
"It is not only politically important, but also commercially important to the banks that this matter should be explored rapidly, not least through investment in cross-border links between national retail payment systems, as pointed out by Mr Herman."
"The Commission is determined to act as a catalyst for all these developments; and to Mr Wolf, who asked what other initiatives are planned, I can reply that this is one."
"We are currently preparing a communication, to be published by May 1999, concerning the policy on payment systems in the economic and monetary union."
"Last of all, as far as cross-border credit transfers are concerned, I would recall that the directive which Parliament helped to adopt dates from January 1997, and that in the Conciliation Committee a very late date had to be set for its entry into force: mid-August 1999."
"The main reason was that this was demanded by one Member State, whereas the majority of Member States formally undertook to transpose the directive no later than the start date of the euro."
"However, this has not happened in most Member States, and at the ECOFIN Council on 8 February, I pointed out to the Finance Ministers that this directive needs to be implemented as soon as possible;"
"I am following this up in writing."
"Therefore the Member States too bear considerable responsibility here."
"I would add that, according to press reports over the past few days, the French Minister of Economics and Finance intends to embark on a dialogue with all the parties affected by euro-related bank charges."
"This is an encouraging sign. Given the overall context which I have described and in which - as you see - the Commission is actively pursuing a cohesive set of measures, I can assure the honourable Members that we are especially grateful for Parliament's support, not least in the form of initiatives such as the hearing which Mrs Randzio-Plath recently organised on this issue."
"Thank you, Mr Monti."
"I would just say something on the procedure. With oral questions to the Commission, the practice is always that the authors first introduce their questions, then the Commission answers, and then come the speakers for the political groups, who can once again state their position."
"Madam President, I have listened carefully to Commissioner Monti's explanations and we must say that they are unsatisfactory."
"They are unsatisfactory for several reasons."
"The first of these is the fact that this is not an unexpected situation we are facing."
"This is not the first time the House has debated the matter."
"We have already looked at this issue, and we have had plenty of advance warning."
"More than one year before the final stage began, we had already discussed this issue - levying bank charges during the transitional stage of monetary union - many times in the House. On two occasions, Parliament reached a conclusion which it made clear to the Commission: in order to avoid unfair practices in this field, the Commission would have to use its power of initiative to prepare a regulatory instrument, a definitive regulation that would set specific limits and establish some discipline."
"The Commission felt that this was not necessary, that a weaker instrument would suffice - a mere recommendation - and that we should trust in the effects of competition to control the situation."
"However, the truth is that the situation is even more negative than the most pessimistic forecasts."
"The general rule in terms of charges for exchanging euro area currencies is that the charge is at least 3 % and, in many cases, it is more than 3 %. Frankly, it is difficult to see how this figure can be taken as a real cost."
"It is difficult to believe the claim made by some banks that the exchange rate risk component in former charges only accounted for 10 % of the charge."
"Today, the Commissioner is telling us that it is between 15 % and 20 %."
"This is unbelievable."
"The majority of reasons banks use to continue charging handling costs, such as the cost of personnel, insurance, storage and so on, are reasons that would also be valid excuses for levying a charge for changing a 100 000 lira note into ten 10 000 lira notes."
"Costs are also involved in these cases, they are also non-interest bearing assets and so on."
"In the end, the result of such behaviour from banks will be that many people, many normal people, will come to the conclusion that the euro is not a single currency that has replaced the currencies of the 11 Member States participating in monetary union but that it is just one extra currency. It is another currency on top of their own currencies that still exist in practically the same conditions as before the euro was introduced."
"The single currency is a reality for the stock exchange and for the financial markets but not for normal people, not for tourists who need to change their money to spend it in another country. Nor is it a reality for the emigrant who is sending money to his home country and who sees that the cost of transferring money has remained the same or, in some cases, has even risen."
"What is at stake here, Commissioner, is something extremely important: the credibility of the single currency, the credibility of the most important operation the Union has undertaken in a very long time."
"This is what we are gambling with and, for this reason, we feel we should once again draw your attention to the possibility of revising the Commission's initial approach."
"Madam President, like my colleague, I am dissatisfied."
"Obviously I appreciate the Commissioner's commitment, but I would point out that I asked the Council an urgent question on this topic in January, which has still not been answered."
"For over four years the Commission, Parliament and the Member States' finance ministers have been telling the public and businesses that there would be a change of scene in the Community as from the landmark date of 1 January 1999, in that the cost of moving currency - the number-one tool of unification - would disappear."
"But none of this has happened!"
"It is more expensive to change a euro-zone currency now than it was in 1998."
"I could go on about this at length, but now is not the time."
"I have in my pocket a small example of what I am saying: like every conscientious MEP - and I am, moreover, vice-chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs - I have one euro account in my own country, Italy, and another here at my workplace."
"I paid a cheque drawn in euros into another euro bank account, and was asked to pay not only the normal cost of the banking transaction but also the cost of converting a foreign cheque."
"So I called for the branch manager and asked him whether he knew, in that specific case, what the lira was."
"To his answer that the lira is our national currency, I replied that, on 1 January, the lira - or franc, deutschmark or peseta - in fact became the national unit of the single currency."
"Unless the banks start working towards a common currency rather than a national one, it will be hard for us to convince the public, business leaders and small traders to work in a market which - as you rightly say, Commissioner - must become not just a single market but an internal market."
"Madam President, Commissioner, it has been interesting to take part in today's debate."
"I also wrote a letter to the Commission on this matter prior to the issue of electronic payments coming up for discussion."
"Much has been said on the subject of exchange-rate charges and transfer costs."
"It was interesting to note the Commission's repeated assurances that it would issue a communication in May, possibly devoted exclusively to payment systems."
"Moreover, I think people are very surprised that we do not have an interoperable bank card or customer payment system."
"I hope that on the one hand the Commission, by being vigilant with regard to competition, ensures that no one is excluded from the different payment or interoperable systems to be launched in the near future and, on the other, that it makes use of all the opportunities which are available."
"I should also like to suggest that while we are deciding what needs to be done, we also look into the transaction costs incurred as a result of using a credit card in another country."
"This is, of course, the only interoperable system which people can use when they are in another country."
"It is very hard to understand why the cost of using a credit card outside one's own country, but in another euro country, should be so high."
"I hope the Commission will give some thought to the matter."
"In this context, charges of 4 % and above have been mentioned."
"Madam President, first of all I should like to say that one of the major arguments used to convince our EU citizens of the benefits of the single currency was the fact that the euro would reduce costs for travellers and for enterprises involved in cross-border trade."
"It was widely anticipated that the elimination of exchange rate risks between the currencies of Member States within the euro zone would lead to a reduction in the costs involved in conversion transactions between these currencies."
"Notwithstanding these arguments, charges for exchanging euro area currencies have remained relatively high, as have bank charges for cross-border transfers, despite the fact that all the currencies are now inextricably linked."
"Parliament has consistently insisted that compulsory conversions between national currencies and the euro must be eliminated in every shape and form."
"It is important that the EU institutions remain vigilant on this matter."
"The Commission must continuously monitor, assess and publish the bank fees charged by the financial and banking sectors to ensure that no overcharging arises."
"This data must take account of the structure of bank charges and must allow for direct comparisons between conversion costs before and after the introduction of the euro so that transparency can be maximised on this important issue."
"The banking and financial sector in Europe should take it upon itself to draw up a code of conduct to ensure that the EU financial legislation governing these currencies is strictly enforced."
"In conclusion, I welcome the fact that the European competition directorate is now investigating banks suspected of overcharging customers for transaction costs post- January 1999."
"Madam President, I am delighted that you have called upon me to speak on behalf of the non-attached Members, but as there is no such group, I have the luxury of speaking on my own behalf, as anything else would not be logical."
"I have started off very dangerously, as with only one minute's speaking time, you can only afford such a long introduction if you can refer to what someone else has already said. In this case I am pleased to say that I fully agree with all Mrs Randzio-Plath's requests and would simply like to support them, in particular her call for the Commission to launch a real initiative and, as far as possible, to ensure transparency."
"However, the vital point is not that the public are now paying excessively high charges, but the fact that this came as a surprise."
"They had no idea what they were in for, and that is what is really wrong. The same members of the public who had to put up with major packages of cuts in order to meet the convergence criteria were persuaded to accept those criteria on the grounds that in future they would be able to travel within Euroland just as they had travelled within their own country in the past."
"The fact is, that has not happened."
"Charges still exist and in some cases they have even risen. The public do not perhaps feel that they have been cheated - I do not want to exaggerate - but at the very least they feel let down."
"This has done nothing to enhance the European Union's reputation in the eyes of the public in the various Member States."
"Madam President, Commissioner, in Le Monde on Wednesday 10 March there was an article with the following headline: 'Euro still a virtual currency for consumers', with the sub-heading: 'Two months after its introduction, the European currency is still a marginal method of payment'."
"I could not have put it better myself."
"So two months after all the fanfares surrounding its introduction amidst hype unprecedented before 1 January 1999 - and we as Members of Parliament were party to that - not only has the euro not caught on with consumers, it has also stirred up various doubts and fears amongst them."
"To my mind, this is a serious blow for the credibility of the new currency and for its acceptance by ordinary mortals."
"Of course it was predictable that national currencies would not be replaced by the euro very quickly in day-to-day transactions within the Member States."
"However, in view of the stability of the euro and a reduction in the cost of transfers, we might at least have expected an increase in cross-border transfers."
"Not a bit of it!"
"If anything, charges have increased."
"The banks have been quite frank in explaining that as they have lost their profit on the exchange-rate spread, they need to recoup their expenses in other ways, and the Commissioner seems to have gone along with this to some extent."
"Let me give you two examples from my own country."
"Since 1 January 1999, the Luxembourg post office has imposed a charge on every cross-border transfer - let there be no mistake, on every single cross-border transfer - amounting to a levy of LUF 80, whereas previously it had been free."
"By way of a second example, a member of the public wrote to me reporting that he had paid LUF 200 in bank charges on a transfer of LUF 268 to Germany."
"None of this will do anything to develop the single market in financial services for the consumer."
"In its communication on financial services, the Commission explained that there were enormous differences between one country and another in all areas affecting the ordinary consumer."
"I think that in the case of bank charges for converting the euro, the least we could have done would be to go for transparency."
"This would have involved explaining what these charges - which are now to be increased - consist of, why there is any need to increase them and what the sector's overall strategy is."
"Ultimately, Commissioner, the question is whether we are to leave things to market forces or whether regulation is envisaged."
"You have made it very plain that in your view there is no need for intervention, and that market forces should push down charges."
"Nevertheless, let me leave you with the following thought: at a time when everything works through the banking system and the average citizen is increasingly dependent on that system, we need to guarantee universal service in banking as well - the right to banking at an acceptable price."
"Madam President, consumers feel taken in and politicians foolish now that the introduction of the euro has failed to produce much lower exchange rates and has even, in the case of exchanges of smaller amounts, resulted in higher charges."
"The same applies for cross-border transfers."
"We were a little less naive than the Commission about what the banks would do, so we called for legislation to regulate exchange costs, but this did not materialise."
"Now the Commission is trying - too late, I fear - to restore its reputation by making dramatic attacks on the banks."
"The banks are right when they claim in their defence that they still have costs to pay, but they should have explained all this earlier when they were still passing on those costs in the form of different buying and selling rates."
"Now they are going to have to be a little more transparent about the costs involved, and if necessary we must introduce legislation to force them to do so."
"Finally, it is unacceptable that the banks should not yet have developed a cheap and efficient system for cross-border consumer payments."
"I find this completely baffling in a sector which claims that the customer comes first."
"The development of such a system should be the top priority in my opinion, and it would also enable the banks to get at least some of their own back."
"Madam President, I wish to thank all the speakers."
"They provide me with the opportunity to identify one point on which I believe there is full agreement among us, namely, that the present situation is deeply unsatisfactory; and one point where there are partial divergences, namely, how to remedy that situation."
"The present situation is indeed quite unsatisfactory."
"The figures deriving from the first partial returns from the banking associations indicate that charges for exchanging banknotes have decreased in many cases by anything from 15 % to over 40 % depending on the amount and the currency being exchanged."
"They also indicate, however - and this is the most unsatisfactory part of it - that the decreases have been less when small amounts - for example, less than the equivalent of EUR100 - are exchanged, and in some cases the charges for exchanging small amounts may have increased."
"This is totally unacceptable."
"The divergence arises where apparently some of you seem to believe that simply setting the level of the charges by a directive or a regulation would be both necessary and sufficient."
"Here the Commission happens to have a different view."
"Certainly we are not so naive as to believe that the unregulated play of the market will do the trick."
"Obviously not."
"What are we doing, since our purpose is not simply to complain loudly but to try to change the situation on the ground?"
"What we are trying to do is, one the one hand, to impose competition."
"Hence the actions of the competition Commissioner to see whether agreements or cartels have been put in place."
"The Commission has the power to eliminate them if that is the case."
"We are also trying to impose transparency."
"As we all know, transparency is a prerequisite for competition and we are using all possible weapons to impose transparency, such as asking banks and bank federations to convey their data; and also in the most immediate way by opening up e-mail sites and faxes available to consumers and citizens."
"We should also avoid creating confusion."
"For example, when the issue of the remittances of migrant workers is brought into the picture, then obviously this has to do, not with conversion charges, but with the good or bad functioning of cross-border credit transfers."
"There the relevant instrument is the one on which legislation has already been enacted - the directive for cross-border credit transfers of early 1997."
"As I indicated in my earlier intervention, there the problem is with a delay in transposition on the part of Member States - hence the actions vis-à-vis finance ministers."
"It would be a great help, I would add, if Members of the European Parliament could also put pressure on their respective national authorities to speed up the implementation."
"Finally, to indicate the complexity of the matter and the panoply of instruments through which the Commission - which is particularly active in this area - is addressing the problem, I should mention that we have proposed two draft directives on the issuance of electronic money."
"It so happens that electronic money may be the first way in which citizens will be able to make cash payments in euros before 2002."
"There were strong interests asking us to limit the ability to issue electronic money to banks."
"We said No, because we want to create competition there too, for the benefit of the consumer."
"So in our draft directive we made provision for other institutions to create electronic money - provided, of course, that they are submitted to an appropriate prudential framework."
"Therefore, we all share the point of view that this is an extremely serious matter, of great relevance, as you all stress, to the credibility of the euro and, incidentally, of the financial system."
"I am afraid it is not a problem concerning which somewhat simplistic solutions such as merely legislating would have the desired results."
"Thank you, Mr Monti."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Leaf tobacco"
"The next item is the report (A4-0067/99) by Mr Trakatellis, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) amending Regulation (EEC) No 2075/92 and fixing the premiums and guarantee thresholds for leaf tobacco by variety group and Member State for the 1999, 2000 and 2001 harvests (COM(98)0633 - C4-0682/98-98/0306(CNS))."
"Madam President, the Commission proposal only partly addresses the restructuring of the common organisation of the market in tobacco."
"There are four points in relation to which the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has made changes which we believe will be adopted."
"The first point concerns the fact that, since 1995, there has been absolutely no readjustment of premiums, which has resulted in producers suffering a substantial reduction in income."
"Our committee has proposed a 5 % increase in premiums, which exactly covers inflation in the European Union since 1995."
"The second point concerns the transfer of certain varieties of tobacco from one category to a better one."
"We believe that this is quite proper, except that these transfers must be possible and they must go ahead."
"Let me give you a specific example from Italy, where out of approximately 15 000 tonnes, which is the guarantee threshold, it has been proposed to transfer between 3 000 and 3 500 tonnes from an inferior variety group to other groups. This can go ahead."
"In Greece, on the other hand, out of approximately 15 000 tonnes, it has been proposed to transfer 14 800 tonnes, which is impossible within the time suggested."
"This cannot go ahead for many reasons. I would like to say, first of all, that if a producer were able to change his variety, why would he not do so?"
"For less tobacco production, he would receive the same money."
"What our committee is proposing, therefore, after much study and debate, is that up to 25 % could be transferred, at least in the case of Greece."
"The third point concerns the time needed for implementation."
"We are already well into the 1999 period, and these transfers require study and a programme."
"We propose that the framework should be implemented for 2000-2002, as this is logical and feasible."
"The fourth point concerns the introduction of a national variety which is grown in the region of Pieria and bears the name of a town in Pieria: Katerini."
"It has been proposed that this variety should be moved to another region of the European Union, in other words outside those regions which are provided for in the COM regulations."
"We believe that this will have negative results, rather than the desired outcomes."
"These are the four points in relation to which our committee has made changes which I believe must be accepted by the Commission."
"There are some amendments which refer to the harmful effect of smoking on health and which say that funding must not be given and that tobacco production must be reduced."
"However, what they do not say is that if production is reduced, imports of tobacco from outside the European Union will increase for years to come."
"I feel, therefore, that this is an unreasonable proposal."
"We seem to be unwilling to face reality. Perhaps the campaign against smoking should be waged from the point of view of consumption and not from the point of view of production."
"I am a doctor and I do not smoke, but I find it illogical that we want to reduce production when we currently import tobacco and will import more in the future as a result. This will have damaging economic effects on the European Union and it will also lead to social unrest, because many tobacco producers will be left without work, not only in Greece but in Italy, Spain, Portugal and Germany - everywhere, in fact."
"What the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is proposing, therefore, is that these amendments should be rejected - and we have already rejected similar amendments in committee - because, as we have said, we believe that there must be economic and social support in the tobacco-producing sector."
"This is the truth and the reality of the matter."
"I propose that we fight to reduce smoking, in which case world production of tobacco will be reduced."
"What we are in fact doing is punishing our own tobacco producers while rewarding tobacco producers in countries outside the Community and creating a major social problem in the European Union."
"Madam President, the Commission proposal we are examining this evening focuses on issues relating to the fixing of premiums and guarantee thresholds for leaf tobacco."
"By a decision of the Council of 22 June 1998, the additional funding which is allocated for cultivated tobacco in Austria, Belgium, Germany and France will increase by between 50 % and 65 % in relation to the 1992 harvest."
"In addition, in order to maintain financial neutrality, the overall level of guarantee thresholds will fall by 0.95 % between 1999 and 2001."
"Premiums are to be increased by 10 %, with a corresponding reduction in special subsidies allocated through producer organisations."
"These proposals maintain financial neutrality, and therefore the Committee on Budgets raises no objection to them."
"I would point out that the value of the premiums has fallen by 5 % in real terms in relation to 1995."
"Consequently, an increase in the order of a further 5 % would be a logical readjustment. For this reason, I support the amendments tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"I support the comments made by Mr Trakatellis on the difficulties and the fundamental inability of Greek producers to carry out tobacco transfers."
"Greek producers are small and medium-sized tobacco producers and it is impossible to replace the qualities they cultivate. Essentially, in the infertile soil where the tobacco is grown, it is impossible for them to switch to better varieties in such a short time."
"That is why, Madam President, I believe that the Commission proposals regarding Greece do not fall within the spirit of the common organisation of the market in raw tobacco."
"Madam President, I rise to speak for the chairman of my committee, Mr Collins, and the majority - indeed I believe every Member - of that committee who voted on the amendments we have tabled."
"I fear I cannot speak with the mild good humour and the calm words of my chairman."
"I get quite indignant when I hear my good friend, Mr Trakatellis say that of course we must wage a campaign against tobacco, but if we are going to kill 28 million people in Europe per year with tobacco, it may as well be with our own subsidised crops."
"That surely should not be the answer."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection believes that with tobacco responsible for as many deaths as it is, the hypocrisy here is, on the one hand, for the European Commission to be spending large sums of money on subsidising research into cancer but throwing away a similar amount on the subsidy - and now the renewed subsidy - of this crop."
"The fact of the matter is that we have been, for 28 years, supporting tobacco growing within the Community and the financial dependency that goes with it."
"The Environment Committee has asked for a gradual reduction in these quotas and premiums for raw tobacco."
"We intended that, in the countries where the dependency was the greatest, to take effect by 2008 - in ten years - and in the northern countries, where, as we have just heard, there is a proposal to increase the sums available from 50 % to 65 % in relation to the 1992 harvest, we wanted that abolished within five years."
"We are not getting that."
"We are moving in the wrong direction and we are creating a health problem."
"To my good friend Mr Trakatellis, who is himself a doctor, I ask if he could honestly deny that is the case?"
"Every time there is a case brought against the tobacco multinationals, every time damages are proved once again in one of these cases, we see the medical evidence laid bare."
"We all understand that fact."
"When I hear Trakatellis I am reminded of what the martyr Jan Huss said when he saw people piling up the faggots to burn him to death."
"He said to an old peasant woman coming forward with her faggots: 'O sancta simplicitas '."
"Those who argue for a greater subsidy for tobacco are saying that today."
"I say to them: sancta simplicitas ."
"This is not the way to go."
"Madam President, discussing tobacco is always very awkward, not so much because of the hour at which we have to do it, as because of the difficulty we MEPs have in understanding one another."
"This is where the main obstacles lie."
"As the representative of the Environment Committee said, there is a fundamental paradox here."
"It is true that smoking is unhealthy, but it is equally true that the problem will not be solved by reducing or eliminating tobacco growing in Europe."
"Either we take a radical position and have the courage to call for smoking to be banned, or else we try to cut the rhetoric."
"The arguments are always the same: on occasion, I have had to support tobacco growers and defend the sponsorship of major sporting events, including the Formula 1 Grand Prix, even though tobacco advertising has been banned at these, and certain Member States' governments have challenged the legality of the measures we are adopting."
"It was nevertheless decided to press ahead, without applying the principle of subsidiarity, bearing in mind that other sectors - such as textiles and clothing - had branding problems needing to be tackled gradually over time."
"We are told at one and the same time that production should be switched and that milk quotas cannot be increased, that under the COM in wine vineyards cannot be replanted or extended, and so on in all the other farm sectors."
"Let us call a spade a spade; let us not make impractical proposals."
"If we put forward workable ideas, with the necessary subsidies, then tobacco growers will be willing to go along with our initiatives - as long as they are feasible."
"Let us cut the rhetoric of the Environment Committee's amendments. Let us support the Commission's proposal as amended by Mr Trakatellis, remaining consistent with the realistic approach we adopted previously, granting aid for quality improvements with a view to promoting tobacco that is less harmful than before, and investigating tangible - not rhetorical - ways of embarking on a process of crop substitution."
"Madam President, the Commission proposal on the fixing of premiums and quotas for tobacco over the next three years centres around two main issues."
"Firstly, it aims to abolish group V varieties almost totally and in a very short space of time and, secondly, it offers the possibility of transferring the Katerini variety and introducing it into Italy."
"As regards the first issue, the Commission seems to be unaware of the particular conditions of production in the specific regions where these varieties are grown, since it is proposing the substitution of certain varieties, such as black tobacco, in soil where their cultivation is simply impossible."
"Moreover, the very short space of time proposed by the Commission for this substitution will mean a deadlock for producers, whereby any idea of planning will be turned on its head."
"As regards the second issue, the introduction of the Katerini variety into Italy will affect the operation of the market both in terms of prices and stocks, since it will have a negative impact on the balance of supply and demand, and in terms of the quality of this variety of tobacco, since the soil and climatic conditions of the new producer regions are totally different from the regions where it has been grown for the last 30 years."
"Unfortunately, the Agriculture Commissioner has failed to bring me the study I had asked for, which was allegedly written by a Greek and which purported to show that these tobacco varieties could prosper and be productive in Italy."
"I am still waiting for the name of the Greek who carried out this study, and this is the first time the Commission has taken account of a study and put forward a proposal based on one."
"This has not happened before."
"I am still waiting for Mr Fischler to give me the name and the relevant details."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur for his own amendments and for those accepted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"I believe that they greatly improve the Commission proposal."
"These amendments aim to improve conditions for the production of tobacco, to set in motion a rational and feasible adjustment in terms of time towards improving the quality of tobacco and, finally, to maintain the level of income of many families on the continent of Europe who live in some of the poorest regions of the European Union, something which the author of the study never really took into consideration."
"I would just like to say a word in conclusion."
"As the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has been proposing amendments and talking about health matters for the last five years, it would be a good idea if it tabled an amendment to ban the use of butter, since butter damages the heart and increases the risk of heart disease. We should also ban the circulation of cars, because I doubt that there is a scientist who can say that smoking is more harmful than the pollution caused by cars and car manufacturers."
"At some point the hypocrisy in this House has to stop."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Trakatellis report is a moderate one."
"It is a moderate report because it makes certain suggestions that, in my view, will help to adapt the tobacco market to the need to improve quality, give tobacco producers the time they need to change varieties and, at the same time, act as a preventive measure by promoting change to a given variety such as Caterini in the case of Italy."
"I agree with Mr Trakatellis's proposals and also agree with the 5 % increase which is really just compensation for the successive devaluations that have taken place since 1995."
"5 % is no big deal."
"However, I would like to emphasise two aspects."
"First of all, the lack of concern shown by the European Parliament, in my view, about fighting fraud in the tobacco sector."
"I have no doubt whatsoever that if fraud in the tobacco sector - one of the major forms of fraud to be found in Europe - were really taken seriously, without crocodile tears or hypocrisy, the money recovered would be more than enough to pay for the many illnesses that the Committee on the Environment says affect smokers - since we know full well and have been amply warned that tobacco is harmful."
"As far as I am concerned, the only thing I ask of a smoker is that they do not disturb me and blow their smoke over me."
"I should also like to point out that tobacco is one of the most heavily taxed products."
"In my country, it is taxed at 82 %."
"I think that whoever takes the risk of smoking and becoming ill will already have paid for his hospital bed."
"It may be in poor taste to say this but it is the truth."
"As far as I am concerned I think everyone should be free to do as they wish as long as they do not inconvenience others."
"Madam President, I could not allow to go by default possibly my last opportunity in this Parliament to point out the nonsense of spending over ECU1 billion subsidising the growing of a product which kills and maims its consumers."
"Only yesterday at the end of the debate on Mr Needle's report on European public health policy Commissioner Bangemann pointed out the contradiction of spending vastly more public money on supporting a product which undermines health than on public health programmes."
"We are actually discussing here a Commission proposal to increase payments to tobacco producers in four of the richest countries in the European Union, allegedly because they produce better quality tobacco."
"France, Germany, Belgium and Austria are not countries so poor or with soil so poor that no other crops can grow there."
"There is absolutely no case on social grounds, such as could possibly be made for Greece or Spain, for public money to be used in this way."
"I was a lone voice in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the date of the vote, supporting the amendments of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and very similar ones of my own, calling for the phasing out of subsidies for all tobacco."
"Sadly, others who shared my view could not be present on that occasion."
"I strongly support my colleague Mr Whitehead."
"The proposals before us move completely in the wrong direction."
"If European farmers want to grow tobacco it should be without public subsidy and the subsidies that exist should be phased out over a number of years with extra support to Objective 1 and Objective 5b areas during the transition."
"Increaisng subsidies over three years to rich countries is totally indefensible."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, tobacco is a plant, and that has been evident in today's debate, during which opinions have been divided and which has been marked by repeated references to certain fundamental themes. These references have chiefly come from Members not concerned with agriculture, who see the debate more in terms of social policy."
"I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur very sincerely for all his efforts."
"The importance of tobacco production in the agricultural sector of the European Union and of individual Member States varies widely."
"I believe that for a number of reasons it would be unwise to abandon tobacco production in the EU without any compromises, as many people are demanding."
"In many regions of Europe, tobacco growing is often the only viable form of agricultural production, and this applies particularly to a number of Objective 5(b) areas, including those in 'rich' countries such as Austria."
"Many family farms working in difficult conditions are dependent on tobacco production, which represents their only source of income."
"Switching to other agricultural products is often out of the question because of the climate."
"I think we are all acutely aware of the social and economic pressure on the population of these regions."
"My second point is that it is pretty unrealistic to expect that people would smoke less or even give up altogether if we completely stopped European tobacco production."
"The result would just be that all our cigarettes and tobacco products would be imported from third countries."
"I hope that you will not misunderstand me, as I attach great importance to a healthy lifestyle and I myself am a non-smoker."
"Nevertheless I think that decisions about our own health should be left to the individual."
"I think we should grant each person that much responsibility."
"In this context, I would like to point out the need for an improvement in tobacco quality."
"I would also like to stress that a voluntary halt to tobacco production in the EU should be possible, with financial support from the EU."
"Madam President, I feel as though I am at the races: whenever we discuss tobacco it is the same old Derby between Latins, Mediterraneans and Anglo-Saxons, as if the latter did not smoke."
"It really is disconcerting that yet again, one year after we last met here to discuss the COM, we are sticking to our guns and saying the same things."
"I was tempted to repeat the speech I made last year, just to check whether anyone was listening!"
"Mind you, I shall not stray very far from it."
"In any event, while the Derby continues, some points have been scored by those wishing to abolish the cultivation of this crop in Europe."
"The prices and premiums have been unchanged since 1995, meaning that they have already fallen by 5 % in real terms; the COM is being put into effect slowly - indeed, for the time being it merely represents additional costs; and the negative effects of the transition from the ecu to the euro are weighing most heavily of all on areas where tobacco is grown, in other words - let us not forget - in the most peripheral areas, those of Objective 1."
"What is more, neither the COM proposal nor that of the Commission takes the slightest account of new elements which we attempted to introduce last year: for example the social proposals - recalled by several speakers - aimed at eliminating tobacco growing as a means of combating cancer, as if people would stop smoking because they could no longer find any European cigarettes on the market."
"Clearly the big American multinationals would have a field day!"
"Well, in many respects the wrong approach is once again in evidence this evening."
"Smokers will not stop smoking, and let us not forget it, but woe betide us if we halt tobacco growing: unemployment in Europe would rise, more or less, by another 1 380 000."
"That would be extremely damaging, without a doubt."
"All of this is proposed in some of the amendments put down by Mr Collins and others."
"Mr Collins says 'stop growing tobacco and grow some other farm produce instead'. My reply to him is that this cannot be done everywhere, and that to ask other Europeans to do so is certainly not acceptable."
"And my own question is this: given that alcohol is more lethal than tobacco, why don't you British stop producing whisky and start growing strawberries?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, both the Commission proposal and the report before us are based on the premise that health should be sacrificed on the altar of structural policy."
"As a non-smoker and farmer myself, I think it is important to recognise the double standards involved in the present form of tobacco subsidy."
"I find it hard to believe that no other crop would thrive where tobacco is grown."
"We need subsidies in that if we stop growing various tobacco varieties here, they would have to be bought in from outside the Community."
"It is also clear that we need a change, an improvement in structural policy in the weak regions, in this case in Greece and Italy."
"I accept that production cannot be stopped overnight in these countries, but I feel that we have been talking about this for far too long."
"From my own national viewpoint, the Commission's proposals are acceptable."
"Although the guarantee thresholds have been reduced, this reduction at the same time makes it possible to increase the premium for the northern countries."
"But overall, I believe that these subsidies should be rejected in their present form."
"Why?"
"Because increasing subsidies does not persuade tobacco-growing countries to switch to other crops, but if anything encourages them to carry on as before, because ironically enough the cigarettes that are most damaging to health are those that receive the greatest subsidy."
"The Commission's proposals are quite simply market-oriented."
"The quotas for varieties with guaranteed markets and high market prices are being gradually increased, whilst the quotas for varieties with weaker markets and low market prices are being correspondingly reduced."
"For 28 years now tobacco production has been receiving massive support without any sign of a change of course."
"The varieties produced in the Community are of low quality, and producers should show more ambition and switch their production to higher-quality varieties."
"To conclude, let me ask what lessons we should be learning."
"First, I believe that tobacco subsidies should be abolished by 2008."
"Second, during the transitional period, they should be reduced in a socially acceptable manner."
"Third, as part of this reduction process, less harmful varieties should receive support and varieties which are particularly damaging to health should no longer be subsidised."
"Fourth, we should provide financial support during the transition period while production is switched to other agricultural products."
"These suggestions are not anti-smoker, they are aimed at enhancing quality and improving health, and I believe that they also offer a solution for farmers."
"Madam President, I wish to begin by complimenting the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, on the quality and efficiency of their work on the proposal to complete the reform of the COM in leaf tobacco."
"To tell the truth, we spent a long time discussing the committee's report and the proposal on the COM reform."
"The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission all agree on the need to continue supporting tobacco growers, whilst at the same time offering them the appropriate incentives to improve product quality."
"In keeping with the thrust of the report, the Commission is proposing to leave unchanged the premium levels and quota amounts, while considering a sizeable reduction in the quota for group V."
"Having said that, I should like briefly to review the main issues raised in the amendments."
"As regards those aimed at excluding the 1999 harvest - Amendments Nos 1 and 3 - the Commission cannot accept them, because the reform of the COM is to enter into force and apply from the 1999 harvest onwards."
"Furthermore, the impact of the proposal on producers is limited, in that the guarantee thresholds are maintained for all variety groups with the exception of group V; for this group, the existing threshold is below 30 % for Greece and 22 % for Italy."
"This deficit is being transferred to other groups on the grounds of poor quality and low market prices."
"We cannot accept Amendments Nos 2 and 6, since the annual stability of the budget must be respected."
"The amendments dealing with the adverse impact of monetary conversion - Nos 4 and 5 - are unacceptable because, in the Commission's view, the same rules must apply to the common organisation of the market in tobacco as to the other COMs."
"Concerning the amendments on the guarantee thresholds - Nos 7, 8 and 9 - the Commission wishes to avoid disrupting the market in all group V varieties, for which market prices are poor and which face competition from cigarettes manufactured in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union."
"Therefore, although we are prepared to examine the impact on the sector of the proposal to transfer amounts to other groups, we confirm our reservations concerning any reduction in group V."
"We cannot accept Amendments Nos 10 and 13, as the additional sum for northern tobacco-growing Member States reflects the situation of their growers and so should not be changed."
"Amendments Nos 11, 12, 14 and 15 deal with the mandatory disengagement of the Community."
"I can reaffirm what the Commission proposed and Parliament agreed last time Mr Fischler discussed this matter here: the tobacco grown in the European Union covers only about a third of Community consumption, and therefore imports - currently accounting for two thirds of domestic consumption - could easily cover it entirely."
"On the other hand, support for tobacco growers is vital in that they are concentrated in the least developed regions of the European Union, without any obvious agricultural or economic alternatives, as has been pointed out."
"Moreover, the tobacco reform already makes provision for voluntary withdrawal from the sector, but we should not force farmers to leave the land."
"Therefore the Commission cannot accept these amendments."
"Commissioner, you have lavished words of praise on the report, but I still do not understand which of the amendments voted for by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development you accept."
"Why do you pay the report so many compliments if you do not accept a single amendment?"
"I should like to know which amendments you accept."
"Mr Trakatellis, the report has an intrinsic value which transcends the individual amendments, clearly, and our words of appreciation related to the undertaking as a whole."
"However, as I said, Amendments Nos 7, 8 and 9 are acceptable to the Commission."
"As for the amendments on the guarantee thresholds, the Commission wishes to avoid disrupting the market in all group V varieties, for which market prices are poor and which face competition from cigarettes manufactured in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union."
"Therefore, although we are prepared to examine the impact on the sector of the proposal to transfer amounts to other groups, we confirm our reservations concerning any reduction in group V."
"My apologies, Madam President, the interpretation may be to blame, but I did not understand Mr Monti's reply or his politeness."
"We want an answer."
"Which of the amendments does Mr Monti accept?"
"That was Mr Trakatellis's question."
"Is it the first one, the second one, the third one, the fourth one, or none of them?"
"My impression is that he does not accept any of them, but he could at least tell us in a word, so that we do not leave the House without having understood."
"Madam President, I am doing my best to convey the Commission's position in a field which, as you know, does not fall within my competence but that of Mr Fischler."
"Amendments Nos 7, 8 and 9 are accepted, with a transfer - or rather a change - in Annex II, transferring amounts from group III to group I and to group II in France."
"The Commission reserves the right to examine the other transfers covered in Amendments Nos 7, 8 and 9, namely those in Annex II aiming both to lessen the reduction in group V in Greece and to prevent the introduction of Katerini and similar varieties into Italy."
"I hope I have been clearer now."
"Thank you, Mr Monti."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Staff Regulations of the European Communities"
"The next item is the report (A4-0098/99) by Mr Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) amending Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68 laying down the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the Communities (COM(98)0312 - C4-0332/98-98/0176(CNS))."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this really is a very important report."
"In recent years Parliament has adopted various decisions, particularly in resolutions on budgetary matters, which have repeatedly stressed that this House would like to see a statute for parliamentary assistants to Members."
"We all remember the report by the Court of Auditors which came before us a few months ago, and which was by no means uncritical - I am choosing my words carefully - of the remuneration of assistants. I accordingly believe that it is high time that the issues of assistants' pay and their conditions of employment were sorted out one way or another."
"However, and this is the important point, we need to approach this in a serious and rational manner. Although the proposal that we are now considering has been presented by the European Commission, it was not actually prepared by the Commission, but by European Parliament officials."
"It was entrusted to the President of the Commission by the President of Parliament with a request to adopt it. I have to say that I find this proposal unacceptable in the form we have before us."
"The proposal essentially provides for the conditions of employment of other servants to be included in a new Article 78, the gist of which is that parliamentary assistants are categorised as other servants of the European Union, and furthermore that the details of the conditions of employment should be laid down in general administrative provisions to be enacted by Parliament itself."
"That is the heart of the problem."
"The legal basis of the Staff Regulations and the conditions of employment of other servants, that is to say the Merger Treaty, does not provide for an enabling regulation for Parliament."
"For that reason I have always been critical of this Commission proposal, or rather the proposal prepared by Parliament's administration, because it does not deal with the question of implementing regulations."
"Nor am I the only one of this opinion: in its judgment of 7 May 1992, the European Court of Justice made exactly the same point."
"The Court of Justice then ruled, and I am quoting now, that: 'The general implementing provisions issued under the Staff Regulations may lay down criteria by which the administration should be guided in exercising its discretion or to clarify the meaning of unclear provisions of the Staff Regulations."
"They may not, however, indirectly limit the scope of the Staff Regulations by restating in more precise terms an already clear provision of those regulations'."
"In plain English, that means that implementing regulations may not conflict with the spirit of the Staff Regulations."
"If they do, they are invalid and should be disregarded."
"They do not have the same legal force as the Staff Regulations themselves."
"On this basis, the European Court of Auditors stated the following in a report to the Council of Ministers, prepared at the request of the Council, in the form of an opinion on this Commission proposal: 'In the present case, general implementing provisions which preclude the application of normal unambiguous provisions of the Staff Regulations, particularly with regard to length of service, for a particular category of auxiliary staff, may be regarded as unlawful and their application could be challenged in an action against a particular case decision'."
"In other words, the Court of Auditors totally agrees with your rapporteur and with the European Court of Justice that if we adopt the Commission proposal, the implementing regulations will be thrown back at us and in the end only the provisions of the Staff Regulations for officials and other servants will apply."
"This will make it impossible to take account of the special conditions of employment of parliamentary assistants."
"The result will then quite simply be - and I am estimating that there are 2 000 parliamentary assistants - 2 000 additional European Parliament officials."
"I think that demonstrates a lack of responsibility and is contrary to the spirit of what we are trying to achieve here."
"That is why I originally proposed to the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights that the legal basis should be changed, and that a statute for assistants should instead be prepared, which would have formed an annex to the Statute for Members of the European Parliament and which would have taken as its legal basis the provisions of Article 190 of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"For tactical reasons, the Legal Affairs Committee rejected this proposal so as keep the Council's decision making on the Statute for Members of the European Parliament and on the statute for assistants separate from each other."
"However, this will mean that provisions that are supposed to be the subject of contracts between assistants, Members and of course Parliament's administration will then have to be incorporated in the statute itself, or to be precise in the Commission proposal itself."
"This is what I proposed in a second report to the Legal Affairs Committee."
"The only legally watertight alternative which might also be possible would be to dispense with a statute for assistants altogether and arrange instead for the Quaestors or the Bureau to decide in what circumstances a secretarial allowance could still be granted, and also to include issues such as social security obligations and an appropriate level of remuneration in these arrangements."
"The Legal Affairs Committee was then faced with a very close vote. My proposal initially attracted support, but the Commission draft ultimately won the day, so that the report which I am presenting on behalf of the Legal Committee contains various contradictions and I as rapporteur cannot support what was agreed in committee."
"For this reason I have today tabled a number of amendments on behalf of my group which reflect the draft report which I originally presented to the Legal Affairs Committee, and I urge the House to adopt these."
"I fear that if we were to adopt the Commission proposal in the form presented to us, it would not be acceptable to the Council of Ministers, in view of the Council's existing reservations in the light of the judgment of the European Court of Justice which I have quoted, and because of the second report of the Court of Auditors."
"We would therefore be reaching a sort of token decision along these lines: Parliament wants a statute for assistants but is adopting an unrealistic text in the knowledge that the Council will ultimately reject it."
"This would not help anyone, neither the assistants themselves nor the Members of Parliament."
"For this simple reason I would urge the House to adopt the original draft report presented to the Legal Affairs Committee and not the Commission proposal."
"If this fails and there is not a majority in favour of my proposal tomorrow, I will feel obliged, in the interests of achieving a worthwhile outcome, to request referral back to the Legal Affairs Committee, or, if there is absolutely no other way, to reject this version of the report, because I personally neither want nor feel able to take responsibility for something that I am convinced is wrong, and is to all intents and purposes a token gesture that cannot possibly solve the problems we face in this area."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have to say that the rapporteur's sharp criticism of the Commission should not be taken to reflect the views of the committee."
"I wanted to correct that impression immediately."
"Our work on the statute for assistants to Members of the European Parliament has been difficult and has been made even more difficult by the strident background music which has accompanied it."
"Nevertheless, we managed to find a way to give our assistants fair conditions of employment including social security arrangements, whilst preserving the autonomy of the European Parliament."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists smoothed the path with its proposals."
"We should now adopt these proposals by a clear majority in the interests of our closest confidants."
"The amendments tabled by my group include two additional elements. Firstly, taking the Commission proposal as a basis, we have made provision to regulate the employment relationship between Members and their assistants."
"This should secure the Council approval which we need."
"The Council cannot have any objections if we call for general conditions of employment including recruitment, dismissal, remuneration and social security to be the subject of a contract."
"Nor can it have any objections to a requirement that professional confidentiality and a ban on unauthorised second jobs including lobbying should form part of the contractual conditions of employment."
"The prohibition of discrimination against citizens of third countries makes sense in view of the forthcoming enlargement of the Union, and the Council will certainly not reject the statute on those grounds."
"The autonomy of Parliament to make decisions on its own affairs will be guaranteed by the second part of our proposal."
"I have in mind the general implementing provisions that Parliament will adopt itself, which will lay down the details of contracts of employment on the basis of a proposal from the relevant committee."
"This will also enable us to accommodate many of the rapporteur's proposals without the risk that the Council will object to a particular provision and will therefore drop the whole statute."
"I would like to mention two points which I feel particularly strongly about."
"The first one is short and simple."
"Any statute that does not provide our assistants with the best social protection available, including sickness and pensions schemes, should go straight into the waste-paper bin."
"It is not worth the paper it is written on."
"The second point is also extremely important: our assistants' remuneration."
"They must be paid fairly and in line with their performance."
"After all, we are not rewarding certificates and diplomas, but the quality of the work done."
"So we do not want a fixed scale based on certificates, professional qualifications and officials' grades. What we need is a high degree of flexibility in drawing up contracts as employers, and also flexibility as regards remuneration."
"There is also another point that we have already covered in connection with the Statute for Members of the European Parliament."
"The contractually agreed remuneration should be transferred from the European Parliament direct to assistants' accounts."
"This provides us with some degree of protection against the constant insinuations we have heard over the last few days that Members are a pack of thieves who exploit their assistants and use phantom posts to line their own pockets."
"Thank you for your attention. I hope that on Thursday you will support my group and myself by voting to give our assistants social security and to preserve the European Parliament's autonomy."
"Madam President, I agree with all those who have said that the work carried out on this regulation has not been easy; indeed, it has been extremely difficult."
"Parliament has not come out of it very well, and I should like to say that we regard the outcome of the votes in committee as unsatisfactory."
"For our part, we believe that the Commission's proposal was a good starting-point, so we have tabled one or two minor amendments clarifying in which cases the rules proposed by the Commission will apply."
"We maintain that it should be made clear which assistants will be covered, and we have introduced a time-limit."
"A majority of the group is also willing to approve the system of remuneration proposed by the Commission."
"In my view, it is very important that we should have a decision on this tomorrow."
"We cannot allow it to be sent back to committee."
"I find the rapporteur's suggestion that that is what should happen if his position is not accepted most undemocratic."
"I would urge a majority of the House to vote in favour of the proposal, so as to allow the introduction of a satisfactory system before all the new assistants arrive to take up their positions in the newly-elected Parliament."
"This lends urgency to the situation, and I would thank the Commission for everything it has done."
"Mr President, the legal uncertainty that exists between assistants and parliamentary auxiliary staff, and the inequalities that such uncertainty engenders, clearly highlight the need for a regulation to put an end to this situation."
"The report by Mr Lehne works towards this and has some positive aspects that deserve recognition, particularly all those that refer to conditions of employment, resolving disputes, and tax liability."
"But in other respects, it may be that the situation we have now is fairer than that envisaged in the regulation. This would indeed be the case if some of the amendments tabled were approved, in particular the extensive and excessively detailed Amendment No 38 that covers everything relating to the grading of assistants, the corresponding remuneration systems and the unequal social security schemes."
"The excessive attention to detail in this amendment leaves very little room for transitional situations."
"I believe that we should opt for a more flexible approach than the one proposed in Mr Lehne's report, yet without ignoring assistants' rights and whilst fulfilling the obligation to provide contracts of employment with the relevant legal certainty. We acknowledge the rapporteur's worthy efforts but on certain aspects we do not agree with him."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the way we are dealing with this extremely important issue, which concerns the people with whom we have our closest working relationships, does Parliament no credit at all."
"So maybe it is not such a bad thing that we are now conducting this debate so close to the witching hour."
"Let me be brief: on the fundamental issues I totally support our rapporteur and I am therefore pleased that he is tabling his own amendments again, and I call on the House to vote for these amendments in the interests of our assistants."
"I also agree with the two previous speakers that we urgently need to adopt any text that puts a stop to the legal uncertainty under which our assistants currently have to work. We cannot let things get to the point where our assistants feel obliged to take the European Parliament to the European Ombudsman because we are to blame for the continuing legal uncertainty they face."
"I hope it does not come to that, and from what I have heard there is a good chance that it will not."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wonder if it would not be more courteous if I were to face the interpreters' booths, as it seems that there are more people in the booths than in the Chamber itself."
"Be that as it may, it unfortunately seems that Mr Lehne's initiative is necessary as regards both remuneration and social protection for our assistants."
"However, one simple and fundamental principle underlying any social doctrine is that every person has the right to fair pay in return for their work."
"It appears that that has not been the case and that Parliament, like the Commission, has been forced to come to terms with this."
"Nevertheless, I feel that Mr Lehne's draft goes into far too much detail on contractual relations and that, to coin a phrase, it ultimately tries to 'statutify' the position of our assistants too much."
"On the other hand, the Commission proposal has the advantage of a degree of flexibility and certainty, and it also has the advantage of having to some extent proved its worth in practice, mutatis mutandis , with the system for assistants to parliamentary groups, which is fairly similar to the Commission proposal."
"In any case, it seems to me that the most important thing is that the choice of assistants - their qualifications, their skills and so on - should be a matter for individual Members of Parliament, who should be at liberty to select their own assistants and agree working arrangements with them."
"Madam President, in our view it is time to close a very difficult chapter, although we are not unaware of the remaining difficulties."
"Consequently, our line in tomorrow's vote will be to stress the crucial nature of the text being adopted: I mean to say that it is essential to lay down certain general provisions, on which to base specific rules governing various matters of a contractual nature."
"But these general provisions, based on what we regard as a positive Commission proposal, must clarify the situation once and for all."
"Amendment No 31 in particular - which we recommend for adoption - is both necessary and important: assistants must enjoy equal treatment."
"They must be paid directly by Parliament, whilst obviously maintaining - or rather strengthening - their links with the Member or Members for whom they work. In this way, transparency and propriety will be ensured."
"Parliament must tackle this issue!"
"It should have done so long ago, and must now do so boldly."
"The battle we are waging here is for transparency and propriety, not only for the sake of assistants but for Parliament itself and its working methods, to ensure dignity and guaranteed rights for all."
"Madam President, allow me to thank the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, and the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs for their in-depth examination of the situation of parliamentary assistants and for their proposed solutions to improve it."
"The Commission drew up its proposal at the request of the President of Parliament and on the basis of a European Parliament Bureau decision."
"The Commission drew on its right of initiative to determine a legal framework, albeit with respect for the prerogative of MEPs to establish autonomously the conditions and duration of recruitment and the level of remuneration of assistants."
"Under the existing system, recruitment, pay and social insurance arrangements are agreed directly between an MEP's assistant and the Member appointing him or her."
"This has led to a wide variety of types of contract, which do not reflect the need for certain basic standards of equal treatment for all assistants."
"As was suggested by Parliament's Bureau, the most appropriate way of avoiding the present difficulties appears to be to confer on MEPs' assistants the status of auxiliary staff, while their duties remain subject to specific rules dictated by the particular nature of their role."
"Consequently, Members will remain free to select their own assistants, whilst allowing them to enjoy all the conditions of service applying to other staff, with the exception of the derogations provided for in the proposal for a regulation concerning their conditions of recruitment and remuneration and the duration of their contract."
"The legal basis laid down in the Commission proposal allows Members to confer on their assistants the status of auxiliary staff."
"Once this legal basis has been adopted, the second step will be to define the specific parliamentary rules of procedure conferring on assistants conditions of service which are more suitable and equitable than the present ones."
"For these reasons, and also in order to ensure that the regulation is adopted as rapidly as possible, the Commission does not intend to modify its proposal."
"Amendments Nos 1, 4, 5 and 11 refer to the rules governing Members' expenses and allowances."
"Since these would change the provisions relating to officials and other servants, the Commission cannot accept them."
"The other amendments proposed in Mr Lehne's report aim to introduce into the regulation provisions which would have to be adopted by the Council, whereas the Commission would wish Parliament itself to adopt such provisions in its Rules of Procedure pursuant to Article 78a. These amendments are therefore unacceptable to the Commission."
"Thank you, Mr Monti."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The sitting was closed at 0.10 a.m."
"1999 Annual Economic Report"
"The next item is the report (A4-0102/99) by Mr Fourçans, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, 'The EU economy at the arrival of the euro: promoting growth, employment and stability' (1999 annual economic report) (COM(99)0007 - C4-0043/99)."
"Mr President, the aims of the report I am presenting today, on the basis of the Commission's report, are twofold."
"First, it aims to analyse the economic situation and then, more importantly, it aims to put forward some guidelines for economic policy which should serve as a basis for the famous broad outlines of economic policy."
"First, I will look briefly at the economic situation."
"It is no secret to anyone that growth is set to decrease in 1999, however it will still remain above 2 %."
"So, it will slow down, but - it must be stressed - there will not be a recession."
"The international crisis has, and will have, an impact on our economies, but the extent of the impact will vary according to country."
"As a consequence, the internal measures that need to be taken must be adapted to the specific situations in the respective countries."
"This means that the interdependency of countries needs more analysis, especially now that we have a single currency, at least in the euro zone."
"And in this regard, Commissioner, although we think your report is good, it did not go far enough and should have gone into more detail on the interdependency of countries."
"That will be a task for you and I next year, Commissioner."
"What conclusions can be drawn from this situation in terms of economic policy?"
"Should we shift the emphasis away from budgetary consolidation, or even amend the stability pact?"
"Should interest rates be dropped to stimulate demand, as those to the left of you, in this room at least, Mr President, tend to favour?"
"Or should we pursue the strategy adopted over the past months and years, as those to your right seem to advocate, Mr President?"
"We believe that the second strategy is the best, as indicated by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy in its vote on 24 February."
"This does not mean - and we must be clear on this - that a good policy mix is not needed or that macro-economic policy is of no importance, because they clearly are."
"But to revert to old Keynesian recipes that have already shown their limitations would, in our view, be a mistake."
"We agree with you, Commissioner, that we must continue to reduce budget deficits, especially in the three larger countries - Germany, France and Italy - which alone, it must be stressed, account for 75 % of GDP in the euro zone."
"This policy must be implemented without increasing taxes and other levies; indeed, where possible, these should be reduced."
"What is more, if public investment is to be increased, as we hope, at least in terms of human resources and research, it will be impossible to implement this policy without reorganising public spending."
"Budgetary consolidation is also needed, firstly, to maintain low interest rates, which stimulate overall demand, and secondly, to maintain consumer and investor confidence, which also stimulate overall demand, and I would emphasise this for the ladies and gentlemen to the right of me in the House."
"I would now like to look at monetary policy and the question of whether or not the ECB should lower interest rates."
"As I said before, in 1999, there will be a slowing down, but there will not be a recession, which is something that must be borne in mind when considering this issue."
"Are we experiencing deflation as some claim?"
"In my view, the statistics show that we are not."
"The inflation rate appears to have stabilised at around 1 % and the price of raw materials and energy have dropped."
"Who says that these decreases are going to last?"
"That said, we must be extremely vigilant and, if it ever looked like we were going to fall back into deflation, then the ECB should lower interest rates."
"But we have not reached that stage yet."
"To conclude this section on the policy mix, I should like to stress that wage negotiations must remain reasonable and workers' purchasing power should increase more or less in line with productivity gains."
"And in this context, workers' purchasing power would increase, which, ladies and gentlemen, would also help to stimulate overall demand."
"It is therefore evident that a sound macro-economic policy is needed to guarantee growth and employment, but it is only through far-reaching structural reforms that unemployment will decrease in the long term."
"I will not go into this issue as it will be dealt with in more depth in the forthcoming report on the broad guidelines of economic policy."
"In short, the labour market must be reformed, which means reducing labour costs, especially for the most impoverished, and making the market more flexible."
"The poorer sections of our society must also have the chance to integrate better. We also need to reform the goods and services markets as well as the financial markets."
"Such reforms have to form part of coherent whole, in line with macro-economic policy, so that all measures benefit everyone."
"So, ladies and gentlemen, this is the context of the report I am proposing. It suggests a sound macro-economic policy and a sound policy mix accompanied by thorough and coherent structural reforms, all based on long-term rather than short-term projections, or on the fine tuning that one might use were it possible to regulate the economy like an atomic clock to within a millionth of a second."
"We are well aware that the economy does not operate in this way and if we forget that, we might be seriously disillusioned."
"I hope, ladies and gentlemen, that we do not become disillusioned in that way."
"Applause"
"Mr President, first of all let me congratulate Mr Fourçans on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on a highly commendable report."
"We are pleased that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy has adopted some important points from our opinion."
"In the context of a single monetary policy under an independent central bank, economic policies in the Member States will have to be more closely coordinated than ever before."
"However, the call expressed in Amendment No 19 for the abolition of the stability pact does not reflect the views of our committee."
"What we are calling for is a balanced policy, which implies a stable currency and effective budgetary consolidation as well as the need to ensure adequate purchasing power."
"Like the Economic Affairs Committee, we are in favour of a productivity-based pay policy."
"If pay restraint leads to increases in profits and investments, a word of gratitude is scant reward for the staff who have exercised such restraint."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs believes that they should be able to share in profits and capital through voluntary schemes."
"As an antidote to unemployment, we also recommend the promotion of business start-ups and the provision of venture capital, especially for small and medium-sized businesses, the development of new services and greater adaptability on the part of companies; at the same time, steps must be taken throughout Europe to safeguard employee participation, to ensure that staff are informed and consulted about structural changes at an early stage, thereby guaranteeing them the opportunity to prepare themselves in good time."
"What we ultimately need is an active, forward-looking employment policy, a modern form of vocational training for youngsters in Europe, improved opportunities for retraining, for lifelong learning and for research and development, investments in human capital by companies and Member States and through European programmes."
"That will enhance both the social dimension and Europe's competitiveness in the world market."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Fourçans on what I see as an improved attempt at presenting the Commission's annual economic report."
"I say 'an improved attempt' because I see the report itself as being unimaginative - unimaginative in terms of how we can improve on projected growth figures; unimaginative in terms of recognising that we are constantly having to revise the growth figures and we do not really know what to do in terms of trying to increase employment, growth and investment in Europe; unimaginative because, whilst it accepts that we have relatively high unemployment in Europe, it does little other than to accept the fact that jobs are being created but are also being lost."
"The level of unemployment in Europe at the moment is the same as when I was elected to this Parliament four-and-a-half years ago, and that speaks volumes."
"We cannot blame the world situation for everything that is wrong with the European economy."
"We accept that 20 % of the world is in recession; we accept that 10 % is close to recession."
"But the benefits of the European Union and of the single market should mean that we can still create jobs satisfactorily despite what is happening outside the European Union borders."
"The report itself states that EMU is itself a protection."
"EMU has not been a protection."
"In my view the single market on its own has been a protection."
"The fact that most of our trade is internal has been a protection."
"The convergence criteria have helped, of course, and we have managed to maintain some investment as a result of consolidated budgetary and fiscal policies."
"But the euro is not here, it is on trial and it is not necessarily a solution to Europe's economic problems."
"That is why I think this is a failing of the annual economic report because what we need to do is look at how we can generate policies to generate jobs."
"The report itself states that the European economy is now used to functioning with an inadequate level of employment."
"Try saying that to the thousands of people, certainly in my constituency, and the millions of people across the European Union who are unemployed. 'Inadequate' is not a satisfactory term."
"We have a bad international situation and again the report mentions the prospects of the Union having an adequate policy mix."
"Adequate and inadequate, in my view, are not particularly appropriate terms to use."
"My concern, in terms of policy and responsibilities, is that the Commission has failed to use the annual economic report as a stimulus for action and as an input into the broad economic guidelines."
"Stability and growth pacts are important but public investment should not be included in those figures."
"We need more private investment, more jobs, more productivity and more sustained growth."
"The ECB has a role but it is not just the ECB, it is the Council, the Commission and Parliament working together."
"We need a coordinated response."
"The annual economic report does not call for one."
"Mr President, it has often been said that the arrival of the euro is the most important event since the storming of the Winter Palace. This is true in many respects, and is all the more true in relation to what we are debating here today."
"In this new world, the Member States' national policies are shaped by three sets of guidelines: the broad macro-economic guidelines, the guidelines on employment, in accordance with the Luxembourg process, and the reports on structural policy that were approved at Cardiff I and Cardiff II."
"But these three sets of guidelines are formed, predetermined and limited by the basic principles that gave rise to the process of European integration."
"There is the principle of the single market according to which the existence of a single currency permanently rules out the option of adjusting economies by devaluing currencies. There is the principle of a single centralised monetary policy which is managed by an independent Central Bank."
"And lastly, there is the principle of a restrictive budgetary policy, where austerity is 'consecrated', to use the biblical term, as a virtue. Therefore, these guidelines are extremely important for Europe as a whole and for each one of the Member States involved, particularly as national policy is being questioned in some of the larger countries."
"Over the past few days we have heard statements from representatives of the German Government concluding that the crisis we are currently experiencing is a crisis of demand and a crisis of price stability. In their eyes, these are two important new ideas that rule out the possibility that structural reform might be the appropriate remedy, as had always been claimed in the past."
"According to the German Government, this remedy harks back to old Keynesian recipes that we thought had been confined to memory following the 1973 crisis."
"A drop in interest rates is being considered on the other side of the Rhine, as an attempt to influence the European Central Bank, and the stability pact itself is being called into question."
"In our opinion, we must follow exactly the opposite policy and this will probably be the central debate in the European elections."
"What the German Government is not telling us is that many of its internal problems are due to an increase in German salaries that exceeds productivity. They are also due to a certain contentment and somewhat of a return to the days of wine and roses in budgetary policy."
"When stability has been achieved, the benefits are clear, at least in my country."
"We must address the question of structural reform in order to solve the only problem that really interests us all: unemployment."
"Mr President, I agree with the point that Mr Hendrick made, which is that we have been sitting here in Parliament for four years now, and unemployment is just as high as when we arrived."
"The White Paper on growth and competitiveness has been on the agenda many times and we have always said that it must be implemented, yet no progress has been made."
"In fact we have gone backwards."
"I would like to highlight one of the aspects that other speakers have mentioned, which is the conservative attitude adopted by some countries."
"If we think about the mobility of labour, for example, and the opportunities for firms to operate across borders, we have to say that more obstacles are being created than removed."
"I recently found out that the German Government imposes extra taxes on workers from companies doing contract work there."
"I think this is scandalous, and the Commission should put an end to these sorts of practices."
"Apart from that, the Member States are perfectly accustomed to using social security and taxation to make it unattractive for people to work in other countries."
"If we look at countries like America, where the employment situation is much better than here, we can see that the mobility of labour contributes a great deal to the level of prosperity."
"Another subject I would like to raise is venture capital, which is something I have often talked about."
"This week we approved a report on this issue without debate, but venture capital can give an enormous boost to small firms which are just starting up."
"The insurance companies and pension funds have huge reserves, for example, but in my view these are not being used appropriately because we do not yet have the rules we need in this field."
"I would urge that these issues should be given close attention in the context of the employment guidelines."
"Mr President, the approach adopted by the rapporteur to the Commission's 1999 annual economic report is comprehensive and also sensible."
"The report covers a wide range of issues and makes some very important statements."
"In particular, I want to welcome the recognition given to the Irish Government policy towards wage developments."
"The Commission states, and I quote: 'Member countries might learn from the positive experience of a number of Member States, especially Ireland and the Netherlands, where continued moderate wage increases over more than a decade have contributed importantly to improved unemployment outcomes."
"Both of these countries have also in common that the appropriate wage behaviour was underpinned by tripartite consensus-based wage agreements and was accompanied by a reduction in the tax burden on labour.'"
"My fear is that the Socialist-dominated governments of Europe are hell-bent on harmonising taxes, on raising tax levels and finding new ways of penalising industry and entrepreneurship."
"We want lower taxes, not higher taxes, and we want an atmosphere conducive to economic investment and the creation of jobs."
"There is still an enormous and hugely costly infrastructure imbalance in my country."
"Nowhere in my constituency on the periphery of Europe is there a semblance of M1-type motorways linking any of the regions."
"This stifles economic and business growth and opportunity."
"Nor have we any direct motorway link with continental Europe."
"We do not want to penalise these people for using the structural funds wisely and openly."
"Our infrastructural work is far from finished."
"Regionalisation is essential for my country; anything less would set us back decades and run counter to Treaty objectives."
"I welcome President Santer's support for the cohesion fund."
"The Agenda 2000 proposals fly in the face of Article 104c of the Treaty which the Commission's annual report itself highlights."
"Under this article Member States in the euro area must avoid excessive government deficits, and that I support."
"Under the stability and growth pact budget deficits must be limited to a maximum of 3 % of GDP in normal circumstances, with the possibility of sanctions, including fines, for Member States breaching this limit."
"I am pleased that cofinancing of the agricultural payments is a non-runner."
"This would have led to renationalisation and the dismantling of CAP."
"Slashing structural fund payments to Ireland, which we have used well, and should not be penalised for having used well, would immediately bring about huge pressure on the national budget and create deficits, leading to fines that would obviously exacerbate economic difficulties."
"I urge a re-think and a special case to be made for my country."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Parliament's examination of the annual economic report presented by the Commission should be an ideal moment for discussing the main economic policies, for assessing those already pursued and for defining options for the future on the basis of that assessment."
"It should also - when the circumstances so demand it - be a time for a serious reconsideration of the approach taken and, on this score, the Fourçans report offers some lucid diagnoses."
"However, despite its technical merits, it is not a satisfactory report because it does nothing to throw light upon the approach or the guidelines that have been followed so far."
"We shall not dwell upon the already well-known points of disagreement between us concerning neo-liberalism and excessive budgetary restraint, but we should like to highlight another aspect: the way in which the labour market works continually against the workers' interests and treats them as though they were the cause of all our ills."
"Slimming down enterprises - which means more unemployment - and wage restraint: the Fourçans report reflects the economic point of view here, neglecting the social aspects and thus merely making the situation worse."
"For our part, as well as sitting in the Committee on Economic Affairs where the report was seen as highly controversial and only passed by a wafer-thin majority, we have tabled amendments that we would like to see approved, not because they change the report or do anything radically to alter its macro-economic approach but because they would at least alleviate some of its harmful effects."
"In particular we must:"
"try and find ways of reducing working hours without any loss of pay, as a way of fighting unemployment, -devise a budgetary policy that stimulates growth and employment, while guaranteeing support for SMEs in particular, -bear in mind the importance of the Structural Funds and the trans-European networks as a way of promoting state investment in infrastructure and improving the skills of the labour force, -introduce a tax on speculative capital movements, making an effective contribution to stability through monetary stabilisation machinery or funds, -last but not least, break with the dogma of the stability pact; it should be replaced by another approach or even a growth and employment pact."
"Mr President, oh yes, they want to continue as before without realising that we have already reached the outer limits of pure supply-side economics."
"What basically needs to be strengthened is the demand element - purchasing power and domestic demand."
"This implies that regional policy must be taken as the starting-point, and strengthening the regions really means creating genuine stability."
"We cannot create stability by means of an export-led economy; we have been trying to do that, and it has not worked."
"What basically happens during a cyclical downturn is that our potential is underestimated."
"And we do have potential: growth potential and employment potential in a whole range of new technological developments - in environmental technology and in the increasingly efficient use of energy."
"Such potential is simply not being used because it is unconventional, because it is new."
"Secondly, there is a lack of courage to admit mistakes, to appreciate that international financial crises would be manageable, that action could be taken to prevent them and that they could be averted, if those involved in the formulation of external trade policy were to recognise that economic and social policy need to be coordinated."
"That relates not only to the EU, but also to the policy of the IMF."
"We can see it in the Albanian crisis, for example, and we have seen what happened in Bulgaria."
"One of the root causes of such problems is that the IMF takes absolutely no account of important social criteria in countries undergoing transformation processes."
"In this context, may I also say that we can certainly take decisive action to curb currency speculation, which is also a destabilising factor, by showing some long-overdue willingness to introduce the Tobin tax."
"It is a stabilising tax, and the stability it created would not only benefit countries in other parts of the world but would also bring stability for us in turn."
"For that reason, all I can say to you is that we must introduce another approach here, and at this time I can only appeal to you to incorporate our amendments into the report so that it will contain at least some new ideas and provide a new perspective, thereby clearly signalling to all observers that we really do want more jobs."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the euro creates a de facto economic solidarity among eleven of our countries."
"However, this does not mean it will eliminate as if by magic the considerable structural disparities that exist within the Union, making it particularly vulnerable to asymmetric shocks which could cause national self-interest and nationalist tendencies to flare up at any time."
"This is particularly evident when there is an uncertain global environment and repeated financial crises in most regions of the world."
"The individual responses of our governments have been to try to counteract local economic vulnerabilities while broadly coordinating over recent years only their general economic and budgetary objectives."
"This is clearly not enough."
"We now need to tackle, in a transparent manner, the comprehensive coordination of both social and fiscal objectives, since these two facets of the organisation of European society are the two major means of adjusting our activities."
"They create sources of tension between our economies that can seriously exacerbate the impact of the asymmetric shocks that destroy our cohesion."
"However, in the context of these common social and fiscal objectives, there can be no question of limiting governments' ability to respond autonomously, just as large companies are nowadays well aware that giving their various units a considerable degree of autonomy makes them better able to respond to day-to-day developments."
"It is important to work steadily towards the long-term general coordination of social and fiscal objectives in order to bring vitality to European democracy, although these objectives are extremely difficult to meet as it is. However in addition to this, should we also develop a public investment programme, as the rapporteur suggests?"
"Since President Delors' proposals, which were put forward some time ago, this has been essential, particularly to improve the major infrastructures for transporting goods, people and information, which, in the future, will considerably help to structure, develop and define the European area."
"But the most pressing need is still to strengthen risk investment funds."
"Subject to these remarks, we will support the main thrust of the Fourçans report. However, we have to criticise the Commission's economic report for lacking vision."
"Madam President, the annual economic report confirms that the introduction of the euro has come at a time when the economies of the Member States are far too divergent."
"To deal with this problem, it is proposed that the EU should introduce a new culture for - or, in simpler terms - a harmonisation of, fiscal, monetary and wages policy and a reform of the labour market."
"Public deficits are to be reduced without increasing taxes or other charges."
"In fact, these are also to be reduced."
"That means, for Denmark at least, that we would have to cut tax-financed welfare benefits."
"This new so-called culture is very much in line with what the German Presidency says about the euro not being first and foremost an economic instrument, but rather a political instrument which transfers one of the most important areas of the nation state's self-determination to the Union."
"The recommendations to reduce the budget deficit and to increase public investment are directly contradictory."
"The Economic Council of the Labour Movement in Denmark has pointed out that it is precisely the reduction in the deficit that has halved investment in Denmark."
"It is also clearly the reason for the record high level of unemployment in the EU."
"The June Movement cannot abolish the euro, but we are voting against the report."
"Madam President, the rapporteur rightly highlighted several points which are regularly censured by the single European thinking."
"For example, recitals C and F, on the asymmetric shocks that threaten the euro zone, highlight a genuine problem for the future."
"In recital I, the rapporteur rightly denounces the persistently high unemployment rate, and in paragraphs 21 and 23 he criticises the public deficits and the heavy burdens of tax and other levies in Europe."
"In paragraphs 28 and 41, he stresses the need to reduce labour costs through the reduction of taxes if we want unemployment to fall."
"Paragraphs 44 and 49 mention possible deflation and slowing of growth and point out that growth forecasts in Europe have been revised and lowered."
"In paragraph 48, he rightly calls for the study of varied economic policy scenarios to give a better understanding of how the economic situation is developing."
"We actually agree with all these assessments but regret that the rapporteur was not prepared -evidently for political reasons - to admit that the majority of the errors criticised in the economic analysis in fact stem from one ideology, the socialist ideology which currently dominates Western Europe."
"This ideology is responsible, in particular, for the high taxes and other levies we pay, for public deficits and for unemployment."
"All of this is, to a large extent, linked to the climate of despondency which is crushing the spirit of enterprise in Europe, quite the opposite of what is happening, for example, among our great American competitors."
"Therefore, the economic criticism in the Fourçans report must be accompanied by political criticism; without it, we will not find any better way of combating the continuing unemployment."
"Madam President, in the annual economic report, which should be seen in conjunction with the basic principles of the Union's economic policy, we have been focusing time and again since 1994 on the question of whether we are actually doing everything possible at European level to combat unemployment and to stimulate investment and growth."
"We have to conclude that in the past, old recipes have always formed the basis of EU policy and that there is a real need for us to break new ground."
"We need to break new ground if we are ever to achieve full employment and the sort of growth that will sustain such a level of employment."
"It is a fallacy to imagine that the causes of unemployment are purely structural, because one of our particular problems in the European Union is the way in which cyclically induced unemployment has very quickly hardened into structural unemployment."
"That is why every effort must be made to kick-start the engine of growth, which is our only hope of reversing this unemployment spiral."
"As an economic region, Europe has problems."
"It must therefore launch a kind of action plan. The annual economic report represents an excellent basis for that."
"It would also do nothing but good if the Commission were to come round at long last to the idea of inviting independent experts to express their views on the state of the EU economy, as is done as a matter of course in many Member States, to give us more food for thought and thus enable us to develop even better proposals, because we certainly must develop proposals."
"The Commission is now rightly saying, as the European Parliament has said for the past two years, that the European Union will not be spared the effects of crises in other parts of the world like some tranquil island enjoying peace and stability in the midst of a storm-tossed sea."
"On the contrary, we in the European Union must take action, and we can only take action if the various players are finally brought around the table with a view to creating favourable macro-economic conditions in the European Union and above all to coordinating their policies."
"Policy coordination, after all, is part of the magic formula that has produced growth, investment and employment in the United States."
"The important thing for us now is to find out why the growth process is stagnating again, even though our inflation is at historically low rates and we are practically starting to pen its obituary."
"We must ask ourselves why further economic development within a favourable supply-side framework has done little to stimulate the private sector and why investments are not being made."
"That is really the central problem for us."
"That is where we undoubtedly need coordination between the various players."
"Above all, I believe that, alongside our very responsible trade unions, we need a monetary policy which can begin at long last to serve the purpose assigned to it in Article 105, as amended by the Maastricht Treaty."
"Only then will it be possible to pursue additional new paths and to implement successfully new infrastructure projects in the European Union."
"We need to engage the help of everyone who operates in this field, not just the finance ministers."
"We need those who formulate monetary policies, we need management and labour, and we also need a bold approach at long last from the Commission and the Council if we are to achieve the modernisation of our infrastructure policy and the creation of a public-private partnership to provide investments that will effectively generate employment."
"Madam President, the Commission's annual economic report is a valuable document which covers the European Union's economic activity in an international context. What the Fourçans report does, very well and effectively, is to look at the economy dynamically and to adopt some political positions, which is useful and also beneficial."
"I wish to make a remark about the comments on the introduction of the euro at the beginning of this year."
"I was expecting a rather more in-depth analysis, but of course as the report was published on 20 January, it was not then possible for it to adopt a position."
"Nevertheless, Madam President, I believe we need to give this subject a good deal more thought. I think that we cannot treat monetary stability as an end in itself, although no one should ignore its importance."
"Monetary stability is part of a more general policy, and experience has shown that whenever we adopt an economic policy - and, even more so, a monetary policy - which has a single objective, ignoring consequences elsewhere in the economy, the results are not very good."
"The dynamic element is essential, therefore, and we must abandon the very sterile fixation with mechanistic approaches to economic phenomena and explore how a policy mix can reflect dynamic factors."
"If we do not do this, I very much fear that we shall be vulnerable to the political sirens who advocate solutions which, flying in the face of experience, persist in tackling classic structural economic problems by anticyclical methods."
"I do not believe that a reduction of a quarter of one per cent in the interest rate will be enough to alter the course of the economy in Europe."
"I do not think that attempting to solve economic issues which are purely internal to one particular economy by trying to establish a corresponding scenario at European level is particularly constructive."
"We must not let it lose its value and, above all, we must not try to use it to solve other problems on a temporary basis, without reflecting on the long-term objective which, in the final analysis, is what we must all aim for. We all know that the problem of unemployment, which is the main problem in the European economy, cannot be solved by using ad hoc and purely short-term anticyclical measures: what we need is a very far-reaching structural approach."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to thank the Commission for its very lucid report and Mr Fourçans for his comments on it."
"I think that now that we are operating in the euro framework for the very first time, it is natural that we should discuss this issue at length, albeit under rather unusual circumstances."
"Mr Hendrick pointed out that in the last few years the biggest problem facing us in the European Union, unemployment, has not improved."
"This is hardly surprising, particularly when you realise that we have spent the last 18 months under Socialist presidencies."
"The ideas put forward by the current presidency, among others - Mr Lafontaine's calls for more government investment, a more Keynesian approach, and less focus on what we have agreed about the stability pact and other issues - leave us Liberals completely cold."
"It is a fact, as we can see from the Commission's analysis and Mr Fourçans's comments on it, that those countries which in the last few years have made the best of their economic growth, taken structural measures and reduced their budget deficits have been successful both on the employment front and in reducing national debt, and have put themselves in a position to be successful in the future."
"So we feel - and this is a question I would like to put to the Commissioner - that the measures under the convergence programmes of the three largest countries at the moment are not enough."
"They are too optimistic."
"If we are to discuss global economic guidelines shortly, the national governments - and perhaps the Commission could tell us how it intends to encourage them to do so - need to ensure that they come up with structural plans to make employers, workers and governments face up to their responsibilities and decide on a plan together, rather than having it imposed on them by the government."
"Madam President, there is a naive belief that the euro will deliver us from all our economic problems."
"It is time to awaken from these illusions."
"We know that the euro is falling, the rate is too high. The euro is falling against the dollar; it is even down against the lowly Swedish krona, which is quite remarkable."
"Financial investors are giving up the euro in favour of the dollar."
"It is therefore necessary to stabilise the euro at a lower level."
"Why is all this happening?"
"To begin with, because the restrictions imposed on the Member States are preventing governments from pursuing an active economic policy and an assertive policy for growth and employment."
"Secondly, because there is a power split where economic policy is concerned between a central bank which is entirely unaccountable and not subject to any democratic scrutiny on the one hand and the governments on the other."
"This split is making it difficult to pursue a systematic and cohesive policy."
"Thirdly, because the demands for harmonisation of the economic policies of different countries are mistaken."
"As the economies and structures of the countries are different, they must be able to vary their policy if they are to achieve the same common objectives."
"If on the other hand they are forced to pursue the same policy despite their differences, divergence will increase and in practice the result will be instability."
"Convergence in policy is leading to inconsistency in the economy."
"Variation in economic policy, on the other hand, can lead eventually to real convergence between economies."
"Experience has shown that all systems with fixed exchange rates, or large systems with the same currency, sooner or later get into a crisis."
"That was what happened in 1931, and that was how it was in 1992."
"What we need is monetary cooperation with flexible exchange rates which can fend off the adverse effects of economic change in an orderly, agreed manner."
"We need that in combination with an active economic policy in the hands of the governments and effective control over movements of finance capital."
"Madam President, there is nothing new under the sun."
"Even now that we have the euro, growth, employment and stability are still being quoted as the main aims of economic policy."
"I entirely agree with this, but I was surprised to hear a very significant comment that is decidedly incompatible with it: that the structure and operation of the European economy have been fundamentally changed by the convergence process."
"If that were true, then all this talk about the problem of high unemployment would not be necessary."
"Promoting employment was already the aim when the single market was created in 1992."
"Nothing new there, then."
"Nor can we expect EMU to solve the problem."
"The generic approach of coordinating policies, which the Commission seems to regard as a magic economic cure-all, will not work."
"The causes of unemployment are structural, and solutions must be found specifically at regional level."
"The current international financial crisis is showing up EMU's weak points, and it is striking that it is the three main EMU countries that are in trouble and are fighting for breath in the EMU strait-jacket."
"Anyone who finds this surprising should read the Minutes from the May 1998 part-session, when it was already clear that France and Italy did not meet the EMU criteria in structural terms."
"The Commission is right to call for structural reforms and wage restraint to continue, but it is rather too late in the day for that."
"This too is nothing new."
"I broadly agree with the resolution as it stands, but we cannot accept any of the 22 amendments that have been tabled."
"I hope that Parliament rejects them all."
"Madam President, the report we are discussing today is a very important one, because the actual issue here is to establish in advance what will subsequently be the approach of the Community, the union of our peoples, to future development."
"There is no doubt that, after an initial period of euphoria, the introduction of the euro has caused us to think long and hard. And that process of reflection has also been prompted by the fact that the development we would have predicted has not materialised - the kind of development that would be part of the natural order of things among our peoples because of their distinctive traditions of activity."
"But in order to reach this stage, we have had to adopt policies of restraint and they have had a negative impact on employment."
"And so, from now on, the efforts of governments, economies and, consequently, the business community and the workforce must focus on relaunching the kind of process that will give us economic development and, as a result, boost employment."
"We Europeans take great pride in our traditions; we believe in the free market, but we feel that we must safeguard the special features of our economic system, which is not the kind of absolutely ruthless system that exercises freedom in a way that may sometimes have the effect of carelessly marginalising the more vulnerable within our society."
"Ours is a tradition of development that respects the conditions within society and, therefore, the needs of all: it is a balanced form of development which may perhaps seem slower in the initial stages but produces the right outcome in the end."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Annual Economic Report has evidently taken on greater significance since the creation of the euro zone."
"It provides the means for defining action plans at European level as everyone is aware that significant growth is needed to solve the problem of unemployment."
"However, exactly how a European growth policy should be implemented remains to be seen."
"In this regard, I think that Mr Fourçans' report, which is a good report, should be completed with a number of amendments we wisely tabled."
"First, we need to develop both public and private investment."
"In short, we need to finally set in motion the grand plans we have spent so long talking about."
"Perhaps we will have to review our original list and shift the emphasis on to new sectors such as communication technologies, low-cost housing and urban transport, which are factors that promote both growth and job creation."
"Perhaps we will also have to consider structural reforms."
"These are only possible if our economies are growing, so it is not enough to simply talk in terms of structural reforms to solve employment issues without also considering growth."
"In order for this growth to develop, we will clearly have to implement a new fiscal policy and Mr Fourçans' report quite rightly included some of our amendments on reduced VAT rates."
"This is a step in the right direction as it will mean greater tax harmonisation beyond the present situation in the European Union, with respect for a particular code."
"If we were to introduce tax harmonisation solely to reduce national budgets' room for manoeuvre, we would not succeed in the fight against unemployment."
"Taxation needs to be readjusted in favour of labour."
"Monetary policy also needs to be redeveloped, as proposed in some of the amendments tabled by my group."
"We fully understand the present situation, in which the authority and the legitimacy of the Central Bank is being consolidated."
"It is a new institution and, as such, needs time to make its mark, but at the same time we need to remain as consistent as possible with the Treaty."
"Indeed, the Treaty states that once price stability has been achieved, monetary policy must be instrumental in achieving the other main aims of the Union, including, of course, employment."
"As far as tools are concerned, Madam President, I should just briefly like to reiterate the need for a coordinated approach to both the broad political and economic guidelines and the employment guidelines."
"To achieve this, we need to take a closer look at the role played by social dialogue, while ensuring that the importance of coordination between the Councils and between the Union's various policies is not overlooked."
"The last point I should like to make is that we would have liked to have seen greater consideration given to the various possible economic scenarios in the Annual Economic Report this year."
"I hope that the House will accept some of the amendments we tabled, so that my group can accept Mr Fourçans' report."
"Mr President, faced with unemployment with a structural component of about 80 %, it seems logical to call for structural reforms, despite what Mrs Randzio-Plath might say to the contrary."
"However, we must not be naive; the problem is essentially a political one."
"In order to reach a position of power these days, it does not pay to advocate structural policy."
"Those who have done so have all been ousted, while those who have come to power have promised easy solutions."
"This is what we are seeing today."
"It is much easier to lower interest rates, increase public spending and neglect the more difficult issues such as training the workforce, reducing labour costs, etcetera. So in spite of what Mr Katiforis might say, the disagreements among us are not of an economic or scientific nature."
"We are still able to listen, we invite top experts along and all agree: the disagreements are not between economists, they are between politicians."
"It is therefore much easier, politically speaking, to develop a macro-economic policy instead of a structural policy."
"And that is where the disagreements begin."
"Mrs Randzio-Plath, who constantly refers to the success of the American economy, is doing exactly the opposite to what the Americans are doing, exactly the opposite."
"She extolls the rationale of the Federal Bank."
"But the Federal Bank has a federal budget that is in surplus and a market that is totally fluid."
"Its labour costs are 25-30 % lower than ours yet she seems surprised to see that everything is going well in the United States but not in Europe."
"So let us be realistic and honest with ourselves."
"Policies that succeed in combating unemployment are never popular and that is why they are not pursued in Europe."
"It is as simple as that."
"Applause"
"Madam President, embarking on the third stage of economic and monetary union is a sensitive process for which the European Parliament has to assume its responsibilities in regard to the peoples of Europe."
"Parliament must make a decisive contribution to the debate and to setting the economic policy guidelines, taking advantage of improved statistical data resources and more detailed analyses."
"Monitoring is essential if we are to tackle properly the phase of structural reform which the introduction of the single currency is bound to accelerate."
"As a result of structural changes in technologies, we have to have an employment policy that focuses on education, on retraining and on improving qualifications: a policy, therefore, that contributes to increasing productivity and competitiveness."
"But that alone is not enough."
"Employment is boosted by encouraging the entrepreneurial spirit of competitiveness, by reducing the tax burden and harmonising the fiscal policies of the Member States."
"If the confidence of entrepreneurs is boosted, the result will be beneficial for productive investment and employment."
"The Member States must continue to pursue the objective of achieving budget equilibrium by reducing deficits but without increasing public spending."
"The value of the euro must be determined by the market and by market fluctuations: it makes no sense for the Member States to ask the European Central Bank to reduce rates individually."
"Political control must be in the hands of the European Union and not individual states."
"We must beware of the risk of asymmetric shocks and try to emulate the position in the United States."
"But we shall be able to achieve that only if, after economic union, we move resolutely towards political union."
"Madam President, I must begin by saying that we do not agree with the proposals in the Commission's communication that presents the 1999 Annual Economic Report."
"The Commission's communication is the starting point for establishing the broad economic guidelines, but presents an analysis that we cannot support."
"The title of the communication is 'The EU economy at the arrival of the euro: promoting growth, employment and stability'."
"I have tried to find where the stimuli for growth, employment and stability are in the communication."
"There is indeed sufficient stimulus for stability, but you will not find stimuli for either growth or employment anywhere in the report."
"After two years of growth that, incidentally, was not excessively high, the European economy is currently on hold."
"We can debate whether or not this represents the build-up to a recession or if it is simply a slowing down of the economy, but the figures are certainly worrying."
"The three largest economies in the European Union, which account for 75 % of the gross domestic product in the euro area, are behaving as follows: the German economy experienced negative growth in the last quarter of last year; the Italian economy has experienced very slight growth of less than 1.5 % over the past two years; and the French economy is currently reviewing its growth forecasts for this year, although it is experiencing the highest growth rate of these three countries."
"There is therefore a real danger for the European economy and even, if I may say so, for the world economy."
"With almost the whole world in recession, except for the United States and the European Union, a possible shutdown in the European engine would have catastrophic consequences for the economy and the global situation. And we have not even mentioned what effects a shutdown of the United States economy could have, which is also a possibility."
"In this context, we can debate whether unemployment is structural or cyclical."
"What is clear is that, at least in the short term and possibly in the medium term, if we do not have a policy that strongly stimulates growth, unemployment will remain at levels that are unacceptable in our societies."
"So what does the Commission say on this subject?"
"Having carried out a most satisfactory analysis of stability, it tells us that the situation is promising from the point of view of monetary stability. It tells us that such positive effects could be encouraged by improving the policy mix, as the report states on page 39."
"Yet later on, on page 67, there is a sentence which says that 'The output gap for the euro zone is still undisputedly negative, both because of the presence of spare productive capacity and the huge slack in the labour market'."
"However, it goes on to say that 'as regards budgetary policy, a gradual structural reduction in budget deficits is expected to resume in 1999'."
"Even at the risk of sounding Keynesian, we do not agree with this approach."
"In fact, we support the opinion expressed in another report that has recently been published under the charge of Jean-Paul Fitoussi, the 'Rapport sur l'état de l'Union Européenne '. This report states the following: 'Nothing indicates that we are facing a situation of an excessive relaxation of budgetary policies."
"Moreover, it would appear that excessively restrictive nature of monetary policy has been largely responsible for the increase in public deficit in the euro area in the 1980s and even in the early 1990s'."
"It is in governments' interests to cooperate openly and in a more systematic manner within the Euro Council and to work on achieving the best possible harmony between the monetary and budgetary policies."
"We hope to see decisive action within the Euro Council to stimulate growth, including by means of the budgetary policy. We are currently lacking such growth in Europe."
"Madam President, we must reverse this trend of psychological see-sawing with economic analyses and forecasts."
"We switch too easily from Europhoria to Euro-scepticism and back."
"We rush from consumer optimism to industry doubts."
"Yes, we should be concerned."
"Yes, we should be aware of the dangers of the economy sliding off the rails, whether they come from outside or inside the European Union."
"But the message that we should be sending from the European Parliament to Europe's peoples and governments should not be a pessimistic one: it should ask them to be rigorous and demanding."
"Despite everything, 1999 will be a year of economic growth in the European Union."
"It might be 2 % or it might be 2.5 % but it will be growth and the real success will be in using that growth to create jobs."
"We need to keep a clear head in order to strengthen the coordination of budgetary, wage and monetary policies."
"We need the courage to avoid any temptation to stray from the narrow path that would jeopardise the fulfilment of the stability and growth pact, the credibility of which is the best guarantor of low long-term interest rates and controlled inflation."
"We need to make a collective effort, involving both sides of industry to coordinate wage policies and involving the governments of the Member States to speed up the necessary structural reforms and to move beyond their existing stability programmes, in which the budgetary control targets are minimal but nonetheless tend towards a balanced budget, or even a surplus by the year 2002 at the latest."
"Public investment in the 15 Member States of the European Union came to 3 % of GDP in 1991."
"That percentage has been steadily sliding ever since, falling tono more than 2.1 % in 1998."
"Giving a fresh boost to the trans-European networks and investing in education, training and the information society could help to reverse that trend."
"At the same time, we must reduce the tax burden on labour and reduce budget deficits."
"These are the types of news, recommendations and forecasts that we hope to see in the major economic guidelines promised for 30 March."
"Growth, employment and stability are the buzzwords in political debate today."
"Stability begins within Europe despite the financial crises on the sidelines in Russia, South-East Asia and Latin America and the overheating of the US economy."
"It is time to remain calm in the midst of the storm."
"Madam President, in his remarkable report, Mr Fourçans very clearly addresses the major issues of European economic policy."
"He advocates a stability-based monetary policy and sound budgetary policy."
"For that he has our approval."
"We share his concern about the French, German and Italian budget deficits which were forecast for 1995 and which amounted to 2 % of GDP or more."
"Given the economic power of those three countries, this could well have had serious consequences for their smaller partners in the event of a crisis."
"I support many of the proposals in the report, but time permits me to highlight only three, namely the wish to channel more investments into research, education and training for reasons of competitiveness, the wish to restrict the consumption of non-renewable resources while developing new forms of sustainable technology, and lastly the need to reduce labour costs without endangering the funding of social security systems."
"Madam President, first of all I would like to make the following comment regarding the American economy. In 1992, America was in a state of crisis, Mr Herman, and it did not recover from the crisis by relaxing regulations, since regulations in America were already rather loose, and there were no market controls which, you say, hamstring the European economy."
"America emerged from the crisis of 1992 and gathered this momentum through the deficits created by Mr Reagan."
"These are just a few facts which you cannot ignore if you want to be realistic."
"As for the rest, of course our differences are political."
"We want to pursue a policy to benefit workers, while you want to pursue a policy to benefit stockbrokers."
"Which is more difficult - to come into conflict with workers or with stockbrokers?"
"Only time will tell."
"Our work is far from easy, as you were insinuating, and we are not looking for easy solutions."
"We have a radically different social and political agenda."
"As regards the report, I would like to congratulate Mr Fourçans on the intellectual quality of his work, but unfortunately I cannot support his general position, which of course stems from his political approach."
"For five years now, the Commission report has been following this method: it takes advantage of any slight, chance improvement in the economy to say to us: 'look, the policy we are implementing is working and Europe's economy is beginning to move forward'."
"Each time there is a setback, it is not our fault, it is the fault of others."
"The fault lies with the crises in the third world, for which the third world is to blame. Our own financial speculators, however, are blameless."
"Neither the Commission report nor Mr Fourçans has addressed the issue of the responsibility of our own financial speculators for the disasters in Asia, for which we will also have to foot the bill - indeed, we have already started to do so."
"The average growth rate of the European economy has stuck at 1.9 %, which is 1 % lower than is needed to reduce unemployment."
"This has been the case for some ten years now."
"Investments remain static, although profit from capital has reached 1960 levels."
"Neither Mr Fourçans nor the Commission has taken the trouble to ask why."
"Two years ago, the corresponding report to the one we are debating today stated that growth in Europe no longer depended on exports and instead was starting to depend on domestic demand and investments."
"What are we seeing now?"
"As soon as an international economic crisis hits European exports, we are back in a recession."
"Where is the internal dynamism you say we are starting to acquire?"
"We are taking a remarkable step and we refuse to accept that the policy the Commission is adopting has failed and that we must form a united front and totally reject it."
"We have become like the Bourbons, Commissioner and Mr Fourçans, who never learned anything and never forgot anything."
"And you know very well what the fate of the Bourbons was as a result of the stance which they adopted."
"Madam President, now that the European Central Bank has begun operations, all the EU financial machinery is in place to meet the challenges of future economic development."
"There will be great scope for coordinated cooperation on the part of the ECB, the Commission and the various Councils, to try to ensure there is favourable development both for the EU as a whole and for the individual Member States."
"It must be stressed that currency stability, whose importance the ECB strongly emphasises, cannot be the only objective of economic policy."
"Steady growth and the avoidance of recession must be seen as being equally important, since they are the only way to safeguard high rates of employment, which are of vital importance to our citizens."
"The ECB bases its policy predominantly on the regulation of the money supply."
"It thus believes in the quantity theory of money."
"This is associated with the doctrines of the early part of the century, not the thinking associated with a new millennium."
"It is not right either that the Commission should be forever stressing the importance of meeting overrated convergence criteria which do not take account of Keynesian views on economic and budgetary policy."
"A surplus should be used to curb overheating; when a recession threatens, we should be prepared enter into deficit to achieve recovery."
"The budgetary deficit should be reviewed within the framework of the whole economic cycle."
"The importance of this is particularly obvious now, when the public deficit forecast for the three largest Euroland countries for the current year is at least 2 %, making flexibility and scope for recovery almost non-existent."
"Parliament should therefore monitor developments and, if necessary, speak up to advocate policies of growth, employment and recovery, as well as structural policy."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, although the need to coordinate economic policies is emphasised at every available opportunity, practice has shown us that there is still a wide gap between analysing and evaluating the main indicators of the economic situation and initiating the necessary decisions."
"An action plan is therefore becoming essential if we are to close that gap."
"Even the present report by Mr Fourçans, the general thrust of which I welcome, still lacks the courage to draw the logical conclusions from its proposals and demand more and better coordination of economic and monetary policy."
"An economic landscape that is overclouded by investment fatigue will not bring forth the necessary growth or the necessary crop of jobs."
"In this context, let me say that fear is the only reason why we are now saving more, and worshipping the golden calf of budgetary consolidation - important though such consolidation may be - is surely a short-sighted and inadequate response."
"This has nothing to do with Keynesianism, which is often misunderstood."
"As long as we cannot conduct a coordinated economic policy based on sound arguments, a policy in which monetary policy also plays a key role, both inside and outside the European Union, it will prove difficult to promote employment, growth and stability."
"A gratifying feature of the Fourçans report is the very responsible way in which it deals with the question of incomes and competition."
"I believe this approach will guarantee that the present rather complex economic situation will not be exacerbated by an erosion of purchasing power."
"That would stifle any additional growth, which is the last thing we want at this precise time."
"Impetus is what we need now, fresh impetus and a bolder approach, for more employment and more growth."
"Madam President, the 1999 annual economic report, covering the first year of the introduction of the euro, duly mentions the progress that has been made in firmly rooting a culture of stability and an established framework of stability in the European Union."
"The report - on which I must congratulate the Commissioner - also talks about a revolution in attitudes in all the Member States."
"This has occurred because the nominal convergence demanded by the Maastricht Treaty for entering the euro - achieving an historically low level of inflation and interest rates and an improvement in the budgetary balance - did not jeopardise economic growth rates: 2.7 % in 1997 and 2.9 % in 1998."
"This success was despite the background of considerable instability worldwide, especially in Asia, Russia and more recently in Latin America, with 20 % of the world economy in recession and 10 % nearing it."
"This has led to a downward revision of the economic growth forecasts for 1999 but, given the overall results so far achieved, there can be no doubt that we are on target for economic and monetary union."
"Rigorous and realistic policies are now called for, as is suggested in the Fourçans report, on which I congratulate our colleague."
"Of the other aspects, I should like to pick out just one: the role of public investment is going to call for special attention without a doubt, especially since the requirements of the stability and growth pact mean that the budget deficit cannot be increased."
"In paragraphs 25 and 26 of his report, the rapporteur stresses the desirability of performing 'an analysis with a view to a harmonised and consistent definition of public investment throughout the European Union' since 'rises therein may entail a reorganisation of public spending'."
"Like other equally important - but perhaps less delicate - measures, such as making markets more flexible or training people, public investment is a difficult objective to achieve. That justifies the need for the European Union - and, in particular, the Commission and the Member States - to discuss practical measures that could be taken in order to rationalise the very notion of public investment."
"Mr President, the annual economic report is an excellent opportunity for Parliament to have some input in the overall economic policy guidelines."
"The main issue is deciding what policy mix to recommend for the Union and the Member States, traditionally involving budget policy, monetary policy and wage movements, since these are the main macro-economic factors that we in the Union can influence ourselves."
"External factors play only a limited role, since external trade accounts for only 10 % of the Union's GNP."
"So what policy mix is appropriate in the current situation?"
"Economic growth is declining and the Commission is already warning of a further readjustment downwards."
"The official inflation figure has fallen below 1 %, which means that the real inflation figure, allowing for miscalculations, must be almost zero."
"If price stability is under threat from anything, it is from deflation."
"With the employment threshold at 2 to 2.5 % and growing, unemployment is unlikely to fall any further."
"Something must be done to reverse the slowdown in growth."
"But what?"
"There is not yet much slack in the Member States' budgets, particularly in the bigger Member States that should really be making progress by now."
"There is some scope in wage trends, but very little, since wages are still lagging behind productivity, which is really not necessary when Europe's businesses are so well off."
"So wages could be a way of giving a much-needed boost to consumer spending, which is currently what is keeping the European economy afloat."
"However, it is vital here that the ECB should lower interest rates further to make investment cheaper and encourage consumers to spend more and save less."
"The present state of near-deflation means that this can be done, and in view of the slump in Europe's economy it needs to be done."
"With such low inflation the interest rates are too high, and the ECB must carry out its duty to support the Union's economic policy."
"Madam President, the presentation of the annual economic report always reminds me of the presentation of a list of grievances about what is not working properly in the European Union."
"This year, however, the picture is very different."
"We have an instrument, the euro, which is binding and compelling and is forcing us towards a new kind of cohesion as compared with the past."
"We know that the autumn 1998 growth forecasts of all the Member States have been revised downwards, and we also know that France, Germany and Italy alone now account for three quarters of GDP in the euro zone."
"If just one of those countries were to find themselves in crisis, the whole picture would be affected."
"We are therefore faced with three new elements for which there are at least three responses."
"The three new elements are: firstly, a new kind of homogeneity based on the euro, that is to say fiscal, taxation and banking harmonisation - and only last night, at midnight, we were discussing and criticising the banks which have yet to accept the euro - in order to continue the process of achieving budgetary stability in individual Member States."
"Secondly, we have a new kind of sectoral division of the market, namely the development of the tertiary sector: we have to focus more on commerce, on tourism, the service sector and the craft sector."
"And finally, we have a new market element: the big companies have their place, but it is in particular to the small and medium-sized enterprises that we have to look for the future."
"The three responses are: economic but also social market evaluation, a realistic wages policy, particularly for young people looking for their first job and, finally, public investment that is targeted and dovetails with private investment."
"To achieve that, I believe that the economic policy guidelines must be coordinated with employment strategy, and therefore the euro is - and remains at this historic moment in the construction of Europe - the main and most appropriate response."
"It is certainly not itself the goal, but it is the means of achieving the goal and must always be considered a sound starting-point, as we intended, and a starting-point at any rate."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are speaking about an employment pact in the belief that jobs can be safeguarded if the representatives of employers and employees jointly formulate policy objectives."
"We have to tread warily here, because it is the consumer alone who creates work and determines employment policy."
"Consumers, in other words we, the people, decide what to buy; we choose the manufacturers of the products we want to buy and their regions of origin."
"Fortunately, consumers are very objective."
"They judge the value of the product on offer."
"In that respect they are very critical."
"When consumers go into a shop, they do not search the packaging of every product to find out where it was made; they base their choice on price, quality and customer service."
"I believe we must focus far more sharply on the need to train our employees and our businesses to recognise the needs of the customer and to anticipate the customer's future needs."
"What makes a good company is its dedication to identifying the future wishes of its customers."
"To that end, such companies need an efficient government."
"We must ensure that statutory charges are reduced, that the machinery of public administration operates more efficiently, that we replace redundant departments, by which I mean that we should restructure unproductive departments into genuine service organisations."
"That is also a particularly important task for the European Union."
"We must set a good example here."
"I believe it is worth fighting hard to achieve that aim."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before I begin, I should like to say to the rapporteur, Mr Fourçans, that I appreciate the quality and thoroughness of his work."
"Although our opinions differ considerably as regards the best policy to pursue at both national and European level, I should like to pay homage to his intellectual honesty and stress the importance of some of his proposals."
"Most of the serious reservations I have about his text naturally relate to what I would describe as an obsession with budget deficits."
"Another point of contention, or obsession, relates to workers and their supposed lack of flexibility and adaptability."
"This is hardly surprising: we have neither the same approach to unemployment nor the same concept of the role of workers in the economy."
"However, there are many things on which we agree, in particular, something that concerns me here, namely, the need for public investment and the criticism of the bank charges incurred by people making payments in euros."
"In relation to the first point, I broadly share the rapporteur's view that Europe needs to give more attention to matters relating to communication and its infrastructures."
"I fully believe that society must take on its full responsibilities in terms of training and education in both the short and long term."
"As regards the second point, I have already asked Commissioner Silguy and Commissioner Monti on several occasions about the issue of taxation."
"In my view, the Commission needs to act promptly on this as it affects the euro's credibility at this intermediary stage."
"To conclude, I think that the Fourçans report is very thorough."
"It does not mask the differences between the left and the right and it is even very discrete about calling into question certain workers' rights."
"Nonetheless, it puts forward some very interesting proposals that are worth discussing."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking our rapporteur, André Fourçans, and congratulating him on his report."
"The report tells us that the main European economic indicators remain strong, that investments are achieving good returns, and that inflation and interest rates are at an all-time low."
"At the same time, however, we note that previous growth forecasts are now having to be scaled down quite drastically."
"We must investigate the reasons for this."
"It is undeniable that the slowdown is partly due to external economic conditions."
"But they cannot be the only reason."
"The very fact that our trade with the regions in crisis, such as Russia, Brazil and South-East Asia, accounts for a minimal percentage of the GNP of the European Union shows that this factor is not solely responsible for the slowdown."
"The real reason for our low rate of growth - and I believe there is broad consensus on this - is a lack of investment."
"Some people blame the European Central Bank and claim that the base rate is too high."
"That, however, is an astonishing claim, given that both short-term and long-term interest rates have already fallen to unprecedentedly low levels."
"Part of the responsibility for the sluggishness of economic growth in the European Union lies with the uncertainties in the economic policies pursued by some of the larger Member States, as a result of which business confidence is sapped and investments fail to materialise."
"Companies will not invest if they have no means of knowing how high their tax and national insurance bills will be at the end of the year."
"This is the first problem that the economic policy of the European Union will have to address."
"The main reason for weak growth and the threat to jobs lies squarely in the realm of economic policy, and not with the Central Bank."
"As an institution engaged in dialogue with the Central Bank, we must not let it be used as a scapegoat for the faults of others."
"Another topic that is currently high on the economic agenda is the strength of the European currency."
"What determines the strength of the euro, and what matters to the people of Europe, is not the drop in the value of the euro on the world market but its internal stability."
"With an average inflation rate of 0.8 % in Euroland at the present time, we have price stability."
"The rate of price increase in the United States, with which we tend to compare ourselves, is more than twice as high as it is here in the European Union."
"But the reason for the decline of the euro against the US dollar lies primarily in the international finance markets' lack of confidence in the economic policies of our large Member States."
"In the report before us, the majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy expresses its support for an economic policy based on the principles of welfare capitalism and its opposition to a dilution of the stability pact."
"That is the only way to win back the confidence that has been squandered and to start fostering growth and employment once again."
"Madam President, may I ask the Commissioner to clarify whether he is at odds today with the annual economic report, because in the annual economic report he said that growth alone has created ten million jobs in the United States."
"For that reason, I think he should reaffirm that growth is indeed a necessary weapon in the fight against unemployment, be it in the United States or Europe."
"Madam President, Commissioner de Silguy made a point of contradicting my statement that unemployment had not changed over the course of this Parliament by saying it had changed from 11 % to 10 %."
"If Commissioner de Silguy considers 1 % over a period of nearly five years a success then, if this was a national parliament, perhaps many Members would be asking for his resignation."
"As it is, the extenuating circumstances are that there has been a global recession, although Commissioner de Silguy very often claims that we have withstood this global recession almost 100 %."
"Madam President, I would like to make the same point as Mr Hendrick."
"I am supposed to have said that in my view unemployment has risen."
"Of course I realise that it has fallen slightly, but it is by so little that I do not think we can go back to the Member States and tell people that very much has happened at all."
"This is why I would strongly urge that we should use the employment guidelines to do the things that Parliament and the Commission have been calling for for years."
"Madam President, can I just briefly say first of all that I did not fully understand the question posed by Mrs Randzio-Plath."
"I did not actually say that growth was not needed to combat unemployment, because it clearly is."
"At no stage did I say otherwise."
"However, what I did say - and this is something that was borne out and noted in all the economic analyses - was that growth alone will not be, and is not, enough in Europe to allow us to put an end to the problem of unemployment; it needs to be accompanied by structural measures."
"Secondly, Mr Hendrick, I simply wanted to correct what I understood to be a simple technical error, namely, your claim that unemployment had increased."
"I said that it had not increased, but that it had decreased, even though it only fell by 1 %, which is not enough."
"That said, Europe is set to create more jobs in the 1995-2000 period, generally speaking, than were lost in the 1990-1994 period."
"Therefore, what I am saying is that the trend is reversed, but there is still a long way to go before the scourge of unemployment is fully eradicated."
"This will only be possible through a combination of a sound and stable macro-economic policy that is focused on stability and growth, and a dynamic employment policy, which must be implemented in the context of general and consistent structural measures."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"EU relations with Central Asia"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report (A4-0069/99) by Mr Truscott, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the communication from the Commission - Towards a European Union strategy for relations with the Independent States of Central Asia (COM(95)0206 - C4-0256/96); -the recommendation (A4-0071/99) by Mrs André-Léonard, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council and Commission Decision on the conclusion of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Uzbekistan, of the other part (7652/96 - COM(96)0254 - C4-0418/96-96/0151(AVC))."
"Madam President, I should first like to thank honourable Members for their cooperation, suggestions and amendments which have been gratefully received."
"Since the five Central Asian Republics - Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan became independent in 1991 with the breakup of the Soviet Union, the European Union has been engaged in the process of building bilateral relations with each of them."
"The five states differ widely in terms of population, land area, resources and democratic developments."
"The Commission communication on relations between the EU and the newly independent states of Central Asia published in October 1995 stated that the primary objective of the Union was to maintain the stability of the region which could best be done through the development of broadly-based democratic institutions, the reduction of sources of conflict and economic reform."
"Given the length of time since this communication was produced perhaps now would be a good time for the Commission to update it."
"Parliament was asked by the Council for its assent to the partnership and cooperation agreement with Kazakhstan in July 1995."
"In the case of Kyrgyzstan it gave its assent in November 1995."
"However, given the concern over the internal situation in Kazakhstan Parliament delayed its assent until 13 March 1997."
"In the case of Uzbekistan the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy and the rapporteur Mrs André-Léonard decided that the situation was such that it was very clear that the country did not meet the general principles laid down in Article 2 of the PCA, i.e. respect for democracy, principles of international law and human rights."
"Thirty months on and human rights and democratic institutions have been further undermined in Central Asia."
"The recent presidential election in Kazakhstan was widely regarded as rigged and flawed."
"In Uzbekistan, after a series of explosions in Tashkent on 16 February, the government has used this as an excuse to clamp down on opposition groups."
"There has been particular concern for the safety and treatment of Mamadali Mukhmurdov and Munira Nasriddinova."
"Since the main non-violent opposition parties, Erk (Freedom) and Birlik (Unity) have been closed down, the Committee for National Security (KNB) is also busy arresting and harassing dissidents."
"In Turkmenistan and Tajikistan, despite the peace agreement signed in the latter country last year, there has been little or no improvement in the human rights situation, and even in Kyrgyzstan, where human rights are respected in many areas, there are still problems with citizens' limited ability to change the government, freedom of speech and the press, due process for the accused, religious freedom and ethnic discrimination."
"On a positive note it is to be welcomed that both Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan have introduced moratoria on capital punishment."
"I hope this will be extended to all Central Asian countries."
"The Commission has given an undertaking that human rights issues will be regularly raised as a serious issue with the authorities of Central Asia and that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy will be kept fully informed of developments in this sphere."
"I trust that Commissioner van den Broek will keep this promise on his forthcoming visits to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan and report back to committee on his impressions."
"It is regrettable that Commissioner van den Broek could not be here today but I hope that he will keep the committee and Parliament fully informed."
"Central Asia is an area of outstanding geo-strategic and economic importance to the European Union."
"Its importance has been recognised since the days of the 'silk road' and during the era of the 'Great Game'."
"The natural resources of Central Asia, especially gas and oil, are considerable."
"US State Department estimates suggest that the Caspian contains up to 200 billion barrels of oil, enough to supply the world for eight years, and 7 000 billion cubic metres of natural gas, enough to supply Europe for 16 years."
"Clearly the EU must be engaged with the countries of Central Asia and encourage them to shed their old Soviet era mentality."
"The role of TACIS, in particular the democracy programme, TRACECA, INOGATE and WARMAP are to be welcomed."
"But cross-border and democracy programmes, assisted by NGOs, should be given more support."
"The legacy of environmental degradation, especially round the Aral Sea and the nuclear test ground of Semipalatinsk should also be tackled with an adequate response from the EU."
"The region has suffered from both the Asian and rouble crises."
"The Commission, Council and international financial institutions must consider measures to help protect the population of the region against severe economic hardship."
"While the EU should encourage foreign investment in Central Asia, part of the solution lies in the region itself in terms of introducing assured legal rights for investors."
"Currently the EU is the region's most important market outside the CIS."
"If Central Asia is to develop its economic independence it will require foreign assistance in developing alternative gas and oil pipeline routes and new markets."
"In conclusion, the EU should play its part in helping to build a democratic, prosperous and secure Central Asia in a region of fragile stability."
"Central Asia may be far away but its future will affect us all."
"When the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy appointed me rapporteur on the partnership agreement with Uzbekistan, I wanted to see the situation there for myself, so I went to Tashkent to meet political leaders and representatives of civil society and human rights organisations."
"This country, which was part of the former Soviet Union and gained independence in 1991, has still not fully broken away from the practices of the former Communist regime, though of course efforts have been made to do so."
"In December 1992, a new constitution was adopted, which makes Uzbekistan a pluralist democracy."
"A constitutional court is currently in operation, the parliament is working quite well and an ombudsman has been appointed to ensure that human rights are respected."
"The problem is that the ombudsman is directly dependent on parliament and is therefore under its charge."
"In 1991, Islam Karimov was elected to power with more than 80 % of the votes cast, against just one other candidate."
"The President's party, the People's Democratic Party, won a landslide victory in the parliamentary elections in December 1994, after several opposition parties had been banned."
"And in March 1995, President Karimov was re-elected for a period of five years."
"What I saw there did little to reassure me."
"In fact, freedom of expression is non-existent, censorship is in force, the press is not independent and there are only four newspapers available, all of which are subject to government control."
"The freedom of assembly, the freedom of association and the right to demonstrate are all forbidden, and opposition parties are banned."
"Arbitrary arrests and detentions are a daily occurrence."
"Torture is frequently carried out and the death penalty is still in force, although we have, of course, asked the Uzbek authorities to commute the death penalty to prison sentences."
"My conclusion was that democracy only takes root slowly - even here - and that 70 years of communism and totalitarianism cannot simply be forgotten overnight."
"That is why I asked the Committee on Foreign Affairs to postpone our agreement and give Uzbekistan two years in which to make progress in terms of respect for human rights."
"Time has unfortunately not changed the situation and today we are receiving some alarming reports from human rights organisations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International."
"The recent riots on 16 February demonstrated the violence those in power are capable of."
"Three people are still in prison and have suffered serious violations to their integrity; no proof of their guilt has ever been furnished."
"One of the prisoners, Mrs Akedova, is 60 years old and is the head of a human rights organisation."
"However, I think that we should give Uzbekistan a chance, because this country, this region, needs our help, be it democratic, economic or environmental."
"The country has substantial mineral and gas resources that are underexploited."
"It is the world's fourth largest cotton producer, and yet, according to its leaders, 15 % of the population live in abject poverty and wages are almost as low as they are in the third world."
"A great many TACIS projects have been set up, ranging from projects promoting democracy, transport, energy, telecommunications, education and the environment, to projects aimed at combating drug trafficking."
"It must be noted that the volume of drugs from Afghanistan is huge, and that 40 % of the drugs that reach Europe come from this region."
"I do not have enough time to elaborate on environmental issues here but I can tell you that I spent two hours flying over the Aral sea, or rather what is left of it. I witnessed the sheer scale of the ecological disaster there, which Europe has failed to gauge the importance of."
"Pesticides that have been used for years in this area have destroyed everything and dried up the sea."
"Infant mortality is 10 % higher in this region than in the rest of the country, as is maternal mortality."
"Many of the people are disabled, miscarriages are so frequent that they are no longer accounted for, and diseases such as cancer are rife."
"We rapidly need to take action in this part of Uzbekistan if we do not wish to bear a heavy responsibility for these stricken peoples."
"These observations were what finally influenced my decision and what led to Commissioner van den Broek's commitment to suspend the partnership agreement should human rights violations continue, as provided for in Article 2 of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement."
"Mr van den Broek is to visit Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan himself at the end of the month. I hope that he will be able to act as Europe's spokesman and subsequently give an account of his trip to the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"Other elements have contributed to the proposal to conclude this partnership agreement, especially the very worrying regional context in Central Asia."
"Mr Truscott already discussed this situation and I shall not go into it here."
"The geostrategic situation of Uzbekistan, which shares a border with Afghanistan, and the fear that the Islamic fundamentalism of the Taliban will spread, finally convinced me to adopt this position."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must indeed be vigilant, but it is vital that, at the dawn of the third millennium, we continue in our historic duty to ensure respect for human rights all over the world."
"We must also share our knowledge and experience to enable regions to prosper, regions that have been deprived of fundamental freedoms for far too long and that have lapsed into an economic and democratic backwardness that needs to be overcome."
"We must therefore have confidence in Uzbekistan, and hope that we will not be betrayed."
"In any case, the Committee on Foreign Affairs will submit an annual report to the European Parliament on how the situation is developing in terms of democracy."
"Applause"
"Madam President, I apologise for having to raise this issue again."
"It is one I have addressed before."
"As Members entered this Chamber this morning some form of demonstration was taking place outside, with people who had labels attached to their clothing advising us to vote in a particular way."
"I do not believe that any of them were Members on this occasion."
"I offer no comment on the issue they are raising, but I believe Members of this Parliament should be able to come into the Chamber without encountering any form of demonstration outside its doors."
"Applause"
"I entirely share your views, Mr Perry, as I think does a section of the House."
"Here in Parliament, we have never cast our votes under pressure from anyone at all."
"Madam President, I would like to make a point of order pursuant to Rule 109 on order in the House."
"I should like to ask you, Madam President, whether you think that Rule 109(1) means that I cannot display a sign saying 'Stop treating us this way, give us a statute today', because you think it will disturb the sitting, or whether, on the contrary, this Rule does not mean that this is forbidden, because you think that a statute for assistants is essential for a social Europe and for the rights of all."
"I shall certainly not pass judgement on the substance of the matter, Mr Duhamel."
"That is not something for the Chair to do."
"On the other hand, it is up to me to judge whether what you do disturbs order in the House."
"I would not think that to be the case."
"Madam President, unlike Mr Perry, I have no problem whatsoever with people demonstrating for their rights."
"The only thing I would say to the assistants is that it may be worthwhile exposing certain Members who are not paying their assistants the proper wages which they should be entitled to receive."
"We should expose people when they are bringing this Parliament into disrepute."
"I would also wish to expose an institution that is bringing Parliament into disrepute."
"The institution is Parliament itself."
"I understand that people who work for us, such as the freelance interpreters, have not been paid since October."
"I find that disgraceful!"
"And I hope every Member in this House finds that disgraceful."
"If I were the shop steward, as I was in Rosyth dockyard, there would not be an interpreter in any of those booths today, until such time as that matter had been corrected."
"I ask the Bureau to issue us with a clear, categorical statement as to why people who work for us are not being paid properly."
"I would ask the Bureau to issue that statement prior to the part-session in April."
"Applause"
"I can tell you that the Bureau is aware of this matter, Mr Falconer. You will be kept informed of the situation."
"VOTES"
"Madam President, you have just announced that you were going to put Amendment No 90 to a split vote."
"Like all other Members, I have the definitive voting list here, in which this split vote is not mentioned."
"I should like to know exactly when a request for this was made, and if it was not tabled before the deadline, why is it being introduced now?"
"As it was our group that originally requested a roll-call vote, I would not like the request for a split vote to be added to the request for a roll-call vote just because too many of the latter have been requested."
"I should like a specific answer on this point."
"I will give you a very specific answer, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy."
"As regards the request for a split vote, this was certainly made in good time, since I prepared for the votes last night - I could not do so this morning, as I was chairing a meeting on the Structural Funds - and this request for a split vote was already included in the papers prepared by our services."
"As for the request for a roll-call vote, on the other hand, I have just been made aware of this."
"But I shall turn a blind eye, and we will take this roll-call vote all the same."
"Madam President, I should like to ask the other rapporteurs to reconsider how they intend to vote as we do not want to have an incoherent situation where the amendments and the explanatory statement do not make any sense."
"Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, you know that here in Parliament we never go back on a vote."
"I am referring to the current vote but in relation to a vote that will take place later, namely the vote on Amendment No 98."
"And I should like to warn this House that we must be careful when voting on Amendment No 98 so that we are not inconsistent."
"Madam President, I am surprised that compromise amendments have been admitted at this stage in the debate."
"The report was the subject of many committee meetings and it was even considered by the political groups before it was debated in the House."
"Since the deadline for tabling amendments has passed, I object to the fact that we are putting Amendment No 182 to the vote because the request was tabled too late."
"To go back to the question I just raised, regarding the request for a split vote, I should like to remind you that the deadline for tabling requests for split votes and separate votes was Tuesday evening and not yesterday evening."
"I believe the deadline was in fact before last night."
"I simply said that I had at least seen that it had been tabled yesterday evening."
"I shall consult the House on putting this compromise amendment to the vote."
"Parliament agreed to consider the compromise amendment"
"(Parliament adopted the decision)"
"My warmest congratulations to the three rapporteurs, who have done a truly wonderful job."
"Loud applause"
"(Mr Gutiérrez Díaz rose to join Mr Corbett and Mrs Palacio, and the three rapporteurs exchanged congratulations)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have taken a decision in this Chamber which I, as the rapporteur in this instance, believe we have no authority to take."
"We decided that questions relating to employment contracts concluded between parliamentary assistants and Members should be governed by general administrative provisions adopted by the European Parliament."
"There is no legal basis for this decision in the European Treaties."
"That is not only my opinion; it is also the opinion of the European Court of Auditors and is reflected in the decisions of the European Court of Justice which I cited yesterday."
"Moreover, we have contradictions once again in our decision, contradictions which were contained in the report as adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and which we are carrying forward into the vote today."
"So if we want to come up with a prudent solution, with a proposal which can be adopted by the Council too and which ultimately clarifies the contractual position between ourselves and our assistants in an effective manner, it is my view that the Legal Affairs Committee should re-examine this report."
"On behalf of my group, I therefore request, pursuant to Rule 129, that the report be referred back to the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights. At the same time, I wish to intimate that, should this motion fail, my group will regrettably be compelled to vote against this report."
"Mr President, I wish to speak against."
"There may be contradictions in what we voted."
"Frequently we find that is the case."
"But that does not exclude the possibility that we can make significant progress with the dossier."
"This is a reform which is both necessary and overdue."
"Many of our assistants are potentially vulnerable to exploitation."
"Many of our assistants may lack proper social security and other cover."
"This House has demanded urgency on a statute for its own Members; it must treat its own staff with no less urgent respect."
"This House has demanded that another European institution should clean up its act."
"It should demand no less of itself."
"Let us proceed to a vote and let us vote for a statute."
"Applause from the centre and the left"
"Ladies and gentlemen, is there a speaker in favour of the request for referral back to committee?"
"Madam President, I am as well aware as Mr Lehne of the difficulties with the legal basis, but the reasons which Mr Cox has just cited for the urgency of this report and of the matter under discussion here make it imperative that we vote now."
"The difficulties will have to be dealt with in the framework of the interinstitutional dialogue."
"Madam President, I would ask you to reprimand Mr Ullmann for seeking leave to speak when you asked for someone to speak in favour of the motion, and then saying something quite different."
"Either we keep to the rules of the House or we do not!"
"Parliament rejected the request for referral back to committee"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Madam President, I have been patiently waiting for the end of that vote before interrupting the proceedings of the House."
"But there has been an interview taking place up in the Gallery with cameras and people who have been interviewed."
"I believe that to be against the Rules of this House."
"I do not think we should allow this Parliament to be devalued by the Rules not being applied."
"I therefore ask you and the Bureau to investigate thoroughly what the ushers in the Gallery are actually supposed to do."
"If there are rules they should be applied properly; and if people have special permission to take interviews up there, at least the House should be informed."
"I can assure you that the Bureau will look into this matter, Mr Provan."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, along with all the members of my group, I voted against Mrs Haug's report on the European Union's system of own resources."
"It is regrettable that, on this important issue of the future financing of the Community budget, this House, as is often the case, allowed ideological and political criteria to take precedence over the fairness and transparency which should characterise the financing of the European Union."
"In fact, the solution proposed by the Commission and by the Court of Auditors in its report concerning the assessment of the system of own resources was to continue the development of recent years and increase the GNP-based resource, which is the only genuine indicator of Member States' wealth."
"However, the majority of Parliament advocated financial autonomy, for reasons solely linked to a determination to increase the European Parliament's powers."
"This is incompatible with the need to rationalise the Community budget, the overall total of which can be, and must remain, subject to strict ceilings, as the Commission itself confirmed."
"I naturally welcome the fact that the various paragraphs on cofinancing have been rejected."
"This was the only area of expenditure subject to amendment."
"As we have already said, the adoption of such a stance is incompatible with the aims of the Treaty, because agricultural expenditure is compulsory."
"Moreover, no provision was made regarding the need to reduce other non-compulsory forms of expenditure."
"Therefore, although we welcome the fact that the Committee on Budgets' proposal on this matter was rejected, we disagree with the overall tone of the report and were therefore unable to adopt it."
"Madam President, I should just like to briefly explain that after having drawn up a minority opinion on the Haug report, I voted in favour of it."
"I simply wanted to point out that my argument was essentially based on whether agricultural cofinancing, as proposed by the Haug report, was compatible with the aims of the Treaty."
"As this was rejected by Parliament, I was able to vote in favour of the report and I am delighted that my minority opinion in committee has become the majority opinion of the House."
"Madam President, we reject both the principle of cofinancing and the introduction of a degressive approach to subsidies."
"We are opposed to the idea of revising the European budget at the expense of our farmers."
"Moreover, we are also vehemently opposed to the development of new ways of providing the EU with its own resources, because we do not wish to impose any additional burdens on the people of Europe."
"It is also wrong to dispute the connection between the Cohesion Fund and the euro area."
"No country that is ready for the euro is in need of these funds."
"Solidarity cannot and must not be one-sided."
"In general terms, the aim on the revenue side of the EU budget must be to create greater transparency and an equitable distribution of burdens."
"Since the House has rejected the principle of cofinancing - a decision which we welcome - and since some parts of the report that reflect our views were adopted, while others were rejected, we abstained in the final vote."
"Today the Danish Social Democrats voted against the report's proposal for cofinancing of the common agricultural policy through national budgets."
"We are of the opinion that the support for agriculture in the EU should be phased out instead."
"A change in the EU budget is desirable and necessary for the future."
"The EU budget is much too wide-ranging, which is clearly leading to considerable problems."
"Not least among these are all the reports of fraud and irregularities, which are costing the EU taxpayers some 40 billion a year in Swedish money, i.e. a sum corresponding to double the Swedish membership contribution to the EU."
"There must be changes here."
"In the first instance, much of this has to do with the fact that no one has any sense of belonging to the EU, and that most only see the EU and its budget as a source of grants and subsidies."
"We consider the proposal that the EU's biggest item of expenditure, the agricultural policy, should be financed jointly through the national budgets to be an important and correct step in the direction of reducing the total EU budget."
"We believe that, as a result of this, the Member States are bound to become more involved in the EU's agricultural policy and to show greater concern over how appropriations under the agricultural policy are managed."
"We oppose all the demands in the report that the EU should take on responsibility for fiscal policy and should direct the coordination of economic policy, especially against the background of arguments such as that of the Union having a role as a 'global political and economic actor of growing importance'."
"The Member States, Europe and the world do not need and have nothing to gain from a superpower, whether it be an economic, political or military one."
"We have strong objections to paragraphs 9 and 11, because they seek to give the Union clear responsibility for fiscal legislation, and moreover powers to raise and appropriate the taxes."
"Fiscal policy and economic policy must be decided at national level, even though a certain degree of international cooperation is needed on some clearly specified taxes or duties."
"But that is not the same thing as a fiscal policy decided by the EU, in which the EU takes control of the taxes raised."
"It is timely that we are discussing this report when European Union leaders are engaged in tough and contentious negotiations on the future financing of the European Union itself."
"While we are debating here today the issue of the rebate which the European Union gives the British Government on an annual basis, this matter should now be put into its overall context."
"It is clear that some Member States of the EU, most notably the Netherlands, Austria and Germany, believe that they are contributing too much money to the European Union annual budget."
"It is argued that the British Government secured too favourable a deal at Fontainebleau in 1984 with regard to the rebate which the European Union gives to it annually."
"This is now a matter for negotiations between European Union leaders, the European Parliament and the European Commission."
"A framework for the future financing of the European Union for the period 2000-2006 must be put in place."
"One particular financial equation is certainly very clear."
"The European Union annual budget will still be raised by means of a levy on individual Member States to the maximum of 1.27 % GDP."
"Decisions have already been taken that the future financing of the enlargement of the European Union is to come from within the parameters of this 1.27 % budgetary allocation."
"It is clear that a compromise is going to have to be found between those countries which are claiming that they contribute too much to the EU, as equally, those countries which have received favourable treatment from the European Union annual budget in recent years."
"The British Government certainly falls into this category and as the negotiations progress to the Berlin summit on 25 March next it is clear that there is bound to have to be a relaxation of the rules governing the amount which the British Government receives via rebates from the EU each year."
"With regard to the future financing of the European Union, one option which cannot be considered is the possible renationalising of the common agricultural policy itself."
"Such a decision would have serious implications for Ireland because of our unique dependence on agriculture and the importance of family farming as an essential feature of the economic and social infrastructure of rural areas."
"For the third time since the Luxembourg Treaty of 1970 and the Fontainebleau summit of 1984, we are faced with the problem of how to finance European integration."
"The Member States agree with the assessment of the problem, but are extremely divided as to how it should be solved."
"At the heart of the problem lies the complicity and injustice of the way in which Europe is presently financed; in other words, it rests on four supports with four forms of resource."
"The injustice lies in how the burden is distributed."
"Germany contributes more than it receives in return, as does France, which is why we talk in terms of 'net contributors'."
"On the contrary, Spain, Ireland, Greece and Portugal benefit thanks to the Cohesion Fund."
"However, the Member States' financial contributions are much more complex than that."
"For example, Belgium and the Netherlands seem to pay a great deal because there are customs duties on imports through Antwerp and Rotterdam."
"Belgium and the Netherlands therefore seem to pay a great deal but they do not really have to bear the cost of these customs duties."
"What is more, each Member State's financial contribution is subject to the criterion used to make the calculations."
"If we were to compare how much each inhabitant pays out of their income in terms of per capita GDP, the result is reversed."
"People in the Netherlands who contribute to the Cohesion Fund make a greater individual sacrifice than people in northern Europe."
"This just shows how complex the system really is."
"An examination of exactly how the VAT-based or GNP-based resources are calculated, as well as the technical mechanism used to cap the British contribution, would reveal an even more unlikely complex situation."
"This technical impenetrability hides many mistaken beliefs, in particular, the belief that the European Union is financed by its own resources, by taxes, through VAT, whereas in reality, it is still financed by state contributions."
"It is also a mistake to think that enlargement towards the East and the extension of the EU's powers will be achieved with the same budget envelope of 1.27 % of GNP, as the Commission would have us believe."
"Tomorrow's Europe will require ever more financial resources and will eventually be forced to tackle the problem of taxation."
"This is where the disagreements arise in terms of the best solution to adopt."
"Although the mistakenly good idea of cofinancing, which in fact would be a new resource created on the sly without being ratified by national parliaments, has been ruled out, fundamental differences on principles and techniques remain."
"As regards principles, should the British idea of the 'juste retour ' be upheld?"
"Should we limit, out of simple common sense, the sacrifice imposed to prevent the despoliation of some countries, such as France?"
"Should we really move towards a 'single tax' with an ever-increasing GNP-based contribution, even though we know that a single tax is a grossly unjust tax?"
"Whichever resource or resources are chosen, should they be progressive as Spain advocates, or proportional?"
"Above all, as regards decision making, should the unanimous rule, which is the only way to guarantee security, be maintained or should we opt for majority voting, which we usually do when there are drifts involved?"
"The differences involving principles and techniques are inseparable."
"Will Europe finance itself by making CO2 pay?"
"Only the Greens believe that this is possible."
"Will there be a European income tax?"
"These concepts are to be avoided. We should instead stick to the present system, in other words, financing through state contributions, because we know that old taxes are the best and are the ones that will be respected."
"Like the majority of the French members of our group, we voted against the report as adopted by the House."
"Once again, I regret the fact that many Members did not think things through rationally enough."
"Although we succeeded in rejecting paragraph 13, which put forward the idea of cofinancing the CAP, albeit with a small majority, other parts of the resolution were not acceptable and, in our view, should not have been accepted."
"Several paragraphs of the resolution stated that Parliament wanted control of the overall Community budget."
"As a consequence, I think that those who voted in favour of this resolution are also in favour of eradicating the principle of compulsory expenditure."
"In fact, since the Treaty of Rome, all agricultural expenditure under the Guarantee section of the EAGGF has been compulsory."
"In other words, Parliament is limited to giving an opinion on this type of expenditure and the Council is the only institution empowered to make decisions on it."
"Since the beginning of this legislature, some have been critical of the fact that 48 % of the Community budget is allocated to one socio-professional category representing less than 5 % of the European population."
"Experience shows that if the European Parliament were ever to gain full control of the agriculture budget, it would progressively reduce it in order to transfer funds to other areas and policies, forgetting that the CAP is the only fully integrated policy at Community level."
"In terms of the European Union's GNP, I should like to remind you that the agriculture budget only represents 0.5 % of the Member States' GNP."
"A second factor influenced my decision to reject this report."
"Several sections of the text adopted by the House propose increasing the budget of the EU's institutions through the creation of additional forms of resource, without, however, increasing the overall fiscal burden on the people of the Member States of the European Union."
"The question immediately arises as to how this will be possible, with the only plausible answer being to transfer funds from the Member States' budgets to the European budget."
"In view of the enormous difficulties we are experiencing today in balancing the European budget with regard to all the constraints imposed by the convergence criteria linked to the introduction of the euro, I think that such a proposal is completely unrealistic."
"The European Union's priority is to give precedence to its common policies."
"It will not solve budget problems through cofinancing or by gradually reducing agricultural subsidies, but by providing these policies with the necessary budgetary allocations."
"Not so long ago, before 1992, the CAP accounted for 70 % of the Community budget, and at the outset, it even accounted for almost the entire European budget."
"European farmers have contributed financially to the introduction of the euro by doing away with the differences between the rate of the ecu and that of the green ecu."
"Today, all we are doing is asking them to finance the EU's enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, while being fully aware that their future hangs in the balance. This is because the European Union only thinks in terms of concluding free trade agreements and dismantling what is left of the Community preference."
"The Haug report contains some very positive ideas, such as its condemnation of the principle of the 'just return' and the 'British correction' and the suggestion that VAT as a base should be fully replaced by GNP."
"As can be seen from an interesting table to be found in the Valdevieso report, this would do a lot to help us escape from the current regressive trend, already reduced in 1997, because of the proportionately greater importance given to GNP among the current resources."
"This is something to be borne in mind when we consider a suggested 'new' resource, a tax on carbon dioxide emissions."
"Two other suggestions that could be implemented by the European Union are a tax on profits made from coin minting by the European Central Bank and a tax on short-term speculative investment (the Tobin tax).They are both very interesting, but need further consideration and, in any case, would make only small contributions to the budget."
"Given that it would lead to greater revenue, fairly distributed and identifiable by the public (thereby strengthening the desirable notion of accountability), we cannot understand why progress is not being made, as a priority, on a tax linked to personal income."
"Finally, with regard to the CAP, rather than renationalise it we should be making moves to reform it, lowering consumer prices, taking measures to restructure agriculture and give the less favoured farmers income support."
"There is a need to change and reform the EU's system of own resources."
"However, I am opposed to the proposal contained in paragraph 8 of the resolution, because it will lead to increased supranationality."
"I believe that in principle only the Council should continue to decide on the Union's own resources."
"As regards the cofinancing of agricultural expenditure, I do not think that is an appropriate solution."
"The agricultural policy currently pursued must be radically reformed, and we should reduce expenditure without delay."
"As we need to devise a general system, I reject the principle of cofinancing."
"The current system of own resources has a number of shortcomings."
"For example, the collection of the traditional own resources gives rise to a great deal of red tape, irregularities and fraud."
"It is therefore entirely appropriate to carry out a detailed cost-benefit analysis of this source of own resources, as the rapporteur proposes."
"Another important point is that the benefits and burdens of the EU budget are unfairly distributed among the Member States."
"I am quite happy to support the rapporteur's proposals here, such as the introduction of cofinancing of agricultural expenditure by the Member States."
"I also share his criticisms of the correction mechanism for the United Kingdom."
"Five other Member States are now in more or less the same net contributor position as the UK, so there is no longer any legitimate reason for maintaining the correction mechanism just for one country."
"However, I feel it is going too far to reject any correction mechanism on the revenue side of the EU budget out of hand."
"I think a compensation mechanism which applied to all Member States could be a perfectly viable instrument for helping to remedy the unfair distribution of the financial burden among the Member States."
"Although I support all these various proposals, I felt I could not vote for the Haug report, mainly because of the proposal for a fundamental review of the own resources system, eventually replacing the national contributions to the EU budget with European taxes."
"This is designed to create a Union which is entirely financially independent of the national governments, and while this is very much in line with the supranational European model that many people in Parliament still want to see, it is completely at odds with the kind of Europe we support."
"The European Union must remain a collaborative undertaking between national Member States, and this means that the national governments must continue to have influence over how it is financed."
"An integral system of national contributions based on the level of affluence of each Member State (GNP), which is what Mr Fabre-Aubrespy calls for in his minority position, offers the best guarantee for a balanced and transparent financing system, with a cost-benefit ratio which is also in its favour."
"Madam President, the Lehne report focuses on an extremely worthy objective, that of rendering the treatment of Members' auxiliary staff and assistants more transparent and fair."
"Unfortunately, it exploits this good idea in that it harmonises, or begins to harmonise, a statute at European level, in which the European Parliament, in particular, would be the employer, even if the Member himself was naturally free to hire and fire his staff."
"According to the rapporteur, this development would be based on a broad interpretation of the new Article 190(5) of the EC Treaty, as consolidated by the Amsterdam Treaty, which provides for the implementation of a standard European statute for the Members of this House."
"The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations opposes this standardisation as, in our view, such a statute should remain under the remit of each country."
"My group therefore also opposes the broad interpretation of Article 190(5), which seeks to extend this harmonisation to Members' assistants."
"In our opinion, each Member of the European Parliament represents his country and should be remunerated or compensated by that country, and his assistants should be treated in the same way."
"If this is not the case, we will soon have assistants that are fully integrated into the European regime and way of thinking, making spontaneous proposals to their Member on positions to advocate ever deeper integration since they will have become functionally incapable of thinking anything else."
"I am very wary of the potential influence such a statute might have on an individual's behaviour."
"This is why I think that the equity needed in the management of assistants must be established at national level."
"What is more, the assistants of the Members of the European Parliament must be managed according to the same laws and practices and by the same services as the assistants of members of national parliaments."
"At present, Members can employ their staff according to the rules of either Belgian or home-country employment law, under terms of employment involving normal social security obligations."
"The present system has led to considerable differences in conditions of employment as between staff from different political parties and Member States."
"The majority of staff, including those employed by the Swedish Social Democrats, have conditions of employment geared to home-country rules, whereas other staff have neither a contract of employment nor trade union representation."
"The lack of an acceptable personnel policy and failure to observe the rules of employment law which the Assistants' Association reports is a cause for concern."
"Such abuses must not be allowed to happen."
"We also do not think that assistants should be taxed according to Community law."
"The conditions for a joint solution to be worked out are not yet present."
"Although the Lehne report seeks to regulate working conditions for the staff of Members of the European Parliament, the details have not been sufficiently well thought through."
"Today the Danish Social Democrats voted in favour of introducing decent conditions of employment for parliamentary assistants."
"The situation at present is that 23 % of the assistants have no contract."
"Unfortunately, there are examples of assistants being employed without any salary or social security."
"We have therefore voted in favour of introducing binding rules for recruitment, dismissal, remuneration, social security and pensions, amongst other things."
"We have voted in favour of introducing binding rules before the end of this parliamentary term."
"We hope that the Council will also accept its responsibility, so that we can have proper conditions of employment for all the assistants as soon as possible."
"The Commission proposal to extend the European Staff Regulations to cover MEPs' assistants goes much too far, in our view."
"The Members themselves are responsible for ensuring that their secretarial allowance is spent properly, but unfortunately many of our colleagues offer their assistants too little security and pay them widely differing wages."
"The rapporteur wants assistants working in Brussels to be covered by Community rules."
"The income he proposes is less than in the Commission proposal, but it is still too high by national standards."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs has created a rather obscure hybrid, with assistants being covered by the Staff Regulations but in a highly ambiguous manner, creating even more uncertainty for some of them."
"The PSE Group amendments introduce some fine-tuning, but also take the staff budgets out of the Members' hands."
"In our view, we must focus on combating unfair treatment, for example by introducing a code of conduct with minimum conditions of employment, limiting the duration of probation periods, etc."
"Members must agree to abide by this code when they receive their secretarial allowance."
"We were therefore unable to support the proposals in question."
"We fully endorse the assistants' attempts to obtain decent recruitment, remuneration and working conditions."
"It cannot be our intention, for example, that assistants can be dismissed at one day's notice or if they are called up for military service."
"They too have a right to normal periods of notice."
"We are opposed to unnecessary bureaucracy and believe quite unequivocally that national social security schemes can and should be respected."
"Although the proposal before us is not perfect, we have still decided to vote in favour of the report, in order to put a stop to the black market in labour."
"Members of the European Parliament are elected by the people of the Member States and represent them in the EU."
"They are not the EU's representatives in the Member States."
"Their salaries and taxation arrangements should therefore be governed by the rules that apply to national parliamentarians."
"The assistants of Members of the European Parliament are assigned to the Members and should not be treated on the same footing as employees of the groups, who are directly subordinate to the federalist structure of the European Parliament."
"Our assistants, both those who work in the home country and those based in Brussels, are covered by the national collective agreement and tax system."
"In our opinion, this arrangement has worked extremely well."
"Any attempt by Parliament to regulate conditions of employment in detail, to restrict the freedom of expression and informants' protection to which assistants are entitled and to introduce huge pay differentials is alien to us."
"This does not mean that we favour the exploitation of staff which is practised by some MEPs."
"But such matters should be resolved in some other way, without the disadvantages introduced by the proposed Council regulation to amend the Staff Regulations, the Lehne report and most of the amendments tabled for this part-session."
"There is a need for conditions of service and contracts of employment that regulate the social and other entitlements of assistants."
"Their employment should, like that of Members of Parliament themselves, be governed by the legislation of the home country or the legislation of the country in which the person is actually resident."
"What is important is not that there should be common rules, but that the rules should be clear and unambiguous, and that the conditions should be acceptable to both the assistants and Members."
"Assistants, like Members of the European Parliament, should not pay EU tax but should be taxed in their home countries."
"Madam President, my group has been entirely opposed to the tabling of a resolution in advance of the Berlin summit."
"This House has, over the last few months, spent hours and hours in detailed work, passed by this plenary, on the Agenda 2000 package."
"It is completely inappropriate, in our view, that we should have a resolution adopted in literally a few minutes, by comparison, which in some places repeats and in places contradicts the work that went on for the Agenda 2000 package."
"It was on that basis that we determined to vote against all the resolutions that were put forward in this House other than our own, which determined that we should adopt and abide by the Agenda 2000 package, as per our first reading."
"That is the basis of our opposition."
"I can only repeat our pleasure that the plenary rejected the resolutions."
"Madam President, as rapporteur for the general regulation on the reform of the structural funds I voted against the PPE resolution and the compromise resolution."
"This resolution does not fully reflect the negotiating priorities agreed by the PPE and the PSE in the McCarthy/Hatzidakis resolution and, as such, can only give a partial and partisan view of Parliament's priorities."
"It is, in my view, deplorable that the PPE seek to undermine our joint rapporteurship and negotiations with the German presidency."
"Parliament has a commitment to continued investment in Objective II-type areas and has requested two additional Community initiatives for urban and industrial areas."
"The PPE appear to have weakened their support for these areas and are abandoning them by omitting them from the priorities of the text."
"They have sent a signal to Berlin that these areas and communities are not a political priority for them."
"I could not support this text."
"I hope that the communities from these areas will show their displeasure in the ballot box in June 1999."
"Yet again the PPE have demonstrated their inability to sustain any support for the shambolic approach to Council resolutions and, in particular, Agenda 2000."
"It is correct that Parliament voted down this compromise as it only sought to undermine agreements in Berlin."
"It is extremely important that the forthcoming European Council meeting in Berlin should cut the Gordian knot on Agenda 2000."
"Reform of the agricultural and structural policies and new agreements on the financing of the Union are absolutely vital if the Central and Eastern European countries are to be able to join."
"Broadly speaking, we agree with the joint resolution on this issue and therefore voted in favour of it, but we would still like to make the following points."
"We can live with the Commission proposal to set aside 0.46 % of GNP per year for structural measures in the period 2000-2006, but only under two conditions."
"Firstly, as with other expenditure headings, this must be an expenditure ceiling rather than a spending target."
"The current privileged status of the Structural Funds tends to mean that the available budget has to be spent at all costs, which does nothing for efficiency and is financially irresponsible."
"Secondly, the appropriations for structural aid for the applicant countries must be integrated into the EU programmes upon their accession without exceeding the expenditure ceiling of 0.46 % of GNP."
"This means that clear priorities must be set."
"The Agenda 2000 proposals are too focused on the acquired rights of the southern Member States, and we must realise that in future the poor regions are going to lie to the east."
"We do not share the PPE and ARE Groups' objections to the Council's plans to nominate a new Commission president before the European elections in June, and we therefore did not vote for the amendments on the subject."
"The Commission President is the most senior official in the European civil service."
"Officials are not selected, they are appointed, and the appointment of the Commission President is first and foremost something the Member States must agree on among themselves."
"The decisive factor here must be a candidate's personal qualities, not his political affiliations."
"If the nomination is made dependent on the outcome of the European elections, then too much weight will be attached to the candidate's political background."
"The Berlin European Council, which will discuss enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, might be the opportunity to finally adopt a friendly attitude towards Belarus."
"The accusations levelled against that country are unfounded and it is wrong to say that freedom of expression does not exist there."
"Belarus is gradually developing a regime that gives greater precedence to progress and freedom, based on the present constitution."
"Any step backwards would be a mistake."
"The criticisms levelled against Belarus are reminiscent of those levelled against General de Gaulle by some Anglo-Saxon circles during the Fourth Republic."
"On the pretext that he intended to create a new constitution through a referendum, he was accused of anti-republican fascism."
"This type of accusation is absurd."
"There is far more respect for human rights in Belarus than in pro-American countries such as Turkey, which benefits from an association agreement with the European Union."
"We must stop making accusations that are inconsistent with the principle of friendship among peoples, something that is particularly essential in today's enlarged Europe."
"The Berlin summit, which will focus solely on Agenda 2000, is of particular importance for the future of the European Union."
"Apart from the financial aspects of this reform, the principle of subsidiarity is at stake."
"Like our President, José Maria Gil-Robles, I think that this reform must be viewed as a whole, so that we can give a clear political message to the people of the European Union and of the applicant countries."
"As regards the more specific proposals put forward by the Commission, I have several comments to make."
"First, as regards the CAP, I think that, on one hand, we need to guarantee a stable income for the whole of the agricultural sector, and on the other hand, we need to promote an agricultural model that is not connected to world markets and that is responsible for planned rural development that is accepted by all."
"With regard to structural policies, I still support the idea that areas leaving Objective 1 should be given a transitional period in which to adjust."
"Another challenge that the European Union must face relates to areas that are very densely populated."
"We do not need to be reminded of the number of Europeans living in such areas to reaffirm the relevance of the URBAN programme and the need to maintain it, as the European Parliament has already mentioned."
"Similarly, I also share the view that the Structural Funds must be consolidated as a tool for creating jobs and combating unemployment."
"In this respect, I agree with the fact that the European Union must consider establishing a system of own resources that allows us to prepare for enlargement without undermining the principles of solidarity and cohesion, two of the most fundamental ideas behind European Union integration."
"Finally, I agree with the ideas on human rights and balanced development, which must be major objectives for those countries wishing to join the European Union."
"The Berlin summit is undoubtedly of particular importance and it forces our leaders to send out a strong message a few weeks before a deadline when our citizens will take full advantage of the opportunity to express their views on the Europe they are being offered."
"The fact that the European Council will be held in Berlin is already a significant symbol of the new strategic order, as Germany is taking advantage of its presidency to defend its interests in the financing of the European budget, in enlargement towards the East and in the CAP."
"France's interests are different in all three cases."
"The industrialised and Atlanticist Germany would easily sacrifice the agricultural Europe, giving Washington a monopoly over the food weapon."
"France, on the other hand, would not."
"Germany - which is the leading net contributor to the European budget, since it pays in more than it receives - would like to receive at least a financial return that is not extremely unjust, if not quite a 'juste retour ' as Margaret Thatcher demanded in 1984."
"With regard to this budgetary issue, France, which has lost more than FRF 20 billion in a single year of financing the European budget, is sensitive to the excessive inequalities in each Member's financial contribution."
"However, we must not forget that, although Germany makes a substantial contribution to the European budget, it has also made other states in the Union pay a considerable amount since its reunification."
"The high interest rates imposed by the Bundesbank to finance the five Länder of the former East Germany are one of the major causes of the recent economic recession and the fact that six million French people are unemployed."
"France has paid a large part of the dowry for the marriage of the two parts of Germany."
"Lastly, enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe is displacing the European Union's centre of gravity further towards the former Comecon area, where the currency was the Deutsche mark."
"This shows the extent to which we are under Germany's sphere of influence. For France, the accession of the countries of Eastern Europe, where 25 % of the active population work in agriculture, is going further than the problems posed by the present CAP reform, which goes against our national interests."
"In other words, the interests of the Franco-German partnership are not necessarily the same in terms of the independence of nuclear energy, the reform of the CAP, where we reject the idea of cofinancing as it would make us pay with giving us any power of decision, or the financing of the CAP, where no clear decisions have been taken on the principles involved."
"Instead of talking about limits, ceilings or correction mechanisms, we really need to make a decision on the principles, that is, whether or not Europe should be financed by taxation or by contributions from the Member States."
"If we opt for fiscal measures, what form should the tax take?"
"Should it be progressive, as Spain hopes, proportional to wealth, or a head tax?"
"In fact, in Berlin, Europe is at a junction where all roads meet: the roads from the East, the budgetary roads and the strategic roads."
"The time has come for European integration to get rid of any ambiguities and the first of these is to decide if we are building a European Europe or a globalised Europe."
"Since the beginning, the National Front has made its choice clear: it favours the Europe of realities and truths, the tangible Europe, and the Europe of states and nations."
"In these times of lack of ambition and any sense of responsibility, we should rejoice at certain aspects of the resolution that we have just voted on in the European Parliament."
"This is true of the point made in recital A that the Structural Fund and the Cohesion Fund are the main instruments of economic and social cohesion, while the importance of economic cohesion is also emphasised in paragraph 5."
"Emphasis should also be laid on the statement in paragraph 4 that budgetary restraint needs to be reconciled with the guarantee of sufficient funds for the essential tasks of the European Union."
"Another point to be emphasised is the approval in paragraph 6 of the proposal to earmark 0.46 % of the European Union's GNP every year for structural actions during the period 2000 to 2006."
"Let us hope that these are not just good intentions since the most powerful leaders, focusing on Agenda 2000 instead of worrying about having enough resources to meet Europe's ambitions, are basically concerned with setting a sacrosanct limit of 1.27 % of GNP for the Union budget. What is more, in Agenda 2000 the Commission is proposing to transfer EUR 45 billion from the Structural Funds to actions preparing for the accession of the new Member States, leaving the current 15 Member States with EUR 10.2 billion less or, in other words, 0.39 % of GNP."
"These are major points which should have been resolved or clarified."
"The sitting was suspended at 1.35 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m."
"TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0272/99 by Mr Imbeni and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists; -B4-0295/99 by Mr Vinci and Mr Ripa di Meana, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left; -B4-0317/99 by Mr Santini and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party; on the disaster in Cermis (Italy) and the verdict of the United States court-martial."
"Madam President, on 3 February 1998, a US military aircraft that had been violating the rules of aviation caused the Cermis ski-lift disaster, with the deaths of 20 European citizens."
"Just a little over a year later, the American court-martial at Camp Lejeune has delivered an absolutely scandalous verdict, clearing the pilot and refusing to try to identify responsibility elsewhere, even though the Italian judicial authorities have established, beyond all doubt, that there was a clear breach of the rules of aviation."
"European Socialists are scandalised by this verdict, which makes no attempt to try to establish responsibility and prosecute and punish the guilty parties, and is offensive and hurtful to the families of the victims and all of those affected by the Cermis tragedy."
"We are asking the US authorities to use all the procedures available to them to identify where responsibility for the tragedy lies, to punish severely those who are guilty and guarantee that relatives of the victims are fully compensated, both in terms of moral support and materially."
"We therefore support the stance taken by the Italian Government, which has put these views and requests directly to the President of the United States."
"However, events in Cermis also show us that we need to reconsider and act to change the rules contained in the 1951 London Convention, so that tragedies of this kind - which would certainly be more likely were there to be a general feeling of impunity - are prevented in the future, and to guarantee that there would, in any event, be no obstacles in the way of the investigations and judicial proceedings against elements of NATO armed forces that violate the laws of the countries in which they are stationed."
"Finally, we are asking for joint action to be put in place to ensure that any form of military exercise within the territory of the Union takes place in conditions of complete safety for the civilian population."
"Once again, I join with all who have extended their condolences to those who lost their loved ones in the Cermis tragedy."
"Madam President, the few words I wish to say on this sensitive issue can be summed up by way of two premisses and three specific proposals."
"My first premiss is that, in the Cermis incident, in which 20 people lost their lives, there was collective responsibility on the part of the NATO command in Aviano which has always authorised training flights, even over densely populated areas, because it has been too liberal in its interpretation of the 1951 London Convention."
"My second premiss points the finger of blame at the pilot, Captain Ashby, who broke every rule of care by interpreting even more recklessly an already dangerous flight plan."
"It has been said in his defence that the military maps did not show the ski-lift cable: that is unbelievable given, after all, that it has been there for more than 25 years and was reconstructed after an earlier incident, on 9 March 1976, in which 43 people lost their lives."
"If the pilot was right, then in any event, the responsibility of those who failed to update such important maps ought to be established."
"However, you do not have to be a pilot to find it difficult to imagine that when you enter a mountain gorge at 800 kilometres per hour, at an altitude of only 80 metres, it is still feasible to consult a map."
"The inhabitants of the villages situated along the route of the ski-lift know a thing or two about this, and they testified that extremely low-flying aircraft were a common occurrence."
"Again, according to their evidence, it seems that the Cermis cable, extending over 80 metres, was considered a challenge for the young Aviano pilots, almost a test of courage, a baptism of fire, swooping over people's heads."
"Some, a very few, managed to fly under the cable, while others pulled the nose up at the last minute and cleared the cable."
"Unfortunately Captain Ashby stopped half-way."
"He severed the cable and caused the death of 20 people."
"I believe there are three proposals to remedy this situation: firstly, we need to review and update the London Convention, particularly with regard to overflying; secondly, we need to recognise that the ordinary courts have to take precedence over the military courts in cases of this nature; and, thirdly, we have to put pressure on the US Government to speed up the process of compensating the victims' families."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Vecchi, the person who tabled the resolution, has just said, the American court-martial has delivered its verdict and the pilot of the aircraft involved has been cleared."
"It is not our intention to comment on the verdict as such, but we do have some serious questions about the system established under the London Convention."
"We would point out that a legal system such as Italy's is perfectly capable of guaranteeing a proper trial, so why, in cases like this, can the airmen responsible not be tried by the regular courts in Italy rather than by special courts, such as the court-martial here?"
"Do not misunderstand us, this is not a call for a people's court, for emotional justice or for revenge, but for new international procedures so that responsibility for accidents or offences can be determined at the place where the events occurred."
"The acquittal of the crewmen concerned also leaves a number of questions unanswered, which is why we expect the investigation at least to continue."
"Why did the pilots not have the correct maps?"
"Why was the ski-lift not shown on those maps?"
"Why did the NATO authorities in charge not have information on the permitted flight altitude in the region?"
"Something or someone in this whole unsavoury business has to be responsible."
"Finally, we want the promises and commitments given about compensation for the victims to be honoured, because here too justice must prevail."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the acquittal of the American pilot whose reckless behaviour a year ago caused the deaths of 20 European citizens, including five young people from my immediate neighbourhood, cries out for revenge."
"Justice was clearly not done when, despite the incontrovertible evidence, the pilot was not only acquitted of involuntary manslaughter, but even the charges of dereliction of duty and reckless conduct were apparently not admissible."
"When Parliament sent its condolences to the victims of this terrible accident last year, calls were already being made for a review of the London Convention, under which jurisdiction in the case of military offences lies with the country to which the military personnel in question belong."
"The unacceptable verdict delivered by the court-martial shows once again just how necessary this review is."
"There is also the question of whether recourse to the separate system of courts-martial is still justified in peacetime."
"Is it fair that a serviceman who commits an offence in the course of an operation which serves no military purpose and in which civilians are harmed should be tried by a separate legal structure made up almost exclusively of other servicemen, in other words colleagues?"
"The special circumstances such as a war which justify the existence of courts-martial did not apply in this case."
"We all agree that actual responsibility must be determined and fair compensation must be paid without delay to the families of the victims."
"I wish to add my voice to what has been said by other honourable Members and express the indignation of the Green Group at a verdict which is not only an insult to those who lost their lives, but highlights a situation that is totally unacceptable."
"Moreover, I have to say that we understand the reaction of the people of the Cermis region and the response of the victims' relatives."
"I think that is right, and I also think it right that the victims' relatives should be compensated, even though compensation can never bring back those who lost their lives."
"Setting all of that aside, I think we are right to ask how it is that, almost 50 years on from the London Convention, incidents of the kind we have seen can still happen."
"I would remind the House that last year, on 19 February, when we were discussing the Cermis tragedy, I tabled a resolution in which I called for the London Convention to be reviewed."
"I therefore believe that not only should we call for the inquiry to be reopened to establish whether there is responsibility at a higher level, we should also consider whether it is necessary to retain the NATO bases, as if we were colonies of some kind, or to react and ask for the current rules to be amended so that the national courts are finally given jurisdiction over criminal acts of this nature."
"Madam President, the Cermis incident is without doubt a tragic episode, and the impression of US justice which Italy and the rest of Europe have been given has certainly left us with a bitter taste in the mouth."
"We feel that sense of bitterness first and foremost for the relatives of the victims, of course, but also for all those who have regarded the Atlantic Alliance in the same way as we have always viewed it: that is to say as an Alliance which has guaranteed our countries' security for 50 years."
"I believe it is right that, after the Italian Parliament stated its view yesterday, we in the European Parliament should now be discussing the issue and taking an interest in seeing that justice is done, although much - too much - remains unclear about this incident, which is also protected by the provisions of the 1951 Convention."
"I do not, however, believe it either right or helpful that we Europeans should be raising for debate, on the basis of these incidents alone, matters which could have been discussed elsewhere."
"That seems to me, at any rate, to be a dangerous mix."
"Madam President, I think that everyone here in the House can imagine what the families of those who died at Cavalese must be going through and, whatever our politics, would share their outrage today at the fact that a year after the disaster, the pilot responsible has been found not guilty by an American court-martial."
"However, I think that we, as politicians, should not simply confine ourselves to a few non-committal words of moral support or criticism of the London Convention."
"As the European Parliament, we must have the courage to face up to our political responsibility and say that this is about much more than just the guilt or innocence of one man, of one pilot."
"Over the last few weeks, we have been forced to face the facts, facts that we might sometimes prefer not to know."
"The facts show that the American troops stationed in Europe are actually above the law in the Member States, they can contravene laws and regulations with impunity, as we have seen, and will never be called to account before the European courts or the courts of the Member States."
"We must ask ourselves whether this court-martial verdict, sadly, is not indicative of a certain American mentality today that clearly regards the American troops in Europe as a sort of army of occupation which, like all armies, is above the laws and regulations of the countries in which it is stationed."
"We must therefore now not just demand compensation for the victims' families, although it goes without saying that they can never be compensated for their suffering, we must also condemn this totally unacceptable American attitude that can only be described as neo-colonial."
"The countries of Europe are not America's vassals, they are not negro villages, and they must not be treated as such."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is surprising how justice goes out of the door when it is left to the country of origin of NATO troops, which is responsible for accidents or breaches of the law, to assign responsibility and exercise a remote - in both a physical and a moral sense - form of justice, from thousands of miles away."
"The attitude taken by American pilots to Cermis hardly bears description: they were supposed to be carrying out military exercises, but in fact slaughtered defenceless people."
"Equally unjustified, however, is the surge of anti-American feeling which is going so far as to challenge the basis of the international agreements with the United States, those same agreements which have protected Italy from the strategies and subversion of the Communist International."
"The non-attached Members therefore wish to dissociate themselves from the protests coming from those who still hanker after the Warsaw Pact, and to affirm the importance of the partnership between the United States and Europe, and between the United States and the Italian Republic. Once again we are voicing our support for the establishment of a European security and defence policy which cooperates and works with the NATO structures and, if necessary, acts independently to defend the interests of the whole of Europe."
"Madam President, I think it appropriate and right that this House should state its position on the Cermis tragedy - and not only on the incident itself, but above all on the verdict from the other side of the Atlantic which failed to condemn it."
"We consider the expression 'concern', which is used in the resolution on which we are to vote, completely inappropriate."
"I do not know what compromise led to that word being used, but I reject it."
"There are two things we should be talking about here: about condemnation - condemnation of the action of those pilots who play at cowboys in the skies, risking the lives of others - and above all censure of the verdict of the American court-martial, which is failing to give our people, our nations, justice."
"On behalf of the Padania bloc, which I represent in this House, and certain that I am speaking for the people, I therefore ask Parliament to be very firm in the stand it takes."
"This Parliament is reaching the end of its mandate, but I think that we should begin to set an example for those who will come after us."
"This Europe of ours will either gain respect or regularly be walked over by people and states that want to be our friends, although we know that the essential basis for friendship, between both individuals and states, is mutual respect."
"I am therefore asking for the wording of the resolution to be much more forceful than it is at present."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's thoughts are primarily with the families of the victims of the tragedy in Cavalese. The Commission would like to express its deepest sympathy with them and it shares their pain and grief."
"The Commission also shares your feelings regarding the conditions under which this accident took place and, like many of you, regarding the questions that remain unanswered."
"Like Parliament, the Commission hopes that there will be swift and fair compensation for the families concerned."
"Moreover, I note that President Clinton himself has recognized that the United States may have had some responsibility."
"An acquittal has just been pronounced by the American Court-Martial."
"This is the Court that has authority in this matter, under the provisions of the Treaty of London of 1951, which determines the courts that are empowered to rule on infringements committed by NATO troops abroad."
"Any decision to amend this Treaty is the sole responsibility of the members of NATO."
"The issue must therefore be dealt with within and by the appropriate institutions."
"The Community does not have the authority to rule on issues concerning the security of military flights."
"There is a directive, Directive 56 of 24 November 1994, which establishes the basic principles governing enquiries into accidents and incidents in civil aviation."
"However, this directive does not apply to military aviation."
"It is therefore up to the Member States to adopt any decisions which may be necessary on this matter."
"Thank you, Mr de Silguy."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0234/99 by Mr Moorhouse and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party; -B4-0275/99 by Mrs Berès and Mrs Jöns, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists; -B4-0279/99 by Mr Pasty and Mrs Carrère d'Encausse, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group; -B4-0288/99 by Mrs Schroedter and Mr Gahrton, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament; on support for the peace process in the Caucasus."
"Madam President, we can think ourselves lucky that since the cease-fire in the Caucasus in 1994, things have remained relatively quiet, at least as far as the clatter of weapons is concerned."
"But things have been far from quiet when it comes to human rights violations."
"We have seen in Armenia, Azerbaijan and the Caucasus that human rights and democracy are still not being given a chance, and the negotiations for a peaceful solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict have still not produced positive results."
"As I said, thank goodness there has been no real outbreak of violence yet."
"At the moment the so-called Minsk group - the United States and France - is working to try to achieve something through the OSCE."
"Let us hope that this resolution helps to publicise the problem of Nagorno-Karabakh once again."
"Madam President, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the region of Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan experienced some difficult times."
"Fortunately, there has been a cease-fire since 1994 which is opening the way for negotiation, and the Minsk Group is taking charge of this."
"Today, we have on the table a proposal from this Group, which the OSCE has entrusted with finding a solution to this long-standing conflict."
"I think that we should welcome this, as it respects two principles we all support: the inhabitants' right to self determination and the respect for borders as they are currently laid out."
"Nevertheless, we cannot accept changes that would come about as a result of the use of arms."
"This is one of the reasons why, once again, we feel that this proposal by the Minsk Group is headed in the right direction, insofar as it proposes a large degree of autonomy within the existing borders, and we feel that this is a fundamental point."
"A window of opportunity is therefore opening for us to begin a process that could bring about a solution to this conflict."
"We hope that all the parties will be capable of seizing this opportunity to put an end to the conflict and arrive at a situation whereby the people can live together peacefully within the existing borders."
"Madam President, the conflict in Nagorno Karabakh, which my own eyes have witnessed, is a conflict with innumerable tragedies."
"Since 1992 there have been countless refugees, and their children, who have only ever known a state of emergency, have been growing up in tents and covered wagons."
"It is not only the hatred that is constantly growing, and the irreconcilability of two peoples who used to live side by side and to intermarry as a matter of course; there are also the diverse interests of various European powers which keep preventing a peaceful solution, as they did again only recently."
"Nor has the European Union achieved anything with its partnership and cooperation agreements; it has not taken the opportunity to use them as an instrument in pursuit of a peace settlement."
"What we most need to do now is to break down this hatred, because otherwise there can never be peace in the region, and that is why we must not rely entirely on political instruments but must concentrate above all on supporting the key players within society and make them the starting-point for a concerted reconciliation campaign."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, even after five years of cease-fire, there is still no sign of a lasting settlement of the conflict in Nagorno Karabakh."
"There are still more than a million refugees, most of them living in inhuman conditions."
"They have been driven from their native areas and have no prospects, while the continuing absence of a permanent peace settlement for this part of the Caucasus is disrupting the cooperation between Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia that this region so desperately needs, which is ultimately stifling the economic development of the entire region."
"The European Parliament supports the untiring efforts of the Minsk Group to find a political solution that will lead to a stable peace in Transcaucasia."
"We call on the OSCE to continue its efforts and to set up an observer team which would constantly monitor respect for human rights and democratic development in those countries."
"Such a commission of observers would operate as a political early-warning system, so to speak."
"For all the progress that has been made in developing democracy and strengthening human rights, there are still some real problems here, of which last year's presidential election is but one example."
"The latest arrests in Azerbaijan are also a cause of great concern to us."
"The European Union will continue to support the development of democracy in these young states."
"In this context, we call on the Council to increase the allocation of economic aid to Transcaucasia but to link it, I need hardly add, to the process of establishing democracy."
"There can only be economic stability, however, if the political conditions are right, in other words if Azerbaijan and Armenia make a determined effort to reach a political compromise on the future of Nagorno Karabakh."
"Madam President, I am speaking on behalf of our colleague, Mr Francis Decourričre, who drafted one of the motions for a resolution."
"We have had several opportunities to discuss the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, in terms of the human problems caused by the war and as regards our desire to help solve the conflict."
"Since 1993, the OSCE has been trying to find a solution, to negotiate and to draw up a peace plan, but we all know that these negotiations have encountered many obstacles, and that in November, the peace plan proposed by the Minsk Group was rejected."
"In this respect, we want to firmly reiterate our support for the peace process in the Caucasus and also our support for the peace plan presented by the Minsk Group."
"The proposals in question are a good basis for negotiation to help find a peaceful solution to this conflict, and it is essential that negotiations are resumed so that an agreement can be reached as quickly as possible."
"I would like to point out that, following the recent rejection by the Azerbaijani Government of the peace plan proposed by the Minsk Group, some political leaders in Azerbaijan itself warned the government against such a refusal and asked it to enter into direct negotiations with the Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh and to propose a political solution that would grant self-government to the area and make it a free zone."
"This is a new and positive element."
"At the same time, the European Union must continue to make its aid to the region conditional on visible progress in terms of human rights."
"During all information and observation missions, the OSCE must also pay special attention to the level of respect for human rights in the area in order to prevent an escalation of violence if any incidents do occur."
"To conclude, I would like to say that the European Union must increase its aid and assistance to the NGOs in the area, which, through discussion and political education, are trying to promote mutual understanding of the history of the communities that live in the region."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Caucasus region - and in particular the three Transcaucasian republics - are of considerable importance for the countries of the European Union. It is our duty to monitor closely what is happening in these three republics and do everything we can to bring about peace in the region, which is of a much greater significance than is represented by its population alone."
"It is therefore right for the Member States of the European Union to show concern for the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh."
"It is up to us to do everything we can to put an end to this conflict, to establish peace in the region, of course, but also to promote economic development."
"Such economic development can only benefit from the resolution of the conflict."
"The Delegation for relations with the Transcaucasian republics has had several opportunities to visit the country and it got the impression that both the Armenians and the Azeris sincerely want to see a solution."
"This great expectation extends to Europe and to the European Parliament, which could help find a solution, as we have said ourselves."
"The Minsk Group was given the task of drawing up a lasting peace plan."
"The leaders of the countries involved - Azerbaijan and Armenia - have put forward proposals."
"Armenia, in particular, has come up with proposals that are likely to restore peace in the region."
"This is precisely the aim of the resolution in support of the peace process in the Caucasus region, which I personally signed on behalf of my group. We want to make a modest contribution to solving a problem which has been going on for several years and which urgently requires a solution."
"I would like to add that, clearly, in co-signing this resolution, which relates to both Azerbaijan and Armenia, we are not forgetting the problems that both of these countries are facing."
"We could not of course forget the tragedies that Armenia has experienced, nor its repeated demands, in particular, that the tragedy of the Armenian genocide be recognised. Nor are we forgetting that the human rights situation in Azerbaijan leaves a lot to be desired, and that we must make all efforts to improve it."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Union is working to develop regional cooperation in the Caucasus region and it is supporting the efforts of the Minsk Group and of the OSCE, which is the most appropriate body to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh."
"The peace plan presented by the three co-presidents is a good basis for negotiation to find a solution to this conflict."
"In order to contribute to bringing the regional players together, the Union has set up technical assistance programmes through TACIS with the aim of developing cooperation between Armenia and Azerbaijan."
"The presidents of these two Caucasian countries have demonstrated their support for these initiatives."
"They are contributing effectively to improving dialogue between the parties, which facilitates the search for common solutions to the regional problems."
"In this context, the Armenian Prime Minister, Mr Darbinian, took part in the presidential transport summit which was organised last year in Azerbaijan with the support of the Community."
"The Armenian and Azeri Prime Ministers also attended a conference in Brussels in February on the transport of oil and gas."
"The Azeri, Armenian and Georgian Presidents have agreed to participate in a summit organised by the German Presidency in Luxembourg on 22 June to mark the entry into force of the partnership and cooperation agreements between the European Union and the Caucasian countries."
"The main priority of these agreements is to support democracy and human rights, in line with Parliament's wishes."
"Finally, the Commission notes Parliament's desire to strengthen the work of the 'democracy' aspect of the TACIS programme in the region."
"However, up until now, it has only received a very limited number of projects from non-governmental organisations."
"The Commission therefore believes that the very small number of NGOs established in Armenia and Azerbaijan means that, for the moment at least, it would be premature to increase the resources allocated to this programme."
"Thank you, Mr de Silguy."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"Cuba"

"B4-0239/99 by Mr Bertens, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party; -B4-0289/99 by Mrs Schroedter and Mr Gahrton, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament; on the situation in Belarus;"

"Cuba"
"Madam President, the blessing given by the Pope during his visit has simply made Castro more determined than ever to go on with his evil practices, adopting new penal legislation and reimposing the death penalty."
"It reminds me of when I was a little Catholic boy and the religious procession came through the village, all the curtains were open as the image of Christ and its two candles went by and things were absolutely still, you could have heard a pin drop."
"Then as soon as it had passed, the curtains were shut again and people went back to drinking and beating their wives and committing all manner of sins until the next year."
"Castro - and I should know, I lived there for four years - is no good."
"He may be all right as an image of the 'last revolutionary', but we have had quite enough of all that."
"I think it is sad and in fact almost pathetic that we are still trying to get along with this caudillo , another word for dictator."
"All he is doing is strengthening the American line on the boycott."
"So Europe must not change its policy here."
"We must carry on providing support for democratisation and renewal, and this is what our programmes must focus on, rather than some image of Che Guevara."
"Now he was a real revolutionary, but unfortunately he died young and, as you know, Castro had a hand in that too."
"Our programmes and our political dialogue with Cuba must be actively pursued, and we must make it clear to this caudillo that unlike the Pope we are not to be trifled with."
"The people of Cuba deserve democracy and the renewal of their country, even the gullible among them."
"Madam President, I am very pleased at what Mr Bertens said."
"Despite all the human rights violations and the lack of political freedom in Cuba, Parliament - encouraged by the left-wing parties - has unfortunately always turned a blind eye and has thus allowed the situation to become entrenched."
"The dissidents who have put up opposition have never once been honoured with the Sakharov Prize in five years."
"It is enough to make you weep, and I think it is a very serious omission on our part."
"What is more, our extremely selective approach has not helped the people of Cuba one little bit."
"Now, at long last, we have a resolution, albeit one which adopts an extremely mild tone."
"It talks about help for constructive dialogue instead of sanctions, which is fine."
"But a year or more after the Pope's visit, when there were such great hopes of improvement, the people of Cuba have less freedom than ever."
"The opening-up of the economy has not helped the Cuban workers but party officials and a single Italian and Spanish investor."
"It all reminds me of the way things went in the Batista era: prostitution, drinking, rich tourists - these are surely not what you would expect to find in a socialist revolutionary administration?"
"As I see it, today's investors should have to sign contracts with the workers themselves and not with the government, because what happens is that firms investing there hand over all the wages to the government, which then creams off everything it wants and gives a few pence to the workers."
"It is scandalous!"
"No diplomats or journalists were allowed to be present at the trial of the dissidents."
"The European Union said it was an oversight, but when the same thing happens in Turkey, the whole of Europe hits the roof."
"What I mean is that we take a very selective view."
"In the resolution we talk about observing human rights, but really, as Mr Bertens said, a great deal more than that needs to be done."
"Never again must Fidel Castro be given the red carpet treatment anywhere in the world."
"He should face the same fate as Öcalan or Pinochet: a trial."
"Should not the international community be speaking out against the arrival of 300 Cuban troops in Angola and Brazzaville, as reported in the Portuguese newspaper Diario de Noticias ?"
"They are there to help dictators cling to power and to bring oil and diamond revenue to Cuba."
"This House has waited a long time to hold its trial."
"The time has now finally come, but from the communication I received from the Cuban ambassador this morning, he clearly thinks it is all nonsense."
"I do not."
"I hope that our resolution brings hope to those in Cuba who support freedom."
"Madam President, last year, just as John Paul II was arriving in Cuba, the radical party was holding a demonstration in Rome against this visit and what it stood for."
"Many people criticised this at the time, saying that we needed to have confidence in the process of democratisation, and that the signs of this process were apparently demonstrated by the Pope's visit."
"I think that Christmas was celebrated in Cuba, and that is about all."
"When we see that this trial is dealing with the terrible and deplorable crime of having had contacts with the foreign press, we realise that this so-called democratisation is very far from being achieved."
"From that point of view, this resolution does not go very far."
"We should have affirmed more strongly that while human rights are not fully respected, this dialogue - this attempt to take a few small steps - is doomed to failure."
"Madam President, this is not a resolution against the Cuban people."
"The text that we are debating today, and which I should like to see approved, is a criticism of the corrupt and incomprehensible way in which the Cuban Government interprets freedoms, such as the freedom of expression, the freedom of assembly and the freedom of association."
"If there is no acknowledgement of the right to disagree and the right to political dissent, then there is no freedom."
"For this reason, we must condemn the detention, arrest and imprisonment of Cuban dissidents and political opponents simply because they think differently to the current regime."
"Political dissent is a right, it can never be interpreted and judged as a crime of sedition or as a crime against national security."
"In a free regime, such detentions would not have occurred."
"Using the North American embargo as an excuse is too simplistic."
"We have condemned - and I have condemned - the attitude of the United States administration as being mistaken, amongst other things. But their attitude cannot be used as a reason for detaining, imprisoning and sentencing all those who do not comply with the dictates of the single party, which in Cuba is the Communist Party."
"We fully and unreservedly support Vladimiro Roca, Félix Bonne, Marta Beatriz Roque and René Gómez Manzano, who were detained on 16 July 1997 after having written and distributed a text entitled 'The homeland is for us all' which went against official government positions."
"We feel great solidarity with the Cuban political prisoners who have been imprisoned due to their political beliefs."
"I sincerely hope that condemning the Cuban regime in this way will not destroy the fragile framework for dialogue that is still alive between the European Union and Cuba."
"The Cuban Government's mistakes are not the mistakes of the people, they are the mistakes of the ruling party."
"Its political positions, its defensiveness and its negative attitude towards anything that involves a cultural, political, economic or social opening up cannot destroy all possible dialogue between Cuba and the European Union. These attitudes must not lead to the Cuban population being condemned, as they are the ones who will suffer the consequences if such dialogue is destroyed."
"Madam President, the delegation of which I am chairman, the Delegation for relations with Cuba, has made extraordinary efforts to maintain our ability to hold talks with the Cuban authorities and with Cuban society as a whole."
"Even without a cooperation agreement, this House has given its full support to Cuban society, and the European Union is the largest donor of humanitarian aid to Cuba in the world. In this way, the Union is demonstrating its awareness of the problems and shortages Cuba is suffering at this point in its history."
"In this same spirit, and as Mr Cabezón Alonso said a moment ago, we have spoken out as often as has been necessary to condemn the extraterritorial effects of the Helms-Burton Act."
"And now we also have to speak out to defend human rights and democratic freedoms in Cuba because moderation becomes a vice when it means a lack of commitment."
"This House has an irrevocable commitment to freedom that is, and must be, our ethical and aesthetic guiding light."
"I have already said in this House - quoting an illustrious colleague of mine - that the future cannot be imposed on individuals or peoples without their support and that there can be no individual dignity unless every man and woman is able to play a part in determining their future as a society."
"As a result, this House must show its solidarity with those who are suffering and be firm in its inevitable demands for freedom."
"Therefore, my group is once again calling for the release of Vladimiro Roca, Félix Bonne, Marta Beatriz Roque, René Gómez Manzano, Jorge Luis García Pérez and all those who, having been deprived of their freedom, fight in Cuba for their freedom and dignity."
"Madam President, there are several hundred political prisoners in Cuba."
"Under the Cuban Penal Code, it is possible for opposition politicians to be found guilty of so-called crimes such as lack of respect and hostile propaganda."
"Opposition politicians are sent into internal exile within the country, and there are many reports of police brutality."
"Altogether, restriction of democratic rights and freedom is extensive in Cuba."
"This must be unequivocally condemned, which Parliament has done in its resolution."
"Cuba is under intense pressure from the USA, through a long-standing economic blockade and other forms of aggression."
"The blockade against Cuba must be lifted if the country is to engage in positive development."
"However, the US aggression can never be an excuse for deficiencies in democracy and human rights in the country."
"There are many progressive elements in Cuban society, for example a level of social justice which for the region is advanced, and endeavours in the field of education and health care."
"But clearly none of these things can compensate for any restriction of the democratic rights of the Cuban people."
"The Cuban people are fully entitled to choose a socialist model for their society."
"The problem is that they are not allowed to choose, because political pluralism and fundamental democratic rights are lacking."
"Madam President, as has already been said, our group is naturally in favour of the respect for and promotion of human rights and freedoms, as well as the right of peoples to determine their future."
"Therefore, when a nation such as Cuba has been suffering for so many years due to an embargo that is illegal in international terms and to a relentless pursuit by the United States, we begin to understand the suffocating situation of the Cuban Government. We begin to understand the defensive attitude it must adopt to be able to defend itself against these problems and shortages, particularly now with the Helms-Burton Act, which is also illegal in international terms."
"However, we believe it is important to help so that a process promoting human rights can resume, and so that democracy and freedom can be re-established, values that are clearly compatible with socialism."
"The European Union can end this American siege and promote this alternative path, a path we believe to be satisfactory."
"Integrating its economy and its cultural relations could bring normality to cultural and political life in Cuba. This is largely dependent on us as the United States is not prepared to help in this respect."
"I therefore believe that now is the time to make a considerable effort to bring Cuba into the framework of economic, political and cultural relations."
"Madam President, Cuba, as we know, is not the United States."
"In contrast to the United States, Cuba has guaranteed schooling and free health care, as well as all the achievements that have freed it from its former dependence on the United States."
"So why does the Cuban Government imitate one of the most appallingly undemocratic and totalitarian systems ever invented?"
"Why on earth do the Cubans not launch a campaign to prove themselves more democratic than the United States by respecting human rights and abolishing the death penalty?"
"The Cuban Government has done the exact opposite."
"It has added to its list of capital offences."
"No democrat or Socialist can approve of that, because it is a gross violation of the most fundamental of all human rights, namely the right to life."
"Societies are changing everywhere, and Cuba is no exception."
"We should make it unmistakably clear to the Cuban Government and the Cuban people that we are prepared to develop our economic, social and cultural relations with Cuba, and that to this end we need to establish contacts with open-minded, creative and democratic Cubans and their organisations, whether within the ACP framework or on the basis of a bilateral agreement."
"In order to accomplish this, we seek dialogue."
"We hope that the Cuban leadership will be far-sighted enough to pull together with us in this venture."
"Colombia"
"Madam President, the situation in Colombia is still very worrying, despite the promising reports we received some months ago that President Pastrana had started a new peace offensive."
"At the moment, however, it appears that paramilitary groups and as a result the guerrillas too have started carrying out attacks again."
"We heard yesterday evening that three Americans have been brutally killed."
"When will the warring factions finally realise that there is nothing to be gained from this constant destruction?"
"I think the Union must continue to stand up for human rights, but it must do so in cooperation with President Pastrana."
"We cannot be indifferent to the way in which the constitutional state of Colombia is being systematically destroyed."
"We must try to persuade the United Nations and our own Union to convince others that peace and human rights go hand in hand."
"Madam President, I am going to appeal to the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces and to the insurgent forces because it is neither revolutionary nor heroic to assassinate defenceless voluntary workers, it is neither revolutionary nor heroic to kidnap civilians and it is neither revolutionary nor heroic to demand a ransom for anyone's life."
"Any action taken against unarmed people cannot be considered heroic."
"The course of history will not be changed by resorting to using violence against the weak."
"The insurgent forces still have a chance of going down in Colombia's history as a factor in creating peace."
"They have received political recognition - including at international level - but we must ask them to respect international humanitarian law. We must ask them to release all kidnapped civilians, some of whom are ill."
"Do not harm yourselves even further with such reprehensible actions."
"Do not demand justice whilst being unjust yourselves."
"We must also talk about the other form of violence: the terror caused by the paramilitaries."
"It is easy to shoot those who are defending human rights, to shoot trade unionists or journalists committed to freedom or to shoot women and unarmed farmers. In short, it is easy to shoot anyone who may seem slightly suspicious because they support democracy."
"Paramilitary action represents evil, fascism and all the worst aspects of an intolerant and exclusive sociology. It claims to protect whilst killing and eliminating the best people in society."
"There is no room for any form of consideration for paramilitary activity, other than its persecution, dismantling and condemnation."
"Peace in Colombia will not be easily achieved but it must be done."
"The years of violence have affected several generations."
"President Pastrana's offer must have our full support and must have sufficient international economic support so that it can meet the social demands that are really at the root of this violence."
"War, Madam President, is much more costly than peace."
"Madam President, when President Pastrana took office last year, many of us hoped that the protection of human rights in Colombia would greatly improve."
"Unfortunately that seems not to have happened, and so far it does not look as though the President has developed any action plan to increase respect for human rights."
"Both the paramilitary forces and the guerilla groups continue to commit crimes."
"There is systematic elimination of persons and groups campaigning for human rights in Colombia, for example social workers and trade union activists."
"Of course we demand that the archives of the state intelligence service should be searched under international supervision."
"These archives contain large amounts of information on persons who are actively campaigning for human rights and democracy in the country."
"Clearly, this must not be allowed to continue."
"Human rights must be defended and we must do all in our power to defend and support those people in Colombia who are campaigning for these rights."
"I therefore expect the Council of Ministers to prepare a very forthright declaration on Colombia for the forthcoming UN meeting in Geneva."
"Madam President, kidnappings and murders continue to entrench the culture of violence in Colombia, and how often have we had to say that here!"
"This time we have the cases of three US citizens whose bodies were discovered and a French geologist who died shortly before he was due to be released by his kidnappers."
"We have also repeatedly condemned the crimes committed by paramilitaries in addition to these murders and kidnappings, or even in connection with them."
"I must say that it is sometimes difficult for us to understand how President Pastrana can continue his peace talks with the guerrilla organisations in the face of these atrocities, how he can go on negotiating with FARC in particular but also with the other main guerrilla organisation, the ELN."
"Such an approach may appear contradictory, but I believe it represents the only way forward, and we therefore vigorously support the President in his efforts to continue the peace negotiations and ultimately to conclude an agreement."
"Nevertheless, we can only repeat time and again that human rights will not be respected and protected in the long term unless the rule of law is established."
"The European Parliament has also repeatedly stressed its endorsement of the demand made by the Colombian office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights that the safety of human rights activists should be guaranteed."
"We believe this is an important issue, and we hope that the Council and the Commission will be helping to make that point to the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva."
"We call on the Colombian Government not to relax its efforts to combat violence but to continue them vigorously, because it is our sincere wish that the Colombian people should be freed at long last from this cycle of corruption, murder and violence, that peace should descend on the country and that these horrifying crimes should cease to be associated with the name of Colombia."
"Madam President, this is the third time in four months that this Parliament has held a special debate on Colombia and we will continue until the gross violations of human rights come to an end."
"We call upon the UN Commission on Human Rights, when it meets in Geneva, to condemn the Colombian Government's failure both to disband paramilitary groups and to protect human rights defenders, both called for last year."
"They have failed;"
"UNHCR must now act accordingly."
"Let us never forget the human cost that this failure represents."
"Terry Freitas had spent two years helping the Uwa indigenous people defend their territory from oil exploration by Occidental Petroleum."
"He had been followed by people he believed to be paramilitaries and had received a message on his answer-phone: 'back off or die!'."
"Evidence of complicity by the Colombian armed forces is that the military had forced him to sign a statement absolving them of responsibility for his safety."
"Earlier this month, Terry and two colleagues were kidnapped by two hooded men with machine guns and later their bullet-ridden bodies were found dumped across the Venezuelan border - the murder of one 24-year-old who believed in the defence of human rights."
"Stop the paramilitaries, end the killings, respect human rights!"
"Indonesia/East Timor"
"Madam President, Indonesia is a complex country."
"It covers a two-hour time zone and has 13 000 islands, many different races and many different languages."
"For 350 years it was governed in a very centralised, colonial way by my country, and even then there were uprisings in Aceh, the Moluccas and Irian Jaya, just as there are now."
"After independence, the constitution - the Pancasila - ensured that different races and religions could live freely and safely side by side."
"The fall of Suharto and the economic crisis have now, unfortunately, brought all the various differences to the surface, as we are seeing in the clash between Muslims and Christians in the Moluccas."
"I very much regret that it should be happening in the Moluccas, because we too abused and repressed the people there, some of whom are now living in the Netherlands."
"But Indonesia is on the road to a new era and a new order."
"Forty-eight political parties have registered for the elections in June, and they deserve our support."
"The resolution calls for a referendum under UN auspices on allowing East Timor the right to self-determination."
"Let us hope that this is carried out, and that it goes smoothly."
"I would point out that an independent East Timor could well open Pandora's box and encourage other Indonesian races to demand the same, which would present a major risk for the stability of the Asiatic region as a whole."
"This too is something we cannot afford to ignore."
"Parliament has adopted some harsh resolutions against Indonesia, but I feel that recently there has been greater scope for constructive support for the steps that are being taken towards democracy, and I welcome this approach."
"Madam President, Mrs van Bladel said in a nutshell exactly what I wished to say."
"Indonesia's complexity and the clashes and explosions - both literal and figurative - in the Moluccas and on the island of Ambon in particular have all shown how difficult things are likely to become if we allow the last pillar of strength that we have at the moment, President Habibie, to fall."
"The underlying cause of the unrest in the Moluccas lies in the serious political and economic crisis that the country is going through."
"It is extremely important that we should try to ensure that democratic elections are held as soon as possible, and we should certainly support them."
"This enormous, great and beautiful country - the 'emerald belt' as it was called in our geography books - must not be allowed to become isolated, and we have to find some way to show it that we are not disowning it but embracing it."
"Europe, and in particular the Netherlands, still bears a great responsibility from the past here."
"Mr President, this House has repeatedly condemned human rights abuses in many parts of Indonesia over the years and some appalling crimes have taken place in that beautiful country."
"This resolution deals firstly with outrages which have been committed more recently on the Moluccan Islands."
"Over 200 people have been killed there and their homes and those of others have been destroyed."
"Nine thousand troops are deployed there and the people are very badly repressed."
"This is taking place at the very time when we would have expected, because of the changes that have taken place in Indonesia, a movement in a different direction."
"This resolution again recalls the situation in East Timor, where appalling crimes have been committed."
"The forthcoming election provides the opportunity for a change, and it is very important that we should give every support to those people in Indonesia who are trying to achieve a new departure."
"We must also press very strongly for the referendum which is being talked about to go ahead to provide the people of East Timor with the right of self-determination."
"It is quite appalling that those people have been denied that right."
"Over the years a third of the population has been killed."
"The European Parliament has pressed persistently throughout those years for changes to take place, and that possibility now exists."
"It is therefore extremely important that we should maintain our pressure for change at this particular juncture and I hope that once again we will give unanimous support for this motion."
"Mr President, we are prepared to support the efforts to establish democracy in Indonesia."
"I believe the entire House and the other EU institutions are also willing to lend material support to a peaceful democratisation process."
"However, Indonesia will also have to show that it wants a peaceful process and that it is actively encouraging democracy, and in this respect there are two regions that we consider to be very important."
"The first of these is East Timor."
"The referendum in East Timor must be organised as quickly as possible; in actual fact, the independence of East Timor is historically inevitable. The repression there has to be ended, and Mr Habibie knows that."
"I believe we should act quickly to assist in the transition to independence."
"Such assistance might, for example, take the form of training for East Timorese administrators in the European Union, in the Member States, with a view to the creation of an administrative infrastructure that would enable East Timor to manage its own affairs."
"The second region is the Moluccas, where we must ensure that an end is put to the conflicts which are raging at the present time and which are apparently being encouraged by the police."
"On Ambon, we have a situation in which 85 % of the island's population are Christians."
"We must prevent the outbreak of hostilities between religious groups, and in this respect a heavy burden of responsibility falls on the government in Jakarta to demilitarise the population by restraining the police and by using the police force to uphold law and order, rather than to fan the flames of conflict."
"If that happens, I believe our only option is to call on the Commission to provide humanitarian aid in these conflict-torn areas and to support the campaign for democracy and the elections, and to do these things as quickly as possible in order to ensure that peace prevails throughout Indonesia."
"Applause"
"UN Commission on human rights"
"Mr President, some time ago we discussed the Bernard-Reymond report on China."
"On that occasion my group, the Liberals, brought up the question of the UN Human Rights Commission."
"A majority in the House did not want to discuss this subject and were also against taking it as an urgency."
"When will we learn that we need to adopt or discuss resolutions that can genuinely be of some influence in good time?"
"The UN Commission meeting in Geneva starts in eleven days' time - how can we still hope to influence the Council's priorities in any way now?"
"A new ice age has started in China, as everyone knows."
"Dissidents are being rounded up in large numbers, Internet users arrested, and there is a crackdown on the formation of new political parties such as the Democratic Party."
"The Union must behave honourably here."
"Human rights dialogue must carry on as normal, but if it is to be effective, we must also be prepared to bring public, international pressure to bear: the carrot and stick approach."
"If this process is to be effective, the Council must itself table a resolution on China, lobby for it actively and stop countries from supporting a 'no action on China' motion."
"When we see how China is using its influence towards Macedonia and is thus undermining the Contact Group's Balkan policy, I think we are entirely justified in using public pressure on China."
"The Chinese will accept this, provided that they are taken seriously."
"My group thinks it is a pity that we always have to fight so hard to say what we want to say about China."
"But then, money makes the world go round, or at least so we think."
"Mr President, I think that the resolution drawn up this time for the UN session is a very good and balanced one."
"I think it is very important that we should call for a millennium amnesty for political prisoners and for a ban on the use of children in warfare."
"We are right this year not to have a list of countries that are failing to observe human rights, but instead to concentrate solely on China."
"In this morning's Herald Tribune , there was a photo of the Dalai Lama in northern India, five years after the invasion of Tibet."
"The point has to be made that the day after the China report was adopted in Parliament, dissidents were being rounded up and missiles were being aimed at Taiwan from southern China."
"We have to give China a signal."
"Not for ourselves or just to be a thorn in its side, but to guarantee stability in the region, because peace is, and will always be, important."
"Mr President, over recent years the European Parliament has established a record on human rights throughout the world of which we can be very proud."
"It is, therefore, highly appropriate that we should put forward our priorities for the forthcoming 55th Session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights."
"Our motion recognises that poverty is a fundamental obstacle to the realisation of human rights."
"Freedom of thought, speech, religion and all other political, religious and civic liberties are absolutely vital."
"Economic rights and their close links to other rights must not, however, be overlooked, above all at a time when more than a thousand million people in our world are deprived of adequate food, pure water, proper clothing, reasonable shelter, education and health-care."
"The motion before this House calls for coordinated action to fight the scourge of racism and discrimination, which has led, even in recent years, to genocide or massacres like that in Rwanda."
"The motion also calls for positive action to end the appalling discrimination against, and exploitation of, women and children."
"Everywhere we must work for the liberation of prisoners of conscience, the outlawing of torture and the ill-treatment of prisoners and an end to the barbaric institution of capital punishment, which should be seen to be utterly unacceptable in the world and the civilisation of today."
"Therefore, we particularly call on the Council and the Commission to pursue issues raised by human rights resolutions in this Parliament and we hope very much that they will be reflected in the work of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights."
"The achievement of full recognition of human rights in every country in the world is a challenge to us in our time."
"I believe that by passing this resolution, we shall be reaffirming our intentions of carrying on the struggle to achieve that."
"Mr President, I think that this resolution is a good one for two reasons: firstly, because we succeeded in the compromise meeting in eliminating all the demands concerning rights such as the right to housing, the right to work, etcetera, that is, all those rights that cannot be claimed."
"The first point relates to the universal moratorium on executions."
"In this respect, we are calling for this session in Geneva to be the last at which a resolution is passed on the moratorium, and for this year's General Assembly to vote for the universal abolition of the death penalty."
"The second point involves taking an initiative in favour of the ratification of the international court for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity."
"Finally, the third point relates to China, which was mentioned by Mr Bertens and Mrs van Bladel."
"We do not hold out a great deal of hope."
"The policy on the People's Republic of China has been a disastrous policy not only for Mr Brittan, but also for Mr Jospin, Mr Dalema, Mr Schröder and many others."
"It is a policy that is slowly edging towards despair."
"Mrs van Bladel spoke about Tibet."
"On this matter, I am afraid that we must recognise that as in Kosovo, there are limits to the capacity for suffering and acceptance both of the Tibetan people and of all the people of China, and that we will once again arrive too late."
"We are obviously calling on the Council quite seriously to reverse this policy and to finally place democracy and human rights at the heart of its concerns."
"Mr President, we are debating an extraordinarily detailed resolution and we will vote on it later. I believe that it is perhaps one of the best texts on human rights that we have ever held in our hands in this Parliament."
"But I believe that we now have to put to the Council something that is even more important than the very relevant issues in this resolution, such as the 'Millennium Amnesty', promoting the defence of those defending human rights - please forgive the repetition - making the rights of women and children a priority, abolishing the death penalty and pressing for the International Criminal Court to finally become a reality. We must ask that our involvement as the European Union and as member countries in the 55th Session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights serves mainly to defend two principles: the universality and the indivisibility of human rights."
"We have just discussed some related issues."
"For example, we cannot allow a government such as the Cuban Government to impose certain conditions on the respect for human rights, such as the lifting of the present embargo by the United States. We also cannot allow, for instance, the dictator in Equatorial Guinea to tell us that the human rights tradition in his country is different to the tradition here in Europe."
"As a result, I believe that it is vital to defend those principles."
"And in this era of globalisation, indivisibility also means linking political rights to social and economic rights."
"Mr President, I cannot but endorse the words of my colleagues here."
"It is utterly impossible for me to contradict anything that has been said on this subject; what we really need to do today is to make a very forceful appeal to the Commission and the Council, not least in view of this meeting in Geneva."
"The fact is that, every year when this meeting comes round, it carries the hopes of people around the globe who want to hear our Member States loudly and clearly denouncing violations of human rights."
"We therefore call on the Commission and the Council - especially the Commission, since it also serves as a coordinator for the Member States - to put our message across in no uncertain terms."
"A great many countries have featured in the resolutions of the European Parliament in recent months."
"Some of them have repeatedly been the subject of resolutions. Colombia, which featured again today, is one example."
"But I should also like to list a few others, such as Afghanistan, Algeria, Burma, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iran, Iraq, Kosovo, Rwanda, the Sudan and Turkey, although I am aware that Kosovo is not a country but nevertheless a major problem."
"The reason why we have not included this list in the resolution is that the names of far too many other countries occurred to us, and we could not list them all."
"China, however, is mentioned."
"I cannot argue with that."
"I should also have liked to see China on the agenda for Geneva, because we know that this touches a raw nerve with the Chinese and elicits a crystal-clear response."
"We take that response very seriously too."
"If the Chinese Government is serious about its dialogue with the European Union, it must not follow up these meetings with more waves of arrests, not to mention its position on the Tibetan question."
"Other catchwords we should like to mention include repression and trafficking in women, child soldiers, religious intolerance and the death penalty."
"Let me say once again to the Commission and the Council that we earnestly beg you to take firm action and to ensure that our Member States' diplomatic scruples do not cause them to dash the hopes of the watching world."
"We have a huge responsibility here, and we want the Commission to make it clear that it demands compliance with democracy and human rights clauses."
"Then the European Union would truly be setting an example."
"Applause"
"Mr President, there are numerous indications that the history of human rights has entered a new era."
"Immediately after the end of the Second World War, they were essentially a political manifesto."
"Now, however, they have become a legal reality, and this, of course, gives rise to an entirely new set of problems."
"We are discovering new aspects of human rights, the social dimension, and it has become apparent that the human dignity and human rights of women and children are particularly at risk."
"We see the need to abolish the death penalty worldwide, we see the legal reality of human rights in the form of the new international court, and we appeal to the Council and the Commission to do everything in their power to ensure that progress is made in ratifying the constitution of the International Court of Human Rights."
"But there is also a great danger that, precisely because human rights are now a legal reality, they will be ground down in the mills of foreign policy interests."
"What can be done to prevent that?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the European Union has a very, very important role to play in the transformation of foreign and security policy in the traditional sense into a 'peace policy', in other words a coordinated political approach that is governed by the overriding aim of establishing and preserving peace."
"You all know how often Members of this House have called for a mechanism through which the European Union can speak with one voice so that this transformation can be effected."
"This Parliament can already speak with one voice, as today's debate has shown, and it should use that voice to ensure that respect for human rights, which is now enshrined in international law, is enforced."
"I therefore wish to re-emphasise what previous speakers have said and to appeal to the Council and the Commission to assist in promoting the achievement of this aim."
"Belarus"
"Mr President, the situation in Belarus is still very worrying."
"President Lukashenko is still a dictator and is blocking any form of normal political and economic development."
"The Union must support what opposition parties there are and must try to establish dialogue."
"This seems about as likely as snow in summer, but the recent resolution of the 'embassy conflict' could indicate that President Lukashenko is beginning to realise that international isolation is not in his interest, and hopefully this will encourage him to make certain concessions."
"If this happens, the Union must be prepared to provide assistance to support the process."
"A dogmatic approach is not what is needed here."
"We need to do everything we can to solve problems and improve the lives of the people."
"We have had a whole series of dictators under review this afternoon, but President Lukashenko is the one nearest to us, and this may be our chance to convince him that he is a dictator and that he needs to change his ways."
"Mr President, Belarus will soon be one of our neighbouring countries."
"However, the situation there, Mr Bertens, is still marked by the absence of democracy."
"Perhaps that does not apply to the embassy, but it applies to the population there, and all attempts by the opposition to re-establish fair interaction among the forces of democracy by peaceful and democratic means have been thwarted by the dictatorial rule of President Lukashenko, who simply keeps issuing decrees that criminalise opposition activities."
"But the opposition MPs are not criminals."
"That is the problem."
"By criminalising their activities, Mr Lukashenko is prohibiting fair play, a prohibition that even extends to the forthcoming local elections."
"That is why the opposition has refused to take part in these elections - not because it is against democracy, but because it insists that there should at least be a minimum catalogue of fair conditions."
"One of these is freedom of the press."
"It is truly calamitous that the Belarus people do not even have the opportunity to find out about alternatives to President Lukashenko, because he uses the press to such a great extent as an instrument of power, and I know that situation from personal experience."
"That is why we must make every effort to ensure that changes are made in Belarus and in particular that freedom of the press is restored, because that is one of the main prerequisites of free elections and the democratic process."
"In spite of everything, the Belarus people continue to yearn for democracy and personal freedom, which is why we are called upon to ensure that the agreement between the Council, the Commission and Parliament is upheld, and above all that it is implemented in such a way as to help that nation to satisfy its longing for democracy and does not subordinate this purpose to economic interests."
"Mr President, both of the previous speakers have highlighted the critical points."
"Allow me to add a little to their comments."
"We have tabled a joint resolution, and we are reaffirming that we want to welcome Belarus into the democratic world and that it is our wish that Belarus should be part of that world. But the latest spate of arrests has naturally raised new difficulties and new problems, and as has so often been the case in Belarus, one step forward towards democracy has been followed by two steps back."
"The President is now dreaming of a pan-Slavic union, and I can only hope that Russia does not seize upon that dream and that the Ukraine remains aloof and does not jump on the bandwagon either, otherwise the results would be devastating for all of us."
"I must say, however, that the argument which is currently raging over the elections announced by the opposition for 16 May 1999 will certainly have devastating effects."
"As my colleague Mrs Schroedter has already indicated, the European Union would do well to follow this process very carefully and to lend all the support it possibly can."
"I am thinking here in particular of the assistance that the OSCE will need."
"This also means, Commissioner, that financial support is required."
"I know that Ambassador Wiek has approached the Commission to ask for funding so that the proper training can be guaranteed for those involved in the organisation of the forthcoming elections, and I ask you to look at the relevant documentation again and to do everything we in the European Union can to support this process; let us not use bureaucratic difficulties as an excuse for not delivering the necessary funds."
"The situation this year is exceptionally critical."
"The economic situation is unstable, the political situation is extremely unstable and as future neighbours, as my colleague rightly pointed out, we are called upon to do everything we can to help Belarus to find a decent path that will lead it to democracy."
"Mr President, I am delighted to be able to follow Mrs Mann, because her fine words express what I also intended to emphasise."
"First of all, it is a fact that the people of Belarus are a very likeable people and also have cultural links with us somewhere along the line."
"Secondly, Belarus perhaps offers the best evidence of the destructive nature of the regime which ruled that part of the world for 40 years."
"When we criticise President Lukashenko here, we must not forget what school he was trained in and the education he received there."
"Somehow we must even find it in ourselves to sympathise to a certain extent with this man, for he was led in this direction, and most of his wrath has so far been vented on foreigners."
"I believe that Mrs Mann was right when she said we must do everything we can to assist the Belarus people and guide them slowly but surely to the path that leads to freedom and democracy, the path which I am certain they instinctively wish to follow."
"Anyone who knows these people will appreciate that they need to be helped if they are to progress gradually towards those goals."
"Kicking them in the shins, so to speak, will not induce them to move in that direction."
"On the contrary, we must make every effort to form a peaceable and fruitful relationship with Belarus, quite irrespective of the fact that Belarus will continue to be of vital importance to us in the future, since we shall be sharing a common border."
"We need only look at the map to realise how vitally important it will be for all of us, especially our Baltic friends, which is why we must do everything we can to guide Belarus, one step at a time, back into the fold of the civilised and democratic nations."
"Russia"
"Mr President, Russia is never out of the headlines."
"These usually tell of economic problems, the effects of which are reverberating through Europe."
"Far less loudly heralded but no less intractable are certain other problems we hear about in Russia, problems that do not sit well with a country which has been campaigning very vigorously for membership of the Council of Europe, since they relate to actions which are incompatible with the Council of Europe's Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and with the provisions of the partnership agreement with the European Union."
"Only this week, in what might almost be termed a live commentary, a delegation from the Congress of European Jews confirmed some of the facts from this list, for example the gradual resurgence of anti-Semitism, which has some political support, especially from the Communists."
"Our resolution covers various other areas under the same heading, areas which cause us grave concern."
"These are increased religious intolerance, the treatment of conscientious objectors and the lengthy delays in enacting legislation on this matter and the grim conditions in the armed forces, which led in 1998 to more than 1 000 suicides and unexplained deaths. It is not only courageous mothers in Russia who are providing this information."
"All of these, I am sorry to say, are vestiges of the Soviet empire that have not been swept away."
"Our resolution should be understood as an expression of concern, a message of concern that we wish to send with our colleagues who are travelling to Moscow in the coming week for talks with representatives of the Duma and the authorities."
"We in the European Union are especially anxious that Russia should be a strong partner, a country where democracy and the rule of law prevail."
"That is absolutely imperative for this Europe of ours, because it would create solid common foundations for a peaceful and free Europe in the next century."
"This is precisely how we want our message to be understood."
"It undoubtedly expresses criticism, but it is intended to be constructive and to show the depth of our commitment to helping to improve conditions in Russia."
"Mr President, as Mrs Lenz said, this resolution speaks of anti-Semitism, and it does not condemn comments made by just anyone, but the views of Mr Zuganov, who is, in fact, the chairman of the Russian Communist Party, the main party in the Duma."
"I think that our delegation that is to visit Moscow shortly should remember this and should ensure that the people there realise that the European Parliament knows about these statements and is fully aware of their seriousness."
"Another issue is conscientious objection."
"The European Parliament is somewhat concerned about the delays on the part of the Duma, which is again under the control of Mr Zuganov's party, the Communist Party, and which for four years has systematically blocked the adoption of a law on conscientious objection, a law which is nevertheless provided for in the Russian constitution."
"Along with colleagues in my party, the Transnational Radical Party, in Russia, we are trying to get past this deadlock by launching a campaign, which I think Parliament should support, to bring an end to military conscription and to establish a professional army in the country, which would be a significant step in the right direction."
"Mr President, I believe we are at one in our criticism of the situation in Russia with regard to human rights and anti-Semitism."
"On the other hand, Mrs Lenz, I would not oversimplify matters by blaming it all on the Soviet empire."
"After all, the Soviet era was not exactly preceded by a Golden Age of democracy and respect for human rights."
"Repression, regrettably, has a long tradition in Russia and was to assume appalling and criminal dimensions during the Soviet era, especially under Stalin."
"I can subscribe to the criticism of all political forces in Russia, including the Communist Party, which is unfortunately blocking progress on respect for human rights and bears its share of responsibility for the regrettable resurgence of anti-Semitism."
"In view of the heinous crimes that have been committed by anti-Semitic regimes, there can be no tolerance on this point."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists therefore backs the delegation in its mission to convey this message in very clear terms during the forthcoming visit to Russia."
"Mr President, when we ratified the partnership and cooperation agreement with Russia, we criticised the fact that the human rights situation in Russia did not meet the criteria laid down in the human rights clause of the agreement, to which Commissioner van den Broek replied that the agreement provided an excellent basis for changing that situation."
"That, however, was three years ago, and nothing has changed!"
"Conditions in Russian prisons do not accord with international standards, and nothing is being done to rectify that situation."
"No progress is being made in the provision of alternatives to military service."
"The maltreatment and humiliation of young people in the Russian army is driving many of them to suicide."
"May I therefore ask the Commission to specify where it has intervened on the basis of the agreement."
"Where has it applied pressure on the basis of the agreement?"
"When did it intervene during the WTO negotiations to remind the delegates that human rights were a priority issue?"
"I expect answers to those questions now!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to answer point by point, as is the custom with human rights issues."
"I will therefore begin with Cuba."
"The Commission shares Parliament's concerns regarding the development of the human rights situation in Cuba, and it is concerned about the adoption of a reform of the criminal code which considerably reinforces the repressive nature of the legislation."
"The Commission is also worried about the outcome of the trial of four dissidents."
"In consultation with the Member States, it will very shortly consider what position should be adopted in order to respond to these attacks on human rights."
"Nevertheless, the Commission will continue with firm but vigilant dialogue with the Cuban authorities."
"The Community cooperation policy, which - I would remind you - is a European policy is governed by the principles established in the common position of 8 December, which, as far as I am aware, is revised with each new presidency."
"This policy is aimed at encouraging a peaceful transition to democracy, promoting human rights and supporting the economic development of the island."
"In this respect, the activities funded by the Community that are planned for the 1999-2000 period mainly involve food aid, support for economic reforms and the development of civil society."
"Finally, at the end of June 1998, the European Union granted Cuba observer status in the negotiations between the European Union and the ACP countries."
"That is also dialogue."
"Full and complete participation in those negotiations, including Cuba's accession to the future convention, depends on it making substantial progress in terms of human rights, the rule of law, what is known as 'good governance' in English, and political freedoms."
"With regard to the second issue, Colombia, the Commission entirely shares Parliament's concerns about the development of the situation in the country."
"The Commission is particularly concerned about the repeated violations of human rights committed in recent years by the guerillas and paramilitary forces."
"Above all, it regrets the breakdown of the peace negotiations between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the FARC."
"More than a thousand political murders are committed each year."
"Over 300 people have been kidnapped and are still being held, including around 20 foreigners."
"With regard to the case of the four members of the Colombian NGO, the IPC, Instituto popular de la capacitación, who were abducted by a paramilitary organisation, the AUC, the European troika approached the Colombian Vice-President and Mr Lemus, who is responsible for human rights, to demand their release, which has since taken place."
"The Commission fully shares Parliament's desire to see dialogue swiftly resumed between the guerrillas and Mr Pastrana's government."
"The European Union gave its support to the peace process in a declaration on 8 January."
"A meeting between the government and the opposing armed movements is planned for 24 April."
"Support for actions to promote human rights and help with the implementation of judicial reforms are a priority of the Commission in its work to help Colombia."
"I must remind you, or perhaps inform you, of the figures: in 1998, the Commission set aside EUR 17 million for NGOs, along with EUR 2 million for human rights and EUR 12 million for ECHO to help displaced persons."
"With regard to Indonesia, the Commission strongly condemns the violent and murderous events that are currently setting Muslims and Christians against each other in some parts of the Moluccan Islands."
"The Commission supports the steps that have been taken on behalf of the Union to inform the Indonesian authorities of Europe's concerns about the development of inter-ethnic tension."
"In particular, the Union has asked the Indonesian authorities to ensure that the police forces act with greater restraint in Ambon, where there were several deaths in January as a result of repression."
"The Commission is monitoring the development of the situation as closely as possible."
"The European Community Humanitarian Office, ECHO, sent a representative to the area who is working in close cooperation with the Commission representatives in Jakarta and the NGOs present in the region."
"Through ECHO, the Commission is preparing to provide aid of around EUR 1 million for the people of the two communities that are victims of the conflict."
"The implementation of this decision will be entrusted to the European NGOs present in Indonesia, in cooperation with the World Food Programme."
"This will involve food as well as health and medical aid."
"It will also provide basic necessities for the displaced people living in shelters."
"The fact that elections are being held in June is also an important factor in resolving the current tensions between the communities."
"The Commission will support them, while liaising with international organisations and other donors present in the area."
"A programme worth EUR 7 million is currently being prepared for this purpose."
"With regard to East Timor, which many of you mentioned, the Commission hopes that the discussions that are taking place under the auspices of the Secretariat of the United Nations will allow the people of East Timor to be consulted on the future of the region."
"The Commission shares the concerns expressed by Parliament, which have just been repeated here, about the military situation and the arming of civilian militias."
"This could endanger a peace process which is still fragile."
"The Commission supports the conclusions of the Vienna European Council, which call for the disarmament and dissolution of these militias and which also ask that a United Nations mission be sent to the area in order to ease the tension."
"The fourth issue is the United Nations Commission on Human Rights."
"You are aware that the preparation of work for the Commission on Human Rights is carried out by the Council's 'Human Rights' group."
"This group has already met several times for this purpose since the beginning of the year."
"During the annual session of the Commission on Human Rights, which, I would remind you, lasts six weeks, experts from the Union meet every day in order to decide on the speeches to made by the presidency, on behalf of the Union, and the motions for resolutions to be presented by the Union."
"The Commission participates systematically and actively in the work of the 'Human Rights' group, and in all the meetings of experts in Geneva."
"I can reassure Mrs Lenz on this point."
"Nevertheless, I have taken careful note of comments that have been made."
"I am thinking, in particular, of what Mr Ullman said concerning the Commission's attitude."
"I can assure you that the Commission is doing everything necessary, and will do all in its power, to convey your views to the Council."
"You know, as I do, that it is the Commission's job to take a position on the wishes expressed by Parliament in its motions for resolutions."
"More specifically, regarding China, which many of you mentioned, all the Member States of the European Union decided in 1998 not to table a resolution condemning the country."
"On 22 March, the Foreign Affairs Council will decide what stance the Union will take in Geneva in 1999."
"For this purpose, your resolution will be a useful source of information in those debates."
"The fifth issue relates to Belarus."
"The Commission is extremely concerned by the recent deterioration of the situation in Belarus."
"In economic terms, the population has become poorer, a situation of hyperinflation has developed and serious social tensions have emerged."
"In political terms, the disagreement over the application of the constitution has led to a deterioration in terms of fundamental liberties and has resulted in the arrests of several opponents."
"The presidential decree adopted in January, which means that the activities of political parties and associations must be authorised by the administration, is undoubtedly a sign that the regime is becoming tougher."
"The Commission is sincerely asking the Belarus authorities to establish an open, constructive, public and democratic dialogue with the people and with the opposition with a view to resolving the economic and constitutional problems affecting the country, and to make a real effort to move towards democracy."
"In this respect, the Commission fully supports the work of the OSCE towards restoring the democratic operation of the institutions."
"The Commission is closely following the development of the situation with regard to human rights and fundamental liberties."
"Mr von Habsburg, I can assure you that we aim to support the Belarusian people in this process."
"I can also reassure Mrs Erika Mann that we are considering how the Commission can play a useful role in the electoral process."
"Finally, the last issue relates to Russia."
"The Commission is concerned about the frequent anti-Semitic comments made by certain political figures who are members of the Duma."
"On behalf of the European Union, the German Presidency has brought this issue to the attention of the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs and the leaders of the Communist Party and made them aware of its concerns."
"The European Union has taken measures to promote tolerance and the advent of a civil society in Russia."
"Notably, under the TACIS programme, it is currently involved in work to promote democracy which is aimed at creating an environment that will eradicate such demonstrations of racial hatred."
"The Commission will continue to monitor the situation very closely and hopes that these anti-Semitic outbursts from another age on the part of certain members of the Russian Parliament will end."
"With regard to human rights, and the death penalty in particular, you know that the Commission shares the European Parliament's concerns on this issue."
"In this respect, it has been involved in an approach made to the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs by the troika to express its concerns about the possible re-introduction of the death penalty."
"The Minister assured us that Russia intended to comply with the obligations arising from its entry to the Council of Europe, which, I would remind you, includes a moratorium on the death penalty."
"Mrs Schroedter mentioned a problem concerning specific examples."
"I think that in my perhaps general answer, I have answered these more specific questions."
"Mr President, may I say to Commissioner de Silguy that I naturally appreciated that it would be difficult for him to answer specific questions which lay beyond his own area of responsibility."
"Let me therefore request, Commissioner, that you submit these questions to Mr van den Broek and ask him to provide me with a written reply to them."
"You have my word, I will do it this evening."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 5.30 p.m."
"Mr President, a veto by one of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council has blocked the extension of the mandate of the UN preventive deployment force in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia because that country has entered into diplomatic relations with Taiwan."
"That is extremely serious, particularly bearing in mind the institutions to which this House belongs and the nature of the United Nations."
"In both cases, in fact, we are dealing with organisations designed to overcome the kind of nationalistic tendencies which underlie the veto by the People's Republic of China."
"And yet, the United Nations' force has played an important part in keeping the peace, not least by preventing the threat of the conflict in Kosovo spilling over into Macedonia."
"The Community institutions must therefore take resolute action to get the veto lifted."
"But at the same time, it is essential that we have, as of now, the ability to make a virtue of a vice: if the United Nations Security Council fails to take a positive decision, the European Union and its Member States would have to shoulder the responsibilities hitherto exercised by UNPREDEP, in conjunction with the other institutions, primarily NATO and the Western European Union."
"That could act as an important incentive, albeit in very sad circumstances, encouraging us to put into effect the foreign and security policy that everyone claims to believe in, but which is all too rarely put into practice."
"Mr President, I regret the fact that this resolution limits itself to stating the obvious, as it is clear that neither the United States nor the European Union can give in to the veto, to the attempts of the People's Republic of China to blackmail us over the presence of troops to guarantee peace and security in Macedonia."
"It is therefore clear that solutions will have to be found."
"These are already being considered with a view to replacing, if necessary, the current formula with another formula that will not be met by a Chinese veto."
"I also regret the fact that, since everyone is talking about stability in Macedonia, we have not dealt with the real issue of stability in Macedonia, in other words, its economic development, its democratic development and, above all, its swift entry into the European Union."
"In this respect, the European Union is absent, which I find absolutely scandalous, and the Commission has set out an incomprehensible policy."
"I hope that Mr de Silguy will also be able to mention this matter to his colleague Mr van den Broek this evening."
"The Union's funds to Macedonia are being reduced by ECU 3 million."
"Given the difficulties that Macedonia is facing, this is truly staggering."
"Moreover, everything has been done, and is still being done, to convince the Macedonian authorities that they will only be able to ask to join the European Union after they have ratified the cooperation agreement and the association agreement."
"They will therefore have to wait for decades before they can present a request for accession. This is wrong from both a legal and political point of view."
"Therefore, we have launched a campaign directed at Mr Georgievski asking him to present a request for accession to the European Union immediately."
"Here is a postcard with a lovely picture of the flag of the European Union, and, in the middle of that flag, the Macedonian flag, so that, in the coming months, Macedonia may be an official candidate for membership of the European Union."
"Mr President, perhaps not everyone will agree with me when I say that Macedonia, or FYROM, ought surely to have proceeded somewhat more adroitly and made a more judicious choice of tactics in its policy on diplomatic recognition, but that does not in any way justify the Chinese veto in the UN Security Council."
"In fact, I cannot recall any recent use of the veto in the Security Council by a major power, be it Russia or, as in many cases, the United States, which was actually justified, but that is another matter, and there is little to be gained by debating it here."
"I am entirely in favour of the aim of the resolution that the mandate of UNPREDEP should be extended if at all possible and that provision should be made for military protection of the Macedonian borders, which will not only afford protection to Macedonia itself but will also protect the observers in Kosovo."
"As far as our aid to Macedonia is concerned, I should like to make one thing clear: we can probably never help enough, but the crux of the matter is that our aid should be used effectively, that the country itself should have the capacity to absorb the aid, and it is up to the government, of course, to create that capacity."
"There have undoubtedly been some missed opportunities in the past."
"The new government is doing its best on issues ranging from the Albanian question - on which, I am glad to say, some progress has been made - to the economic and social situation."
"But, however much political continuity can be guaranteed, we should not raise any false hopes."
"Whether Macedonia manages to find its way to Europe will depend primarily on its own efforts, and the way to Europe in the sense of the European Union will naturally be a long one, whenever the membership application may be submitted."
"Mr President, the Green Group also considers China's veto of the extension of UNPREDEP's mandate in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia totally unacceptable, not least because it amounts to a kind of retaliation."
"But this also reveals all the limitations of the Security Council in its current form and therefore the need for Europe, as a whole, to seek to change the current UN system."
"However, given that the problems of Macedonia are real ones - and we have only to remember what is happening next door to that region, in Kosovo, to appreciate the importance of continuing with the UNPREDEP mandate - it is clear that we Greens also believe that, were it to prove necessary, the European Union should shoulder its own responsibilities."
"The Green Group also considers it appropriate to extend the debate on Macedonia to Bosnia-Herzegovina, to deal with the problem of the Brcko corridor, and it has therefore tabled a number of amendments to that effect."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the only republic of the former Yugoslavia to survive the demise of that state more or less without bloodshed and to achieve statehood without warfare was Macedonia."
"There is absolutely no doubt that our preventive measures were instrumental in this."
"We were there in the territory of the former Yugoslavia to prevent trouble, and we deployed UN forces on the border between Serbia and Macedonia - and now these preventive measures have been scrapped."
"It is incomprehensible to me that a Chinese veto in the Security Council should jeopardise the safety of Macedonia."
"There is surely something wrong if it is possible to veto preventive measures when they have finally been implemented and, what is more, to take such action for quite transparent reasons which could effectively be described as revenge for poor little Macedonia having had the temerity to recognise Taiwan."
"We can all well imagine why it did so."
"It hoped that recognition would bring it a great deal of investment and financial aid, which of course it could never obtain from China."
"As you know, China and Russia have often used their veto in the Security Council to prevent us from providing military assistance to people and nations that are subject to persecution and aggression, as has been happening for a year and a half in Kosovo, and as was the case in Bosnia for a number of years."
"Something is rotten in this UN Charter."
"It ought to be designed in such a way that preventive measures, at least, cannot be vetoed, and it should naturally allow intervention to thwart the plans of a dictator and criminal, thereby protecting people and nations from such criminals, as in Bosnia and Kosovo."
"In view of the crisis in the neighbouring country, in Kosovo, there is a real need to avoid any instability in Macedonia."
"The UN forces known as UNPREDEP have helped to do that."
"They have not only contributed by their presence but have also, as I discovered in my own conversations, helped to bring together the Albanian minority and the Macedonians in special discussion forums on specific subjects in order to promote harmony between the two ethnic communities."
"Until the Security Council can finally decide to renew the UNPREDEP mandate, to which end we have included a special appeal to China in our resolution, the NATO forces deployed along the border to protect the OSCE observers in Kosovo will have to perform that function too in order to prevent insecurity from spilling over into Macedonia at the very time when the country is developing fruitful cooperation among the peoples within its territory."
"I should also like to endorse the view of Mr Dupuis that we in the European Union should support these extremely promising steps towards fruitful cooperation by forging additional links with Macedonia, including the provision of financial aid."
"The Macedonians have earned it."
"Mr President, a few days ago, the UNPREDEP forces were actually withdrawn on the basis of a veto by the People's Republic of China."
"That has thrust us very suddenly into an extremely dangerous situation, because the situation was relatively stable until then."
"I myself have been in Macedonia several times, and I know what these UNPREDEP forces on the border have achieved and how they have enabled the Macedonian Government, which is indeed of high quality, to launch a process of development that would have stood up to close scrutiny."
"The Macedonians were criticised because they recognised Taiwan, but there is one thing we must not forget."
"The nation we are discussing lives in indescribably wretched conditions, for which the border conflicts, incidentally, must take much of the blame."
"And of course we must remember that the Greek blockade in the south and the Serbian blockade in the north have stifled economic growth, since the major trade routes all ran from north to south."
"We must also recognise that sizeable loans have now been secured from Taiwan, because none could be expected from other sources."
"A government simply cannot be criticised for adopting such a course of action."
"That is why we must reflect on how we can guarantee Macedonian security again with forces from Europe, and in that context, I can only recommend that you look at the past."
"It is time we began to take our lead from the Organisation of African Unity."
"They more or less sort out their own affairs."
"We always ask the United Nations, instead of simply saying 'Europe for the Europeans!'"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the past, since 1992, in fact, UN forces have played an important role in stabilising the Balkans."
"Like all the Members who have just spoken, the Commission therefore sincerely regrets the failure to extend the mandate of UN troops in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"Following the recognition of Taiwan by the FYROM, China decided, as you know, to exercise its veto in the Security Council against the extension of the mandate of UNPREDEP."
"The presidency of the European Union tried to get the authorities in Peking and Skopje to reach a consensus, but these attempts were unsuccessful."
"It is unfortunate that a bilateral disagreement should be behind this Security Council decision."
"The Commission believes that an international presence is more necessary than ever in this part of the Balkans, following the withdrawal of UNPREDEP."
"It is appealing for the participation of the WEU in a Petersberg-type mission in the area."
"I apologise to Mr Dupuis for being unable to answer him either with regard to the level of aid or the request for accession."
"I had prepared a response to the issue of the breakdown in diplomatic relations, but once again I promise to pass on his question to my colleague Commissioner van den Broek this evening."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following six motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0241/99 by Mr Frischenschlager, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the disastrous avalanches in the Alps; - B4-0242/99 by Mrs Stenzel, Mrs Grossetête, Mr Ebner, Mr Böge and Mr Habsburg-Lothringen, on behalf of the PPE Group, on disastrous avalanches in Austria, France and Italy; - B4-0255/99 by Mrs Leperre-Verrier, on behalf of the ARE Group, on the Alpine avalanches; - B4-0267/99 by Mr Swoboda and Mr Bösch, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the disastrous avalanches in the Alps; - B4-0277/99 by Mr Pasty, on behalf of the UPE Group, on the avalanches in the Alps; - B4-0304/99 by Mr Voggenhuber, on behalf of the V Group, on the disastrous avalanches."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, rarely does this House deal with natural disasters, but there is no doubt that the disaster we are discussing today demands all our attention because of its enormity, its unpredictability and its scale."
"It also demands our attention because it affects a region, the Alpine region, which should be particularly prized in the process of Community integration."
"The Alpine area actually provides a culture that is unitary, broad, clear, specific and in harmony with itself, and which has for centuries been accustomed to being not a barrier but a link between Europe, north and south and east and west."
"The national frontiers, which gradually became more rigid during the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth century, then sought to some extent to break up the Alpine region; and the same is true of the national legislations which failed to take account of the special nature of the region and the special characteristics of what we might call the culture of the mountains."
"That is why the avalanches which have struck various areas of this extremely important part of Europe should serve to draw our attention to these issues, which go far beyond the natural disaster, and stir us into planning for a range of measures - not only short-term and preventive measures, but ones that are designed to tackle this problem and this situation in a comprehensive way."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this resolution on the situation following the avalanche disaster in the Alps is a matter of paramount concern to the Austrian delegation and its leader, Mrs Stenzel."
"We are also grateful for the special gesture by the European Parliament in granting our request for a minute's silence in honour of the Galtür victims."
"But we do not merely wish to express our general condolences in today's resolution."
"There is more to it than that."
"We have combined our expression of sympathy with a request for concrete financial assistance for the disaster area of Paznauntal in the Tirol and for all the other areas, such as those in Italy and France, which were hit by the avalanches."
"We have received support from all the other groups."
"This is a sign of solidarity that has been extended to us both inside and outside the House."
"The regions that have sustained long-term economic damage are particularly grateful for this solidarity."
"I therefore appeal to the Commission to associate itself with this gesture and to make every effort to ensure that help can be given to the stricken areas as quickly as possible."
"Europe can demonstrate real solidarity here."
"I earnestly beg you to do that."
"Mr President, with regard to these avalanches, we must offer support to the victims and their families and pay tribute to the rescue teams and to the local communities. However, the problem that we are faced with today is that of preventing such disasters from re-occurring."
"It is true that we should not underestimate the work being done by the European Union, which, through the Interreg programme, is already funding work on mountain safety in cross-border regions."
"I am thinking, in particular, of the experiments that have been carried out in the Mont Blanc massif."
"Nevertheless, the European Union should take account of the specific nature of mountain regions and increase its aid to the regions that are affected as well as its involvement in preventive measures."
"Although it is difficult to define with any certainty where the avalanches are going to strike, it is clear that the equipment used to detect avalanches has proved to be very effective, and mapping of the risk areas should therefore be refined."
"I would also like to highlight other factors involved in the prevention of avalanches."
"Firstly, given the deterioration of the mountain ecosystem, we should call on the Member States to be more vigilant when granting building permits."
"In the same way, the development of mountain sports - both winter and summer sports - should lead to the organisation of genuine multilingual information campaigns in order to give a sense of responsibility to those participating in such sports."
"My group has tabled several amendments on these two points."
"I hope that you will support them because this is the sine qua non condition to ensure that the mountains are still the area of freedom we love so much, despite the fact that the European Union is not paying enough attention to them."
"Mr President, I believe that this debate today is not about political, party-political or personal point-scoring, but rather about a common wish to join together in expressing our solidarity with the victims. Otherwise, Mr Rübig, we should have to ask why, when this matter is so close to Mrs Stenzel's heart, she is not here in person."
"But that is not what this debate is about."
"We are debating what we can do to help with resources from the European Union that are available now for the various areas, and we urge the Commission and its staff to do everything in their power to cut through the red tape and ensure that these funds can be injected quickly and used efficiently."
"The areas concerned may not be in the poorest regions of this continent, but they are areas which need our solidarity in their present plight."
"Of course there is every justification for asking a secondary question: could these disasters have been prevented?"
"What is the settlement structure and what is the planning policy in these areas where there may be a risk of avalanches?"
"I would not like to claim that building plans and settlement patterns in all our Alpine areas have been designed so as to avoid potential risks."
"Many things which are done in the name of tourism or economic interests are not particularly prudent and could certainly have repercussions and lead to disasters, if the worst came to the worst."
"Be that as it may, as far as I am aware there is no evidence at all, at least in many of the areas we are discussing today, that human error or political mistakes were at the root of these disasters."
"And so it really only remains for me to ask the Commission to cut through the red tape and to help quickly wherever help is needed."
"Mr President, firstly, with regard to the distressing subject of avalanches, the Commission wishes to express its distress and to offer its heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims of these events."
"In answer to the questions that have just been raised, I would point out that the Union has various tools to help prevent disasters and to deal with their effects."
"Firstly, as far as prevention is concerned, the European Union can help the mountain regions, notably through afforestation programmes for agricultural land."
"Objective 5b of the ERDF and the Structural Funds also allows us to implement forestry measures."
"The Commission's proposals on the 'rural development' aspect of Agenda 2000 will further increase the possibilities for aid for afforestation and forestry improvement, if the Council agrees with the Commission's proposals."
"In the context of these proposals, compensatory payments could be made in order to preserve and improve the ecological stability of forests in areas where they have a protective and environmental role that is in the public interest."
"Within the framework of the 5b programmes in the Tyrol and Vorarlberg areas, the European Union is cofinancing the improvement of agricultural land, land management measures, planning and advice on the agricultural use of areas that are ecologically sensitive."
"In relation to what Mrs Leperre-Verrier just said, the Commission also supports the idea to draw up forestry maps and forestry development plans."
"Finally, and still on the issue of mapping, the ERDF can support cartographical studies of the mountainous areas that are at risk within the framework of transnational cooperation programmes."
"Initiatives could also be cofinanced by Interreg, especially during its next programming period."
"Therefore, the tools do exist, and I can assure you that the Commission will do all in its power and spare no efforts to put those tools to use, especially in areas that are at risk."
"Secondly, moving on from prevention to dealing with the effects of avalanches, I would remind you that in 1997, Parliament blocked heading B4-3400, which was precisely aimed at providing emergency aid for the victims of disasters."
"The budgetary line B4-3300, which relates to civil protection and environmental emergencies, does not provide for intervention to reconstruct damaged areas through economic aid or emergency aid."
"Nevertheless, it is possible to re-focus the existing provisions on measures to re-establish the potential for agricultural and forestry production that was harmed within the existing financial envelopes."
"It is also possible to transfer funds between the Länder."
"Finally, in the framework of the Community action programme for civil protection, the Commission is prepared to examine - within the limits of its funding capacities - any proposals submitted by national or local authorities to improve their ability to act when disasters occur."
"The joint debate is closed"
"The vote will be taken at 5.30 p.m."
"That concludes the topical and urgent debate."
"The sitting was suspended at 5.20 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m."
"VOTES"
"Mr President, a point of order under Rules 119 and 120 concerning roll-call votes, in which I know you have a special interest."
"At this morning's sitting we had any number of roll-call votes."
"We are destined to have more again this evening and Members can look forward to a fairly healthy-sized volume of roll-call results in their pigeonholes tomorrow morning."
"Rules 119 and 120 referring to roll-call votes state they shall be recorded in the Minutes."
"Rule 133 states that the Minutes shall be distributed to the Members."
"I wonder whether, in the interests of economy, efficiency, and certainly of modernisation, you could either rule as President or call for an investigation to see whether the word 'distribution' could be interpreted to mean 'distributed electronically', so that those Members who want to access the full list of recorded votes can do so through the computers or a certain number of copies can be made available to those Members, rather than going through the expensive and wasteful procedure of distributing hundreds of pages to everybody."
"Thank you very much for that thought, Mr Evans."
"I did in fact send a letter to the President of the European Parliament, and this very afternoon the Conference of Presidents debated the matter."
"One of the issues I raised in the letter, which of course will be distributed, is the excessively large number of roll-call votes, which often reach 100 or more. This is of course my own opinion, and does not commit anyone else."
"Apart from the waste of time, each of these cost the European taxpayer EUR 300 because, as you know, the results of the votes must be published the following day. They also have to be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, and that costs a great deal of money."
"An initial debate has taken place in the Conference of Presidents but I do not think I should expand on that now, since it is neither the time nor the place for a more general debate."
"There is a problem and, of course, we note your recommendation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at first sight Mr Evans's proposal to save paper by not distributing the results of the spiralling number of roll-call votes may well appear very tempting."
"But let me make another suggestion."
"Let us discuss in the relevant committees how we can get back to the original purpose of roll-call voting, which was to enable us to hold a special vote on particular issues of genuine importance."
"I believe it is rather pointless to take a roll-call vote on every single phrase."
"For that reason, I believe we should be well advised to review this procedure, and then the paper problem would automatically be solved."
"Mr Konrad, thank you very much for your comment."
"I do not want to broaden the debate."
"This is not the time, and we are not prepared for a debate without an opinion."
"I think we should stop here so that we can continue with the votes."
"Mr President, I should like to draw the attention of the Chair to the fact that under Rule 19 every word spoken by the Chair, even though it might prove superfluous, is nevertheless printed in the full report as well."
"That costs paper and trees."
"Applause"
"Mr President, let me take up Mr Konrad's excellent suggestion at this point and ask the PPE Group to agree to this very sound proposal now and withdraw the flood of roll-call votes which they have requested on this report, so that we can indeed put this good idea into effect."
"Mr Rehder, I do not want this debate to continue. It should take place in the political groups, since we need to find out if we can do anything more."
"Parliament adopted the legislative resolution"
"Mr President, I merely wanted to announce some sad news to the House."
"The German Federal Minister of Finance, Oskar Lafontaine, has just resigned his posts as finance minister and party chairman."
"Applause"
"Mr President, I wanted to vote in favour of that, but my machine was not working!"
"Laughter"
"Mr President, I only wanted to say that it does not really befit the dignity of this House to greet a domestic political decision with applause."
"We ought to bear in mind that such a decision is a matter for the Germans, for the German Federal Government. It is not the concern of this House."
"Mr Swoboda, I do not want us to continue this discussion, but it goes without saying that the information that was given is of interest to the House, even though Parliament did not ask for it, since Mr Lafontaine is the current President-in-Office of the Council of Finance Ministers."
"Mr President, I must nevertheless take the liberty of contradicting Mr Swoboda on that point."
"Negotiations are about to take place on the tough conditions presented by the Agriculture Council, and we all know that Mr Lafontaine is President-in-Office in the finance policy sector. So to that extent, his resignation most definitely affects the European Parliament."
"Applause"
"We have decided to abstain from voting on the Adam report on trans-European networks."
"Trans-European networks are, on the face of it, a sensible arrangement which improves both security of supply and competition in the energy market."
"However, there is another side to the coin which people should be aware of, namely that the various energy providers cannot supply on equal terms."
"Small, environmentally friendly, decentralised combined power and heating stations, which are owned and run by local interests, cannot be expected to supply electricity at the same price as nuclear power stations and large, coal-fired power plants."
"Renewable sources of energy are also uncompetitive because the external costs of the large plants are not included in their prices."
"There is therefore a risk, as things stand at present, that a healthy, environmentally friendly development in the power supply industry could be destroyed by the trans-European networks."
"The June Movement actively supports the development of environmentally friendly forms of energy, and believes that the Member States should have the opportunity to promote renewable energy with all the means at their disposal."
"In Kyoto, the European Union committed itself to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 8 % compared to 1990 levels before 2012."
"Given the fact that energy consumption in the Member States is set to increase by 50 % in the next 20 years, we need to make an extra special effort in terms of energy efficiency."
"Sufficient resources should therefore be allocated for this purpose."
"Our rapporteur is concerned about 'the low budget allocated to SAVE II' and says that, as a result, 'the programme's potential is being overestimated.'"
"In its opinion, the Committee on Budgets takes the same line."
"It stresses that the Union's dependence on energy imports is increasing and goes on to highlight the importance of the SAVE programme, since its objective of saving energy 'will thus reduce this dependency'."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection is of the same opinion."
"It states the following: 'The Commission proposal on the promotion of energy efficiency is somewhat disappointing."
"The measures it contains are far too weak if the targets set at Kyoto are to be anything more than empty words.'"
"It is unfortunate that the European Union is not providing itself with the resources needed to achieve its objectives. However, I will support this proposal since, above all, it does at least exist."
"But we need the resources to implement the policy. With this in mind, I would like to highlight another of the conclusions reached by the Committee on Budgets: 'Tax policy can also influence the achievement of these objectives and to this end an agreement should be reached on a common energy and CO2 tax at the first opportunity.'"
"I am opposed to any form of subsidy for the tobacco industry."
"I believe subsidies of this sort cannot be justified and should be stopped completely."
"I have therefore cast my vote in accordance with this principle."
"I and other British Labour members voted against this report because it recommends increasing subsidies for growing tobacco, not in poor countries in regions totally dependent on growing tobacco, but in four of the richest countries in the European Union."
"Tobacco-growing subsidies should be phased out, not increased, with support for growers in Objective 1 and 5b areas to assist change to other products."
"Many thousands of European Union citizens die every year and millions suffer years of ill-health due to smoking-related illnesses, discovering too late that the dangers they were warned about in their teens become apparent when they suffer heart attacks and cancer in their 40s, 50s and 60s."
"There is absolutely no justification for continuing to use taxpayers' money to support the growing of tobacco."
"Increasing subsidies is completely unacceptable."
"Money saved should be diverted into rural development programmes and health promotion programmes."
"I am wholly opposed to this report from Mr Trakatellis and the Agriculture Committee, because it wants subsidies for tobacco cultivation to continue in the EU."
"I cannot support this, because I do not think that the EU should give money for tobacco cultivation."
"On the one hand the support is unreasonably high, and on the other hand tobacco is harmful to health; tens of thousands of people in the EU countries die every year from tobacco smoking."
"At the same time, the EU has programmes encouraging smokers to stop smoking."
"This contradictory policy must cease."
"One cannot give the tobacco growers 10 billion in support at the same time as spending a few hundred million on programmes to encourage people to stop smoking."
"I have instead chosen to support the amendments tabled by Mr Collins and others, calling for the EU's tobacco support to be phased out and to be discontinued completely after a few years."
"I consider this to be both reasonable and possible."
"The entire system of support for tobacco must be abolished."
"This must take place over a transitional period, however, so that the growers do not suffer economic problems and so that unemployment is not made even worse."
"I am voting in favour of the amendments proposed by the Trakatellis report on the regulation on leaf tobacco."
"The amendments reaffirm the need to support European tobacco production which, I would like to point out, only represents 23 % of the volume of leaf tobacco consumed by the European processing industry."
"The battle against smoking, which, in my view, is essential, should not involve the reduction or abolition of this production, as some of my colleagues have suggested."
"It would be immediately replaced by production from countries outside the European Union, which already account for 95 % of world tobacco production."
"Moreover, this report proposes a greater increase in premiums."
"This is doubly justified, firstly, because of the losses that resulted from the withdrawal of the green ecu, for which there is no compensation as it is below 1.98 % - which represents a loss of ECU 1 million for French producers - and secondly, because of the losses suffered over the years when subsidies were not increased to account for inflation."
"The Members belonging to the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations are aware of the importance of tobacco production for the economy of many rural regions."
"This production requires a considerable workforce and allows many jobs to be preserved on relatively small farms."
"We are therefore opposed to the amendments proposed by the chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, which seek to eventually abolish the aid granted to the tobacco production industry."
"We are all aware of the European Union's low level of self-sufficiency: it only provides 20 % of its own needs, which means that any reduction in aid will lead to a decline in European production to the benefit of tobacco imports from third countries, especially the United States."
"The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations voted in favour of Amendment No 5, which provides for full compensation for producers for the negative effects of currency conversions in the transition from the ecu to the euro."
"In France, for example, we know that compensation aid and official prices have fallen by 1.9 % for all farmers in the transition to the euro."
"This provision obviously requires additional budgetary resources but it preserves the principle of equality."
"We regret that, although their income decreased during the 1997-1998 season, farmers were not treated fairly: the challenge of the single currency was more important to some people."
"Amendments Nos 7, 8 and 9 aim to transfer the guarantee thresholds from group III (dark tobacco) to group II (Burley) and group I (Virginia)."
"Although this transfer does not affect the budget, it encourages production to move towards quality tobacco."
"The level of nicotine in dark tobacco, in particular, is higher than that of the other types of tobacco which would benefit from the transfer."
"To conclude, I would also like to make a stand against the principle of gradually reducing agricultural aid, as proposed by the Commission on the basis of a French initiative."
"This phased reduction would represent 3 % per year as from 2002."
"Taking account of the depreciation of the currency, that would mean that official prices and compensation aid would decrease by around 5 % every year."
"Initially, the lowest performing producers will be forced to stop producing and the level of European production will therefore fall."
"A uniform phased reduction of 3 % will primarily penalise the sectors of production which receive the most aid, such as tobacco growing."
"It is a mistake to think that our producers' productivity gains could compensate for this decrease in compensation aid."
"The European Union must react vigorously and oppose the arrogance of the United States of America, which has unilaterally announced that, as of the beginning of March, it will be imposing sanctions (100 % customs duties) on a whole list of European products, even though the final decision of the WTO's banana panel has yet to be announced."
"By already imposing 100 % customs duties on imports, the USA is actively limiting the import of products, threatening the fragile economies of the less favoured countries and regions of the Union."
"Europe must stop kow-towing to the USA."
"We must have a trading policy commensurate with the European Union's importance in the world."
"That is why we are calling on the Commission to use every means at its disposal to oblige the USA to comply with WTO rules."
"I am voting in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on the US imposition of sanctions against EU companies as a consequence of the banana dispute."
"I completely condemn the US's unilateral action and its failure to wait for the decision of the World Trade Organization (WTO) panel on 12 April 1999."
"The US action will cost the EU euro 450m."
"It will throw thousands out of work, devastating and blighting the future of all those families and communities in the interests of American multinationals, who appear to buy their influence through donations to American politicians, who are waging an economic war against some of the poorest communities in the Caribbean."
"I ask President Clinton and the US Administration to think again and wait for the WTO to rule."
"Mr President, given the political balance in this Parliament, Mr Colajanni's report was, in its initial version, undoubtedly the lesser of all the evils that could have come out of Parliament on the subject."
"I did not, however, vote in favour of the report, as I think that it has unfortunately been distorted by certain amendments."
"This does not make it any less interesting, as it is a very good example of the contradictions of European policy."
"On one hand, we give excessive unconditional support to the claim for a new Palestinian state alongside Jordan, while on the other hand, we say that the proclamation of that state would create an explosion situation. Added to this, we state that, in any case, it is too expensive and the administrative structures are not viable."
"Undoubtedly, and absurdly, this is what is interesting about the report."
"But it is not a reason to adopt it, since it sets out a position which explains why, for a long time to come, Europe will continue to pay without truly being able to make any decisions."
"Luigi Colajanni's report contains several strong ideas and we must give them our immediate support."
"Following the Wye Plantation agreements and the deadlock in the situation on the ground, the Palestinian authorities have decided to declare the independence of the territories unilaterally on 4 May."
"The Israelis have stated that if that happens, they will occupy the territories with military forces."
"As it is obvious that there is not enough time left to achieve the considerable progress that is necessary, I believe that the rapporteur is right to ask the two parties to engage immediately in negotiations in order to put back the date of application of the provisional agreement until after 4 May."
"I also share his view that the negotiation process must result in the constitution of an independent Palestinian state and that the existence of the State of Israel and its right to security must be recognised by the Arab world."
"As I said in this House in 1998, to try to resolve each conflict in the region separately would be to erase all the historical, ethnic, religious and cultural differences and to forget the international strategies that aim to control the raw materials and maintain areas of influence through the military alliances."
"The European Union's aim, in fighting every form of extremism and fundamentalism, must be to strengthen its political role in the region and to support a process that establishes security and cooperation between all the countries of the Near and Middle East and benefits all those involved. It must also support any moves towards finding regional solutions."
"I hope that the Euro-Mediterranean Conference to held in Stuttgart between 4 and 6 April will enable us to make progress in that direction."
"It is in this frame of mind that I will visit Syria next week with a delegation from the Socialist Group. We are now at a stage where Syria and Israel have expressed the will to resume peace negotiations on the basis of regional cooperation founded on the common interests of the countries and the region."
"The Wye Plantation agreements, which were concluded with American backing, enabled the Oslo Agreements, which had been completely grounded for 18 months, to be relaunched."
"We must welcome this along with the fact that for the first time, all of the main Israeli political forces seem to have accepted the principle of exchanging land for peace."
"However, what is much less pleasing to us as Europeans is that we have been in no way associated with the political negotiations, despite the fact that the European Union is the region's main financial backer."
"In a way, we are paying, but we do not have anything to say."
"There are two main reasons for this."
"Firstly, despite a few institutional steps in the right direction, the Union's common foreign and security policy is still largely in its embryonic stages."
"Secondly, the considerable sums of money given to the Palestinian Authority were not enough to improve the lot of the Palestinian people; quite the opposite."
"To be more specific, I should in fact say that, on the one hand, these funds were used in an inappropriate manner, and on the other hand, their distribution was hindered by the administrative obstacles put up by the Israeli authorities and by the repeated closures of the territories in the wake of attacks."
"On this particular point, I would like to express my own personal belief that it is not advisable to link the resumption and continuation of the peace process to a cessation of terrorist activities."
"The terrorists' very goal is to block the path to peace, and those who plant the bombs will continue with their terrible acts as long as their crimes serve their political objective: to bury the peace process."
"Having said this, like our rapporteur, I would like to stress the need for the European Union to establish a common position as quickly as possible, especially with the prospect of 4 May 1999."
"We have voted in favour of the report because, in many parts, it highlights the value of improved cooperation between the EU countries and the states around the Mediterranean."
"It also points out how important it is that the peace process in the Middle East should continue and that measures should be taken to ease the situation of Mediterranean countries struggling under the burden of international debt and to cancel debts."
"This is positive."
"However, the report also contains points which seek to strengthen the EU's common foreign and security policy and to give the Commission increased powers in the foreign policy area, to which we are opposed."
"Despite this, we have chosen to vote in favour of the report in the final vote, for the reasons indicated at the beginning."
"Mr President, the idea behind giving aid to improve the safety of nuclear power stations in the applicant countries has always been that they should be shut down completely in the long term."
"The trouble is that this has not happened, and there is no sign that it will happen."
"Having extended the lifetime of the nuclear power stations with the help of EU aid, the applicant countries now claim that the safety of their nuclear plants has become so good that there is no reason at all to close them down."
"The Adam report has not taken this into account."
"It does not link aid to the demand for closure in the long term. Nor does it spell out a clear policy for financing the form of energy which will replace the nuclear plants."
"On top of that, the nuclear power industry in the West is also having its lifetime extended."
"The order book was more or less empty, but with EU money a new and lucrative market has emerged."
"The June Movement recognises the right of countries to choose and manage their own forms of energy, including nuclear power."
"But under no circumstances will we be party to giving economic aid to maintain nuclear power as an energy source, at the expense of developing more environmentally friendly sources of energy."
"The June Movement will indeed vote for a short-term improvement in reactor safety, if it is aimed at phasing out nuclear power."
"The Greens' amendments provided for that, but since they were all rejected, we have voted against the Adam report."
"Despite the decline of nuclear power in Europe, the EU continues to waste massive resources on promoting, researching and developing it, via the Euratom Treaty."
"It was one of the three original treaties of the European Union, and still maintains the 'atoms for peace' lie in a legal constitutional form, so as to 'permit the advancement of the cause of peace' (recital 1) 'by creating the conditions necessary for the speedy establishment and growth of nuclear industries' (Article 1)."
"While the European Parliament has a major say on the EU Budget, it has, exceptionally, no real control over the activities which take place under the anachronistic and non-transparent Euratom Treaty."
"The European nuclear industry, having been badly hit by Chernobyl, has turned that around into a business opportunity."
"They have made millions of ecu working on nuclear safety projects in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, funded largely by the EU."
"However, EU Court of Auditors Special Report No 25/98 on the PHARE-TACIS nuclear safety programmes recently showed that no real safety improvement has taken place, as we have claimed for years (and was shown in a Parliament STOA study commissioned at the initiative of the Greens), so that over 800 MECU have been largely wasted on producing reports."
"And yet, the European Commission is currently considering three safety-related Euratom loans, for the completion of Khmelnitski 2 and Rovno 4 (k2/r4) in Ukraine as part of the Chernobyl closure agreement, for Kallinin unit 3 in Russia and for Kozloduy units 5 & 6 in Bulgaria, all Soviet designed reactors."
"These projects neatly illustrate the sort of problems associated with EU enlargement negotiations as far as the safety of nuclear power plants is concerned."
"Ukrainian President Kuchma has written that his country originally wanted gas-fired stations as part of the Chernobyl closure deal, but the G7, looking after the interests of their nuclear industries, forced Ukraine to accept the completion of these two VVER 1 000 MW reactors, whose construction had been abandoned after the collapse of the USSR, and which have not been that well preserved in their incomplete state."
"The Least Cost Study on this project carried out by a panel led by Prof. John Surrey of SPRU at Sussex University showed that they were far from least cost, and yet the Commission and G7 continue to press the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to fund these reactors (190 MECU), alongside Euratom's 400 MECU, in breach of all rational procedures, technical and financial concerns."
"Energy saving is clearly the least cost investment in Ukraine, where energy intensity is an order of magnitude higher than in the EU, a situation common to the former Eastern bloc states."
"Kozloduy illustrates another crucial aspect of this problem."
"Units 1-4 are of the more dangerous VVER 440-230 type, and should be closed forthwith."
"Bulgaria made a closure agreement with the Nuclear Safety Account run by the EBRD for the G24 countries in return for finance, but the conditions attached had to be carried out by Bulgaria, allowing them to legitimately extend the closure dates by not meeting those conditions, which they have now done."
"In both cases the interests of the Western nuclear industry takes precedence over everything else, something that must be changed during the rest of the enlargement negotiations - firm dates without escape clauses for the reactors are essential as a pre-condition for entry to the EU."
"It is of course worth noting that there are equally dangerous nuclear installations in the EU, such as the UK Magnox reactors, which have no secondary containment, not to mention all of the unstable high-level waste and other dangerous materials associated with the UK and French reprocessing plants (something not found in Eastern Europe)."
"Nuclear power will leave a heritage of nuclear waste, for tens of thousands of generations to come."
"But, a more subtle heritage is to be found in the permanently altered genetic stock of every living thing on the planet."
"Atmospheric nuclear weapons testing was the first of many reckless activities to spread radio-isotopes all over the planet, which is why the military scientists made sure that radiations standards were set at an unreasonably high level, so as to avoid consequent claims against the weapons states that they had compromised the health of the human race."
"This problem is still with us today, as the science is manipulated, prevented or simply neglected, which shows that despite the reductions in levels, they are still way too high, as was demonstrated in a Parliament workshop initiated by the Greens, the basis of a STOA study published on this matter."
"What is worse, the Radiation Standards Directive (Euratom/96/29), which should protect the public and workers as from 2000, actually has features which facilitates the dilution and recycling of radioactive waste, so that consumer products might even contain these materials and no one would know."
"A radical revision is urgently needed, before these materials are released."
"And the new areas of radiation protection research need to be urgently pursued by the EU, such as Genomic Instability and DNA mini-satellite research, so that we find out the long-term effects of low-level exposure."
"Since 1999, nuclear power has been an important issue for the European Union's relations with the Central and Eastern European countries and the new independent states."
"It is essential that in the new enlargement process nuclear safety is put at the heart of the negotiations."
"Agenda 2000, the European Commission's Framework for the Development of the European Union, states that most of the power stations operating in the applicant countries are still using Soviet technology and do not meet international safety standards."
"From an EU perspective, reactors are placed in three categories: reactors of Western design, reactors of Soviet design and unsafe reactors."
"The European Commission must agree to an energy strategy for each of these countries under partnership and cooperation agreements in which provision is made for the closure of unsafe nuclear reactors at an agreed date."
"While the initial assessment by the European Commission and the Agenda 2000 programme is not sufficiently detailed, the Mochovce plant in Slovakia which is still operating must be singled out for special attention."
"If this plant is to meet international safety standards, together with other nuclear installations in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Bulgaria, modernisation programmes will take at least seven to ten years to ensure that the highest environmental and public health standards are met."
"Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia also have to find solutions for the storage of the nuclear waste that they produce."
"All these problems are broad in their implications for the European Union and we must ensure that no enlargement of EU takes place until we are sure that the nuclear plants operating in the applicant countries meet the highest international safety standards."
"This is not going to be a particularly easy task."
"For example, it is now fourteen years since the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl."
"It is hard to believe that this nuclear plant is still a key supplier of energy needs for the people of Ukraine."
"It is clear that Western finances will still be needed to close this nuclear plant down once and for all."
"The overall cost involved in ensuring that no further environmental or public health affects arise from the plant is estimated at £1.7 billion."
"This is designed to ensure that the two reactors which are still functioning at Chernobyl are safely closed down and defused."
"The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will have a role in this process and I welcome the fact that they have contributed close to $ 200 million last year alone to help the Ukrainian Government to close down the Chernobyl Plant in the near future"
"There is no doubt that growing numbers of people have a great sense of insecurity as regards nuclear power in the EU countries, in the Central and Eastern European countries and in the New Independent States alike."
"Retrogressive nuclear policies are increasingly being abandoned, a process which has led amongst other things to decisions by Sweden and Germany to begin the phasing-out of nuclear power."
"It would be more than desirable if the Central and Eastern European countries and the New Independent States did the same."
"The report from Mr Adam and the Energy Committee contains several points which, in my opinion, tend in the opposite direction (encouragement instead of the phasing-out of nuclear power)."
"For example, the nuclear power industry in the EU countries is encouraged to continue its activities in the countries concerned."
"I consider on the contrary that the EU must provide economic support to help those countries commit themselves to moving away from nuclear power."
"In this context, the economically stronger EU countries must offer help."
"I have misgivings with regard to the assistance programmes addressed by the report, in view of the problems which have arisen hitherto in the EU's assistance programmes, on which the Court of Auditors presented a report last year."
"The problems seem to be very wide-ranging, and the money which the EU had set aside has not brought about any noticeable improvements."
"This is a serious matter, and the EU should consider how support for the phasing-out of nuclear power and support for renewable energy and efficient use of energy should be formulated in order to produce tangible results."
"Finally, in the vote I have supported all the amendments which we tabled in the Green Group and which are of great importance for the future."
"A natural consequence of the introduction of the euro is that the euro countries will be compelled to follow a uniform economic policy."
"There is nothing surprising about that, but it explains, amongst other things, why we believe the euro is a political instrument for closer integration."
"Individual Member States should insist on following their own economic policies, including their own policies on tax, VAT and employment."
"The heart of state sovereignty is having independent instruments to manage the economy."
"With the euro, the states have to give up this right and subordinate themselves to the interests of the Union, thereby undermining what is best for the individual state."
"The EU should not meddle with the economic instruments of the Member States."
"Monetary union and a central bank will not be able to survive in the long run unless they are controlled by a common government and a common parliament."
"Therefore, monetary union must either be followed by a new leap towards political integration or perish."
"In principle, we believe that voluntary coordination of economic policies and currency cooperation between the Member States could be an excellent idea, but this report does not prepare the way for voluntary coordination."
"On the contrary, it maintains that the Member States should be committed to coordinating fiscal policy (paragraph 43)."
"The report calls for systematic coordination of the taxation of enterprises, capital and energy."
"We do not think the EU should be deciding macro-economic goals and instruments, which are the essence of democracy in the Member States."
"We are therefore voting against this report."
"However, we do share the report's concerns about the global economic crisis."
"We endorse the report's criticism of the EU's inability to fight European unemployment, which has admittedly fallen, but is still very high."
"The Commission regards the growth of the European economy over the past year as broadly positive, although it appears rather worried about the repercussions of the international economic and financial crisis. It acknowledges that these repercussions are already visible in the economy of the European Union, and forecasts a slowdown in growth for 1999."
"The conclusion it has reached on what should happen is based on the well-known logic of unilateral austerity, further reducing financial deficits and the public debt, and strengthening anti-inflationary policy."
"The Commission fails to mention that the stifling restrictions on national budgets will limit the scope for action in the event of the crisis deepening."
"It fails to explain why, despite ever-increasing returns on investments, increased profits, reduced labour costs and low interest rates, there has been no stimulation of private investment."
"The Commission and the report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy both call for measures to reverse the downward trend in public investment."
"But how will this come about, when the scope for action is extremely restricted as a result of the obligations deriving from the Treaty on European Union and the stability and growth pact?"
"Our fear is that this will lead to a reorganisation of budget infrastructure, resulting in further cuts in social spending."
"We are particularly concerned by the attempt to bring about closer links between the procedure for approving general economic measures and the policy on employment."
"While admitting that the EU and Member States have failed to tackle unemployment, the Commission is further subjecting wage policy and the other aspects of employment policy to the requirements of the Maastricht criteria and the stability and growth pact."
"A typical example of its hypocrisy is that we were initially told that adding a chapter on employment to the Treaty would solve the problem."
"Subsequently, we were told that the process to implement the relevant provisions was to begin."
"Then we were told about special measures that were to be decided upon at the European Council meeting in Vienna. Now we are being told to wait for the European Employment Pact, but although this is now at the drafting stage, it merely covers the same ground as the German action plan on employment."
"It is clear that the idea of greater convergence of the political choices made in terms of the general direction of economic policies and employment policies, as called for by the Commission and by the majority of those in the European Parliament, is resulting in more job opportunities in the sense of an increase in part-time and atypical forms of employment, as well as an undesirable restructuring of the social security system."
"Moreover, the two reports that were published by the Commission on structural policies, known as Cardiff I and II, call for greater flexibility and for greater changes to be made in labour relations and in the labour market, which the Commission regards as the extra key ingredient in our macro-economic endeavours."
"We are also seeing that almost all new jobs are part time, while the number of full-time jobs is falling."
"The Commission has failed to state that it will take decisive initiatives at international level in order to limit the movement of capital for profit and to promote productive investment."
"We call on the Commission to include in the next round of multilateral negotiations the problems created for international monetary and financial stability by the unchecked movements of capital, and to promote the adoption of measures such as the Tobin tax."
"It is painfully evident to the people of Europe that the policy currently being followed will get us nowhere."
"It is clear that there is no future for the deception perpetrated on the people of Europe through insipid debates about employability and entrepreneurship."
"With increasing force and coordination, the people of Europe are demanding specific measures in favour of full-time, stable employment, budgets for the redistribution of income in favour of working people, an end to the scandalous impunity enjoyed by multinationals, a totally different policy in Europe, and that the Member States should pave the way for sweeping changes which will promote peace, progress and social prosperity."
"That concludes voting time."
"EU relations with Central Asia (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on the report by Mr Truscott and the recommendation by Mrs André-Léonard."
"Mr President, I would simply like to inform the House that this morning I said that some people had been arrested during the riots on 16 February, including Mrs Akedova, who is one of the leaders of a human rights association."
"I have just received a quite alarming telegram informing me that one thousand arrests have been made since then."
"As the Uzbek Ambassador is honouring us with his presence in the gallery, I would like him to be our messenger to Mr Karimov and to ask him for clemency for these one thousand people who have been arbitrarily arrested."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the two rapporteurs in this joint debate."
"I have been a member of the Central Asian Delegation for the last two years and was privileged to visit Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan with the European Parliament Delegation in May 1997."
"This is an exotic destination for Europeans with its image of the 'silk route'."
"I was particularly struck by the warmth and friendship for Europeans expressed by the people we met."
"We visited the Aral Sea and saw at first hand the environmental problems that exist."
"We also learned of the economic problems of those landlocked countries and the difficulties of transition from Soviet domination to independence and the change to a market economy."
"I have recently learned from the ambassadors at the last meeting that the problems have increased with the collapse of the Russian rouble."
"However, I must point out that there are considerable human rights problems in Central Asia as was vividly expressed by Mr Truscott this morning, although the extent of the problems varies from country to country."
"Consequently, although I give the interim agreements a cautious welcome I must ask that the Commission to remain vigilant on human rights and, whenever possible, continue to point out to the respective countries the need to observe human rights properly."
"I should like to congratulate Mr Truscott on his excellent work and on the way in which he has accommodated the various opinions which have been delivered."
"I had the honour of drafting the opinion of the Committee on External Economic Relations, and he took full account of the recommendations I made, which can really be summed up in one proposal."
"The Commission's proposals are very good, but we in the Committee on External Economic Relations would stress that they need to be incorporated into an overall policy, so that the infrastructure work, communications, pipelines, roads - everything that has been planned to help open up the countries of Central Asia and enable them to become part of a modern economy - will be dealt with all together rather than in isolation to create a genuine basis for their development."
"This proposal was accepted without amendment."
"The rapporteur said he was happy with it and the text before the House therefore takes due account of it."
"I think this is an excellent example of cooperation between different committees and rapporteurs, for which I should like to thank Mr Truscott once again."
"As chairman of Parliament's delegation for relations with these Central Asian states, I would like to sincerely congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mrs André-Léonard and Mr Truscott, as I have witnessed the excellent and, above all, meticulous work they have carried out."
"For my part, I have also seen that in some of these states, or in practically all of them, there is a clear lack of democracy and respect for human rights. If pressed, we can appreciate how difficult the transition to a free regime and a market economy can be."
"But I have always defended the theory that the important thing is that these countries did not stop working towards these freedoms, rather they were heading in the right direction to a greater or lesser degree."
"It would have been unfair to ask these countries to behave in the same way as our consolidated Western democracies."
"There has been a certain lack of understanding and it is clear that the development we wished to see is indeed taking place."
"It is perhaps slow, but it is happening nonetheless."
"I am therefore delighted to see that, in the text of the recommendation on Uzbekistan, the rapporteur explicitly welcomes the efforts made by the authorities there to strengthen democracy and respect for human rights. I am also pleased that the report by Mr Truscott welcomes the progress that has been made towards establishing a functioning democracy along the terms set out in the CSCE documents."
"Moreover, we must not forget that the guarantee of democracy also comes into play as soon as the corresponding partnership and cooperation agreements include a conditional clause linking such cooperation to democratic principles, human rights and the rules of the market economy."
"As regards developing these principles, the government of Uzbekistan has stressed that it is willing to make progress in this field. And as proof of this, it cites the fact that offices of the OSCE, Human Rights Watch and the Uzbekistan National Centre for Human Rights have already been opened and that an ombudsman has been appointed."
"What is more, an excessive delay in ratifying such an agreement could cause problems during the country's transition to democracy. And the importance of this country for Europe in terms of energy is very clear from a socioeconomic perspective."
"Therefore, Mr President, we support the recommendation and the report."
"Mr President, partnership agreements such as the ones we are discussing do have conditions attached."
"The countries that sign up to them must be prepared to tread the right path towards democracy and human rights."
"Ten years ago, no one knew where Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan or Kazakhstan were; perhaps if you had read the book 'The Courier of the Tsar' you might know where Central Asia began, but not where it ended."
"This is why I think it is a good thing that now, ten years after the Wall came down and what we called the Russian bear disappeared, we politicians can blithely say 'these countries are going to do this and this'."
"I therefore wholeheartedly endorse Mrs André-Léonard's report on the partnership agreement."
"We also support the Commission communication on the whole of Central Asia."
"The agreement on intensive human rights dialogue will be a way of both encouraging and checking up on the countries in question, which are to be actively monitored and advised."
"Should they relapse, we can always suspend the agreement, although I would not recommend this."
"We must be patient in view of their history and the ground they need to make up socially, for whatever reason."
"Some of us may have known where Uzbekistan was, but I find it a liberating experience to be able to find out about this huge area of our planet in this way."
"I should like to thank both rapporteurs."
"Mr President, may I say to my colleague Mr Bertens that we should not always judge others by our own standards."
"We have an important responsibility, which arose, of course, when the Wall came down, for the East and for ensuring that its difficult transformation process leads to the development of democracy and stability."
"For that reason, I am inclined to wonder about the real motive behind the interest of the European Union in close relations with the states of the East."
"When I examine the Commission documents, the Council statement and even the Truscott report, I begin to doubt whether the issue is really the stable development of these countries or whether it is all about their natural resources. Are we more interested in those countries' natural resources than in the future of their people?"
"That is why one of the key issues for me concerns the ways in which this partnership and cooperation agreement with Uzbekistan and comparable agreements with other states actually affect stability and the balanced social and economic development of these countries."
"I have my doubts there as far as the exploitation of natural resources is concerned."
"For that reason, I attach paramount importance to the human rights and democracy clause, because democracy is an absolutely categorical imperative if difficulties in the transformation process are to be properly overcome."
"The population must be involved; employees must have a say."
"For the second time today, I am led to wonder about the value of this human rights clause if there is no way of penalising violations of human rights, if such violations are simply condoned as before, and if the human rights clause cannot be used to guarantee the creation of genuinely democratic and stable structures in the country in question."
"So here is the situation: we have no clear division of powers, we have problems with free and fair elections, we have huge problems with freedom of the press, the death penalty is still on the statute book, we have criminal trials against opposition newspapers, against journalists, against interest groups and against demonstrators."
"That is the problem."
"To my mind, the question we have to ask the Commission once again is whether this agreement is really the answer, or should we not actually be doing far, far more for these countries?"
"That is why I think it prudent for us, before we ratify this agreement, to reconsider which measures are actually in place to stabilise this region."
"I should also like to remind the House that we also have an obligation under the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees."
"We must ensure that the requirements of that Convention are satisfied before we can recognise these states as reliable partners."
"The same clause is contained in the partnership and cooperation agreement."
"We cannot rubber-stamp the agreement before the proper conditions are created."
"Mr President, the new states of Central Asia are particularly fragile."
"Their populations are not homogenous."
"They cannot rely on state traditions as they are emerging states that up until now have only been Empire dependencies."
"They are used as a channel by the drug rings, and they have to assert their existence in a highly dangerous international environment."
"They are caught between Russia, which is the former dominant power and which still has a considerable interest in the area, Turkey, whose ambition is still to be the leader of a great, Turkish-speaking Central Asia, and Pakistan, which supports a plan for a great, fundamentalist Afghanistan, on the basis of the particularly dangerous tool of militant Islamism, just as Iran does."
"We must of course be vigilant with regard to respect for human rights in all regions, but if we judge these countries solely by normal human rights standards, we are in danger of condemning ourselves to powerlessness and ineffectiveness, which other countries such as the United States know how to avoid."
"We must be capable of looking beyond the rulers of the Soviet era who are still in place, the powerful mafias and the nomenklatura seeking to go on for ever."
"We must also take account of the encouraging fact that, apart from the tragic events in Tajikstan, these countries are not ravaged by civil wars and there is a tradition of secularism which could form a barrier against the spread of Islam."
"It is therefore better not to subject the implementation of partnership agreements with these countries to conditions that would deprive us of any form of influence."
"We have seen that postponing the agreements is ineffective."
"It would be more appropriate to provide ourselves with specific tools for action, which must be closely coordinated, under the auspices of the Council, with the Union's other instruments for external action and with the bilateral policies of the Member States."
"That, Mr President, is the price of effectiveness."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by ratifying the partnership and cooperation agreement between the EU and Uzbekistan, the European Parliament will send an encouraging signal to the Republic of Uzbekistan, which became an independent entity in 1991."
"It is a country that is suffering from the effects of the Russian crisis as well as having felt the full impact of the fall in raw material prices, as is rightly noted in this report."
"It must be recognised that the government of Uzbekistan has taken some steps to improve the human rights situation by admitting an observer from the OSCE and by appointing an ombudsman."
"The continuing existence of the death penalty and the atrocious conditions in the country's prisons, however, show that there is still a huge gap between our expectations and the situation on the ground."
"By conferring its approval, the European Parliament is also recognising the will of the government, which has at least been documented for the outside world, to improve the human rights situation in this part of Central Asia."
"The fact that the Commission report calls for Parliament to be presented with an annual report on democracy and human rights and for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy to be kept informed of developments is a sign that Uzbekistan has a long way to go before it can complete the process of democratisation and stabilisation."
"We still have grounds for concern, not only on account of the ethnic tensions that keep flaring up between Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, but also because of the Ferghana Valley, which has to be regarded as a potential trouble spot."
"The partition of the valley among three states after the collapse of the Soviet Union has fuelled ethnic conflicts."
"The region is far from having overcome the destabilisation and general economic depression that resulted from the partition of this valley, which was one of the most fertile and densely populated in the region."
"Another cause for concern is the fact that the Ferghana Valley, as well as being a tourist centre, is also a hotbed of drug trafficking and internationally organised crime and a breeding-ground for Islamic fundamentalism."
"The brutal bombings on 16 January of this year illustrate how tense the situation remains."
"Indeed, it was the most serious act of violence in Central Asia since Uzbekistan became independent."
"The way in which it was carried out suggests very thorough organisation, although the Karemov government has been anxious to play down the incident."
"We believe that stabilisation can only be achieved if the TACIS programmes are used in pursuit of specific targets and if the ethnic conflicts are defused."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the joint debate today highlights the particular importance that Parliament attaches to the issue of human rights in all the countries of Central Asia and particularly in Uzbekistan."
"The Commission welcomes the decision by your rapporteur, Mrs André-Léonard, to ratify the cooperation and partnership agreement with Uzbekistan."
"Continuing to veto this agreement would have penalised the country and would have had the involuntary yet negative effect of reducing the level of protection of human rights."
"It would also have had a negative effect on the process of transition to democracy, as Mr Camisón Asensio has just pointed out."
"Unlike the trade and cooperation agreement and the interim agreement that have been applied up until now to bilateral relations between the Union and Uzbekistan, this new partnership and cooperation agreement will enable us to directly tackle the issue of human rights through political dialogue."
"This partnership agreement will provide a structural framework for political dialogue and will also cover economic, commercial and cultural matters."
"In answer to your rapporteur, Mrs André-Léonard, I can confirm that Mr van den Broek is committed to discussing the issue of human rights at the various bilateral meetings, and particularly during his next visit to Tashkent at the end of March."
"He will report back to you on this, as you requested this morning, Mrs André-Léonard."
"Uzbekistan is currently experiencing difficult times, as Mr Rübig reminded us a moment ago."
"From an economic point of view, the fall in the price of cotton - which is its main export in terms of raw materials - is largely responsible for the deterioration in its balance of trade."
"From a political point of view, the wave of explosive attacks on Tashkent demonstrates the fragility and sensitivity of the situation on the ground."
"Mr van den Broek immediately wrote to the President of Uzbekistan to offer his condolences to the families of the victims, but also to remind him that the legitimate search for the perpetrators of the attacks should be carried out with full respect for individual rights."
"Mrs André Léonard, a moment ago, you mentioned that the Uzbek Ambassador was here to listen to your debates and I would like to welcome him this evening."
"Allow me, on behalf of the Commission, to reiterate the appeal you made to him."
"Despite these problems, the Uzbek Government is working to step up the economic reforms and to improve the protection of human rights."
"The recent contacts that we have had with the authorities have highlighted their determination to continue along this path."
"Secondly, I would like to comment on Mr Truscott's report."
"This report relates to the 1995 Commission communication and also focuses on the issue of human rights."
"In particular, it draws a comparison between all the Central Asian republics and the Commission shares your rapporteur's concerns."
"However, I would like to point out that, as in the case of Uzbekistan, all the partnership and cooperation agreements provide the legal framework and, in my opinion, a basis and an appropriate structure to look at the issue of human rights with the countries concerned."
"This is the reason behind the political dialogue, which, for the first time in the Union's bilateral relations with these countries, is officially laid down in each agreement."
"Mr van den Broek will keep you closely informed of the development of the situation in the area, as Mr Truscott also requested this morning."
"Furthermore, in relation to Uzbekistan, but also in relation to Kazakhstan and Kyrghyzstan, the 1998-1999 national TACIS programmes envisage projects that will facilitate the implementation of these partnership and cooperation agreements."
"In this respect, the Commission has made it clear that the priority is to promote democracy within the society, including by helping with the preparation of elections."
"Moreover, in the context of these partnership and cooperation agreements, a parliamentary cooperation committee will be set up for each country."
"This will allow for direct discussions between the representatives of the parliaments of each of the Central Asian republics and the European Parliament."
"In this way, Parliament will itself be able to bring up the issue of the protection of human rights in an appropriate context and increase its control over the bilateral relations between the Union and the Central Asian countries."
"Thank you, Mr de Silguy."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"Community Customs Code"
"The next item is the report (A4-0080/99) by Mr Paasilinna, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (COM(98)0226 - C4-0370/98-98/0134(COD))."
"I give the floor to the rapporteur, Mr Paasilinna."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are here to discuss a Commission proposal to change the basic regulation governing the Community Customs Code."
"The Commission's aim has been to simplify and rationalise the customs regulation, which is certainly justified, as it contains a total of 253 articles and innumerable subparagraphs and repeals at least 28 legal instruments in use before the regulation came into force."
"This jungle of legislation has sprouted such an impenetrable thicket of clauses and paragraphs that presumably only a few people in the Union have a complete command of its content."
"However the proposal still does not manage to any significant extent to fulfill the Commission's objectives to clarify the rules, which is unfortunate."
"To keep legislation complicated and abstruse is to wield power: when people are unable to understand laws they must obey, power falls into the hands of those professionally equipped to interpret the law."
"As Parliament will not now approve all the proposals, the matter will obviously be dealt with later by the Conciliation Committee, possibly while Finland holds the presidency."
"The Customs Code has a significant impact on Community trade policy, especially agricultural policy, where traditional agricultural taxation has in fact become customs duty."
"The Code likewise affects indirect taxation, because it is still used to apply VAT to products imported from third countries."
"Furthermore, the rules affect Community anti-fraud policy in the context of the transit system, as security factors have now been included in the rules to be applied."
"The Code is also a tool for compiling trade statistics, and it therefore affects statistics on foreign trade."
"I have amended the Commission's proposal concerning the use of data-processing techniques for making customs declarations."
"My amendment has been approved by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, and I hope that it will also be approved here in the House."
"In my own country, as in many other Member States, it is important that the use of electronic customs declarations should be established once and for all, and accompanying documents should also not be submitted in paper form."
"Using electronic media will speed up the work of the customs authorities and make it more effective."
"One very serious problem in the European Union is that the customs authorities in the different Member States are still not in full, real-time contact with one another."
"On the other hand, it would appear that our adversaries, that is to say the criminals, are quite capable of keeping in contact."
"I would therefore ask the Commission what stage the computerisation of the customs declaration system has reached, to make it less likely to be breached than is the case today."
"With customs clearance, as with electronic commerce, for example, the parallel churning out of hard-copy documentation is harming the electronic system and preventing its development as part of the move towards rationalisation, efficiency and sustainability."
"I also did not agree with the Commission's proposal in relation to Article 5 on direct and indirect representation to customs agents."
"According to estimates, this would mean that some twenty thousand customs agents would lose their jobs, and, furthermore, there would be less reliability and more fraud, especially in southern Member States."
"The committee agreed with me on this."
"I would ask you to look especially closely at Amendment No 13."
"I still propose the addition of a new Article 1(21a), as supported by my group in my original proposal."
"It relates to the ultimate origin of goods in relation to preferential status, and the question of bona fide operations."
"In it I propose that if a certificate issued by the authorities of a non-member country proves to be incorrect, no tax penalty should be imposed solely on the importer acting in good faith."
"My proposed amendment will make the situation easier for labour-intensive SMEs, especially, and will allow the risk to be distributed."
"It was a close result, but the committee voted to grant extremely broad protection to the importer, with the consequence that the Community, to which revenue is due, would have to bear the whole risk rather than it being fairly distributed."
"Now I have discovered that Mrs Peijs, who tabled Amendment No 9 which was approved by the committee, is withdrawing it, so we can now support this new article which I have just described and which is, I believe, a sufficiently good compromise between the Commission's proposal and Mrs Peijs's amendment."
"If the Community loses resources as a result of criminal activity, it is obviously always the taxpayers in the Member States who will have to make good the shortfall in the end."
"For this reason the Community must have the means to intervene in criminal operations or abuse on the part of exporters and the authorities in exporting countries."
"Mr President, the Community Customs Code is instrumental in the Union's commercial policy and is an essential tool in completing the internal market and in protecting the EU's financial interests."
"There is no doubt that we must continue to revise customs regulations and procedures and to adapt them to the new situations that arise. In this way, we will eliminate possible judicial or procedural gaps."
"If there is a new situation that emphasises the need to amend the present Code, then it is without doubt the gradual growth of the Community's trade. This growth is due to the progressive opening up of the markets and developments in the information society."
"These are changes that require the Code to be updated with a view to simplifying and streamlining it so that it is more in step with the new realities. Therefore, the Committee on External Economic Relations welcomes the Commission's proposal for amendment as it agrees with its philosophy."
"However, its specific content is far removed from the measures proposed."
"The Commission realises that wanting to improve efficiency is not enough and that a better balance must also be guaranteed between the much-needed simplification and modernisation of procedures it proposes and the fight against fraud."
"In fact, in the context of the gradual liberalisation of the markets and taking into account the system of preferences the Union has established with many third countries, and with the ACP countries in particular, it is all the more vital to have legal instruments available to help combat forgery and fraud. And we must also ensure that the rules of origin are applied, particularly where preferential and non-preferential rules are concerned."
"At the same time, and in view of the abolition of customs barriers between Member States due to the completion of the internal market, it is all the more essential to establish effective control measures that guarantee the uniform application of customs procedures throughout the Community. In this way, we will avoid any gaps that might encourage fraud and crime."
"However, the Commission's text does not contain any proposals that take these aspects into consideration, aspects that could be of the utmost importance."
"To fill in the gaps, I have tabled two amendments, Amendment Nos 14 and 15, that include the conclusions of the opinion that the Committee on External Economic Relations approved unanimously. And I should like to bring these amendments to the attention of the House and the Commission and ask you to vote in favour of them."
"In fact, what we are discussing here is allowing goods declarations to be submitted in electronic form. Nonetheless, we are still maintaining the obligation - and I do mean the obligation - for all goods declarations that are submitted electronically to be accompanied by the relevant supporting documents, which may also be submitted in electronic form."
"In addition, we are discussing the idea that customs authorities must adopt control measures to guarantee the correct and uniform application of Community rules throughout the Union."
"It is only in doing this that we will be able to implement genuinely effective control measures to combat all fraud and forgery."
"In accepting these amendments, we will not only send out an unmistakeable signal from the Union on the fight against fraud; we will also help improve the competitiveness of businesses and, as a result, promote economic growth and job creation within the Community."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to express my appreciation of Mr Paasilinna's report and my gratitude for the inclusion of many amendments that were proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"In our opinion, the Commission is seeking to transfer too many legislative powers to the committee."
"It is gratifying that both of our committees want to change that."
"Having said that, I should like to focus the remainder of my remarks on one point, a point which, in my view and in the view of the Committee on Budgetary Control, relates to an extremely serious problem."
"More than 50 % of all goods imported into the European Union are subject to what are known as preferential tariff arrangements."
"Certificates of origin must be presented for all these goods."
"There is undoubtedly a temptation to present false certificates with a view to paying as little customs duty as possible."
"These manipulations do not only defraud the Union of budgetary resources; they are naturally perpetrated at the expense of honest producers and importers too."
"When such manipulations occur, the Community Customs Code provides for the possibility of waiving the liability to customs duty if the exporter has been dealt with in good faith."
"Two of the rapporteur's amendments - No 9 and No 13 - relate to this point."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control, though grateful for the adoption of several of its own amendments, feels that these two amendments run directly counter to its interests."
"They are formulated in excessively lax or generalised terms."
"If they were adopted with this wording, all importers or exporters - whether Amendment No 9 only refers to exporters and Amendment No 13 only to importers - would be able to assert that they had acted in good faith."
"That is too lax, it is too dangerous, especially since our fraud prevention unit UCLAF has to cover the entire European Union with only a small number of officials to investigate suspicious cases."
"The risk of being convicted for a false declaration is too slight."
"I would therefore ask the rapporteur to reconsider his Amendments Nos 9 and 13 and to withdraw them if possible, otherwise he will be opening the doors to fraud on an even grander scale."
"Besides, we have information that the Council and the Commission are working on a more precise form of wording to define what good faith is and what may not be regarded as good faith."
"The future blacklists may also be seen in connection with the certificates of origin."
"I therefore strongly recommend that Amendments Nos 9 and 13 should be reconsidered and, if possible, withdrawn."
"We cannot subscribe to them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1997 alone, a total of ECU 13.6 million was collected in customs duties."
"That corresponds to 86.4 % of the Union's traditional own resources."
"It is a well-known fact that customs duties constitute the only real tax revenue in the EU budget."
"The current debate on net contributors and recipients underlines the importance of applying the Community customs system effectively and efficiently."
"For that reason, we are very favourably disposed to the report before us."
"It must also be said, however, that legal stipulations naturally have to apply in equal measure to import checks and export checks. It is surely illogical to make a distinction."
"The crux of the matter, however, concerns the liability for erroneous certification of the origin of a product."
"The question is whether the European importer or the exporter from outside the EU is liable for the appearance on a certificate of origin of false information resulting from an error by the overseas authorities."
"We believe that efforts should be made to introduce the proposed electronic procedures at an early date and to ensure that they are efficient and, above all, easy to set up, because to my mind the current proposal is too complicated."
"A distinction should also be made between sensitive goods and normal or mixed cargoes, because detailed checks are most probably impracticable in such cases."
"It is conceivable that these mistakes could be caused by errors made by the exporting companies or by the authorities of non-EU states, but they could also be the result of fraudulent transactions."
"That is why care should be taken to design forgery-proof documents, to use rubber stamps with various unknown colours of ink, to introduce digital signatures and in particular to ensure that a note is made of the departure time of consignments and their destination, so that customs checks can reveal precisely when the goods left and where they were delivered and so that any discrepancies in the timings can be very efficiently investigated."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, for its part, is proposing that importers should only be held liable if they are found to be personally responsible in whole or in part for the production of false certificates of origin."
"If, however, the certificates of origin are falsified as a result of malpractice on the part of the exporter or the foreign authorities, any importer who has observed the rules must be excluded from liability."
"If we had a sensible set of rules, we could rid the trading system of an enormous additional burden."
"The importer must be able to rely on the authenticity of a certificate."
"It is up to the politicians to organise the system accordingly."
"It would be unreasonable to require importers to conduct their own investigations, particularly in cases where there is no reason to doubt the authenticity of the certificate."
"Mr President, with a proposal that is incomprehensible and totally without foundation, the Commission is seeking to amend Article 5 of the Community Customs Code in a way that we believe will be the death knell for a sector which is already suffering unemployment and underemployment."
"It should be noted that in 1993, with the abolition of internal borders, this particular sector suffered job losses in excess of 80 or 85 %."
"The Commission is now proposing to abolish the alternative possibility available to each Member State to make its own choice between direct or indirect customs representation, according to its financial needs."
"This possibility was established several decades ago, it has stood the test of time, and it has been shown to function smoothly, since it gives each Member State the opportunity to take into account the particular aspects of its own customs area and to promote the proper, responsible, speedy and cost-effective handling of customs operations."
"The duties of customs agents demand technical expertise and require an in-depth knowledge of customs legislation to enable customs agents to categorise goods according to their customs classification and to determine the level of duties and taxes."
"Because of the criteria for entry into the profession and the personal qualities required - professional ability, reliability and presence of mind - customs agents are now on a par with those who work in the customs authority. They contribute to combating fraud and help to ensure a swift flow of traffic through the timely release of goods."
"They also reduce the cost of storage and distribution of goods, to the benefit both of competitiveness and the smooth flow of external trade."
"The Commission is invoking the argument of reduced competition and the infringement of the principle of freedom to provide services."
"However, this is an unfounded argument, because on the one hand, customs agents are self-employed, they do not have a collective tariff, and they are in competition with each other. On the other hand, the users of customs services can either carry out the necessary formalities with the customs authorities themselves, or they can be represented by a method which, in accordance with national legislation, is not the sole prerogative of customs agents."
"The arguments deployed by the Commission are fanciful, untenable and arbitrary."
"There is not a single quantitative study to support its curious claims."
"The report by Mr Paasilinna, whom I congratulate on his work, convincingly refutes the claims of the Commission."
"We shall vote in favour of it."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Paasilinna."
"The report shows that the customs union remains at the centre of the political debate: that should come as no surprise, because objectives such as the simplification of formalities, legal certainty for operators and safeguarding the Community's financial interests, on which everyone is agreed in theory, can still be viewed differently when it actually comes to applying them."
"I must also say that the debate has in addition been fuelled by a major problem of an institutional nature, one that threatens to deprive the Community, in the immediate future at least, of the drive for reform which is needed in relation to specific policies and, more particularly, the customs union."
"The Community Customs Code is one of the pillars - the most important of all - that will help secure uniform administrative action within the limits dictated by the principle of subsidiarity."
"Views can differ on this."
"As far as the Commission is concerned, achieving uniform administrative measures in relation to customs, to guarantee effectiveness and efficiency, frequently proves difficult, not only because of the limited resources available to the Commission but also, and above all, because the Member States remain sovereign with regard to the application of the Community rules."
"That is the result of an excessively rigid and formalistic interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity, as Parliament was able to see for itself in the debates on the Customs 2000 programme."
"I must add that, as a result of this situation, the Commission is frequently the butt of criticism, which is understandable but sometimes rather unfair, because it is alleged to be incapable of securing adequate customs controls."
"While it is true that expectations often exceed the possibilities open to the Commission, it should also at least be recognised that the Commission itself has to be given the instruments it needs to make the Customs Code into an effective framework, in particular by adopting implementing rules that are clear and effective, albeit in a very limited context."
"Only in the light of that framework, Mr President, is it possible to understand some of the differences in opinion that are emerging as we assess what the outcome of the process of amending the Customs Code should be."
"Turning now to our position on the amendments, on Amendment No 1, the Commission is able to accept only that the limits set in some Member States for direct representation to be used to meet customs formalities should be compatible with the objectives of a single market."
"The Commission does, however, recognise that a period of transition may be needed; however, what I said a few moments ago means that we are unable to take on board Amendment No 11."
"Amendment No 2 does not pose any problem, and nor does the first part of Amendment No 3."
"However, there is one thing worrying the Commission: if it is left to the discretion of the Member States to decide whether the documents accompanying the customs declaration should be submitted to or merely kept at the disposal of the customs authorities, we may find administrative practice varying from one state to another."
"That part of Amendment No 3 is therefore not acceptable; on the other hand, Amendment No 14, which shares the same objective, cannot be accepted because it is irrelevant."
"In practice, the first part of that amendment reiterates what is contained in the current text of the code, and the second part is identical to the amendment put forward by the Commission."
"Moving on to Amendments Nos 4 to 8 and 12, which are linked to the reform of the economic conditions under the customs regimes, the Commission is able to accept Amendments Nos 6 and 12, but cannot set aside its proposal, as required under Amendment No 4."
"The Commission can, however, clarify the wording of its initial proposal."
"Amendments Nos 5 and 7 are unacceptable because they would prevent the Commission from getting rid of a bureaucratic obstacle when examining the economic conditions."
"Amendment No 8 fails to take account of the fact that the Commission has itself proposed deleting another provision: if both were deleted, we would be left with a clear legal vacuum; that amendment is therefore not acceptable."
"Amendments Nos 9 and 13 concern the issue of the good faith of the economic operators."
"The Commission has followed closely the work of the House in this area and generally agrees with its objective, that is to say to find a solution which helps the importer by apportioning more equitably the risk that a certificate may not be valid."
"Amendment No 9 has been withdrawn, and the Commission would not, in any event, have been able to accept it."
"However, Amendment No 13 seems to us a better indicator of how to find a more appropriate and balanced solution to the problem of the responsibility of economic operators."
"In that sense, Amendment No 13 may be considered a positive contribution and, therefore, the Commission could accept it as the basis for a more extensive revision of Article 220."
"We therefore intend presenting, in the revised proposal following the vote in the House, a new version of Article 220 to provide a better balance between the responsibilities of importers, exporters, third country authorities and the Community customs authorities responsible for assessing whether the parties have acted in good faith."
"Again in relation to the responsibilities of economic operators, the Commission believes that reducing the period of limitation from three to two years would mark significant progress in enhancing legal certainty for honest operators."
"Unfortunately, Amendment No 10 stands in the way of that."
"Removal of that section of the Commission proposal is also likely to deprive us of the possibility of taking interim measures."
"The Commission therefore feels unable to accept the amendment."
"Turning, finally, to Amendment No 15, the Commission considers that the aim of that amendment, that is to say adequate controls, cannot be defined in theoretical terms in the Customs Code, but must be related to specific aspects, good faith for instance, or the risk element."
"For that reason, the Commission does not consider the amendment acceptable and believes that it would be more relevant in relation to anti-fraud legislation."
"In once again extending my thanks to Mr Paasilinna, I wish to take just a moment to respond to his question concerning the national information systems."
"As you will be aware, the Commission has set up the Common Communication Network - Common Systems Interface, known as CCN-CSI, to enable the national systems to communicate with each other and with the systems set up by the Commission itself."
"That platform will also be used in the context of the new information transit system which will come into operation at the end of this year between the five partners taking part in it, that is to say Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Switzerland."
"Let me end by inviting those honourable Members who are interested to take part in a demonstration of the system on 31 March."
"Thank you, Mr Monti."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I see that we have a large group of young Europeans in the gallery."
"I should like to welcome them and thank them for coming. I should also like to say that this is where, from one day to the next, we do our modest work in the hope that, when they are a little older, they will find a Europe of peace, of people living peacefully together and a Europe of social justice."
"Once again, welcome to Parliament."
"Applause"
"Protection of inventions by utility model"
"The next item is the report (A4-0096/99) by Mr Añoveros Trias de Bes, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive approximating the legal arrangements for the protection of inventions by utility model (COM(97)0691 - C4-0676/97-97/0356(COD))."
"I give the floor to the rapporteur, Mr Añoveros Trias de Bes."
"Mr President, legislation has been adopted in all areas of industrial property in the European Union except in the case of utility models."
"The fact that utility models exist allows small technical advances that aid the human race to also benefit their creators, even though the level of invention does not warrant as much protection as under a patent."
"The utility model is especially useful for both individual inventors and for small undertakings."
"What is more, the existence of an instrument providing an alternative for minor inventions means that the level of invention required can be interpreted more strictly."
"The Commission has opted for harmonisation and has put forward a proposal for a directive that valiantly tackles the delicate task of approximating twelve laws with many different points and introducing legislation in three countries that do not have this system."
"This proposal adopts three of the classic requirements in the protection of inventions: novelty, level of invention and industrial advantage."
"However, the requirement that utility models must include a practical or technical advantage has been overlooked, despite this being an essential and inevitable part of their nature."
"This requirement clarifies the distinction between the utility model and the design or trademark with a view to preventing those who might infringe the utility model from sidestepping protection by means of superficial alterations to the designs that would enable them to copy technical innovations from its component parts."
"We propose defining the utility model by reference to a structure, a mechanism or a configuration."
"This means that the inventor only has to put forward a structure which has an industrial advantage, using a quick and simple procedure with minimum legal certainty."
"This would also mean excluding substances and processes from protection, as the Economic and Social Committee has also proposed."
"The lower level of legal certainty offered by the utility model compared to the patent is the price that has to be paid for the speed and lower cost of the utility model."
"In our report, we suggest a series of measures to add to the Commission's proposal in order to improve the degree of legal certainty of the model without harming the speed and lower cost of obtaining this instrument."
"The measures I propose are mainly contained in the amendments. And naturally, they go along the lines that, although the level of invention or the creative input is not the same as for a patent, a mere declaration of the level of invention from the applicant will not suffice."
"Therefore, as a first step, we propose that the definition from the European Patents Convention be adopted but in a less strict form than required by the Convention."
"Another measure is to introduce the opposition procedure to swiftly settle disputes concerning utility models."
"We should also promote those involved to draw up a search report, which is compulsory in the event of legal proceedings being undertaken."
"We must improve protection conditions and use them for reference. Further, as a last step, we believe that there should be an additional ground for revocation where the proprietor of the utility model was not entitled to obtain it."
"This new ground revokes the registration and not the invention itself, which is valid and can be protected if the inventor or his successor submits the applications."
"Therefore, Commissioner, in spite of my aim to add these measures, I agree with the Commission on many fundamental aspects."
"We believe that a lower level of invention should be required in comparison to patents and that no formal verification of the substantive requirements should be necessary."
"We have readily accepted the amendments by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs but I must also say - as I see my colleague Mrs Oddy is here - that I rejected her amendments, Amendments Nos 34 and 35, in committee. However, they have now also been tabled by another colleague, Mrs Thors, and having studied them in detail, I intend to accept them."
"Lastly, I should like to point out that the duration of a utility model is shorter than that of a patent."
"We agree with a maximum protection period of ten years, which is the same as most countries. As a result, we propose that no renewal should be granted - if requested by the search report - as a deterrent against an excessive duration and, at the same time, as a way of strengthening legal certainty and improving information."
"Mr President, at this time of night we are not here to debate complex issues but I should like to begin at the end."
"And I am doing so because the rapporteur has now generously accepted the amendments that were tabled by Mrs Oddy, who is one of my colleagues in the Socialist Group and a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights and that are now tabled by the Liberal Members, Mrs Thors and Mrs Riis-Jørgensen. These two amendments refer to games and toys and it is a shame that the visitors who were here earlier have left because this affects them directly."
"I say this as I believe that perhaps one of the innovations Parliament could introduce is to also allow games to be utility models and to be protected."
"And I am disappointed that our visitors left - I think the President frightened them somewhat - as they would probably be able to help us and submit a utility model."
"Perhaps, in doing so, they could use the method the rapporteur is now proposing, although we will naturally have to find out what the Commission intends to do in this respect."
"We have to find out what one-stop shopping is; it is a term we are used to in Spain but for different reasons."
"Here, we are talking about a different sort of one-stop shopping, but the idea is that if someone submits a utility model in an EU country, then this model should be recognised throughout the entire Community."
"In this respect, the rapporteur is attempting to go slightly further than normal legislative work, because the Commission's Green Paper only talked of three stages: firstly, harmonisation; then mutual recognition by the Member States; and lastly, regulations."
"We still have not reached the stage of a uniform Community regulation but we could take another small step towards this stage."
"It would be very interesting to know what the Commission thinks of this."
"I should like to ask Commissioner Monti if he believes that, in the short term and on the basis of the proposals Parliament is making here, the Commission could establish this one-stop shopping procedure in such a way so as to ensure that if an inventive young person discovers an interesting toy, he can go to one EU country alone and, using this one-stop shopping procedure, be assured that his game will be recognised throughout the Community."
"My colleague, Mr Añoveros Trias de Bes, is a colleague in two senses of the word: both as a Member of this House and as a professor of international law."
"And it is clear that he has done some extraordinary work and that this is an excellent analytical and well researched report."
"At an academic symposium, I would probably argue with him over a few points, because there will always be reasons for disagreement, but I believe that he has done some exceptional analytical work."
"For example, he has paid great attention to the definition of invention, and what invention involves."
"This is an issue that could lead to a lengthy discussion, as could the definition of the utility model based on a structure or configuration but not on a substance or specific procedure."
"However, at this time of night, these issues are probably of little interest to the Members and I only wish to say that the Socialist Group supports the amendments by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights as well as the two amendments tabled by the Liberal Group."
"Thank you very much, Mr Medina Ortega."
"I do not believe that I frightened our young European visitors with my warm words."
"But you may well be right in that young people are very intuitive and they may have guessed that I am a paediatrician, which may be what frightened them off."
"In any case, I did not intend to alarm them but to simply give them a warm welcome to this House."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the utility model is a means of protection used in one form or another by most European countries, with the notable exception of Germany and France."
"Given that these various certificates exist, it was indeed right to try to harmonise them."
"We are therefore entirely in favour of the harmonisation of the legal provisions involved."
"The rapporteur's proposal is of a very high standard, as is always the case with Mr Aoveros."
"Nevertheless, I have certain questions surrounding what seem to be inaccuracies."
"One example of this is Amendment No 10, which proposes a definition of invention that we believe to be somewhat broad and imprecise."
"Also, the procedures for the one-stop shop should perhaps be clarified."
"Is it a solely declarative procedure?"
"On what elements is mutual recognition based?"
"What linguistic rules will be applied?"
"The rapporteur envisages a 50 % reduction in taxes for SMEs, individuals and universities."
"This is a very good measure, as the utility model must be economical, especially for SMEs."
"I think that it would be particularly beneficial if all the taxes were so low that there was no need to reduce them."
"Mr President, I welcome this report and congratulate the rapporteur on his work."
"This proposed directive introduces the right to register a utility model."
"This is a less-developed right than that which would qualify for a patent."
"This right does not currently exist in all Member States."
"For example, in the United Kingdom - my own country - this concept does not exist and consequently inventors can only register patents."
"To register a patent, more research is needed, and higher standards of development."
"The advantage of registering a utility model, as opposed to a patent, is that it is a quicker, cheaper and more simple procedure."
"It is therefore to be welcomed."
"I thank the rapporteur for accepting my amendment, tabled in committee, and now taken up by Mrs Thors, as this will assist the European toy industry and will be of great interest for Europe's younger citizens."
"I have received some letters of concern from interested parties that the Commission proposal, as drafted, is a little too lax."
"The rapporteur has addressed these concerns by introducing requirements for searches before litigation and before the life of the utility model can be extended beyond six years."
"I support these proposals and again thank the rapporteur for his diligent work."
"I must congratulate Mr Añoveros Trias de Bes on the quality of his report."
"I welcome the fact that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizen's Rights has not queried the Commission approach to this dossier and that the features of utility models, as set out in the proposal for a directive, have been retained. These are: an inventive step lesser than required for trade marks, no preliminary examination of the conditions of merit, and a period of protection limited to ten years."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs has adopted 33 amendments, and the Commission is able to accept 24 of them, but five of that number in part only."
"We in fact think that these amendments clarify and better define some aspects of the proposal."
"I am referring more particularly here to Amendments Nos 4 and 33, which provide for the directive to be monitored by the Commission."
"That will allow us to assess the practical operation of the directive and to fill in any gaps three years after the directive has been incorporated by the Member States."
"The Commission cannot, however, accept nine amendments, including Amendments Nos 1, 6 in part and 13 concerning the introduction of a one-stop shopping procedure."
"I well understand what motivates these amendments, but introducing a procedure of that nature goes beyond the objective of this proposal for a directive, which is to align the national provisions on utility models which have a more direct impact on the operation of the single market."
"Moreover, that sort of procedure would raise a number of problems at a legal and a practical level without resolving the problems of transfer, but would not appear to respond to any of the needs voiced by the relevant economic groups."
"Amendment No 18, which provides for the introduction of an opposition procedure, also goes beyond the limits of the kind of harmonisation the directive is meant to achieve."
"This is a procedural issue that must be left to the assessment of the Member States, in accordance with the principle of proportionality."
"Moreover, no such proposal has ever been tabled in the discussions of the groups of experts in the Council."
"However, Mr Medina Ortega, as in the case of the earlier amendments, the possibility of introducing an opposition procedure could be considered as part of the monitoring provided for in the directive itself."
"Other amendments also raise problems: I am referring here to parts of Amendments Nos 2, 6 and 8 and the whole of Amendments Nos 23 and 24 which relate, directly or indirectly, to the scope of the directive."
"These amendments are designed to exclude substances and processes from the scope of the directive."
"I would draw your attention to the fact that excluding substances and processes from protection by utility model harks back to a now outdated view."
"The consultation set under way with the 1995 Green Paper showed that most of the groups concerned were in favour of including substances and processes."
"The three-dimensional requirement, which therefore excludes protection of substances and processes, is a step backwards in Member States' legislation."
"Currently, only four Member States regard three-dimensional format as a condition of obtaining protection by utility model."
"For those reasons, the Commission is unable to take on board these amendments."
"Nor can we accept Amendment No 12, which provides for a reduction in fees for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I absolutely appreciate the concerns reflected in that amendment, but a provision of that nature cannot be included in a harmonising directive, as it would have financial implications for the Member States disproportionate to the aim of the directive."
"It might be possible to introduce a recital mirroring the concept which underpins that amendment."
"There are other amendments which the Commission is unable to accept: Amendment No 15 which provides, in addition to control a posteriori , control a priori of the exemptions, cannot be accepted because it calls into question the fact that there is no formal examination of the conditions of protection; nor can we accept part of Amendments Nos 6 and 10 or the whole of Amendment No 16, which put forward practical or technical advantage as an additional condition for obtaining protection."
"That would introduce a new requirement, whereas technical or practical advantage must be considered as simply justifying inventive activity."
"Nor are we able to accept Amendment No 30, which provides that applications for utility models are invalid if the owner was not entitled to the utility model, since the invention could no longer be considered to be new; rather than making it invalid, it would be appropriate to make provision, in cases of that kind, for the right to be transferred to the genuine inventor."
"I should like to end by mentioning the amendments tabled during this part-session: the Commission can, in principle, accept Amendments Nos 34 and 35, both of which are designed to allow full and equal legal protection for games and toys by utility models: in particular, by deleting the word 'game' in Article 3(2)(c), Amendment No 34 will place games and toys on an equal footing for the purposes of protection by utility model;"
"Amendment No 35 reflects the same need in its Article 6 which relates to the criteria for defining inventive activity."
"But Amendment No 35, although, as I have said, acceptable in principle, needs to be worded differently in the Commission's view."
"I think, Mr President, that if, as we had all hoped, our young Europeans had waited until now, they might perhaps have understood that we were discussing games and toys, albeit, I regret to say, in rather complicated technical terms."
"Thank you, Mr Monti."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"Social protection in Europe"
"The next item is the report (A4-0099/99) by Mr Pronk, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the report from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Social protection in Europe (1997) - Executive summary (COM(98)0243 - C4-0375/98)."
"I give the floor to the rapporteur, Mr Pronk."
"Mr President, I know that Mr Flynn cannot be here this evening because of an urgent appointment, although the report does, of course, come under his portfolio."
"But I am very pleased that Commissioner Monti is here, because I must admit that his work in this field was part of the inspiration for our report."
"There are certain parallels between the fields of social security and taxation, firstly because a substantial proportion of social security is paid for out of tax revenue, secondly because people often regard social security contributions as taxes, and thirdly, and most importantly, because under the Amsterdam Treaty both can only be changed by a unanimous decision."
"So it is good to see the laborious but constant progress that the Commissioner has made in the field of taxation."
"We welcome the Commission's report on social security."
"The social security system was a response to the social question that arose at the end of the last century, and now, a century later, we can see that the problems associated with it have still not been resolved."
"However, social security has proved to be an important instrument for adapting the 19th century market economy to the needs of social justice."
"If we look at the figures we can see that, at 28.5 %, social security and social protection account for a considerable proportion of Europe's GDP."
"Millions of people in the European Union depend on unemployment benefits, invalidity benefits, pensions and health-care schemes."
"The Union's prosperity has also advanced thanks to this comprehensive system which provides help in times of difficulty, need and crisis."
"The Council of Ministers delivered a recommendation in 1992 on the convergence of social protection objectives and policies, and I have therefore included a number of recommendations in my report to promote greater convergence."
"I call on the Commission to put forward an action plan which should include the following: the criteria for a benchmarking process in the area of social security; secondly, a code of conduct for avoiding harmful competition via social security systems; thirdly, precise figures for the economic damage arising from the evasion of social security contributions; fourthly, proposals for minimum standards based on the Amsterdam Treaty for certain areas of social protection; and fifth, the determination of a poverty line in order to establish an acceptable minimum income."
"There are two points I would like to enlarge on."
"The first is the benchmarking process."
"Following the example of the European employment strategy - another successful element in the European Union's social and economic policy - and the criteria for economic and monetary union, comparisons must be made between the Member States."
"Benchmarking can help the Member States to make decisions in order to develop a sound and decent social protection system, particularly now when a number of factors are placing increasing pressure on the system, such as the growth in the number of people of retirement age and the number of one-person households."
"Both of these groups tend to be very dependent on the social security system."
"The second point I wish to enlarge on is the idea of producing figures on the economic damage arising from the evasion of social security contributions."
"In my view, this is something that is often sidelined as unimportant and therefore negligible, and people tend to think that only small sums are involved."
"Yet I have never seen any figures to prove this scientifically."
"The evasion of contribution payments affects something else on which the European social model stands or falls, and that is solidarity."
"Mr President, I do not have much time left, and social security is something we could talk about at length."
"I know that there are a number of others who wish to speak in this debate."
"I would like to thank everyone for enabling us to reach a consensus, and I hope that this report will be adopted."
"Above all, I hope that the Commission will be able to use it to produce a policy for convergence."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me at the start of this debate to express my regret at the resignation a few hours ago of the German Finance Minister."
"I am saying this in the context of the present discussion, because in Oskar Lafontaine we had found a comrade-in-arms, one of the few European politicians who was far-sighted enough to recognise and defend the European dimension at all times."
"You especially, Commissioner Monti, will understand my response to this news, because Mr Lafontaine had begun to implement the proposal you made quite some time ago on the reduction of non-wage labour costs as a means of making labour a less expensive production factor."
"Many aspects of social protection in Europe, of course, are still not given nearly enough consideration in terms of their European dimension in many Member States."
"Politicians are still far happier to discuss them in the small provincial forum of national politics and fail to realise that the people of our countries, the workforce, have long come to expect European action too in this domain."
"The Socialist Group supports Mr Pronk's report, partly because it provides good continuity from the first two reports which we adopted here in the Chamber and for which I had the pleasure of doing the preparatory work and formulating the conclusions."
"I also find it right and proper that Mr Pronk has not endorsed everything the Commission has proposed, since there were certainly some points in the report of which we were highly critical in the committee."
"I shall only mention one of the proposals which I believe is unacceptable in its present form: in connection with the need to cut health service costs, you have proposed more direct contributions by patients towards the cost of services."
"I believe that would be a very one-sided perspective, and we shall naturally be unable to adopt everything as it stands."
"Mr Pronk dealt with several areas in detail."
"I intend to confine myself to a few points that seem to me to be very important, such as proposals on a flexible transition to retirement and consultation between management and labour on such matters."
"In many Member States, employers have been far too ready to discard older workers by means of systematic early retirement."
"That will certainly have to be made more flexible."
"In addition, we shall have to pay more serious attention than has been given in the past to the need for women to be accorded equal rights within the social security system, and we have supplemented the report in that respect."
"I also support Mr Pronk's proposals because, with his Dutch regard for consensus, if I may say that, he has adopted demands that we in the PSE Group made in various areas where we expect specific aims, specific measures and above all directives and action programmes from the Commission."
"It is not enough, now that we have the third communication - fine and good and important though it may be - to produce more new communications."
"We need quite specific legislative proposals, including proposals based on Articles 13 and 137 of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"The Commission also has our support in the negotiations, in the struggle with the Council of Ministers."
"They know that Parliament expects more than communications."
"We also expect tangible qualitative progress."
"What has been submitted in the framework of the dialogue between European management and labour is not enough for us either, not even the latest results, which still fall far short of the expectations of the European Parliament."
"I should like to take up one final point made by Mr Pronk."
"At the end of his speech, he referred to solidarity and to the evasion of welfare contributions in our systems."
"We must not forget that employers are by far the main culprits when it comes to the evasion of welfare contributions, as any of us who have looked behind the scenes will know."
"Public opinion, unfortunately, has a highly distorted view of this situation."
"We all know about the economic benefits of the single market, which are becoming increasingly obvious."
"But what we lack is social protection at the European level."
"Social security is not a relic from the past but the model for the future, a model through which the people of Europe can begin once more to trust and accept the European institutions."
"Applause"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by expressing my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for the work he has done."
"I emphatically welcome the proposed action plan."
"May I say to Mrs Weiler that her contribution has demonstrated the broad cross-party consensus that exists within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"But I should also like to say that while I do not, of course, entirely share her regret at the resignation of Mr Lafontaine, I do freely admit that there is now a danger that the labour wing of the German Social Democratic Party will face difficult times as well."
"There can be no doubt that the preservation of peace within European society crucially depends on social security."
"All Member States must launch additional efforts to increase employment."
"Besides unemployment, demographic development is also a major burden on the welfare state."
"In the face of this pressure, the principle of social solidarity must not be sacrificed under any circumstances."
"I fully agree with the rapporteur on that point."
"We must try to increase the activity rate."
"That applies to women, but it also applies to our senior citizens who, as you said, Mrs Weiler, suffer discrimination."
"The burden of statutory non-wage labour costs, particularly in the service sector, must be reduced."
"At the same time, the reduction process must not lead to distortions of competition."
"Atypical forms of work present another problem."
"It is high time an appropriate level of social protection was created at European level for those whose work does not fit into the usual pattern."
"Without intensive cooperation among the Member States, there will be no progress on social protection and employment."
"At the same time, it is especially important to exclude any scope for social dumping."
"Pressure must be exerted to obtain further progress towards the equal treatment of men and women."
"Gradual convergence of the national welfare systems must be pursued, with due regard for the subsidiarity principle."
"The development of supplementary pension schemes, based on the formation of coverage capital, must be subject to strict safeguards to protect employees from fraud and loss of pension rights."
"The compulsory systems must not be eroded and put at risk."
"Before the European Union is enlarged, the applicant countries must redefine and improve the criteria for the convergence of their welfare systems so as to avoid unforeseen consequences for the entire EU."
"The emigration of young, well-qualified specialists could set back the applicant countries' economies by several years, as well as wreaking havoc on the labour markets of the established Member States."
"Last, but by no means least, let me say quite emphatically that, within the framework of social solidarity, the European model must come up with sound solutions in terms of the creation of pro-family employment strategies."
"At the same time, we must never forget that, in addition to childcare, consideration must also be given to the ever-increasing need for employees to care for elderly parents and other dependent family members."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Pronk report contains a whole raft of measures which we really need to take, and the convergence of social security and taxation is becoming a particularly important issue, partly as a result of the introduction of the euro."
"But the actual situation in reality is quite different, with the Member States still creating obstacles to prevent people from working in other countries."
"One current example is Germany, where there are tax obstacles that make it very difficult for foreign companies to take work in Germany."
"The staff of such companies have to pay regular taxes, which I think is extremely strange, and it is something that Mr Lafontaine has failed to tackle."
"My own country, the Netherlands, also knows a bit about this sort of thing."
"The review of the taxation agreement between Belgium and the Netherlands places an enormous financial burden on Dutch frontier workers."
"As long as we have these huge differences in tax and social security and we still get up to all kinds of tricks when it comes to recognising diplomas and certificates, a great many job opportunities will be lost in border areas, both now and in the future."
"Another example is the lack of policy coordination on supplementary pensions, both on the question of deductibility and on tax on the eventual payments."
"This is a major obstacle to the free movement of workers, and I am therefore very pleased that Commissioner Monti announced this week that he is to put forward a proposal very shortly to deal with these problems."
"I have always welcomed his proposals in this field, and I hope that the Council will act upon them."
"This morning in our discussion of the annual economic report for 1999, I called for greater international mobility of labour."
"This will become increasingly important over the next few years, since EMU means that unemployment can no longer be tackled with monetary measures alone."
"Labour mobility is needed as an adaptation mechanism for tackling regional unemployment in the Member States."
"But we must not allow social security discrepancies to prevent this mobility from happening."
"We therefore need to work together to achieve convergence in this field, both on social security and on taxation."
"Mr President, this morning, a French newspaper ran the headline 'Social Europe stumbles'. Indeed, it is true that there is still a great deal to be done in the context of the single market and the single currency to ensure that social protection is not the variable used for adjustment to the detriment of workers, and that the Union's companies are not subjected to unfair competition through widespread social dumping."
"However, it is true that if social Europe is stumbling, it is because we do not have sufficient legal bases."
"This is the reason behind the determination of politicians such as Bartho Pronk, who is making every effort to bring about a social Europe, and his report today is proof of that."
"In France, the President of the Republic pointed out in his speech to the national parliament that as well as a European civilisation, there is a European social model, which cannot be separated from European citizenship."
"That is why we must constantly defend this European social model."
"It is with this in mind that I completely support the rapporteur's objective of establishing a certain degree of social convergence in Europe, not through standardisation, but through increased cooperation between the Member States on social matters."
"I also support Bartho Pronk's request for minimum European standards for certain social provisions, as well as a structured process of voluntary consultation at European level on the objectives and policies related to social protection, especially as regards the European employment strategy that was adopted at the Luxembourg summit."
"I am convinced that adopting guidelines on social matters would genuinely encourage our governments to seek a productive and essential balance between solidarity and competitiveness."
"As we have just celebrated Women's Day, I would like to emphasise an important element for the many women who work, that is, reconciling their family and professional lives."
"Obviously, this not only affects women, but also children."
"In this respect, the report calls on the Council to include specific objectives in the guidelines on social policy to develop child-care structures as well as facilities for relatives who require a certain level of care."
"I would like us to be able to include this dimension of social protection in the social policy that is to be defined by Parliament."
"I am aware that certain politicians are not in favour of this."
"I would like to quote these words from a German socialist Minister, who was speaking about the Treaty of Amsterdam: 'So many difficult compromises have been hammered out that it is not very glamorous for a Prime Minister to go back home and tell his people that he has managed to negotiate measures on child policy'."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mr Pronk on his report, and also the Committee for Employment and Social Affairs which, through its amendments, has made it a very good one."
"A few aspects of social security and a social system founded on solidarity which are important, indeed crucial, to me are stated at the outset, namely that everyone must assume responsibility and contribute in a spirit of solidarity to basic social security."
"Even though private supplementary insurance may be both right and important as an element in the adjustment of our social insurance systems, which are suffering under the strain of increasing numbers of elderly people in the population, it must not be allowed to undermine our common responsibility, with the result that we end up with different levels of health care - we hear shocking stories of such situations in countries like the USA."
"We must instead safeguard the principle of common responsibility and maintain a social system based on solidarity."
"Unemployment costs a great deal of money and puts severe stress on social expenditure."
"For that reason, it is important as part of our social security to ensure that more jobs are created."
"A factor involved here is the need to bring down tax on labour, which is something that Mr Pronk also takes up."
"The internal market has of course increased the need for cooperation and coordination in the field of social security."
"There is also a need for a code of conduct on illegal competition with inferior social provisions - what we are accustomed to call social dumping."
"There is a need for minimum levels of security of employment, which should include the proliferation of atypical forms of employment which are now appearing."
"We must however also remember that, when we speak of social convergence, it is a voluntary adjustment, a coordination of aims and strategies, which is required."
"It is to a large extent a question of mutual recognition of social security provisions, employment insurance schemes, pension systems and so on, which is also important in the context of freedom of movement."
"With the new proposal which the Commission has put forward, on which I have been asked to draw up Parliament's report, protection is also extended to citizens of third countries, frontier workers, students and so forth, which is entirely the right way to go."
"Finally, the report takes up discrimination and social exclusion."
"The resolve to devise a coherent plan to tackle this as soon as possible and to reduce the number of socially excluded and poor people in Europe is really something that we in the Green Group support."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a lot of very worthwhile points have been made about the Pronk report, and I agree with the calls for general solidarity and for a realistic and careful approach to a new society in which the concept of care has assumed a whole new dimension."
"All of these things must be included in the programme."
"These days, the Member States are making very considerable efforts to provide social protection, but because society is changing and ageing, because so many women now have jobs outside the home, because there are one-parent families and so on, there are more and more new things that social protection does not cover."
"I would urge that our view of the responsibilities in this field should not be too dogmatic, but that we should at least grant the same social rights which should also be available to those in unpaid work."
"Commissioner, it is obvious that we need a European social pillar."
"Cooperation between the Member States needs to be stepped up as a result of EMU and the European employment strategy."
"There must be a social safety net for everyone."
"We do not actually have much time left, because convergence on social protection is urgently needed."
"I would call for entirely practical measures to be taken, as Mr Pronk does in his report and the Social Affairs Committee does as well."
"The current differences in the cost of social protection distort competition between the Member States and thus threaten employment."
"I would like to mention just one example of the many I could quote."
"Renault's departure from Flanders has caused great bitterness."
"We need minimum standards for social security and pay if we are to have a genuinely social Europe."
"But this in itself is not a solution for countries with a very highly developed and expensive social security system based on general solidarity, which has a considerable effect on the cost of labour."
"We do not want social security in such countries to disintegrate, but it is clear that an effective employment policy must remain the basis of the system throughout Europe."
"There should not be employment in some countries with little social protection and unemployment in countries with a high level of social protection."
"No, thank you."
"Convergence is what we need, and the sooner the better!"
"Mr President, perhaps I take a rather different view from the rest of you, not so much on the matter itself as on the place where matters should be dealt with."
"Questions of welfare, relationships between children and parents and between the generations, education, social security, and dental and medical care are, first and foremost, national issues."
"There is no reason to harmonise them or to regulate them in detail at EU level."
"On the other hand, there are sound reasons for the mutual recognition of different systems, so that people who move from one country to another can avail themselves of their social benefits in the new country."
"In this area, there are many deficiencies and a great deal to be done."
"The most important question at EU level in my view is employment."
"But in that area the EU has failed!"
"When Sweden applied for membership 10 years ago, in 1990, we had unemployment running at 2.3 %."
"Today the figure matches the EU average, 10 to 12 %."
"There are immigrant areas in Sweden which, ten years ago, had an unemployment rate of 50 %; the current rate is 75 %, perhaps even 90 %."
"I am not saying that it is the EU's or anyone else's fault, but I am saying that we have failed to solve the most serious social problem, which is hitting vulnerable groups unable to do much about that reality - children and unemployed people who have nothing to live on - particularly hard."
"The EU has paid too much attention to the economy, markets, trade and competition."
"It was important to do that, but there was not always the same concern to consider the consequences."
"The project that overshadows everything is EMU, which has been very costly in terms of economy plans, cutbacks and increased unemployment."
"We now have 18 million unemployed and 50 million people in poverty."
"That is far too many!"
"Apart from unemployment, social questions to which the EU should give priority are the major problems concerning the shaping of public opinion to combat discrimination against groups such as immigrants, women and the unemployed, trafficking in human beings and the fight against drugs."
"In this area, there is any amount of work to be done."
"Here too, the approach should be to give advice, direction and support to the Member States through common guidelines at EU level, but to leave the implementation of decisions to the national level."
"EU cooperation in the social field should concentrate on the following four areas: jobs and unemployment, reducing exclusion and poverty, curbing discrimination and social dumping, and strengthening equality."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, throughout the Union, welfare systems and welfare reforms are at the top of the political agenda."
"There are good reasons why political action is so obviously required in this area."
"The introduction of the euro has undoubtedly had an impact on wage policies and hence on social protection in the various Member States."
"At the same time, despite a high level of economic activity, Europe is struggling to cope with a vast army of unemployed."
"This means that welfare systems have been subject to increasing demand, while the funds allocated to them have been increasingly restricted."
"Our finance ministers, as you all know, have to operate with tight budgets, and increasing taxes would only harm Europe's international standing as a business location."
"Against this background, the common aim of all the efforts to reform welfare systems must be to safeguard the effectiveness of the system in the long term, while structuring it in such a way - and let me stress this point - that it promotes economic growth and the creation of new jobs, instead of stifling them."
"Let me start by thanking Mr Pronk for his excellent report and for his generous words which I personally welcome for two reasons."
"The objective, namely tax coordination to which he made reference, does not aim simply at improving the single market but has also a social objective in making tax systems more labour-friendly."
"In the instruments there are indeed striking similarities between what has been devised to fight harmful tax competition and what the rapporteur is proposing in terms of a code of conduct for avoiding harmful competition via social security systems."
"Mr Pronk has taken the opportunity arising from the publication of the report on social protection for 1997, presented by the Commission at the initiative and under the guidance of Commissioner Flynn to open up a debate in Parliament on the future challenges facing Europe's social protection systems."
"This is valuable and also very timely, for reasons that I will come to."
"I can state that the Commission welcomes the resolution that you are debating today."
"You are giving the right message at the right time."
"Europe is living through a period of change: change in the world of work, change in society and in family structures, technological change and a major demographic change."
"All Member States face these changes to a greater or lesser extent."
"We need new, innovative approaches if our social protection systems are to continue to perform their traditional and very important roles: income redistribution, building social cohesion, and providing security against social risks as they have done over the last fifty years."
"In 1995 the Commission launched a debate on the future of social protection."
"The aim was to trigger a process of joint reflection to look together for solutions and to learn from each other."
"Not having been an initiator of this - it was Commissioner Flynn - I can say in retrospect, on a personal basis, that this was perhaps one of the very first examples of trying to achieve progress through comparison, through peer review, and similar processes, which I find very helpful."
"In 1997 the Commission took stock of this debate in its communication: Modernising and Improving Social Protection."
"The Commission's main message throughout this process has been that there is an urgent need to modernise social protection in the European Union."
"Modernising means adapting systems to the new social and economic conditions in which they operate."
"It does not mean abandoning the high ideals and important objectives which lie behind these systems."
"It means changing methods and approaches where necessary in order to ensure that we can continue to give our citizens the high levels of social protection that they want."
"At the same time we must ensure that our systems are sustainable."
"The important of a high level of social protection was underlined in the reactions to the 1997 communication, in particular the resolution of the European Parliament, prepared by Mrs Weiler, and in the discussions on the European social policy forum."
"The process of rapid social, economic and political change goes on."
"At European level alone, since we launched our debate on modernising and improving social protection we can take note of the following: the Amsterdam Treaty has been adopted and will shortly come into force, incorporating a new chapter on employment and other relevant developments to do with social exclusion, non-discrimination and public health."
"The European employment strategy has been successfully put into place and Member States have made a good start on implementation."
"The single currency was introduced in January."
"Enlargement negotiations have been launched with five countries in Central and Eastern Europe."
"It is important to recognise that these developments will impact on both Member States' social protection systems and our ways of cooperating at European level."
"The time is ripe to take the process of joint reflection on the future of our social protection systems a step further."
"The proposals made in Parliament's resolution go in the right direction."
"You clearly support what is a central theme in this process - the need to work together closely and the great benefits that can flow from doing so."
"Social protection policy is a matter for which Member States have responsibility."
"There are considerable differences between the systems of the 15 Member States."
"Nevertheless we are facing common problems and challenges."
"We have common objectives."
"All of us have much to gain from a common reflection."
"You also send a clear message to the Commission and the Member States to be ambitious in this process."
"The Commission will keep these views very much in mind when we come back with our proposals on how to take forward these ideas on social protection."
"We will be issuing a new and ambitious communication in the next few months."
"Your resolution is a timely input in that regard that we value very much."
"Thank you, Mr Monti."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"Mr Schiedermeier has the floor on a point of order."
"Mr President, allow me to make a brief comment."
"Many of our colleagues will take any opportunity to criticise the conduct of the Commission."
"That is why I find it all the more regrettable that there are Members of the House who deliver their contributions to the debate and then immediately leave the Chamber without waiting for the reply from the Commissioner, who has been good enough to stay here until 9 p.m."
"May I offer my personal apologies for the conduct of my colleagues."
"Thank you, Mr Schiedermeier."
"Your comments will be recorded in the Minutes."
"With that, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our agenda."
"It has been a longer day than usual, which has meant extra work for all the services of the House, who deserve our particular thanks."
"The sitting was closed at 9 p.m."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I rise on the comment made by my colleague, Mr Evans, yesterday regarding the quantity of documentation we receive."
"I feel he has made a very good point."
"Given the amount of paper we have received this morning, if these votes are going to continue, will the President look into the provision of extra trunks for Members in future to allow us to get the results back to our offices in Brussels?"
"I will ask the services to investigate that matter."
"Parliament approved the Minutes"
"VOTES"
"The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations fully supports this report and the amendments which were adopted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy."
"The Commission's proposal calls into question the Community Customs Code as defined in the original Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92."
"I must stress the importance of the Community Customs Code for third countries, in particular the former CEECs."
"This code serves as a reference and a model for many countries in urgent need of operational customs legislation enabling them to integrate into the world of international trade."
"In terms of commercial policy, although the customs tariff is losing its importance as an instrument for the protection of certain industries, it is still used to support competition policy."
"Anti-dumping and countervailing duties are applied in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Community Customs Code."
"With regard to agricultural policy, the code's customs procedures are used to manage the export refund arrangements."
"The new WTO rules depend on the code."
"In terms of external trade statistics, the Single Administrative Document provided for in the Code Implementing Provisions remains the instrument on which the gathering of statistics is based."
"Given this essential role of the Community Customs Code, our group cannot understand the Commission's proposal to eliminate or minimise the role of Member States in the procedure for implementing the Community Customs Code."
"As an example, in the current regulation Member States may reserve the right, on their territory, to make customs declarations by direct or indirect representation in order to preserve the role of the customs agent."
"In this new proposal, the Commission limits this right to the indirect representation procedure."
"If this measure were adopted, the role of the customs agents would be significantly limited and a large number would disappear."
"The new provisions therefore seem to favour negative changes with a reduction in customs control by Member States, the elimination of jobs for customs agents and therefore an increase in the opportunities for fraud and a reduction in the Community preference."
"As for the customs procedures and the placing of goods under a customs procedure, the Commission is proposing a system of exceptions for all companies making declarations electronically."
"The very principle of protection by Member States will be diminished because these electronic documents will eventually be sent directly to the Community institutions."
"To conclude, from the two examples which I have just given, you will understand why our group is using its vote to oppose any change to the Community Customs Code which would lead to a reduction in Community preference and in the role of companies and national authorities in the customs process."
"I am surprised that, under the pretext of administrative simplification, the Commission is proposing to weaken the principle of Community preference together with a de facto reduction in controls which risk leading to an increase in fraud, particularly on the eve of new negotiations within the World Trade Organisation."
"The report deals with a range of social questions which do not fall within the EU's decision-making powers."
"We consider that the EU's regulatory system in the social field should concentrate entirely on minimum measures designed to counteract social dumping."
"Other aspects of social policy must be handled at national and local level."
"This report goes considerably further in the quest for harmonisation and in making proposals in fields such as child care and pensions."
"We therefore voted against the report."
"The unfaltering political choice of the European Union and Member States to further dismantle not only the social security system but also, in more general terms, the system of social protection which has reigned in Europe since the war as a result of the effective struggles of the workers' movement is becoming ever more apparent."
"The Commission report on social protection in Europe calls on Member States to strengthen their efforts to promote gainful employment."
"It regards the provision of medical and hospital care as a mere commercial commodity and insured people as consumers who must limit their demand. It proposes measures to modernise social protection and to adapt systems of social protection to changing circumstances by means of privatisation of health provision and pension cover."
"The report of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, while it contains some positive findings and puts forward relevant measures, accepts in its entirety the new social protection framework. It addresses existing problems of the financing of systems of social protection from the standpoint of their impact on the competitiveness of the European economy, thereby lending support to those who call for a reduction in spending and for partial privatisation of social provision."
"Regarding the assessment contained in the report that the strengthening of market mechanisms in the area of medical and hospital care must not result in a two-tier health service, we wish to say that privatising a part of medical and hospital care and strengthening market mechanisms in the sector will lead, de facto , to the creation of a two-tier health service."
"Those with high levels of income will have no difficulty in paying high levels of contributions to private, profit-making schemes, while the overwhelming majority of working people will be restricted to minimum, low levels of provision."
"The situation in Greece is typical, where we see that the NHS is being consciously downgraded and stripped bare, while the private sector is being shamefully strengthened."
"We are categorically opposed to attempts - in the name of cost reduction - to further reduce the level of pension provision from state social security services and to reduce pensions which provide a minimum survival income, which will benefit private profit-making pension schemes to which those people will turn who want to improve on state subsistence pensions."
"The recent announcement made by the President of IKA that the setting-up of a new supplementary insurance fund is being studied, which will function along purely private lines and which will be based on the principle of a direct link between the level of contributions and the level of provision, with the possible direct participation of private insurance capital, is giving rise to grave concerns."
"We reject the new model of social protection which is being prepared."
"We know that these choices are a direct consequence of the unpopular austerity policies imposed by the convergence criteria and the stability and growth pact and which exacerbate the problems of financing the state social security system and will eventually lead to its demise."
"We believe that in the short term, the most fundamental way of addressing the problems of the state social protection system is to boost full-time, stable employment by promoting productive investment, especially in labour-intensive sectors. This can be achieved by providing support in terms of financial and tax incentives for SMEs which absorb the greatest share of overall employment, and by reducing working hours without reducing wages."
"We also feel that there are solutions - other than the ones put forward - to the immediate financial problems of social security organisations, such as the strict enforcement of existing provisions of social security legislation regarding contributions, combating the evasion of social security contributions and undeclared work, taxing profit-making movements of capital, and the abolition of exemptions in the taxation of income from movable assets and derivatives."
"Side by side with the working population, we are fighting to maintain and strengthen the state social security system of social protection, to broaden and improve the quality of provision in order to bring it in line with the objective of a high level of unified state social protection."
"This report is right when it says that with the euro, the Member States now have no monetary options for relieving economic pressures, so that competitiveness, even within the European Union, will be focused more than ever on wage costs, taxation and the cost of social protection."
"This is just one of the enormous problems that the introduction of the euro has caused, problems that have been swept under the carpet for purely ideological reasons without any proper debate."
"Nevertheless, I totally reject the idea of harmonising social security at European level."
"In Belgium, we know what it means when two nations are required to share the same social security system."
"The automatic financing mechanisms produce the very opposite of solidarity, a sort of organised robbery."
"This may sound harsh, but it is true."
"We are heading in this same direction at European level, only worse, because experience with the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund has taught us that local and national authorities are, by definition, not very careful with 'European' money."
"So spare us this pressure for European harmonisation."
"We need to understand that the greatest progress and the best forms of social security are achieved within clearly defined limits."
"We can always create other forms of Community or extra-Community solidarity, but that is something else entirely."
"Maritime cabotage, manning conditions on passenger craft"
"Mr President, the rapporteur, Mrs McIntosh, who has produced a substantial and important piece of work in this report, unfortunately cannot be here today."
"She has therefore asked me to present the report."
"I think that the basic consideration which one must focus on when dealing with a matter such as this is that the shipping industry in the EU is currently having a very difficult time."
"It is up against increasingly harsh competition from other countries."
"The ferry operators, for example, either immediately this summer or in a few years' time in the event of a postponement, are faced with the abolition of duty-free trading and hence the loss of a substantial portion of their revenue."
"In its proposal, the Commission emphasises the importance of free access to shipping markets throughout the world, along with the need to raise quality standards and to maintain or increase competition."
"The Commission can also show that considerable progress has been made in these areas."
"At the same time, however, working conditions for seafarers in the Union have deteriorated and employment is showing a consistently downward trend."
"All this is the result of flagging-out, manning reductions and cheaper labour from third countries."
"These developments have hitherto hit the freight sector hardest, but could also spread to the passenger sector."
"The Commission is concerned to devise a Community policy which will both remove the incentive for flagging-out and harmonise market conditions for seafarers."
"Hence the Commission's first proposal under which the regulation on cabotage would be amended to provide for crews from third countries to be placed on an equal footing with seafarers from the Community."
"The second proposal concerns the manning of vessels in regular passenger and ferry traffic."
"On the matter of working conditions as well, the Commission is seeking equal treatment irrespective of whether the crew members are resident in a Member State or not."
"There are grounds for misgivings as to some of the Commission's proposals."
"First of all, the question is prompted whether the time is right, having regard to all the problems that shipping is already facing in the EU."
"The proposed directives on cabotage have given rise to concern in the industry, since they amount to direct intervention on the labour market, which many see as running directly counter to free trade in goods and services."
"One of the aims the Commission seeks to achieve is to create equal conditions for competitors within the EU."
"In actual fact, working conditions vary greatly from one Member State to another."
"It is therefore also difficult to see the effect of the proposed measures."
"The conclusion on this is that it is difficult for the moment to see any acceptable reason why the regulation on passenger traffic should be amended."
"The present version expires in the year 2001."
"It should be added that the Commission has itself already proposed voluntary changes; that happened, for example, in a report which was presented in 1995."
"The rapporteur therefore proposes that we should not make any change in this part before the Commission has examined what effects the liberalisation of passenger and ferry traffic will have."
"Amendment No 4 proposes that the economic and social consequences of the liberalisation of cabotage should be reviewed and a report submitted to the Council and Parliament at the latest by 1 January 2001."
"On the basis of this report, the Commission should then present proposals on a definitive system."
"As regards the directive on manning, efforts should be concentrated on areas other than those the Commission addresses."
"If we want to increase the competitiveness of the entire industry, the first concern should be to promote training and know-how in the maritime sector, something the Transport Committee has taken up in other contexts too."
"The rapporteur has developed this in Amendment No 8."
"Let me conclude by just saying that the rapporteur takes a positive view of all the amendments proposed, with the exception of Amendment No 7."
"Mr President, earlier this week Parliament had an in-depth discussion about the future of Europe's railways, and today gives us the opportunity to do the same in regard to intra-European Union shipping."
"I thank the rapporteur, Miss McIntosh, for her work."
"I am sorry she cannot be with us here today - no doubt it is due to other commitments in another house."
"I should also like to say that her initial ideas, based on Conservative Party dogma, were not relevant, nor indeed helpful."
"However, she has changed her mind on that and we now have a more balanced, more pro-European report as a result."
"This report deals with manning levels on intra-EU services and on cabotage."
"I am going to confine my remarks to the manning proposals, as it appears, sadly, that within the Council the cabotage issue is dead and buried."
"Firstly, it must be said that these proposals deal with intra-EU and not deep-sea services."
"Secondly, my Group believes that action has long been overdue because of the increase in use recently of non-EU seafarers to crew those vessels at wage rates and conditions of service well below accepted EU levels."
"In short, EU shipowners have started to introduce flags of convenience in this sector, just as they have done previously on deep-sea operations."
"The Commission should be congratulated on taking action early in the sector to ensure that, where third-country nationals are employed on intra-EU services, they are employed on the same conditions as our EU seafarers."
"I shall be totally honest with the House this morning. I should like to see a directive which states that only EU seafarers must be used on intra-EU services."
"However, I recognise that this is not possible, which is why our Group supports the principle of having the same conditions of service for those non-EU seafarers."
"We cannot let our ferry operators, in particular, become cheap-labour, lower-standard employers."
"If we do this, then we sign the final death warrant for European Union seafarers."
"That is why this report is important; that is why it is important that the European Union and the European Parliament send a message very clearly and very loudly to European ferry operators: we will not tolerate non-EU seafarers being employed on lower wages and conditions than our own people."
"Mr President, the Commission rightly points out that there is a problem in the Community maritime sector as regards the decline of the seafaring profession and unemployment in the sector."
"This situation is mainly due to the introduction of flag changes, to austerity measures and to cheaper manpower from third countries."
"The cargo services sector seems to have been hit the hardest by these changes, but it seems that passenger services and ferry services may also be affected."
"That is why, in the two reports we are debating, a number of measures have been proposed which attempt to address the problem."
"The intentions of the Commission are essentially well-meaning, but two objections need to be raised. First of all, given that the directives cover all vessels which belong to the European Union but which are registered outside the Community, and given that there are maritime areas between Member States which are regarded as international waters, many questions arise as to the compatibility of the directive with the international commitments of the European Union and its Member States and with international law and international conventions."
"We need to be very careful on this score."
"Secondly, although the aim of the directive is to protect employment, it is not at all certain that in the end we will achieve this goal. The difficulties that will be faced by the regular ferry services as a result of the abolition of duty-free cannot be overcome by unified conditions of employment."
"The proposal may go some way to putting a stop to the use of cheap labour, but it will not protect the sustainability of the services or employment."
"In the end, it may not help our own seafarers, which must be our fundamental objective."
"Let us not forget that many shipping companies are companies with a broad popular base, and therefore the motivation behind our reasoning must be to strengthen the competitiveness of these companies, since only in this way will we be able to serve the interests of our seafarers."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by saying that although Mr Stenmarck has done an extremely good job of standing in for Mrs McIntosh, it seems a pity that she herself has not been able to present her last report in the House."
"I agree with the rapporteur that maritime transport is indeed going through hard times, not just because it faces fierce competition, but also because it is a sector that has really dug its own grave by persisting in its old ways for far too long."
"The abolition of duty-free has absolutely nothing to do with it, Mr Stenmarck, let us be quite clear on that point."
"It is about time that all the fuss about duty-free stopped and the maritime sector got on with things like everybody else."
"Duty-free still exists outside the Community, and that is bad enough."
"So what is the problem?"
"The problem is a serious social one."
"Contrary to what everyone thinks, ship's captains and officers are not really very well paid, and these days no one wants to spend a long time away from home without a break."
"This is why there are no European crews any more, and it also means that the infrastructure is collapsing."
"The nautical colleges are disappearing, which is jeopardising maritime safety."
"We have seen many examples of this, such as in your own country, Mr President, where the only tug available was manned by Chinese and a Chinese restaurant owner had to be fetched to communicate with them."
"Generally there are not enough European crews available and we have to do something about this."
"We need to improve the social conditions for the entire crew, and in particular for the officers."
"Mr President, on the occasion of the debate on the amendment of Council Regulation No 3577/92, I would like to say that we think it essential to highlight the negative impact that the relaxation of cabotage has had on the employment of maritime workers in the Community."
"For countries like Greece in particular, the relaxation of cabotage for passenger, cargo and ferry services in domestic waters is closely associated with sovereign rights and with the ability of the country to defend itself in the particularly sensitive area of the Aegean. It also exacerbates social problems such as procurement, the development of small and peripheral islands, and maintaining island populations."
"However, the Commission has failed to draw the necessary conclusions from the current implementation of the Council regulation on the relaxation of cabotage. Without first conducting a necessary and substantial impact study, it is proceeding to amend it, thereby further aggravating the situation."
"With this proposal, the Commission is aiming to limit the competence of the host state to determining the required proportion of Community nationals in the crew, while all other matters relating to manning will be the responsibility of the flag state."
"Vital issues such as the integrated structure and conditions of work and pay are to be decided on the basis of the flag state's legislation."
"This will mean segregating the crew into those who are included in the integrated structure by being listed on the ship's register, and those who are not."
"It will also encourage practices of social dumping and will have a catastrophic impact on employment."
"By way of example, in certain European countries hotel staff, chambermaids, cooks and so on are not included in the employment structure, and therefore, in the name of equal conditions of competition, shipowners in Greece are demanding that this should be extended to ships flying the Greek flag."
"All issues relating to manning levels must be decided in a uniform manner by the host state."
"Against this background, we support the report of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, which is calling for the proposals in question to be rejected."
"We also support the request for a study to be carried out into the economic and social impact of the liberalisation of cabotage."
"As regards the proposal for a directive on manning conditions, it is clear that all seafarers have a right to equal treatment, regardless of their nationality."
"However, we are categorically opposed to the derogations put forward in the report, since these essentially allow for the circumvention of these provisions through the possibility of exemptions and waivers provided for in Article 3, which the report unfortunately accepts."
"Moreover, we believe that equal treatment must include not just conditions of employment, but must also cover working and safety conditions, pay and the implementation of collective bargaining agreements for the whole of the crew."
"Against this background, therefore, we must put an end to any derogations which are negotiated through bilateral agreements which are often concluded with third countries."
"Although the report of the Committee on Transport and Tourism accepts the proposal, it does not call for the amendment of those articles which lead to its circumvention. Its assessment is based on the argument of non-intervention in the labour market, which does not dispel the concern about the trend of using cheap labour from third countries."
"Specifying the conditions for the employment of third-country nationals, which must be the same as the conditions applying to residents of the Member State which is the flag state, does not however deal with the problem of undeclared, uninsured work."
"The rapporteur has made a very laudable effort, but we cannot agree with her on this point."
"Undermining the provisions will lead to undeclared work and to unemployment among Community seafarers."
"Mr President, the McIntosh report caused quite a stir in the Committee on Transport."
"There seem to be substantial interests involved in the proposals."
"In the first section on the conditions for cabotage within a Member State, it is proposed that each member of the crew should be paid the same, irrespective of origin."
"This is designed to prevent social dumping, sailing with crews that are cheaper to employ than European workers."
"However, I do not think this will cost many EU nationals their jobs, since 95 % of the crews on the vessels concerned are EU nationals anyway, mainly doing maritime work, whereas the non-EU nationals on the same vessels are mainly in non-maritime jobs."
"So there is hardly any competition between the two groups."
"This also means that the increase in costs for the shipowners applies only to a small number of workers."
"The increase in labour costs as a result of this measure is almost completely offset by the income from duty-free."
"I cannot see why people doing the same job should be paid different wages just because they are a different nationality, so there is every reason to agree with the Commission proposal."
"The second proposal on manning conditions for ferry services between Member States extends the scope of these conditions to shipping companies established outside the European Union."
"Under the relevant international conventions, only the port state can apply safety measures on board and more especially in the proximity of the vessel."
"So as far as I can tell, the Commission proposal goes further than is actually possible at the moment."
"In conclusion, I agree with the substance of the rapporteur's Amendment No 4, but I do not think that this directive is the right place to address this issue."
"Mr President, the Commission deserves thanks for compiling its report, and thanks also go to the rapporteur for having brought out the importance and significance of the issue from the point of view of both employment and the future of shipping."
"Every day an enormous number of people travel on passenger craft and ferries in the EU Member States, and their safety relies on professional expertise in the various tasks that are carried out on board by employees who can be entrusted with serious responsibilities."
"An important factor here is that the pay and other working conditions of those employed in navigation should be in line with those of other occupations."
"The Commission's proposals tackle that very issue, and the European Parliament today has the opportunity to make its own important contribution to the final decision to be taken."
"Using an unskilled and underpaid workforce to gain a competitive edge in shipping is a threat both to EU employment policy and transport safety."
"There are, however, calls far and wide to outlaw this improper competitive practice."
"The issue now to be discussed shows the European Union's resolve to counter this negative development."
"Safeguarding and improving employment is one of the most important obligations the European Union has taken upon itself; many would say it is the most important."
"All the institutions have expressed the will to tackle this issue, but often the problem has been that it has been hard to find practical ways of achieving this aim at Union level."
"There has been conflict when such great emphasis has been placed on the importance of the employment objectives, yet responsibility for employment is ultimately the responsibility of the Member States."
"Now the matter to be resolved is a practical example of employment policy being put into practice at Union level, and, in addition, it includes a sizeable element devoted to the issue of safety."
"We must ensure that the EU develops and enlarges as a community in which market forces play the role that befits them, that is, one that is in the service of the people, and not one that dominates everyone and everything."
"As markets become globalised, the European Union will perhaps be the main player, able to influence the framework for imposing conditions on the market within the context of the democratic decision-making process."
"We must, in our own work, see to it that the Union fulfills that task."
"We need a market economy, but not a market dictatorship."
"There is reason to hope that the Commission and all the legislative machinery that evolves out of its initiative in the future will create regulations allowing us to live and travel safely in a Europe where our citizens earn their livelihood under the protection of a modern system of collective bargaining."
"With regard to that, I wish to emphasise the importance of the trade unions, whose job is especially important now in the maritime sector when it comes to increasing safety standards for the public."
"Mr President, we in Finland have a saying that once the ships were made of wood and the sailors of iron, but now the ships are of iron and the sailors are made of wood."
"This will be the case if cheap labour is able to be exploited freely in EU shipping."
"As the previous speaker said, it is also a matter of safety."
"There are very many examples of problems: ships capsize, as for example the Estonia did, in the Baltic Sea, and others catch fire."
"In these situations we need staff who have language skills, who are knowledgeable when it comes to local conditions, and who can rescue people from disaster."
"This is why we cannot have a situation where the safety of navigation is under threat all because of cheap labour."
"All these rules are positive, in the same way as the continuation of duty-free shopping would serve this purpose in the Nordic countries."
"Mr President, I welcome Miss McIntosh's report which supports the adoption of the proposal for a Council directive on manning conditions for regular passenger and ferry services operating between Member States."
"May I take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur, albeit in her absence, for her excellent work on such an important and complex subject."
"The Commission can agree to two of the amendments proposed."
"It can accept the substance of Amendment No 1, provided that it is put into an appropriate article on definitions, since it is in favour of excluding exclusively cargo services from the scope of the directive."
"I would point out here that the Commission is currently carrying out a study of the directive's economic impact, as requested by various delegations in the Council."
"The scope of the directive may therefore be defined in greater detail in the light of the results of the study, which will be submitted to the Council in April."
"As far as Amendment No 5 is concerned, the Commission can accept it on condition that the deadline for submission of the report is given."
"Let us now move on to the amendments which the Commission cannot accept."
"Amendment No 2 cannot be accepted as employment contracts are by definition individual contracts and cannot therefore be included in the article in question, where they would be placed alongside universally applicable instruments."
"Amendment No 3 cannot be accepted as the right to allow seafarers to reside permanently on board ships, or to prohibit them from so doing, is not a matter which is internationally regulated."
"Just because he provides regular ferry services does not give a seafarer the right to reside in a Member State, and the Commission does not intend to interfere in an area which would cause problems regarding residence rights in the European Union."
"Of course this is without prejudice to any decisions which may be adopted under the second and third pillars."
"Amendment No 4 cannot be accepted as the directive deals exclusively with the treatment of third-country seafarers working on regular passenger and ferry services between Member States, and is therefore not the appropriate context in which to make such a proposal."
"In actual fact, the Commission is in the process of drawing up a communication to the Council and the European Parliament on the recruitment and training of seafarers in the European Union, which will assess what actions might be undertaken to encourage young people to enter the maritime professions and to promote quality training."
"It will also examine how the education and training of seafarers are funded in the Member States."
"As regards the proposal for a Council regulation, I note with regret that the rapporteur has departed from the Commission's proposal and has opted instead for an alternative text requiring the Commission to submit a proposal for a definitive system of manning rules by 1 January 2003."
"Such a proposal would have to be based on the report on the economic and social impact of the liberalisation of island cabotage, which is to be submitted to the Council and Parliament by 1 January 2001."
"The Commission cannot agree to such amendments."
"On 17 June 1997, the Commission adopted a report which among other matters dealt with the economic and social impact of the liberalisation of island cabotage."
"The report concluded that in such a labour-intensive sector as passenger and ferry services, a proposal allowing Member States to impose a compulsory quota of Community nationals in crews would be enough to properly safeguard the jobs of European Union seafarers and would also enable the internal market to operate on the basis of Community social provisions."
"The report also concluded that in the cargo cabotage sector, which is linked up to international traffic and is less labour-intensive, there are not sufficient grounds to justify continuing to apply the host State's rules, as is the case at present."
"In the proposed regulation an extra clause has been added which requires the host State to apply its own provisions on working conditions to third-country seafarers providing such services and employed on board ships flying its flag."
"The European Parliament asks for the regulation not to be amended before the assessment of the impact of island cabotage is complete."
"We should remember that as far as manning conditions are concerned, the provisions of the flag State normally apply to shipping companies; under the terms of the regulation in its present form, the host Member States can impose all their own rules on manning conditions, including rules on the minimum wage, qualifications required and social security for seafarers, as well as provisions on working time, rest periods, holidays and so on. This amounts to a major and unjustified restriction of the freedom to provide services, as shipping companies from other Member States have to comply with the various requirements even when just carrying out a single cabotage operation."
"Various companies have already written to the Commission voicing their concern about this."
"On the basis of the legislation which is currently in force, it seems likely that the impact of liberalisation will be slight indeed."
"The Commission feels that its own proposal offers a balanced solution which can effectively guarantee freedom to provide services as well as safeguarding Community seafarers' jobs on passenger services between the Member States of southern Europe, which is a highly labour-intensive sector."
"At the same time, it enables the restrictions which would arise from the enforcement of all the host State's rules to be avoided."
"In conclusion, I would like to thank Parliament for helping to ensure the swift adoption of the common position on these important measures, which will enable us to get rid of social dumping thanks to the application of Community employment rules to third-country nationals working on regular services, which as we have said are highly labour-intensive."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"In successive votes, Parliament adopted two legislative resolutions"
"EU - India Enhanced Partnership"
"The next item item is the report (A4-0066/99) by Mrs André-Léonard, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the Communication from the Commission on EU-India Enhanced Partnership (COM(96)0275 - C4-0407/96)."
"Mr President, 'We end today a period of ill fortune and India discovers herself again."
"The achievement we celebrate today is but a step, an opening of opportunity, to the greater triumphs and achievements that await us'."
"These were the words of Nehru to the Constituent Assembly of the Indian Union on 14 August 1947, a few hours before the proclamation of India's independence."
"He continued in words which are still relevant today: 'The service of India means the service of the millions who suffer."
"For fifty years India has pursued these objectives with determination."
"Although illiteracy, poverty and disease have not been eradicated since independence was proclaimed, enormous progress has been made."
"In 1947, three-quarters of the population lived below the poverty line."
"Life expectancy at birth was 32 years whereas now this has nearly doubled to 62 years."
"Illiteracy affected 84 % of the population whereas now over half of the population can read."
"The country depended on external aid for agricultural production whereas now, thanks to the green revolution of the 1960s, India is self-sufficient in terms of food."
"The major famines are no more than a bad memory, even though much still remains to be done to save many children from malnutrition."
"In terms of population growth, the most pessimistic experts who thought that India could not control this have been proven wrong."
"However, the figures reveal a population of 970 million, compared with 350 million in 1947, and the World Bank estimates the number of Indians will reach 1.3 billion by 2025, thus exceeding the population of China."
"The population issue must therefore be a social and economic priority."
"Since the beginning of this decade, India has embraced liberalisation. It has offered enormous markets and hoped for foreign investors but these have not appeared due to a protectionist commercial policy which imposes hefty customs duties and quantitative restrictions."
"Yet economic and commercial reforms have allowed India to increase its participation in the world economy."
"Politically, India can be proud that it is the largest parliamentary democracy in the world."
"A new government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged from the last elections in March 1998."
"On entering office, Prime Minister Attal Vajpayee announced his declared intention to make India a nuclear power."
"By conducting several tests in May last year, the Hindu nationalists of the BJP have tried to implement an independent nuclear policy, breaking with the previous policy of not exercising its nuclear option which had been maintained for nearly a quarter of a century."
"The people were perhaps surprised but not so the international observers."
"These events had the effect of suspending the progress of my report for several months."
"The final text calls on India to sign and ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)."
"We also consider it essential to restart the dialogue between India and Pakistan in order to come to a peaceful solution on the question of Kashmir."
"We are also calling for the continuation of dialogue on disarmament in these two countries."
"The proposed partnership agreement is part of a new generation of agreements aimed at redefining the external action of the European Union."
"India was one of the first countries to establish relations with the Union and since 1973 three agreements have been signed, initially defining commercial relations and then establishing an institutional framework for economic cooperation and development."
"The present partnership will go much further."
"It proposes an intensified political dialogue between the two parties, the abolition of barriers to investment and trade and measures promoting cultural contacts and a permanent dialogue with civil society."
"Other elements in the partnership's agenda include the preservation of biodiversity and the fight against drugs and money-laundering."
"My report also concentrates on development aid which represents 95 % of the European aid granted to India."
"The abolition of child labour is also one of the priorities and, where this cannot be avoided, a voluntary code of conduct for companies is recommended."
"As the victims of age-old prejudice, women suffer every form of exploitation."
"Furthermore, India is one of the few countries in the world where there are more men than women."
"This is why the budget for basic health care has been increased."
"Education for girls is of crucial importance since the figures show that educated women are at less risk from maternal and infant mortality."
"Too many clichés abound."
"To associate India with shantytowns, extreme poverty and nothing else is too simplistic."
"We hope that the EU-India dialogue will allow India to assume its rightful place on the world stage and that it will allow our Asia strategy to be revised so that it is not solely targeted at China."
"Applause"
"Mr President, along with China, India is one of the biggest and most important states on the Asian continent."
"I therefore welcome the fact that the rapporteur has done such an excellent job of promoting stronger partnership with India."
"It is a rising economic power attracting private investment, and it is somewhere where my own country, the Netherlands, for example, has a good deal of its administrative work done by local companies because of their technical know-how and because the wage levels are lower."
"Nevertheless, India with its large population still needs a great deal of development aid."
"The interesting thing about India is that it is a subcontinent with an impressive culture, and it is this culture which, in the context of development cooperation, has prevented it from simply putting itself in the hands of the donor countries, as has happened with Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, for example."
"India is still in charge of policy in this field, which is a good thing to see."
"Unfortunately, this mentality is also something of an obstacle, particularly for the further liberalisation of its trade system."
"Strengthening links with India through top-level dialogue, as the Commission is proposing, could encourage movement in the right direction here, enabling this country with its established democracy to play a major role in the WTO."
"All things considered, India has suffered less than expected from the economic crisis in Asia."
"The Financial Times reported this week that the Indian telephone company has reduced call rates by 10 %, and by even more for international calls."
"I think this is remarkable."
"However, there are still some rather worrying developments, as the rapporteur said: child labour, increasing religious tensions, partly caused by Hindu nationalists, the conflict in Kashmir and, of course, the developments on the nuclear front."
"Developments in neighbouring China are also worrying, but India could one day act as a counterbalance between the ASEAN countries, China and Japan, which would be a good thing."
"The recent meeting between India and Pakistan was also a welcome development."
"All of these issues can be put on the agenda if there is a stronger partnership between India and the EU."
"As a former journalist, vice-chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Rights and member of the friendship association with India, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the case of a missing Indian journalist, Ram Singh."
"India promised in 1997 to provide information on this man, but up to now we have heard nothing."
"I hope that the Indian diplomats here can do so."
"My group supports the partnership and we congratulate the rapporteur."
"Mr President, in my opinion India is a country which has possibilities for the future."
"I am pleased that the EU is willing to continue and strengthen the partnership we have had for a long time and which, let us hope, will continue for a long time to come."
"Many think that India is a strange country which is difficult to get to know."
"And so it is, if we see it through Western eyes."
"But that is not how we should see it; we should look at India from within and with different eyes."
"Then we shall discover that India is a unique country."
"I for one, on many of my journeys, have experienced incredible sympathy and generosity, which seem to know no bounds."
"However, apart from the positive aspects, there are also many development problems in India."
"We must of course endeavour to help India in every possible way to take the right road, not because we want to control the country, but because we do not want it to make the same mistakes as many countries in Europe have done."
"I would like to comment on a few points here - I will not go through them all since Mrs André-Léonard has already raised many important points, which I of course entirely support."
"One of the comments I wish to make concerns regional cooperation in India and with countries around India."
"Regional cooperation is indeed of very great importance for the entire region, where India as the largest country clearly has a special position."
"None of these countries can isolate itself entirely."
"If a solution is to be found to many of the problems present in the region, problems with Pakistan and the Kashmir question for example, regional cooperation is of the utmost importance."
"I also think that India increasingly realises and understands that."
"Increased intergovernmental cooperation is therefore a precondition for the region to achieve positive development in terms of peace, the environment and balancing out economic and social differences in the region."
"As regards the nuclear tests, we all had a great shock when we heard that India, immediately followed by Pakistan, had carried out test explosions."
"It sounded to me very much like the most stupid thing which India had done for a long time."
"This is definitely not the way to secure cooperation and trust."
"Nor does it square with the picture of India I have acquired and of the country I have got to know over many years."
"My group and I of course condemn these nuclear tests."
"Clearly we urge India to sign and ratify the nuclear test ban and non-proliferation treaties, and of course also the ban on anti-personnel mines, as soon as possible."
"The Kashmir question is also important."
"Here we come back to regional cooperation, which I believe can play a major role."
"We hope of course that a peaceful solution can be found."
"Progress has also been made in recent times."
"The Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan recently met in Pakistan to discuss the question."
"It was the first time in a great many years that an Indian Prime Minister had set foot in Pakistan."
"We have also tabled an amendment to the André-Léonard report on this, which I hope you can support."
"We have discussed freedom of religion in Parliament many times, most recently during the February part-session."
"Regrettably, a very long list can be compiled of attacks and violence against religious minorities in India."
"Unfortunately, there are repeated occurrences, despite the fact that the Indian Constitution guarantees religious freedom."
"There are of course also a number of provisions to protect human rights."
"When we speak of human rights, we must not forget that India still has the death penalty, which is unworthy of a democracy."
"I therefore truly hope that India will abolish this sanction as soon as possible."
"India has also still not signed the Convention on torture."
"It is of course important too that this should be done as soon as possible."
"We get repeated reports, from Amnesty International among others, that torture is going on in India."
"Serious cases of torture have also occurred in the police."
"I hope that India can sign this convention and that it will endeavour to solve these problems as soon as possible."
"We in the Green Group have tabled an amendment precisely on this human rights issue, mainly in regard to the many unsolved cases which have arisen in relation to Kashmir; it is estimated that there have been over 800 unsolved cases since 1990."
"Of course this is to impress upon India that it must make progress in resolving this matter."
"When it comes to the environment, the problem is that India has nuclear power."
"These nuclear power stations were obtained from the Soviet Union, which does not give any guarantee for the future."
"I therefore hope that we can have greater cooperation on renewable energy resources so that nuclear power can be phased out in India, just as we want to phase it out in the EU countries."
"Renewable energy resources show very great potential in India, especially where wind and solar energy are concerned."
"Finally, we in the Green Group will of course support this partnership and will vote for the excellent André-Léonard report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Sir Leon Brittan always tells us that there is no alternative to his policy of kowtowing and exaggerated politeness on the red carpets of Beijing. He claims that there is no alternative to this policy which is based on sacrificing democracy, the rule of law and the freedom of the Tibetans, the Mongols and the inhabitants of Turkestan."
"Yet we now have an alternative as indicated in this report by Mrs André-Léonard which is heading in the right direction."
"For India is the alternative for the European Union and its Asia policy."
"A true strategic partnership should be established with this great country of a billion inhabitants, compared with 1.2 billion in China."
"India is the largest democracy in the world and a country which, under the government of Mr Vajpayee, has not changed considerably since the government of Mr Rao."
"Substantial economic reforms have been initiated and just as substantial economic progress has been made. The country is opening up to the world market, albeit still too slowly, and is strengthening its relations with the rest of the world."
"So should we continue to follow Sir Leon when he tell us that there is no alternative?"
"Or should we, the Commission, the Council and this House, make an effort to establish a programme which will allow us to rapidly instigate a strategic relationship with this country?"
"We still have a long way to go."
"The Commission delegation in Delhi is totally inadequate."
"This House does not even have an ad hoc delegation with India, although it does have one with the Chinese Communist empire. There is also no annual EU-India summit."
"This House, and the Council and the Commission in particular, need a genuine strategy and measures which will allow us to be suitably equipped to meet this major challenge of ensuring India's progress towards increased democracy."
"In my opinion, and certain Members have broached this problem, we must not look for excuses or pay attention to the problem of the nuclear tests in India."
"India is quite rightly equipping itself with the means to protect itself, just as we did faced with the Soviet empire."
"Why should we be so tolerant of the nuclear strike force of the Chinese Communist empire and yet make such a fuss because India, whose problem is not really with Pakistan but with the neighbouring Communist empire, equips itself with a deterrent power."
"When the situation changed for us with the collapse of the Soviet empire and the lessening of the threat, we were able to start to disarm."
"I believe that India, faced with such a country, has the legitimate right to equip itself with the means to protect itself."
"I must congratulate Mrs André-Léonard on her report which contains some positive elements. The ball is now in the Commission's and Council's court to establish a strategic timetable with the Indian Parliament and the Indian Government so that India can become our favoured partner in Asia."
"Mr President, with regard to this interesting report by Mrs André-Léonard, I am amazed at the lack of priority which this House tends to give to the issue of our relations with India, the largest democracy in the world. This is particularly true when you compare, for example, the emphasis given to our relations with China."
"The refusal to discuss this report at the end of the sitting seems rather cavalier given that this is such an important subject."
"This report paints a fairly full picture of India's current situation. This young democratic country has for some years been experiencing a sustained rate of growth and yet, in practice, the democracy seems to be built on extremely inegalitarian social structures."
"The persistence of a caste system which the public authorities have not managed to challenge is at the root of an unfair distribution of benefits from the country's growth."
"The recent violations of human rights, in particular the violation of religious freedom to the detriment of the Christian communities, as in neighbouring Pakistan, are also worrying and may not have been sufficiently stressed by our rapporteur."
"Furthermore, the economic development of India is still based too much on industries which use underpaid and exploited labour, in particular child labour."
"The external commercial policy of the European Union must help to correct these problems by providing the instruments needed to promote fair trade."
"It must encourage the overall level of production standards in India to be raised and must seek to reduce as much as possible the unscrupulous trade in products which are only competitive because of unacceptable social and health conditions."
"A policy restricted to establishing codes of conduct would be doomed to ineffectiveness."
"Europe's action within the WTO must pursue the same objectives."
"The rapporteur's recommendations on the necessary diversification of our aid programmes, on their decentralisation, on improved capillary action and on the extension of micro-loans seem relevant because they are well suited to the social and geographic structures of India."
"If applied, they should help to improve the effectiveness of these structures."
"Mr President, India is a country where nearly everything is on such a large scale as to make it a problematic as well as an important and promising partner for the European Union."
"This report clearly addresses the priority areas, the acute problems and those that are more deeply rooted."
"A great deal has already been said, and quite rightly, about the nuclear tests, but I nevertheless believe that the development of the partnership has to depend upon the decisions made in this area."
"It is also important for India to sign the Ottawa Convention banning anti-personnel mines."
"I feel it is particularly important for the EU, both in its overall partnership policy and in its relations with India, to be significantly involved in the fight against the exploitation of children."
"The contradictions between legislation in this field and the way it is implemented in India are far too great."
"It is also quite staggering that such technologically gifted people - I am thinking here of the software sector, for example - allow their children to be socially and sexually exploited to such a dreadful extent."
"Campaigns run by the central government have failed due to the resistance of organised crime and corruption and the lack of flanking measures."
"The extreme suffering caused to children forced into prostitution, particularly those from Nepal, is quite simply unacceptable."
"I therefore feel that the proposal in paragraph 44, based on an initiative taken by President Clinton, is a constructive approach which may give some practical substance to European concern about the exploitation of children."
"Firms would have to agree voluntarily to comply with certain minimum criteria in return for a fixed payment or bonus."
"Implementing and policing this would certainly require some degree of political will and administrative expenditure, but it would be a definite signal and would hold out the prospect of achieving progress."
"Mr President, I want to start by speaking from a specifically British viewpoint on India."
"One of the arguments that was always put against British membership of the European Union was that it would mean that we would be turning our backs on the Commonwealth and that Europe was an inward-looking small club of rich nations that did not care about the rest of the world."
"I always argued very strongly against that viewpoint in the 60s and 70s and argued that one of the great advantages of British membership of the European Union was precisely that it would bring the Commonwealth countries into a relationship with the rest of Europe, with all the advantages that could bring."
"The report that we have before us today is a very good example of what precisely has happened."
"Not only has the Commonwealth benefited by being brought into the Lomé Convention but also individual partnerships have been formed, such as the one we are discussing today."
"I should like to congratulate Mrs André-Léonard very strongly on her excellent report which sets out very comprehensively the many social and political issues which face India."
"We know there are problems."
"The subcontinent of India has enormous potential but, as has been pointed out, many problems and tensions to be tackled particularly in its relationships with its immediate neighbours."
"The European Union, as has been shown by this particular resolution, can engage very constructively with India, which is the biggest democracy in the world and which, for all its problems, remains a very strong and vibrant democracy after over 50 years of independence."
"I would like to thank all the colleagues who have participated in this debate."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs André-Léonard, I too would like to thank you for the very thorough piece of work you have submitted to us."
"The rapporteur quite rightly points out that India is an established democracy, and indeed one hardly dares imagine what the whole region would look like without this stabilising factor."
"Nonetheless, the report hands out rather too much good advice for my liking."
"Of course we should, for instance, condemn the attacks by religious fanatics, but this is what the Indian government does anyway, and we should not forget that leading Indian politicians have fallen victim to such fanatics."
"We should therefore and above all look at supporting India in a very positive way."
"I would like to make two further points."
"Firstly, one of the proposed amendments quite rightly calls for the delegation in India to be reinforced."
"That is however just one side of the story."
"Cooperation between the Commission and the delegation would also need to improve, as it is not acceptable for aid-workers on the spot to be kept waiting for nine months before they get the first instalment of funding for their projects and to have to borrow money from other projects and other aid organisations until European Union resources are finally made available."
"In instances of cofinancing it is particularly difficult to explain to a partner why they should provide their contribution whilst those on the European side drag their feet."
"Secondly, I very much welcome the fact that some of the previous speakers also called for improved cooperation in the high-tech sector, for this is indeed the technology of the future for India, but if we do this I think we should nonetheless refrain from asking the Commission to draw up a code of conduct; I feel this is not a job for the Commission but for other organisations to do."
"Mr President, we are seeing on a daily basis that India, the largest democracy in the world, is making considerable progress in strengthening its political, economic and social structures."
"As documented in our new external strategy from 1995, we in Europe have a vital interest in fostering close relations based on shared values, fair partnership, economic cooperation with direct effects on jobs, and support for human rights."
"In meetings I had over there, including in my capacity as vice-chairman of the European Parliament's SAARC Delegation, I was able to see for myself the quality of the reforms."
"It is remarkable how stable India has remained in the midst of Asia's economic crisis thanks to its economic strength and innovative capacity."
"The restructuring of the banking system and financial services and the expansion of the South Asia free trade area will be further important developments."
"Nonetheless, as Mrs André-Léonard has already stated in her well-balanced report, our dialogue should not deal solely with economic matters."
"Respect for human rights is an essential basis for all European Union agreements."
"The fight against child labour can only be won if state authorities get actively involved, if a minimum income is guaranteed, if parents do their bit to ensure that their children are not reduced to the status of cheap and willing drudges."
"Children must be able to attend school to get the education and training that will give them a future."
"Village cooperative societies, micro-loans for women and NGO initiatives such as rugmark need our support."
"Companies too must make their contribution by means of voluntary agreements to safeguard social standards."
"The democracy so close to our hearts means respecting other religious persuasions as well."
"There is no room for totalitarian philosophies."
"Establishments in which people practise their religion must be protected against physical violence and threat just as ethnic minorities should be."
"The words of Prime Minister Vajpayee need to be acted upon further."
"The partnership between the largest state of the SAARC community and the European Union should be of high quality, built up through exchanges of young people, information and of course high tech, networks and a whole range of other experiences, involving political parties and parliaments as well."
"Applause"
"Mr President, on behalf of the Commission and in particular of Vice-President Marín, I wish to warmly thank Parliament for having persevered with the work on the Commission's communication of June 1996 on an enhanced partnership with India, despite all the difficulties encountered."
"I should like to particularly congratulate Mrs André-Léonard, who never tired in her efforts to bring this project to a positive conclusion."
"I also thank her colleagues, Mr Rocard and Mr Malerba and the many honourable Members who have contributed through their questions, contributions in debate, observations and proposals for amendments, to assuring that the final outcome is both comprehensive and of high quality."
"We are all aware of the unfortunate events of May last year, when India took the world by surprise and decided to reconduct nuclear tests after almost a quarter of a century."
"There was a need for the European Union, especially the European Parliament, to observe closely events as they evolved and incorporate them fully into the analysis of our relations with India."
"This has delayed the completion of the report."
"In our view, all the institutions of the European Union reacted to these events in a balanced manner."
"The message to both India and Pakistan was firm and simple, namely, that for the European Union, the principle of nuclear non-proliferation is non-negotiable."
"This is, again, made very clear in the text of the resolution before us."
"While emphasising principles, there is no alternative to pursuing the immediate priority objectives: lowering tensions and preventing an arms race on the subcontinent."
"In the long term we must make every effort to reintegrate India and Pakistan into the non-proliferation system."
"In the case of India in particular there is no alternative to dialogue."
"India is the second most populous country on this globe, with a proud and tested democratic tradition."
"Democracy has enabled India to preserve its unity, despite an ethnic, linguistic and religious diversity that is even more varied than in our European Union."
"Sanctions would likely have fed frustrations, reinforced the radical sectors in Indian society and shut out the country even further from international efforts towards building a global security system."
"The report rightly emphasises the legitimacy of India's aspirations to be recognised as a global player."
"Few developing, even developed, countries could stand the strain of preserving a comparable democratic routine in the face of challenges as daunting as India's."
"The nuclear tests have certainly given India worldwide attention, but for the wrong reasons."
"Indeed, they may well have set back India's global aspirations."
"On the other hand, there are aspects of global concern which cannot be tackled successfully without a contribution by the giant India."
"I will not list them here as they are so clearly identified in the report."
"The current level and depths of our political relations with India still do not reflect the fact that the European Union is India's most important and only growing export market, its first source of investment and technology and also its principal aid donor."
"However, in high-level meetings, as in our daily contacts with our partners, we are confronted with the fact that the European Union is little understood in India and its role hardly acknowledged."
"This applies to all levels of Indian society, including the government."
"In order to put our political relationship with India on a footing that reflects not only the importance of our economic relations but also the status of both the EU and India as global players, it is imperative that we work on increasing our visibility in India."
"I, therefore, welcome your support towards setting up a press and information unit in the Commission's delegation in New Delhi, as is already the case in other major capitals."
"Already we seem to be gaining some ground in this aspect."
"Our decision to maintain dialogue following the nuclear tests and to expand dialogue into new areas is contributing to enhancing our profile."
"The euro has received, and continues to receive, extensive coverage in the Indian media."
"I, therefore, very much welcome the proposal contained in the resolution that the European Parliament take on a more active role in maintaining regular dialogue with its Indian counterpart and that Parliament be given the resources to do so effectively."
"India is not only a democracy in name but also a living and vibrant democratic body politic with a free and fiercely competitive press which has the largest combined circulation worldwide."
"Indians are proud of their traditions and especially sensitive about their democratic credentials."
"We must take into account these sensitivities when adopting declarations, especially when exhorting India on the issue of minority rights and human rights in general."
"This does not imply that dialogue with India on matters relating to human rights is not possible."
"It is not only possible, but also highly desirable."
"The Commission does not, and never has, side-stepped its responsibilities in this field."
"The Commission is convinced that dialogue at all levels, including an intensified dialogue between India's civil society and the EU and its respective institutions, which must also include Parliament, is the only way forward."
"However, we are not convinced that public declarations would not have the opposite effect; namely, make such dialogue more difficult, at least in the short term."
"Last January the 10th EC/India Joint Commission Meeting was held in Brussels."
"On this occasion we formally launched the high-level economic dialogue between India and the EU."
"We are convinced that this is the way forward to building confidence and trust."
"The vote on the House's report on an enhanced EU/India partnership is very timely."
"I should like to thank the House for its tremendous effort."
"It is reassuring to know that we have the support of Parliament in this extraordinary venture of building our relationship with this great country."
"Finally, I was interested in the interventions of those, including Mr Dupuis, who strongly underlined the need to institute an annual EU/India summit."
"We believe this proposal deserves serious consideration in a constructive spirit."
"I believe this reflection should build on, in particular, two sets of elements: on the one hand, the already existing mechanisms which have been set up including an annual ministerial meeting at Troika-level, senior officials meeting, strategy planners meeting, consultations in the margins of multilateral fora and a series of working groups."
"Despite the hiatus imposed by the nuclear tests, we have been working hard to make these mechanisms fully operational."
"The second context in which the idea of an annual EU/India summit should be considered is the evolution in the structures concerning common security and foreign policy that the Amsterdam Treaty is about to bring into force very soon."
"Applause"
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"Before we move on to the vote, Mr Wibe has asked for the floor."
"Mr President, according to Rule 112(2), at least one third of Members must be present in plenary sitting if there is to be a quorum."
"That means 209 Members."
"When I look around, I think I can estimate the number of Members present at about 60 to 70."
"I doubt whether there are more than 100 Members present in the House."
"The rest have gone home."
"I have been an MEP for four years."
"We have never on any Friday fulfilled the conditions for a quorum."
"We have before us an important agreement."
"I think that we should show to the world's largest democracy, India, the respect that we are at least a quorum when we take a decision on this agreement."
"I therefore call for a count to establish whether there are 209 Members in the Chamber or not."
"Mr Wibe, in accordance with the same Rule that you mentioned, Rule 112 - of which you only mentioned part - in order to request the President to establish if a quorum is present, you must have the support of at least 29 Members."
"The President noted that the request for the quorum to be established did not have the support required by the Rules"
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, there will be no discussion on this matter."
"This item is now closed."
"You may have the floor, but only if it is on a different matter."
"Mr President, I should just like to make one comment."
"I would point out to Mr Wibe that even yesterday when there were some very important votes to be taken, there were not even 29 members of his group present."
"So if you are going to make this kind of comment, you need to be sure that you have some people from your own political family to support you."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, you have shaken my good faith in you, since I had already told you that there would be no discussion on this matter."
"The Chair has the last word, and you did not let me have it, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten."
"In any event, we are not going to debate this issue any further."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Parliament adopted the resolution"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to join you in congratulating Mrs André-Léonard and in thanking her for her work."
"The EU must make every effort to shape its cooperation with India in such a way that the country's nuclear weapons do not come to be used and that there is no proliferation of fissile materials for nuclear power and nuclear arms."
"The EU must also impose stringent demands on India to investigate and process the unsolved disappearances which have occurred in Kashmir, and must demand an end to the violation of human rights."
"Macro-financial assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina"
"The next item is the report (A4-0097/99) by Mr Schwaiger, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, on the proposal for a Council Decision providing macro-financial assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina (COM(98)0652 - C4-0704/98-98/0311(CNS))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, here in Strasbourg last Wednesday we had the chance to talk to representatives of the various parties in the elected national parliament of Bosnia-Herzegovina for the first time in our Delegation for South-East Europe, led by our most energetic chairman Doris Pack."
"This political dialogue showed us that we can take it as read that we and the Members of Parliament of Bosnia-Herzegovina are determined to work together and that they place a great deal of trust in us as representatives of the European Parliament and the European Union as a whole."
"We should do justice to this trust and be guided by it in the work we do in the European Parliament, focusing our policies on peace, reconciliation and reconstruction and continuing to implement them consistently."
"Over the last few days Bosnia-Herzegovina has been hitting the international headlines, and not just because the decision about the status of the city of Brcko has finally been taken."
"From now on all sections of the population are to be covered by a single municipal and district administration, so as to put a stop to all the conflicts and blockades."
"The Office of the High Representative has taken on an important role here, organising cooperation, ensuring that refugees return home and promoting peaceful coexistence in this region of Brcko."
"In addition to this, the High Representative has done what was necessary and removed the President of Republika Srpska, Mr Poplasen, from office, thereby preventing the destructive forces associated with Milosevic from holding up the reconstruction work started there."
"The international community is therefore utterly determined to continue with the reconstruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its constituent parts, in other words its entities, and to put a stop to those who oppose the Dayton peace process."
"The macro-financial assistance for Bosnia-Herzegovina which we are discussing today is an important element in the European Union's efforts to do its bit for the reconstruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina and to help the country to help itself."
"The aim of the financial assistance is to support the economic reform and reconstruction programme for Bosnia-Herzegovina, as agreed with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, by means of firm pledges of financing."
"Back in March 1998 the IMF and the World Bank outlined a macro-economic programme for Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"After our ECOFIN Council in April 1998 also agreed to this EU financial assistance, the Commission stated at the fourth Donors' Conference - supported by myself as the representative of the European Parliament - that it was in principle willing to provide Bosnia-Herzegovina with macro-financial assistance amounting to around 50 % of that given by the entire international community."
"Out of this, EUR 30 million is to be given in loans and EUR 30 million in the form of grants."
"With this proposed financial assistance the European Union hopes to support the implementation of an economic reform programme comprising a series of both macro-economic and institutional commitments, concerning both the common institutions of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the institutions of the two entities."
"Although lasting peace is gaining ground in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the country's structures are still fragile and still depend on international support."
"The most urgently needed structural reforms at this stage are banking reforms, enterprise privatisation and restructuring, reform of the healthcare and pensions system, the introduction of a simplified system of customs tariffs and the liberalisation of foreign currency transactions and trade."
"Most importantly of all, Bosnia-Herzegovina must earn revenue of its own, particularly revenue from customs duties."
"However, corruption in the tax administration, an upsurge in organised crime and a plethora of cases of fraud mean that the organs of State - government, parliament and the judiciary - and spending controls do not yet work properly."
"The amendments proposed by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which I am now tabling, support the Commission in this action and I would ask for your approval of this report."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Party of European Socialists I should like to congratulate Mr Schwaiger on his excellent, very clear report."
"It sums up very comprehensively the extremely delicate situation which still prevails in Bosnia and Herzegovina and ways in which the European Union can assist in maintaining what is still a very fragile peace and help to move forward towards the creation of democracy and peaceful cooperation between its different ethnic groups, which we all want to see."
"The EUR 60 m of aid being discussed here is a comparatively small sum but, as the rapporteur points out, Bosnia and Herzegovina has been receiving very large sums of money in the wake of the disastrous civil war and financial assistance on that scale is unlikely to continue."
"It is therefore essential that this money is very carefully targeted and monitored to ensure that it is used to bring about the necessary reforms to enable the country to become self-sustaining."
"Better infrastructure, efficiently functioning public administration supporting democratic structures and the continued transition to a market economy are vital to achieve this."
"The PES supports all the amendments to the Commission proposals which will serve to strengthen the monitoring of the use of the money in a country where fraud, corruption and organized crime are, sadly, still part of the legacy of the civil war."
"All of us in Europe have an interest in helping to improve security, employment and living standards and resettling refugees and displaced persons in a part of our continent."
"It is a moral as well as financial imperative to ensure that this macro-financial assistance is targeted as effectively as possible to achieve these aims in partnership with the IMF and the World Bank."
"The PES welcomes the full involvement of the European Parliament in this process."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Hardstaff."
"And now ladies and gentlemen, for five minutes and on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists - I am sorry, I must ask Parliament's services to rectify what I have just said, since although I am sure that Mr von Habsburg could speak on behalf of any of us, in this case, he is in fact speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party. Mr von Habsburg, you have the floor for five minutes."
"Thank you very much, Mr President, for honouring me by saying that I was a member of your party."
"Our friendship is so strong that no party barriers come between us."
"Mr President, Mr Schwaiger has once again done some excellent work here and has addressed a great many problems."
"Perhaps I could look at what might be termed the political side, since this is, after all, one of the trickiest issues."
"By the way, this is the best proof we could have that Friday sittings are worth attending."
"Thinking back to all the nonsense that was talked on previous days, I must say that this subject is substantially more important than most of the others that have been discussed."
"Let us be clear about one point: the problem of Bosnia is perhaps the most difficult of all for us to deal with, as the crisis there could not be predicted."
"It was a sudden event which swept over the country, catching it unawares and directly exposing it to an attack from outside, from Serbia."
"There were further difficulties besides, as demonstrated by events in Brcko, where a problem was once again left unresolved."
"It is all very well to say that Brcko should be turned into a neutral zone."
"However, this is not what had been clearly promised, which was that the wishes of the population would be followed."
"In that case Brcko would obviously have joined the Federation of Bosnia rather than becoming neutral territory, although that would still have been better than handing it straight over to the Serbs, since there are scarcely any Serbs in Brcko."
"The majority of people there were Muslims and Croats, who certainly had no wish to live under Serbian rule."
"We should also consider that even the dismissal of Mr Poplasen from his post as President of Republika Srpska has yet again shown that the clean-up operation so vitally necessary if there is to be cooperation has not yet taken place in Republika Srpska."
"The fact that Mr Karadzic's cronies continue in power to a certain extent poisons the whole situation."
"Therefore our task, first and foremost, is to help the present, legitimate government."
"This also means, of course, helping this legitimate government by setting a good example ourselves."
"It was most regrettable that a number of the worst cases of corruption in the Commission were related to this very area, and perhaps not enough has yet been done to clear up these cases."
"We are a long way, after all, from putting the Commission's house in order and it is high time, given the situation, for this to be done."
"When all is said and done, it has to be acknowledged that many of the problems listed here, such as corruption, fraud and crime, actually stem from Republika Srpska and again and again spill over into the territory of the Federation."
"The latter, which I have frequently visited, enjoys quite a high degree of law and order."
"It is Republika Srpska which spreads disorder and which is still under totalitarian leadership, whereas the present government in Bosnia, as well as Muslims, Croats and even Serbs, genuinely believe in democracy."
"Yes, such a thing is possible!"
"The problem is that we have never given them enough support."
"We could have worked very well with these Serbs, had we decided not to play games over and over again with Karadzic, Vladic and company, whatever their names are."
"This is an absolutely fundamental political problem."
"We shall have to call upon our Union to pursue a clear and unambivalent policy not just towards Republika Srpska within Bosnia, but also in Serbia itself."
"There is one point we must grasp, which is that as long as Milosevic is in power there will be no peace, just as there would never have been peace in Germany had Hitler been allowed to continue in power!"
"They are after all broadly similar characters."
"We must finally resolve to give effective support to those forces existing in Serbia - we have seen them here ourselves on occasion."
"Only then will we have peace."
"Mr President, I will first pay tribute to the rapporteur for what is a good report."
"I do not do that as a matter of routine but only when it is justified, which is the case here."
"I readily concur with Mr von Habsburg's description of the political situation in these countries - he knows it much better than I do."
"It is thus a question of creating democracy in a country which must now rebuild after war and terror have ravaged its people both physically and socially for so long."
"It is a question of creating political reforms for democracy, stability, a market economy and sustainable growth."
"It is a question of creating living conditions for the people who live in these areas, and who must both cope with their own everyday lives and deal with displaced persons and returning refugees."
"After all the crises we have now had in the Commission, with fraud and mismanagement of resources, which have been discussed in this Chamber many times, not least in connection with matters involving reconstruction programmes, it is immensely important, indeed a condition, that resources for these programmes should actually be used for the intended purpose and that we achieve the results sought by the programme."
"This demands proper control of how the money is spent."
"Since, in the wake of the war, crime and disorder are also rife in the receiving countries, with fraud and corruption as part of everyday life, it is even more important that the money we commit is not subject to mismanagement on the donor's side."
"It is immensely important, from the point of view of trust towards us as politicians and parliamentarians, that matters now proceed according to acceptable rules."
"It is also important to cooperate with other lenders and funding agencies, such as the IMF and the European Investment Bank, and to involve the new institutions, the banking system, the central bank and so forth in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"Reporting on and monitoring of activities is also absolutely crucial, so that we who are now appropriating funds can ascertain what happens and correct any errors."
"It is also a good idea to have a clear deadline for when reports and so on are to be presented."
"This is a good proposal."
"It can also be a good reform - everything depends on how it is set up, implemented and controlled."
"Mr President, even in the peaceful states of Central and Eastern Europe we see that economic and financial assistance have no effect without the rule of law and good governance."
"But this is particularly the case in a country destroyed by war, where the war may have ended but peace has not yet been achieved."
"There is crime and corruption everywhere, even in our own countries, but of course it is far worse in a country whose future is something not many people believe in and who therefore feel that they need to feather their own nests quickly before everything falls apart."
"Through statements like those made by Lord Owen, who said that Republika Srpska might be annexed to Serbia after all, we are supporting crime and mismanagement."
"This destroys confidence that the country of Bosnia-Herzegovina will continue to exist in the future, and that is dangerous because it could bring all our economic and financial efforts to nothing."
"I therefore hold the view that we need political stability, and this primarily involves the return of displaced people and refugees."
"I regret that so far the Commission and the Council have not been able to give me any statistics on how many displaced people and refugees have returned to each entity, so that we could make a scientific comparison of how many have returned to the Muslim Croat Federation and how many, or rather how few, have been able to go back to Republika Srpska - virtually none in the latter case."
"If we had figures available we would see what the ratio was."
"Therefore I urgently request that such data be provided to help us assess the situation."
"As far as Brcko is concerned, neutrality is certainly better than annexing it to Serbia against the will of the people, but this neutrality can only be a transitional solution."
"It must be internationally guaranteed."
"It brings back fateful memories of the Baltic Corridor before the Second World War."
"We have to recognise that true peace is still a long way off for this country."
"Step by step we must try to bolster stability, but we should also realise that it will take years, maybe even decades, for normal conditions to be restored."
"I therefore welcome the Schwaiger report for its practical and critical attitude and also for its endeavours to help people in specific ways and to consolidate administration and the rule of law, without which there will be fresh waves of refugees, and the return of refugees and all the reconstruction work we have done, of which many are justifiably so proud, will immediately come under threat if the highly fragile peace there is destroyed."
"Dayton was just a first step, and a thoroughly inadequate agreement at that, and we need to make considerable improvements to it here."
"Mr President, the Commission congratulates the rapporteur, Mr Schwaiger, for the excellent report which Parliament is to vote on today, and thanks him for the support he has given to the Commission's proposal."
"The Commission is proposing macro-financial assistance for Bosnia-Herzegovina amounting to a total of EUR 60 million, consisting of a loan of up to EUR 30 m and a non-repayable component of up to EUR 30 m."
"The granting of a non-repayable component is due to the country's level of development and will require a special decision from the budgetary authority."
"To make sure that this assistance is provided in good time, without having to wait for the legal basis to be adopted, the Commission will ask the budgetary authority to consider this decision as a matter of urgency, in line with the strategy pursued by the international donor community and by the European Union in particular after the constitution of the State of Bosnia-Herzegovina following the signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement in December 1995."
"The operation is designed to be a one-off addition to the measures provided for under the PHARE And OBNOVA programmes."
"The specific objective of the operation proposed is to support efforts to bring about macro-economic stability and structural reform in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the context of the programme agreed with the International Monetary Fund."
"Furthermore, at the last meeting of the Peace Implementation Council, held on 15-16 December in Madrid, ministers recognised that economic reforms, together with the strengthening of the common institutions, are fundamental priorities if the autonomous development of Bosnia-Herzegovina is to be safeguarded."
"Since the authorities in Bosnia-Herzegovina concluded a stand-by agreement with the IMF in May 1998, some progress has been made on fundamental economic reforms."
"A common currency, the convertible marka, has been adopted, a common state budget has been passed, and budgetary spending by both entities has been strictly kept within the constraints of the revenue available."
"On 1 January 1999, a single customs code, consistent with European Union rules, came into force, and progress has been made in harmonising the trade regimes of both entities."
"In addition, a World Bank programme to improve the management of public finances has been completed."
"Nonetheless, a hefty package of work still remains to be done."
"Gross domestic product per capita is estimated at well below pre-war levels."
"Overall unemployment is estimated at between 35 and 40 %."
"Bosnia-Herzegovina's external financial situation is still shaky and not enough progress has been made in fundamental sectors such as privatisation, the reform of the banking and payments system and tax reform."
"To conclude, Mr President, I should like to make a number of comments on the rapporteur's proposed amendments."
"The Commission supports Amendments Nos 1, 4 and 5."
"It also shares the concerns expressed in many of the amendments rejected, but at the same time it considers it important to safeguard the effective implementation of the assistance, the integrity of the aims pursued and the exceptional nature of this financial instrument."
"The implementation procedures have proved their worth in many similar operations managed by the Commission."
"Making the procedures unduly burdensome could jeopardise the efficacy of the operation."
"I would like to emphasise that the Commission intends to guarantee that the macro-financial assistance complements and is entirely consistent with other forms of Community assistance to Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"In particular, it intends to make full use of the advice of CAFAO, the Tax and Customs Assistance Office funded by the European Union, and will give priority to the implementation of measures recommended by the Office to combat fraud and corruption."
"I would also point out, whilst on this subject, that the macro-financial assistance provided in the form of a non-repayable grant and a loan will be paid into an account at the Central Bank, in order to increase its currency reserves and boost the balance of payments."
"It would be extremely difficult for funds to be embezzled or misused under these circumstances, given also that the use of official reserves is subject to constant supervision by the IMF."
"The Commission notes Parliament's desire to be informed of the conditions laid down for granting this assistance in good time, and it will therefore forward a report on this as soon as possible, as is provided for in any case in the proposal."
"Nevertheless, in order to negotiate these conditions, which are an essential part of the operation, a certain degree of flexibility is needed and we must comply with any confidentiality requirements which the authorities in the country might impose regarding the substance and timetable of the reforms."
"The Commission is however prepared to answer any questions Parliament sees fit to ask during the operation and after it has been completed."
"In the Commission's eyes it is vital to safeguard the objectives of an operation which is designed to support macro-economic stability and economic reforms, and to this end the implementation of the assistance needs to be well coordinated with the international financial institutions present in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"Nevertheless, given the exceptional circumstances prevailing in this area, the Commission will remain in close contact with the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as it already does anyway."
"Finally, as in other Community operations of a financial nature, the principles of sound and efficient management and rigorous budgetary control will of course be complied with."
"The Commission will support these principles before the Council, to make sure that they are properly applied in the final decision."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I take it from what you have said that you will accept and incorporate all the proposals made by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which are now the European Parliament's proposals."
"I just have one question regarding Amendment No 11 to Article 5(1)(new): does this also refer to informing the European Parliament before the second tranche of financial assistance is released?"
"We feel it would make sense to draw up a short interim report and only to proceed further once you have informed us and we have been able to assure you of our further support."
"Mr President, as I have already said, the Commission supports Amendments Nos 1, 4 and 5, and I have also stressed that the Commission shares the concerns voiced in many of the amendments which it has rejected but the spirit of which it will bear in mind."
"As for the amendment Mr Schwaiger is referring to, that is No 11, the Commission does not feel it can accept it as such but intends to take account of it in a Commission statement to the Council of Ministers, which will of course be made in public."
"The reason why we are unwilling to accept the amendment as such is that the procedure proposed could present risks for the efficiency of the operation."
"Nonetheless, given the exceptional political and social circumstances prevailing in Bosnia-Herzegovina at the present time, the Commission will keep the competent bodies of both Parliament and the Council regularly informed of developments, including the actual execution of the assistance programme, which I think the honourable Member particularly emphasised."
"That is all I can tell you about this matter for the moment."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Parliament adopted the legislative resolution"
"Parliament has now come to the end of its agenda."
"The Minutes of today's sitting will be submitted to the House for its approval at the beginning of its next sitting."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you are aware of how much I value the fact that you all work with me to help things run smoothly and to carry out the good and fruitful work we do at these Friday morning sittings."
"In all seriousness, allow me to say how I feel and to express my gratitude, on behalf of the House, to all those who collaborate with us, since this has been a week of very intense work."
"This week we approved the amendments to be made to the Rules of Procedure by a vast majority."
"These amendments will not enter into force until all the Member States have approved the amendments made to the Treaties in Amsterdam."
"This means that, as we are coming to the end of this parliamentary term, we have almost completely prepared the Rules of Procedure of this House for its next term."
"I must say that I felt as if we were planting a tree, that we had stopped concentrating on our day-to-day work for a few moments so that we could also take a responsible look at the future."
"I hope - and I am sure, as you all are - that this tree will bear fruit and will shelter the Members who, as representatives of the people of Europe, will hold these seats in the next parliamentary term."
"Before I close the sitting, Mr Rübig wishes to speak on a point of order."
"Mr President, I just wanted to express my thanks to the French authorities for providing such exemplary cover for the demonstrations by the Kurds and the farmers and for giving full consideration to the security of this House."
"Many thanks to the French authorities!"
"Mr President, I do not wish to thank the French authorities."
"I have had two groups of visitors who were subjected to a great deal of extremely annoying red tape."
"They were searched and made to pay fines."
"What my groups suffered this morning gives a very poor impression of Europe and I believe that the French authorities should respect the Schengen area and not be so overzealous."
"They really are working to rule."
"I must protest at the way in which groups of visitors who come here to Strasbourg are treated."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would propose that we do not begin a debate on this question."
"The speeches by Mr Rübig and Mrs Lulling will be recorded in the Minutes."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"The sitting was closed at 11.35 a.m."
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 12 March 1999."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of the sitting of Friday, 12 March 1999 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"He supported those who fought for freedom in the Soviet Union and was the first to put forward in the Knesset the notion of an Israeli-Palestinian confederation. He conducted the peace concert in Sarajevo, and worked to ensure that culture and the development of culture featured in our Treaties."
"He also cooperated with Parliament and with the Commission to develop the MUS-Europe programme. To date, this programme has enabled over 3 000 children from underprivileged and marginalised areas of the European Union to learn music, mime and movement, as part of education for tolerance."
"Mr President, I think we owe something to this self-professed European and British citizen. I am not calling for a minute's silence simply because I believe Yehudi Menuhin himself would have wished our debates to continue as planned."
"I appreciate that today is a difficult day, but I do feel that the House should pay tribute to the memory of Yehudi Menuhin."
"Loud applause"
"Thank you, Mr Barón."
"I think the applause indicates that the House supports your views, and they will be passed on as appropriate."
"Mr President, I should like to inform you that a few days ago in the rue Wirtz, a woman was raped and then murdered, and I support your efforts to secure the establishment of a police station, which is urgently needed and would be greatly welcomed by those who live and work in the surrounding area."
"Mr Rübig, I have already sent two or three letters to the relevant Belgian authorities, but I will make further representations to them following your request."
"Mr President, I refer to the Minutes of the last plenary session in Strasbourg."
"On Thursday I asked if we could have some information regarding the ongoing dispute about the interpreters and the payment of their wages."
"I understand that today we shall be discussing the wages of other personnel but I think we should be looking into the matter of the interpreters."
"Madam Fontaine promised that a note would be circulated explaining the current situation."
"Can you advise me if that note is now on its way?"
"Thank you for reminding me of this issue, Mr Falconer."
"It was dealt with at the last meeting of the Bureau, and a note explaining the situation will be distributed to Members immediately."
"The Bureau instructed the Secretary-General to act on Parliament's behalf and to bring all possible pressure to bear in the search for a solution to the problem, in the hope that it will be resolved as soon as possible."
"The Minutes were approved"
"Order of business"
"The draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"Pursuant to Rule 97 of the Rules of Procedure, and in view of the events which took place last week, I propose the following amendments to the agenda for the sittings to be held today and tomorrow."
"I should inform the House that these changes have already been included in a corrigendum to the agenda, but they need to be formally adopted."
"The President read out the amendments to the agenda"
"Mr President, you have just mentioned as an item on the agenda, incorporating the corrigendum that we have received, the statement by the Council following the resignation of the Commission."
"I do not think that this wording represents what actually happened last week, which was the resignation - albeit collective - of the members of the Commission."
"This is what was stated in the letter that Mr Santer sent to Gerhard Schröder, which, I would point out, was signed by all the Commissioners individually."
"I think we should not give the public the wrong impression, particularly by leading it to believe that the motion of censure was adopted."
"There would indeed have been a collective resignation if the motion of censure which I and 69 of my colleagues tabled had been adopted, but this is not what happened."
"The agenda should therefore refer to the individual resignation of the members of the Commission, so as to prevent any misunderstanding among the public."
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, I do not think there is any problem about saying in the agenda 'the resignation of all the members of the Commission'."
"It is not just one or two members who have resigned, but all of them."
"They announced this in one single document, which they all signed, so I think we can quite easily call this the resignation of all the members of the Commission."
"I cannot see any problem in leaving this item as it stands."
"Mr President, tomorrow's agenda includes the De Giovanni report on scrutiny of the exercise of the Commission's powers."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control has asked me to recommend to the House that this report be referred back to the Committee on Institutional Affairs, since the Committee on Budgetary Control urgently needs to discuss this matter further, particularly in the light of what is in the Wise Men's report and in terms of access to information and the supply of information."
"I would ask you to take a vote on whether this report can be removed from the agenda and referred back to the Institutional Affairs Committee."
"I have already spoken to the chairman, and we agree that the events of the last few days have made some additional work necessary."
"Mrs Theato, referral back to committee must be requested by a political group or by 29 Members."
"Does any group wish to take over this request?"
"Mr President, you will recall that I asked at the last part-session for the groups and committees to be given another opportunity to peruse this rather insubstantial document and to see whether it represents the best solution."
"For that reason, my group is naturally in favour of referring the report back to committee."
"Mr President, I should like to speak in favour of this proposal because, under these new circumstances, it makes a good deal of sense to reopen the discussion of an agreement which had its merits but could of course be further improved with the new Commission."
"I can therefore say, on behalf of my group, that we are fully behind this idea."
"Parliament approved the request for referral back to committee"
"Mr President, I believe I speak for many other Members as I put the following question, which I hope the Commission can respond to."
"Following the resignation of all the members of the Commission, we have repeatedly read that the Commission will continue to deal with current business, but will not for instance take legislative decisions. This is perfectly understandable."
"My question is as follows: does the debate on Agenda 2000 count as current business?"
"The Commission is very well acquainted with everything involved in this debate and I should like to know if, despite its great significance, the Commission feels it counts as current business."
"I suggest that we do not debate this question now."
"It would seem best to ask the Council itself to reply when it takes the floor shortly. I can also make available to you a legal report prepared by Parliament covering this very contingency."
"Mr President, I have heard that the Commission and the Council Presidency will be here today and tomorrow."
"Today, tomorrow, or at the very latest the day after tomorrow, a decision will be taken on a crucial issue, military intervention in Kosovo, the repercussions of which for peace in general and in the Balkans in particular are anyone's guess. Perhaps you could therefore take it upon yourself to ask these two institutions to make a statement informing Parliament what the position of the European Union is and what their own position is, and to hear the opinion of this House."
"Mr President, we have a historic duty ..."
"The President cut the speaker off"
"Mr Ephremidis, this is not the time to hold a debate on Kosovo."
"There are other opportunities for that."
"It is not possible at the moment."
"The order of business was thus established"
"Statement by the Commission"
"Mr Santer, you have the floor to make your statement."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are currently going through one of the most difficult periods in the construction of Europe."
"These are very distressing times for me and for the other members of the Commission, both professionally and personally."
"We assisted the Committee of Independent Experts in its work, and we acted swiftly and without hesitation by resigning as soon as we knew its conclusions."
"It was a very painful decision, but it was necessary to preserve the institution of the Commission and the European Union as a whole."
"We must now ensure that the right lessons are learnt from this crisis, which must be the catalyst for deep-rooted and permanent reform in the European institutions."
"I hope that it will pave the way for a more transparent, responsible and democratic Europe, a Europe that applies the most rigorous ethical standards."
"This is what the people and the taxpayers of Europe expect of us."
"I have said that the Commission intends to leave office as soon as possible, and this naturally depends on when the Member States and Parliament decide to appoint and approve our successors."
"Until then we shall endeavour to provide a smooth transition."
"We will not take any new political initiatives, but we will deal with matters already in hand and any urgent business, and we will meet our institutional and legal obligations."
"I think it is in the interests of all the institutions that interinstitutional relations should not be affected."
"As for the report by the independent experts, I said at the outset that their work had our support and that we would act on their conclusions."
"We have kept our word, but I have to say that my colleagues and I were dismayed that such general and sweeping conclusions were drawn from the cases examined."
"As many Members of this House have recognised, we have done more than any Commission before us to try to improve the Commission's working methods."
"When I took office four years ago, I started work straight away on modernising the administrative tradition at the Commission, and many of these reforms are now in place."
"I regret that the turbulence of the last few weeks has prevented greater attention from being focused on the reforms that we had already launched."
"Perhaps it is a law of history that crises occur when things are getting better, not when they are getting worse."
"We now need to move on and learn from past mistakes."
"The experts' report talks at length about 'responsibility', an essential concept for any modern civil service which is responsible to those it serves."
"I am convinced that our reforms are starting to bring about change, and the next Commission needs to go even further."
"The concept is one that applies equally to all the institutions, and it also implies that the funding the Commission is allocated must be commensurate with the tasks it is given."
"No matter what the political pressure, the Commission must not take on any new tasks if it does not have the financial and human resources to carry them out."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish my successor, who I hope will be appointed very quickly, every success in his difficult task, and I hope the European Parliament will give him its full support in the greater interest of the Union."
"Applause"
"Thank you, Mr Santer."
"Through its applause, the House has shown how much it has appreciated the dignity with which you have acted throughout this period."
"Thank you."
"Mixed reactions"
"Council statement following the resignation of the Commission"
"The next item is the Council statement following the resignation of the Commission, followed by a debate."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, coming at a time when Europe faces difficult decisions concerning its future development, the resignation of the European Commission is a severe test of our resilience, but it is also perhaps a salutary shock."
"First of all, our thanks and recognition are due to the European Parliament."
"It has vigorously exercised its parliamentary right of scrutiny, which is only right and fitting."
"Without the dedicated work of many of your staff from all the political groups, the beneficial process that is now taking place would never have happened."
"The people of our Member States rightly expect the institutions of the European Union to use the revenue from their taxes in a responsible manner."
"But let me add in the clearest possible terms that the members of the Commission and their staff also merit our respect and thanks."
"They deserve respect for having accepted political responsibility for the circumstances described in the independent experts' report; and the Commission and its staff also deserve our thanks for the work they have done over the last few years to deepen and broaden European union."
"Strategic decisions were taken during their tenure, such as the introduction of the euro and the start of the present enlargement process, decisions in which the Commission played a vital part."
"Not least among its achievements is Agenda 2000."
"The Commission must complete the work it has started on this initiative while it is still in office, which I hope will be done within a few days."
"Europe, the presidency and all of us here must be able to depend on a fully operational Commission in the coming days."
"The resignation of the Commission has highlighted the slow but steady development of a European public opinion and the strengthening of parliamentary democracy as a component of the Union."
"It is my belief that the principles of democracy have stood this test, and I welcome that from the bottom of my heart."
"Applause"
"But the deplorable errors that have now been uncovered must not bring the entire institution into disrepute."
"Since the European Communities were founded more than 40 years ago, the Commission has been the key institution in the unceasing advance of European integration."
"It has to represent the common good of all 15 Member States in an impartial way and must also continue to be the driving force and initiator of new developments in the realm of European policy."
"If we wish to achieve the aims of the Union - and there is surely no doubt of that - we cannot afford to discredit an institution which is unparalleled in the history of our nation states."
"The European Union needs a strong Commission with authority to act, and needs it quickly."
"What is now required is the total radical reform that President Santer has already initiated."
"That too must be explicitly recognised."
"The MAP 2000 programme for better organisation and personnel management and the SEM 2000 programme, designed to improve financial control, are steps in the right direction."
"The Commission's internal inspectorate, UCLAF, must become an independent control body."
"Where do we go from here?"
"It is absolutely crucial that the European Union should demonstrate its effectiveness at this difficult juncture."
"As far as the special meeting of the European Council in Berlin is concerned, this means that the German Presidency must do everything it can to broker a political deal on the Agenda 2000 package."
"Success in Berlin is now more crucial than ever."
"Applause"
"Let me add that this will be one of the most decisive weeks Europe has faced; not only do we have the Berlin meeting this week, but the crisis in Kosovo has regrettably come to a head."
"And we have had the resignation of the Commission."
"The accumulation of these three crises also shows how much we in Europe - our nations, the Commission, the European Council and Parliament - have to do at the present time; we have a huge burden of responsibility to shoulder if we are to overcome these crises together."
"The results of the round of visits undertaken by Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, as well as yesterday's discussions in the General Affairs Council, have convinced us that all the Member States ardently desire success in Berlin."
"The resignation of the Commission is neither a political nor a legal obstacle to the achievement of the success to which we all aspire."
"In accordance with the Treaty, the Commission will continue to perform its official duties until it is replaced by a new Commission."
"That arrangement is an essential means of ensuring a stable transition."
"I am confident that Berlin will be a success and that Agenda 2000 can be formally adopted before the end of the present legislative term."
"The way has been prepared by regular contacts between the European Parliament, the presidency and the Commission for progress briefings."
"The European Council in Berlin will also have to deal, of course, with the consequences of the Commission's resignation."
"Without wishing to anticipate the discussions of the Heads of State and Government, which will certainly not be easy, I think we can already say that the decisions which need to be taken to appoint a new Commission will have to be reached in a difficult political and legal context, at a time of transition from the situation created by Maastricht to the new Amsterdam regime with the accompanying constitutional issues, coupled with the fact hat we are dealing with all these matters for the first time."
"The Council presidency has a great deal of sympathy with your President's proposal, which is supported by all political groups, that the procedure to nominate a candidate for the office of President of the European Commission should be initiated as soon as possible."
"According to that proposal, the European Parliament could approve the nomination of a new Commission President at its part-session in April, and then in May - which is a very ambitious target - it could approve the nomination of the new Commission."
"Applause"
"This in turn raises another specific problem, which concerns the length of time for which the Commission is to be appointed, given the fact that its appointment coincides with the transition from the present Parliament to the one which will be elected this summer and which, I am informed, is due to convene on 20 July. The sovereign decision of the new Parliament cannot and must not be pre-empted."
"The decisions that have to be taken are of enormous political importance."
"Let me assure you that it is the concern of the Council presidency to arrive at a speedy and constructive solution in close coordination with the European Parliament, the Member States of the European Union and the Commission which is in office."
"In Berlin, the Heads of State and Government will deal in detail with the question of the next steps to be taken and - if possible - may even move on to talk about specific individuals."
"The presidency will try to secure a political agreement among the Heads of State and Government on a candidate who could be nominated in time for your part-session in April."
"Besides requiring us to resolve the burning issues of the moment, the latest developments also give us cause to devote more thought to the future working methods and composition of the bodies of the Union in general, especially in the light of the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union."
"The protocol on the bodies of the Union which is annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, as well as the relevant conclusions of the European Council summits in Luxembourg, Cardiff and Vienna, have established the framework for our reflections."
"In preparation for the Cologne meeting of the European Council, the presidency will shortly present proposals as to how and when we should address the institutional questions which were not settled by the Treaty of Amsterdam and which have to be resolved before enlargement takes place."
"However, we may have to go even further than that."
"After all, it is absolutely essential to keep developing the democratic control that this House has exercised so efficiently."
"Public confidence in the institution must be fully restored, and that is precisely what the present crisis offers us the opportunity to do."
"The developments we have witnessed must never be repeated, otherwise the ideal of European unification would be seriously prejudiced."
"In adopting reforms, we must also consider the relative power of the various bodies and their role within the constitutional fabric of the Union."
"The Commission, with its exclusive power to initiate legislation, is an important instrument of European lawmaking, for which the Council together with this House are ultimately responsible."
"The Commission is also empowered by the Treaty and secondary legislation to perform executive functions."
"Greater care must be taken in the forthcoming reform process to ensure that the Commission is not constantly being entrusted with new tasks without being given the material, human and financial resources it requires in order to perform them."
"Applause"
"I hope that all of us will also make this clear to our populations at home during the European election campaign, because in this domain - at least in Germany - I encounter a certain ambivalence between, on the one hand, a proclaimed willingness to transfer more funds to Europe, which is essential for the European Union to go on assuming new responsibilities if it cannot raise its own revenue, and, on the other hand, the domestic discussion which then ensues."
"I believe that if we are serious about European unification, the conclusion to be drawn from this crisis is that the new Commission must be given the funds it needs to guarantee the orderly management of our affairs."
"Applause"
"Every future reform must focus on strengthening the democratic control and legitimation of the executive and legislative branches of the European tier of government."
"That is not only dictated by the constitutional traditions of all the Member States; it is also an absolute prerequisite for a viable Union."
"The present crisis also presents an opportunity to accelerate the reform process and, or so I hope, to make the reforms more incisive than was initially envisaged."
"We must, and indeed we can, seize that opportunity together for the sake of Europe."
"Applause"
"Mr President, the events of the past week have revealed, perhaps for the first time ever, an expression of 'pan-European public opinion'."
"And if we ever needed a demonstration of the suspicion with which, sadly, the public across virtually all our Member States view the European Union institutions, we saw it in the collective sigh of relief and even, unfortunately, celebration which could be heard after the resignation of the European Commission."
"It is important to state at the outset that the resignation of the Commission last Monday was not because the experts had found the twenty Commissioners guilty of personal fraud."
"In fact, the opposite was the case."
"They explicitly cleared the twenty of such accusations and allegations."
"As far as nepotism is concerned, it found only one Commissioner overwhelmingly guilty of favouritism with regard to work which was not within the European remit of the Commissioner."
"It criticised certainly two others for poor judgement in employing friends or relatives whilst acknowledging that the correct procedures for recruitment had been followed, and the work they had been engaged in had been of a European nature."
"We should also be clear that accusations which were being bandied about in this House in December and January against other Commissioners, were overwhelmingly and largely dismissed."
"It is important that this House is grown up enough to recognise that fact."
"However, the report was decisive in its conclusions regarding the loss of control of management by this European Commission; and it was right and proper that in the light of the conclusions the College took the decision to resign."
"My group now expects the independent group of experts to complete the second part of its report on the structure of the European Commission."
"I give notice that I am concerned about voices I hear arguing that the group of experts have now done their job and should stand down."
"I want to caution against those voices."
"I am suspicious of their motives and their backing."
"I believe that it could be very convenient for some if the independent group of experts were to be prevented from delving in the required detail into the workings of different Directorate-Generals."
"I therefore ask this House to make sure that the group is given the space to work and that the Secretary-General of the European Commission be asked to ensure that his officials at every level cooperate to the maximum to facilitate the report."
"In my group's view the second report must contain a more widely-ranging review of the Commission's culture, practices and procedures."
"We want it to deal, amongst other issues, with how financial contracts are awarded and the procedures for contracts for interim or temporary staff to implement programmes, and to follow up allegations of fraud, mismanagement and nepotism involving staff."
"The group of experts is not in danger of removing or, in fact, countermanding in some way the powers of this House."
"To believe that, is to demonstrate a lack of confidence in our work."
"This report and the one which will follow, is about something quite different."
"It is a procedure and process that is not unknown in any of our countries, in order to look from time to time at the culture which permeates administrations and executives in each country."
"Now is time to look to the future."
"The European Commission is not in the habit of resigning."
"This is, after all, the first time in our forty-two year history that such a thing has happened."
"If we are to demonstrate that the European Union can be different; if we are to respond to the opportunity of this moment, then we must call on the Heads of State and Government meeting in Berlin on Wednesday this week to designate immediately their nominee for President of the Commission."
"It is quite unthinkable that the European Commission, having resigned, should quietly continue with 'business as usual' until the end of their mandate."
"We want not just the President of the Commission replaced, but a new Commission in place with speed, properly ratified by this Parliament, using the powers which will be given to us in the incoming Amsterdam Treaty."
"Given this background, the European Council should put forward an experienced, competent candidate committed to in-depth reform, with a clear vision as to where he or she is going, with a programme to get there and credentials which are beyond reproach."
"What is clear, is that the new President of the Commission must assume not just the political responsibility for the Commission, but the political leadership as well."
"This Parliament must also recognise the exceptional nature of this moment."
"We must not allow ourselves to engage in a constitutional or institutional debate about dry procedures and put up bureaucratic obstruction to change, and rapid change at that."
"The impact on European public opinion, if the European Council and the European Parliament were to come together to put in place a new Commission able to demonstrate its commitment to serving the people of Europe, would be instrumental in rejuvenating the vision of Europe."
"Colleagues, our responsibility now is to address three principles to the Council."
"Firstly, we want immediate action to show we have grasped the moment; and we hope that the Council will accept the opportunity which the European Parliament has provided through the work of the independent group of experts."
"The first principle is immediate action."
"The second principle must be to insist on the use of the Amsterdam Treaty, whether it is formally in being or not as the way in which this Parliament will use our powers to ratify the new Commission; and our third principle should be for a strong candidate for the European Commission President, for a timetable for the new Commission to be in place and a strong and clear programme of reform."
"Those are the principles at which we should be looking in our deliberations over the next two days."
"I am sure those are the principles which the people of the European Union want to see as a result of the crisis that currently engulfs us."
"If we do that, working together, I believe that we have an opportunity now to demonstrate a new sort of future, a new sort of Europe for the next millennium."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my comments are directed primarily at the President-in-Office of the Council."
"It is clear, as you say, that the European Parliament has payed a significant role in this crisis."
"The Committee of Wise Men recognised that fact as well."
"Parliament has been taking vigorous action for over a year now on the basis of the Court of Auditors' reports."
"The same cannot be said of the Council."
"The report of the Wise Men says in as many words that the Council has been conspicuous by its silence in this whole affair."
"It is therefore useful to recap on the facts."
"More than a year ago, in March 1998, Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control voted, on the basis of Mr Elles's report, to defer granting a discharge in respect of the 1996 budget and asked the Commission to take the necessary measures towards the middle of September."
"In October 1998, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the independence, role and statute of the anti-fraud office which was to succeed UCLAF."
"The Commission was not yet able last December to comply with the European Parliament's demands."
"The PPE Group then brought forward a programme of action, to be implemented within twelve months, which would modernise the Commission by 1 January 2000."
"We called for an independent anti-fraud office, changes to the Staff Regulations and a code of conduct for Commissioners and senior officials, we called for the members of the Commission to be individually politically responsible, and we asked for Commissioners to make a declaration of their interests."
"The Socialist Group did not ask these vital questions."
"They voted in favour of the discharge."
"They subsequently tabled a motion of rejection which was in effect a vote of confidence."
"Sustained applause from the right"
"In January 1999, we called on Mrs Cresson to accept her political responsibilities and resign."
"This too was rejected, and the Committee of Wise Men was then set up."
"I admit that a majority of my group did not vote in favour of that."
"But, and please take note, the Committee of Wise Men agreed with the findings of the Committee on Budgetary Control, added to them and vindicated the positions which we as the PPE Group had adopted."
"Happily the Commissioners do not stand accused either of fraud or of lining their own pockets, but there is the fateful passage in the Wise Men's report, paragraph 9.9.2.."
"The Commissioners' argument that they were not aware of problems which were well known and known even at the highest level in their departments is tantamount to an admission that the political executive is no longer in control of the administration it is supposed to head."
"Much of the responsibility for this loss of control lies primarily with the Commissioners individually and the Commission as a whole."
"Things that had been going on for years unbeknown to many people have now been brought to light by this report of the Committee of Wise Men."
"The present Commission is also having to take responsibility for the previous one."
"The report of the Wise Men details it all: in 1990, tourism; from 1992 onwards, the programmes for the Mediterranean region, humanitarian aid, training under the Leonardo da Vinci programmes and security."
"The Committee of the Wise Men says that the supervisory bodies are a mess, that the procedure takes too long and that staff policy has been a machine running out of control."
"I wish to pay tribute publicly here, ladies and gentlemen, to the personal integrity of the Commission President, Jacques Santer."
"I wish to acknowledge that the political achievements of this Commission are impressive: the single currency, employment, preparations for enlargement and the preparation of Agenda 2000."
"I wish to state that the reforms which Mr Santer has proposed, for instance the codes of conduct, were impressive reforms."
"But the main thrust of the Wise Men's report has made praise impossible, which is why we must now express appreciation of the fact that you have accepted the political consequences of this Wise Men's report."
"Where do we go from here?"
"For the benefit of Mrs Green, I would say that we are willing to let the Committee of Wise Men continue with their work until April, but on condition that we are able to assess that work at our last part-session in May."
"We shall be discussing this shortly in the Conference of Presidents."
"Secondly, and here again I address myself to the President-in-Office of the Council, the Commission itself said in a statement of 17 March: 'we urge the Member States to appoint a new Commission without delay'."
"Whichever Treaty you care to apply, Maastricht or Amsterdam, this Commission will remain in office until the beginning of January 2000."
"After that and, I hope, after the European elections, a fresh decision will have to be taken by the conference of the European Union governments."
"We want a start to be made on the reforms straight away."
"We have no illusions."
"These reforms will take years, but we have to start on them right away."
"We want to see the new intergovernmental conference you have announced looking also at the question of the individual political responsibility of members of the Commission."
"And we want the measures we have been calling for since last year and in the discussions chaired by Mrs Theato, with James Elles as rapporteur, to be implemented at last."
"It will take time, but the time has come when we have to rebuild confidence."
"We need a strong Commission."
"It is the guardian of the Treaties."
"We need a Commission which is accountable, accountable to Parliament."
"We need a Commission which more than ever, as the Treaty says, is independent, transparent and above all pursues the general interest of the Union."
"A great many people, even some in this House, keep saying that all this is good for their country."
"Who talks about the general interest, the bien commun of the European Union, this European Union which is now in deep crisis?"
"This crisis can also be a challenge, a challenge not only for the new Commission, but for all of us."
"Let us try to make a true challenge out of this crisis and breathe new life into the European Union."
"Applause from the PPE Group"
"Mr President, this has been a week without precedent with the resignation en masse of the European Commission."
"That resignation follows the damning report by the Committee of Independent Experts of the Commission as an administration that in too many instances was out of control and a system where too few people were prepared to accept personal accountability and responsibility for their conduct of public affairs."
"I believe that Mr Jacques Santer is a decent man."
"His Commission included a number of positive and strategic achievements."
"The launch of the Euro, the conclusion of the Amsterdam Treaty, the preparation of Agenda 2000, the opening up of enlargement negotiations."
"In part, the Santer Commission, ironically, has become a victim of its own willingness to examine fraud and corruption within the Commission."
"In part, it has been a victim of the chaotic, undermanaged and sometimes unmanaged growth of responsibilities during the Delors years."
"Ultimately, however, this Commission was the author of its own demise."
"Over the past twelve months, in relation to the conduct of affairs with this House, Jacques Santer, unerringly if unwittingly, led his Commission to last week's crisis-in-the-making."
"At every critical point during that period, he has caused the Commission to offer to this House solutions that, had they been offered at the outset of each stage, might have worked."
"In the end, and always at that stage, they proved too little and too late."
"For his own political misjudgements, Jacques Santer has paid the ultimate political price and with him his colleagues have resigned."
"If this has been a difficult week for the European Commission, it has been a good week for European democracy."
"For the Parliament, this entire debate has represented a coming of age, a new maturity in understanding our democratic rights and our capacity and our duty to act in the public interest when we assert them."
"The system of governance in the European Union needs to be subject to more democratic control and public accountability."
"We believe we have crossed a new and irreversible threshold in that process."
"I might add that threshold is one we would never have crossed if we had followed the soft advice of a false sense of confidence commended by some to this House last December."
"For its part, the European Parliament will no longer be prepared to be presumed to be the junior partner in European decision-making."
"It is not that the Parliament should be first among equals, but from now on it must be an equal among equals."
"We find ourselves now in the process of creating a new, minimum and acceptable European norm for the management of public affairs and Community institutions which does not permit cultural exceptionalism."
"Hiring one's dentist to do work of dubious, if any, European value is not acceptable."
"Now, Mr President, I hope you will allow an English-speaker to talk to you in French to suggest that the language of Molière might be enriched by a new and typically European concept, that of 'berthelisme ', which means having a fictitious job paid for out of European taxpayers' money."
"The members of the Académie française could immortalise this word by putting it in the dictionary."
"Purists could never accuse it of being franglais, not that I would ever dare to offer such an insult to the members of the Académie ."
"Last week saw the downfall of a Commission in which some members had already made a start along the road to 'berthelisation ', and in future we will always be ready to condemn any Commission that again succumbs to the Berthelot syndrome."
"Berthelisme , of course, Mr President, is not confined to the corridors of power of the European Commission."
"The European Parliament must profit from this occasion to clean up its own act."
"We are vulnerable on the matter of top staff appointments."
"We remain vulnerable on the question of Members' travel allowances until the system is radically overhauled."
"We are not yet as transparent as we could be or ought to be on our individual group and collective expenditures financed by public purse."
"We cannot demand in this institution, of other institutions, what we would not demand of ourselves."
"The creation of new European norms of behaviour in office must apply with no less force and conviction to the European Parliament than they will to any future European Commission."
"The ELDR Group notes the implicit criticism of the Council in its role as one of the two arms of the budgetary authority for failing to give due and proper consideration to critical reports prepared by the European Court of Auditors on tourism policy on the MED and the ECHO Programmes."
"This failure by the Council to assume political responsibility should caution a certain modesty among those in some of our capital cities who seem prone to see the failings revealed in recent days as almost uniquely the creation of the European Commission."
"In this regard, we note with concern the relative ease with which the Council granted discharge for 1996; and we note with profound regret that on the very day of the publication of the expert committee report, the Council granted discharge, prematurely in our view, for 1997."
"It is not an inspiring example of responsibility in action."
"Where should we go to from here, is now the essential question."
"The ELDR believes that the Santer-led caretaker Commission has lost its political and moral authority to act and so it must go immediately and be replaced by an interim Commission for the balance of its unexpired term."
"The appointment of the new millennium Commission, due to take place in January next, we believe, properly is a matter for the new Parliament with a new mandate, with new political balances and with new powers under Amsterdam."
"The current treaties already provide a way; and if the Council wishes to add to that the spirit of Amsterdam, then we can proceed to an interim Commission appointment through that means."
"But let me make it clear that the renomination of Mr Jacques Santer or Madame Edith Cresson or some others to the interim Commission would not be acceptable to the ELDR Group in the light of recent events."
"Such nominations would risk provoking even deeper crises."
"For our part, the Liberal group has consistently argued the merits of individual accountability within collegiality."
"To this end, we do not tar all the outgoing Commission with the same brush."
"We are prepared to judge each on his or her individual merit in the belief that not all were personally responsible for the ineptitude or incompetence of some."
"Let me say to the President-in-Office that I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of my Group to wish the Berlin Council well, and to say that we hope you will achieve the objectives of Agenda 2000 which are now more essential than ever."
"But let me also say in concluding that when we come to appoint an interim and future European Commission, my Group, which has been to the forefront in criticising the current Commission, wishes to make it abundantly clear, that our wish is for a strong, independent political Commission; and any attempt to weaken this in the future is one that we would resist in Parliamentary terms."
"The Commission needs reform and Union needs a strong, independent, politically reformed Commission."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the serious problems identified in some areas of management at the Commission and highlighted in the report by the Committee of Independent Experts have led to the collective resignation of the entire Commission in line with the spirit of the Treaties."
"It was a responsible and courageous decision."
"Although the Santer Commission can be proud of its undeniable success in preparing for the introduction of the single currency and guiding it through on schedule, its unprecedented resignation has created a serious institutional crisis involving far more than just the question marks over certain Commissioners or European civil servants."
"Most of the facts which were identified as having led to the completely unjustified failings highlighted in the report originated under the previous Commission administration, which has gone unpunished."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would urge you to reread the chapter in the report on the Security Office, which was set up in 1990 and was directly answerable to the Commission President at the time."
"In more general terms, it is regrettable that all - and I mean all - the Union institutions succumbed to a sort of bulimia, which meant that a number of areas of activity were considerably extended: regional structural aid, external actions, the MED, PHARE and TACIS programmes, emergency humanitarian aid, reconstruction programmes for the former Yugoslavia, upgrading of nuclear power stations in Eastern Europe, and so on - I am sorry to say that this list is not exhaustive - without the structures and administrative procedures being adapted to deal with these new responsibilities and without any kind of financial control worthy of the name."
"Responsibility for this failure lies not just with the Commission, but also with Parliament and the Council, which not only agreed to the increase in the Commission's activities, but were often the ones that called for them to be increased in the first place."
"How can we get out of this institutional crisis?"
"First and foremost, we need to speed up the process of reforming the institutions, a problem that was unfortunately overlooked when the Amsterdam Treaty was negotiated."
"These reforms are also a prerequisite for enlargement, and we need to establish a strict timetable and a target date, perhaps 1 January 2002."
"Secondly, we must take the opportunity offered by the appointment of a new President and a new Commission to refocus the Commission's work on its main fields of responsibility as defined in the Treaties, while respecting the principle of subsidiarity."
"It would also be desirable to arrange for its management responsibilities to be transferred to the Member States and the partner states with which the Union has concluded association agreements, giving the Community bodies greater supervisory powers rather than direct administrative responsibilities."
"Finally, the new Commission President must undertake a programme of action to achieve these aims, which he must present for Parliament's approval."
"Working at the head of a new team, he must clean up the Commission and put his house in order, cutting out any dead wood and concluding any disciplinary and criminal proceedings arising from the cases of fraud or corruption which have been uncovered."
"There are currently 28 directorates-general and offices, not counting the decentralised agencies."
"This is far too many, and the number needs to be considerably reduced, since it is nothing more than a feudal system."
"What we need to do now is not to create more new European civil service posts, but simply to reorganise the management procedures and make them more efficient."
"The root-and-branch reform recommended by the Committee of Experts and the Court of Auditors must be implemented immediately."
"Firstly, effective and independent financial controls should be introduced to apply the Financial Regulation strictly, using reliable audit mechanisms."
"Secondly, an interinstitutional body - Parliament, the Commission and the Council - should be established to follow up the Court of Auditors' recommendations, which condemn the misuse of Community funding."
"Thirdly, a procedure for the award of contracts must be introduced which is totally transparent and is addressed to genuine professionals."
"To eliminate the temptation of corruption, which can occur all too often, the staff working in this field must be rotated on a regular basis, contrary to what has happened up to now."
"Fourthly, recruitment procedures must be reformed to prevent made-to-measure competitions which make nepotism and cronyism all too easy."
"All of these measures should be introduced as quickly as possible."
"However, the Treaty of Amsterdam, which is scheduled to come into force on 1 May, changes Parliament's confirmation procedures, so it would be better not to pre-empt matters before then."
"It would also be politically preferable for it to be the Parliament elected in June that applied these new powers, so we might need to consider bringing forward the date of the constitutive sitting in July."
"Finally, it is up to the Council and Parliament, the Union's two political institutions, to act in close cooperation to ensure that the European Union that emerges from this crisis has stronger structures and greater legitimacy for its activities."
"We rely on the governments not to shirk their political responsibility once again, but to reform all the European institutions to make them more democratic and efficient, so that we can meet the challenges of enlargement and globalisation that are currently the main driving force behind the political construction of Europe."
"Applause from the UPE Group"
"Mr President, it is abundantly clear that the European Union is currently experiencing the most serious institutional crisis of its history."
"The Commission itself is primarily responsible for the events which have taken place, but the governments of the Member States must bear a share of the blame as they have failed to allocate adequate resources to the Commission since the end of 1994."
"The Council should shoulder some responsibility for what happened too. It has been conspicuous by its absence throughout the present crisis."
"The Commission failed to meet the objective its President outlined when he assumed office and declared it was important to act less but to do so more effectively."
"If this crisis heralds the birth of truly European public opinion and helps to strengthen transparency, it will have served as a step in the right direction - a step towards making the European Union more democratic."
"The European Parliament has emerged from the crisis with a greater sense of authority as a body that represents all the people of Europe."
"Successive treaties have increased its legislative powers and on this occasion, Parliament has clearly asserted its role as a monitoring body. In so doing, however, it has acquired additional responsibility which it must exercise wisely in the future."
"Indeed, politically, the Commission as a whole is deemed responsible. Although we recognise the discrepancy between the objectives and the resources allocated to achieve them, lack of political direction and mismanagement - which had already been brought into the open during the mad cow crisis - can never be justified."
"We appreciate the sense of responsibility displayed by the European Commission in resigning."
"Those of us who in the past have strongly criticised its handling of affairs must not now whip up public opinion against it. We must respect the individuals involved and the decisions they have taken."
"Nevertheless, we need to look to the future."
"Public opinion will not tolerate things carrying on in the same old way. If the people of Europe cannot trust the institutions that represent the European venture, they will no longer support it."
"The problem cannot be reduced to the search for some kind of superman or outstanding politician."
"People are certainly important, but so too are the methods, programme and objectives."
"The Commission's role in the European institutional balance is crucial. It defends the common interest, and it must continue to fulfil it."
"We therefore need a competent and responsible Commission."
"The next Commission must improve its decision-making processes. It should be borne in mind that successful implementation of policies is not merely an administrative task, but very much a political one."
"In the eyes of the people, the Commission should embody the values of transparency and responsibility."
"It must also make available to Parliament all the information it requires to fulfil its monitoring role, and this is a prerequisite for mutual trust and effective cooperation."
"I should now like to address the President-in-Office of the Council directly."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left very much hopes that a new Commission will be appointed at the earliest opportunity, in response to the wishes of the people of Europe and to enable us to meet the challenges of the next few months. Chief amongst these is the creation of employment and the promotion of the principle of internal solidarity within the framework of Agenda 2000."
"Our group has called for a new Commission to be appointed immediately."
"We therefore agree with Mr Fischer that the procedure and timetable for doing so should be decided at the Berlin European Council."
"We also call for early approval of a statute for Members of the European Parliament in the interests of transparency for all, not least for ourselves as Members of the European Parliament."
"Mr President-in-Office, we trust you will choose wisely."
"We shall not approve the nomination of a President without a programme or a Commission without clear objectives."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, for over a year, Parliament has been calling for transparency and above all financial transparency."
"For over a year, Parliament has had to fight in order to extract from the Commission the information to which it is entitled under the Treaty."
"Our experience was that we got the information in dribs and drabs, too late, and very often it was incomplete."
"Looking back over this parliamentary term, it is clear that of all the European institutions it is the European Parliament which has done most to expose real and fundamental problems of mismanagement, fraud and nepotism."
"Parliament has been prepared to be confrontational over this, and rightly so."
"If we had yielded last December to the Commission's threats or had gone along with the Socialist Group in approving the 1996 accounts, we would not be at the point we have reached today, a point it was absolutely essential that we should reach."
"The report of the independent experts fundamentally bears out what the Committee on Budgetary Control had uncovered in a number of reports."
"It bears out critical reports by the European Court of Auditors."
"And it vindicates Paul Van Buitenen, the official who was immediately suspended by the Commission and subjected to particularly fierce attacks."
"Applause from the Green Group"
"The essence of the problem raised in the report, however, is that there is no real - as opposed to mythical - ' collegiate' responsibility for the actions of the Commission members as a group."
"That focal problem must now be addressed."
"So I find it unfortunate that the Commission's initial reactions last week were very much ones of defence and denial."
"Parliament has had similar experiences in recent years."
"We therefore find ourselves in a difficult situation, a time of crisis, but one from which the European institutions may emerge strengthened."
"I think I can see the first signs of that."
"This is the very first time I have seen a debate surfacing everywhere in the 15 countries of the European Union in which ordinary people are discussing how they view the Commission, how they view Parliament and what they expect of the Council, and this is something which is new and particularly important for the future."
"We therefore think it is indeed vital for the Council to name a new Commission President as soon as possible, who can appear before Parliament ahead of the elections with a new team."
"The new President must be a strong European figure with vision and managerial qualities, so that reforms can be carried out in what remains of 1999."
"We believe those reforms must include the following: a clear body of control mechanisms, a bridging of the deep divide between political control and the actual implementation of programmes, a good set of Staff Regulations giving officials the right to speak out freely, and the development of a culture of open debate amongst the institutions and with the European public."
"Lastly, we think it crucial that Mr Van Buitenen should be reinstated."
"He has played his proper part as a European official."
"Mr Cox is of course right in saying that Parliament too must continue cleaning up its own act."
"But we must focus here on our remit of exercising scrutiny over the institutions, and in that respect it is our duty to exercise full scrutiny over the executive, the Commission."
"Applause from the Green Group"
"Mr President, my speech is mainly addressed to the President-in-Office of the Council, since he is now the only officer on board - indeed, almost the only officer left - after the resignation of the Commission and the departure of Jacques Santer, to whom I would like to pay tribute."
"Unfortunately, Joschka Fischer has already left, pressed for time, no doubt."
"I have to say that he is facing an uphill task, since he is going to have to make progress on Agenda 2000 by ensuring that the Berlin summit is a success, while at the same time seeing to the appointment of a new Commission."
"On this last point, there is a very clear conflict of interests between Parliament's desire to keep the power vacuum that we have had for the last week to a minimum and our concern, in selecting the new Commission, to follow the highly detailed procedures that allow Parliament to exercise its prerogatives in full, in other words the procedures provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty, which inevitably take a long time."
"There is also a conflict between the desire to change all the outgoing Commission in order to make a completely fresh start and the concern to ensure continuity in the main policy areas at a particularly busy and delicate time, which would obviously be easier if some Commissioners could remain in charge of certain issues."
"In addition to these conflicts of interest, there are also the very different feelings that we ourselves have about all this."
"Our group feels that it is very important that Parliament played its political role, sometimes rather hesitantly, admittedly, but it did so all the same, and it has emerged in a stronger position."
"It has been progress for democracy."
"At the same time, however, we need strong European institutions and in particular a strong Commission."
"So we need to find some sort of middle way between laxity, negligence and wastefulness on the one hand and systematic, destructive criticism on the other."
"Reform is needed for this, and all the institutions must make an effort here: the future Commission, of course, the future Parliament, naturally, and the Council of Ministers, because the Council of Ministers bears a great deal of the responsibility for the problems which have been identified."
"It was mainly the Council which gave the Commission so many more tasks but without the funding to be able to carry them out, and it has seriously neglected its supervisory responsibilities."
"Here again, as the President-in-Office has just said, we are going to have to get round the contradiction of wanting to do more without spending more."
"I wish the Presidency-in-Office the best of luck, since it will now have to shoulder the burden of getting the institutions out of the first political crisis to hit the European Union."
"Mr President, the Europe of Nations Group would like to thank the Wise Men, because they are not looking for scapegoats but are instead indicting the system."
"The problem is the culture of secrecy."
"The Wise Men are very precise in their conclusion: they have not found a single person who has shown the slightest sense of accountability."
"That is a severe judgement on all the members of the Commission."
"None of them should therefore be able to be reappointed now."
"We propose a temporary Commission composed of independent persons who are not themselves tainted."
"We would like to see an investigation of the charges against the current Commission and the apparatus of officials."
"There must be accountability, especially for those who have helped to withhold information."
"If it transpires that there are members of the Commission who are on record as having been strongly opposed to the adoption of the accounts and other regrettable decisions, then they could be considered for reappointment in January."
"But now, after first deciding to stand shoulder to shoulder and accept collective responsibility, the members of the Commission cannot turn round and say that they no longer share this collective responsibility which they recently took upon themselves."
"All of the Commission must go and not come back."
"The Wise Men should continue their work and extend it to the other institutions, including Parliament."
"There are now 1 000 committees, 10 000 laws - with even more amendments - and 100 000 projects."
"The temporary clean-up Commission should examine these committees, rules and projects to see what can be handed back to the Member States."
"A new Commission will be no more able to manage what the old one could not manage."
"We are all indicted in the Wise Men's report, especially those who have voted in favour of the many new areas of responsibility."
"The solution is not new faces, but an extensive clean-up."
"Those who have engaged in fraud and covered up fraud will be held to account, and Mr Van Buitenen should return to his job and have his salary paid."
"The solution is a leaner form of cooperation with complete openness: a lean and open Europe."
"Madam President, if the Commissioners who so badly abused the confidence placed in them had resigned, we would not now be witnessing its members jockeying for position; but probably those Commissioners refrained from resigning at the suggestion of their own coteries."
"Indeed, it now seems clear that the Council of Ministers is seeking to discredit the entire Commission rather than to highlight the shortcomings of individuals."
"The internal feuding has died down and given way to a common aim: to nominate a new Commission which will remain in office for some six years and to appoint the President of the Commission, thereby depriving the future European Parliament of its new power - conferred on it by the Amsterdam Treaty - of appointing the new Commission President."
"An institutional confrontation is taking place."
"The Council of Ministers wishes to tie the hands of the Commission; it wishes to strip Parliament of the role so painstakingly acquired over so many years."
"The result could be to recreate that democratic deficit which once again seems to suit the governments, in that they are working for their own partisan interests and against political union. We reiterate our protest about this."
"We all know that, without political union, economic union will remain wishful thinking, useful only to powerful lobbies but remote from - if not detrimental to - the needs of the European people."
"An institutional war is therefore under way, to prevent the Commission and Parliament from cooperating constructively with one another and to place Europe's future in a strait-jacket designed by the Council of Ministers."
"But a political war is being waged too: the majority in the next Parliament, which ought to appoint the Commission President, might in fact be different from that in the Council, which represents 13 left-wing governments out of 15."
"Alleanza Nazionale resents the fact that this crisis could have been foreseen and avoided; we would draw attention to the potentially negative impact on the turnout at the elections if the appointment of the new Commissioners is not marked by transparency and propriety; and we urge that, if the decision is to nominate a new Commission rather than to extend the mandate of the existing one - replacing the disgraced Commissioners - then its term of office should be limited, expiring on 31 December, since Parliament has political responsibility for appointing the new President."
"Any other procedure would deal a blow to democracy and an insult to the European people."
"But let us also remember that there was already talk a few months ago of the Council of Ministers wishing to proclaim the new Commission before the elections: even then, therefore, there was a clear intent to deprive Parliament of its powers and steer the elections in a particular political direction."
"This is scandalous and undemocratic!"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, when several crises coincide, as is happening at the present time, a President of the Council really ought to possess the capacity to be in two places at the same time."
"Perhaps we should go ahead and adopt that now as one of our future reforms."
"Mr Fischer was unable to stay here with us, because he had to return to Bonn for a special meeting of the Federal Cabinet on the Kosovo crisis."
"I convey his apologies to you."
"The presidency sees the resolution of the Commission crisis in which we are now immersed as a joint responsibility of Parliament, the Council and the Member States."
"That is why I am pleased that a broad consensus has emerged in the course of this debate here in the House, as well as a great deal of concurrence between the opinions expressed here and the view of the Council."
"We want a quick and convincing solution - a solution that is likely to restore and strengthen public confidence in the European institutions."
"That is why we do not seek an interim arrangement; we want to have a clear idea of what awaits us in the coming years."
"We have to know now where the good ship Europe is headed and whose hand will be on the wheel."
"I agree with all of you who have said we need a Commission that will set about the task of internal reform of our work and our institution with great energy and vigour."
"The new Commission will have to meet very high standards."
"For that reason, we must take great care to ensure that the proposals which we in the Member States and the Council make are consistent with those standards."
"We want to take the first decisions in Berlin."
"What I believe we can certainly achieve is a procedural agreement, in other words on what we actually want to decide and when we intend to make those decisions."
"The presidency is thinking along the lines of following up the Berlin summit with an informal special summit at which the principal player would be selected."
"If more can be achieved in Berlin, so much the better."
"But that cannot be guaranteed, because we have to unite 15 Member States behind a common stance."
"You know how difficult that is."
"Let me emphasise how important it is that the rights of Parliament are properly respected throughout this decision-making process."
"This means that, whenever the new Commission President and the new Commission are nominated, the rights of Parliament under the Amsterdam Treaty must be upheld."
"Any other solution is unfair to Parliament and, for that matter, to the new President of the Commission, if we are thinking of making a decision now that will last until 2005."
"I see a very important message and a valuable token of your support in paragraph 9 of your joint resolution, which categorically states that our present problems must not serve as a excuse for deferring or avoiding important substantive decisions."
"The priorities are quite clear: in three days' time, in Berlin on Thursday, we must bring Agenda 2000 to a conclusion, and we must ensure that the Commission crisis is quickly overcome."
"We also agree that the reform process in the European Union must include all the institutions."
"I have no wish to dismiss the possibility of the Council examining how it can organise its work more effectively and reflecting on the mistakes it might have made."
"Indeed, I believe it is necessary for us to do that."
"I should like to refer to another point that was discussed here."
"One of the reforms we shall have to tackle is the Members' Statute."
"This has no direct bearing on the Commission, but it is another very important point under the general heading of institutional reforms."
"Let me assure you that the presidency vigorously supports Parliament's aim of adopting the Statute before the end of the present legislative term."
"That is the only sensible way forward."
"I should like to appeal to you, ladies and gentlemen, to exert influence on the political decision-makers in your own countries so that we can obtain the broad support we require in the Council; unfortunately, we do not yet enjoy that support, but there are signs of progress."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is pleasing to hear what we have just heard from the President-in-Office."
"However, I have to say, Mr Verheugen, that well-intentioned statements from the Council are part of the tradition of this House."
"You will understand the importance we attach to checking whether such pledges are actually honoured at some time in the future."
"But I believe that what you said between the lines, as it were, is correct, and I agree with you there: we should not really be talking in terms of a crisis in the European Union."
"In our own countries, when a government loses its majority and the confidence of the national parliament, that is a crisis for the government, but it is not a crisis of state."
"It is possible, of course, for government crises to develop into state crises, and the crisis between the institutions here - particularly within the Commission - could develop into a crisis of the European Union, but that is what we all intend to prevent."
"What we have heard today from the Council presidency sounds hopeful, in so far as it indicates that nothing in the institutional relationships between Parliament and the Commission and between Parliament and the Council will ever be the same again."
"Our relationships will be realigned."
"The two other institutions will appreciate our desire to shift the balance in favour of Parliament - not because we are out to sap the strength and usurp the powers of the other institutions, but because Parliament has grown in strength through its own activity."
"It has certainly not been easy."
"If I think back a few weeks and months - to January, for example - I remember that all the political groups, especially the main ones, were riven from top to bottom over one issue or another."
"The fact that this is no longer the case is due to the minimum consensus we reached in January, to the fact that Parliament itself appointed an impartial committee."
"I very much hope that, when the committee of five experts has presented its second report and we sit down to deal with it, such an intermediate step will no longer be necessary."
"Parliament must be able to do that under its own steam if it takes itself seriously."
"But if that is the case, then I believe it is also self-evident that the general institutional reform which needs to be undertaken - since there can be no enlargement before the institutions are reformed - will be carried out as a genuine joint task, just as we must jointly appoint the new Commission."
"In particular, the next revision conference on the expansion of the Treaties, especially as regards the reform of the institutions, can no longer be a conventional intergovernmental conference."
"It will have to be a conference of the European institutions, and above all of Parliament and the Council."
"Madam President, this is certainly the first time that the European Union has been in this situation, and I hope it will be the last."
"Following the scathing report from the Committee of Wise Men, the resignation of the Commission was a necessity, but it could have come sooner."
"We could have had a different outcome if the Commission had taken advantage of the stay of execution we granted it when the budget discharge was deferred."
"Had that happened, we should not be in this situation today."
"Parliament could also have brought this whole matter - which has been described here as both a crisis and an opportunity - to a head two months earlier if it had made full use of its powers and passed a vote of no confidence."
"Secondly, it emerges clearly from the Wise Men's report that the European Parliament and its Committee on Budgetary Control acted correctly."
"They exercised their powers of scrutiny."
"They brought the problems to light."
"And now the consequence of this is that we must initiate the action set out in the Elles report. We must look to the future, introducing and implementing appropriate reforms."
"A third point I take from the report is that the information Parliament was receiving from the Commission was inadequate; it was misleading and even fraudulent."
"This will have to be investigated."
"We have a right to information."
"We are a controlling body, and it is up to us to determine what we need to inspect and which oral and written information we require for that purpose."
"What do we do now?"
"We must look forward, because for us in the European Parliament, elections are looming."
"But the public image of Europe is also on the line."
"So although we must get to the roots of the present problem, it clearly makes no sense to indulge in a surfeit of retrospection and soul-searching."
"The first thing we need is the rapid appointment of a new Commission."
"I believe it has to be an interim Commission, one which will take the action that needs to be taken, so that the year 2000 will see the installation of a competent, efficient and trusted Commission."
"Fourthly, the institutional gap between the administration and the Commissioners in terms of accountability must be closed as quickly as possible."
"This was one of the most damning criticisms of the Commission."
"I am not in favour of any further reports by the Wise Men; the real priority now is to implement with all possible haste the programme of work we have drafted, so that by the year 2000 we shall truly have eliminated all the abuses which have come to light here."
"It is important to look ahead and to create more democracy."
"I believe the citizens of Europe understand that we in the European Parliament have begun to grow into our role as the taxpayers' watchdog and the people's advocate."
"That is the path we should continue to follow."
"Madam President, it is remarkable how much progress the European Community has made in a couple of months."
"What was unthinkable even a few months ago has now been achieved."
"Individual responsibility on the part of Commissioners will be a fact in the future and the President-in-Office should be complimented on having recognised this fact."
"Of course, we need to continue collective responsibility to the extent that the Commission, as a legislature, should not be under the pressure of individual governments."
"But we need individual accountability as many speakers have said."
"We are not only at the end of a road, we are at a new beginning."
"This requires real vision on the part of the Council, Parliament and the Commission."
"We need a new balance."
"I should like to ask the President-in-Office a question on this point."
"I listened carefully to him when he said that we did not need an interim Commission."
"I would draw his attention to the fact that paragraph 7 of our resolution speaks both of a Commission until the year 2000 and a new Commission."
"There is a certain ambiguity in the language of the Council."
"The President-in-Office says that we need to work with the Treaty of Amsterdam - I hope he speaks on behalf of all 15 Member States - which means that this Parliament will co-decide who is going to be the new President."
"I hope it is realised that there cannot simply be one candidate."
"Secondly, we want action quickly."
"All speakers have emphasised this point."
"Can we appoint a new Commission during the first week in May when this Parliament is ending its work?"
"I hope that is the case."
"If it is not, we would impinge on the rights of the new Parliament which is sovereign and should give legitimacy to the Commission for the next five years."
"How can that be ensured?"
"The President-in-Office needs to reply to that point."
"If we do not have a new Commission with the full assent of Parliament, it means that the new Commission will only work until September or maybe October this year."
"If that is the case, it will be a total contradiction of what we are saying, namely that we need a new Commission as quickly as possible, and that includes the point made by President Santer."
"This fundamental point should be emphasised because the ambiguity may lead to a misunderstanding."
"My final point is that we should not look at the form but the substance."
"The substance of change, namely putting into action the reform programme of Commissioner Santer, is essential."
"He was right to emphasise that many of these things have already started."
"It now comes down to the question of implementation and this needs some experienced Commissioners who are already there."
"We need a clean-up Commission until the end of this year and I hope the President-in-Office will read carefully the joint resolution by many groups which says that we must have action first and real reform later."
"This ambiguity needs clarification."
"Otherwise this debate will yield only half a result."
"Thank you, Mr Brinkhorst."
"I have no doubt that the Council has heard you and will be considering the question you have put to it."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, I come from a country, Portugal, which has always believed in strong men."
"I personally have greater faith in strong institutions - strong institutions made up of strong men, of course."
"In fact, the problem of a weak country, like a weak Europe, is that it does not have strong institutions."
"And the reason they are not strong is the current Zeitgeist : an extreme centre under which everyone is equal, the parties are all stealing each others' clothes, we all speak the same language and there is no ideology to speak of."
"An example of this was the motion of censure submitted by the Socialist Group, which was really all things to all men, and of course sowed confusion amongst Members."
"In the end a different motion emerged, similar to the one at the time of the BSE debate, and the result was inevitable."
"It has been like the dénouement of a bad Aristotelian play, because there has been no deus ex machina , just intrigue leading to the calamity and the final outcome we are now witnessing."
"I am of course happy for one crisis to lead to another, as this is the only way strong men will come forward who can decide what Europe needs to do."
"Madam President, the Commission is paying the price for having such an untransparent and secretive style of management."
"Its resignation is a sign of crisis and indicates the failure of a Europe cut off from its citizens, turning its back on social needs and thumbing its nose at democracy."
"The Commission and the Council must learn their lesson from this by radically changing some of their practices."
"The Commission has long felt itself to be above any form of control and has refused to give Parliament the explanations it has demanded for the serious irregularities identified over a number of years."
"Its behaviour has often been obstinate and arrogant."
"It has been obstinate in following an ultra-liberal line which the public has increasingly rejected and in pursuing policies which Parliament and the Council have strongly contested, such as the liberalisation of postal services and trade relations with the USA."
"It has been arrogant in the way it has justified these policies and its undemocratic management style, though this is certainly not intended as a criticism of the work of the European civil servants, for whom we have the greatest respect."
"The irregularities which have been identified must never happen again, and this means that both the methods and the approach need to be changed."
"The Commission and the Council must stop seeing the fight against employment as a matter for discussion rather than action."
"The current emphasis on financial profitability and price stability must give way to policies promoting jobs and growth with binding targets, and the task of the ECB must be revised accordingly."
"Europe needs a breath of fresh air to bring it greater transparency and democracy."
"The relations between the European institutions and their respective responsibilities need to be clarified, and the Council must face up to its responsibilities, which has not always been the case."
"I myself think that having a stronger Commission would not solve any of our problems, quite the reverse."
"What does need to be stronger is Parliament's monitoring of the Commission and its initiative-taking and evaluating role, in conjunction with the national parliaments."
"We also need to have more widespread democratic debates on European issues throughout the Union."
"It is high time that the public in the European Union became involved in the building of Europe, so that they can impose transparency, democracy, a spirit of responsibility, ethical standards - all in all, respect for themselves as citizens."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the Commission, rather than the whole of Europe, was embroiled in a profound crisis - of that there is no doubt - and that the crisis had already gone on too long."
"To that extent, the resignation of the Commission is only logical; it is a salutary shock that clears the way for the rebirth of credibility."
"The soul of Europe is embodied in its people, who rely on their representatives to continue the work of unification democratically and efficiently to the best of their knowledge and judgement - in a word, responsibly."
"The Commission that has just resigned, however, had lost the confidence of Parliament and the people."
"That is why the first and foremost requirement is the earliest possible appointment of a new Commission, headed by a strong European personality, a Commission that is determined to serve until the year 2004."
"The ball is in the Council's court, and it must come up quickly with the necessary proposals."
"I believe this has to take place before the elections to demonstrate to the public that we can get things done."
"At the same time, I am well aware that, before the elections, parliamentary assent is still governed by the Maastricht rules, but it is the spirit of Amsterdam that will determine the political implications of our assent."
"That is why the new President of the Commission must be granted the right to demand the resignation of individual Commissioners who transgress."
"But the need for reform applies to every institution."
"The constitutional fabric of Europe, the balance between the institutions, the need for greater powers of legal redress for the citizens of the Union - all of these things have been on the agenda since at least the last intergovernmental conference in Amsterdam."
"For that reason, Mr Verheugen, I should like to propose that, when you give the starting signal for the next intergovernmental conference under your presidency, you involve the European Parliament from the outset and ensure that we are not left standing outside the gates again when the chips are down."
"This crisis is simply crying out for the establishment of a new relationship between the Council and Parliament."
"Grasp that opportunity now!"
"As you know, Madam President, I am a relatively new Member of the House."
"When I first came here, I was full of admiration for the Members of the European Parliament and especially the Committee on Budgetary Control, which had carried out very rigorous and very clear analyses of what was going wrong in Parliament."
"I admired Parliament and was proud to be a part of it, because it pushed for real action to be taken."
"We could, then, have reached a decision back in the autumn."
"At the end of the year, we were ready and already felt that a motion of censure was appropriate."
"We tabled one, and in the end almost half the Members of Parliament voted in favour of it at the start of this year."
"Some Members, a majority, thought that we ought to secure more evidence from a committee of independent experts, and we got it."
"The Commission then accepted its responsibilities, and we think that is a good thing."
"Throughout all this, however, the Council has remained deaf and blind."
"Even after the Commission resigned, it barely troubled to investigate in a number of Member States what the charges were and what the new Commission's remit ought to be."
"There is, after all, no question of the present Commission, which has just resigned, staying put."
"That is not an option."
"In any event, we want the incoming Commission to discharge its responsibilities fully and clean out these Augean stables."
"It will need to be a strong Commission."
"It is of no great interest to me whether it is a short-term or a long-term Commission."
"What matters is that the rights of the European Parliament, in other words the rights of our citizens, should be fully respected, now under the Maastricht Treaty and soon under the Amsterdam Treaty, and not before time."
"The main thing is for the Council to appreciate that the Commission must be flanked by a strong and democratically elected Parliament; respect for Parliament must ensure that the Council gives us a Commission which we can fully endorse and with which we can cooperate, so that we never again have a recurrence of what we have seen here in the last few months."
"Madam President, it is always tempting to rewrite history, but the facts always tend to remain obstinately the facts, and the fact is that the European Parliament has by no means always played the role it should have done in the events since August which have now led to the resignation of the Commission."
"Let me remind you that last December and January it was Mrs Green, on behalf of the Socialist Group, who said that anyone who felt able to tell the public, the Commission and Parliament that they had no confidence in the Commission's financial abilities had no place in this House, and it was Mr Martens, the chairman of the PPE Group, who said that his group still had every confidence in the President of the Commission, and if a majority in Parliament voted against the Commission it would be an out-and-out disaster."
"Mr Cox and Mrs Lalumière said that they personally would be voting in favour of granting the discharge."
"The report by the Committee of Independent Experts, which is an excellent one, merely repeats what Mrs Wemheuer and Mr De Luca wrote in their report on tourism, what Mr Fabra Vallés wrote in his report on the MED programmes and in his work on ECHO, and what Mr Elles himself said in his report on the discharge."
"The Committee has a good deal more to say, a point which it has made itself, and the statements we hear each day from its members would seem to indicate that they should be given further work to do here."
"This is why the Committee should be asked to produce a second report, and why it should also give its opinion on how Parliament operates, so that everything is out in the open and no one can say that Parliament too is afraid to confront its own style of management."
"We need a temporary committee to implement the remedial measures in the same way that the Committee of Experts diagnosed the problems."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our colleague Jean-Claude Martinez was the first person to condemn the Commission's mismanagement, serious errors and lies during the BSE scandal in 1990."
"We have had to wait another nine years before the Commission was forced to resign."
"The report by the Committee of Independent Experts of 15 March, which among other things criticised the Commission for having lost control of the administration it is supposed to manage, was absolutely scathing."
"This mafia-style political mismanagement in the Commission, which goes back to the time of Jacques Delors, is partly explained by the fact that it is directly responsible for the management of considerable sums of Community funding, and that civil service work is delegated to external consultants or subcontractors selected on the basis of questionable criteria without any sort of advertising or transparency."
"Claude Perry, the director of Perry-Lux, admitted that out of 5 000 or 6 000 external experts working for the Commission, several hundred were in fictitious jobs and were receiving a daily allowance of BFR 2 860, as was the case with Euro-Conseil."
"The Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties meant that the Commission took on a great deal more work and Community programmes, all of which threatened to make individuals and businesses alike feel increasingly smothered."
"In this Orwellian world with its supranational and totalitarian administration, it became difficult, according to the Committee of Experts, to find anyone with even the slightest sense of responsibility."
"This lack of responsibility enabled the Commissioners, and in particular the Socialist Mrs Cresson, to turn a blind eye or to cover up fraud, malpractice and nepotism."
"Instead of the heavy punishment that Europe's taxpayers, having seen their money squandered, are entitled to expect, the Commission is proposing to pay the 20 Commissioners in question 60 % of their salary for three years, in other words a minimum of 60 000 francs per month."
"The voters and taxpayers are going to love that idea."
"This is why there is a justified upsurge of feeling against these anonymous officials who are trying to deprive us of our sovereignty, identity and freedom."
"When they vote for my list on 13 June in France, the public will be showing their political maturity and spirit of national resistance."
"Madam President, I think it is important to keep things in perspective as we confront the present situation."
"The European Commission has resigned following the publication of a report prepared by a Committee of Independent Experts, which both Parliament and the Commission had agreed in advance to abide by."
"Clearly, the Committee of Independent Experts is not endowed with divine right but it has drawn up a report and we must respond to its findings."
"The report did not find individual Commissioners guilty of fraud or misconduct."
"It arrived instead at the overall conclusion that the Commission had not been operating satisfactorily, that certain procedures were not appropriate and that the Commission was collectively responsible for this state of affairs."
"Accepting collective responsibility, the Commission then resigned."
"What should not happen is what we witnessed in the House this afternoon, when certain party leaders or leaders of political groups took advantage of the situation to attack other political groups for purely electoral reasons."
"There is no excuse for such behaviour."
"To use a biblical reference, I would invite whoever is free from sin to cast the first stone."
"As things stand at the moment, the fact is that it has been shown that the Commission was not operating satisfactorily, and as a result we need to appoint a new Commission."
"A constitutional procedure must now be embarked upon."
"The Treaties do provide for replacement of the Commission, yet Parliament finds itself in a difficult position as its term of office expires in June of this year. Consequently, unless Council nominations are received very soon, this Parliament will be unable to approve the new Commission."
"The task would have to be delegated to the new incoming Parliament."
"A word of warning is also called for, however. Our eagerness to monitor and scrutinise the Community's public accounts must not be allowed to hinder the Community's executive role."
"In other words, if the Committee of Independent Experts continues its work for an indefinite period of time and investigates every aspect of the Commission's activity, Parliament might well become a very powerful institution and a very effective one where monitoring is concerned, but there is a danger that this would hamper the normal running of the Commission."
"I believe there is a need for caution in following up the findings of the Committee of Independent Experts."
"My feeling is that rather than concentrating on further monitoring, we should come up with fresh ideas to ensure that the new Commission is properly structured."
"As previous speakers have already made clear, we hope in any case that the Council will set the course, prepare the programme and indicate what we can do in the few remaining months of our term of office. Parliament will then be in a position to judge whether or not it is in a position to fulfil the constitutional role laid down for it in the Treaties."
"Nevertheless, I think we should pay tribute to the former Commission, which is still in place in a caretaker capacity. We should pay tribute to the dignity of its members and to the dignified manner in which the Commission decided to resign, choosing not to continue in office."
"Madam President, following on from the views expressed by my colleague, I believe that the public's verdict on how we discharged our responsibilities during the present crisis will soon be made crystal clear at the ballot box."
"I am very satisfied with the active - and on occasion decisive - part played by my delegation."
"I am also very well aware of the implications for the whole process of putting forward a motion of censure with the contradictory aim of bolstering confidence in the Commission. Further, minutes before its crucial meeting following the publication of the much-heralded report, a de facto motion of censure was threatened, should the entire European Commission not have resigned."
"Returning to the present crisis, my view is, firstly, that a solution should be found as quickly as possible."
"Secondly, it is vital for the Berlin European Council to set out clearly the timetable and procedure to be followed."
"We should trust the wise judgment of the Berlin European Council."
"Finally, I feel that we should make all efforts to implement the Treaty of Amsterdam as it seeks to enhance the status of the European Commission."
"Above all, we need to maintain a sense of perspective."
"What our fellow citizens really want to know is how we are going to tackle unemployment more effectively, how we are going to continue supporting the agricultural sector, how we are going to put our economies back on track, how we are going to promote the development of our infrastructure and how, indeed, we are going to ensure that solidarity remains a pillar of our Union."
"These must also be our priorities."
"Consequently, every effort should be made to remain focused on what must still be the main objective of the Berlin European Council."
"Madam President, firstly may I say that I find it a pity that no one is left from the Commission."
"But anyway, after the report it was inevitable that the Commission should resign."
"To my mind, it would have been far better for democratic and political developments in Europe if Parliament had had the courage to send the Commission packing in January."
"Parliament has really hidden behind the skirts of the Wise Men and has thus let a political opportunity slip."
"As regards the report of the Wise Men, I think the conclusion that the Commission has totally failed in its duty is a little too black and white."
"This Commission prepared admirably for the euro and for Agenda 2000."
"Nor do I like the ease with which accusations are made against individuals and their families, without any proof."
"For the man in the street, it is not easy to distinguish between improprieties in Parliament and in the Commission."
"That is why clear measures are needed to show people, amongst other things, how the official machinery actually works, for the very specific reason that people have a strong aversion to officials, technocrats and their bureaucracy."
"So independent financial scrutiny is required."
"I agree with Mr Brinkhorst that action is needed."
"But we must not get carried away by the emotions of the crisis and take hasty decisions which we may later regret."
"We need a strategic approach to secure democracy in Europe."
"I think that only a new Parliament can install a new Commission."
"Madam President, as we see it, the Commission's resignation was the only conceivable outcome, particularly in the light of the report by the Committee of Independent Experts, which basically clarified and confirmed the reasons that led many of us to vote for the motion of censure - which some people claimed was a vote of confidence - back in January."
"Which means that, one way or another, we have now lost nearly three months."
"But the issue we are discussing today is the replacement of the Commissioners, and in that context we consider it essential that the Commission should be replaced as speedily as possible so as to reflect all the political and legal consequences of the Commission's resignation. Nevertheless, this speed should not prevent very serious reflection about the immediate and fundamental causes underlying this resignation."
"It is not enough for us just to change individuals - it is also crucial to change both working methods and policies."
"As we see it, these two aspects are the main reason for the Commission's resignation."
"On the one hand, there is a lack of transparency, with absurdly secretive management of instruments and public funds, which inevitably leads to irregularities, favouritism and fraud."
"But there is also the obvious insularity and remoteness of the Commission from the public because of the misguided policies that have been implemented and in particular because of their impact on our societies."
"Because of all this it has become necessary not only to change people, but also to find appropriate ways of changing our working methods and policies."
"It will be essential in future to provide for greater and more effective control of the Commission, in view of the concentration of both legislative and executive powers in that body."
"Indeed, the issue that we now have to tackle is not whether or not to strengthen the Commission, but above all how to keep a check on its activities."
"The next European Council will have to take all these aspects into consideration, and if possible, it will have to draw up a precise and realistic timetable in conjunction with Parliament so that these issues can be analysed and a new Commission appointed without delay."
"Lastly, I would like to mention that financial matters also feature on the agenda of the Berlin Council."
"It is particularly important for the Council to achieve a satisfactory outcome on both the Commission issue and Agenda 2000 - for it to be a success, the Council cannot accept just any solutions to these two important problems."
"This should be its chief concern."
"Madam President, those of us who have been taking steps here during the past two months to ensure that the Commission should be held accountable have won our case."
"We have demonstrated that we, the elected representatives, will not put up with nepotism and fraud under any circumstances, and so the Commission has at last been forced to resign."
"Obviously a new Commission should be appointed as quickly as possible so that work can be resumed."
"The guiding principle behind this undertaking must be to 'clean up' inside the Commission and create the conditions for a climate of openness and transparency - more valuable assets than ink and paper."
"That is really the whole point of the exercise."
"The Committee of Independent Experts, in its report, highlights one aspect in particular: that the Commission has lost control over a large number of projects."
"Consequently, this raises the question of whether the Commission has its fingers in too many pies."
"Is it not time to apply the subsidiarity principle and delegate competence in some fields to the Member States, for example in terms of cofinancing under the common agricultural policy?"
"The EU cannot deal with everything and the Commission is unable to fulfil the tasks allotted to it by the Member States, as the last Commission clearly demonstrated."
"I am not in favour of a strong Commission, but of a strong parliamentary system of government, which means that the European Parliament should have more influence and the Commission less."
"Madam President, the report by the special committee has shown beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is an urgent need for reform within the Commission."
"It has brought to light a culture of complacency towards irregular practices at the very highest level."
"This evidence might not have come to light had this Parliament not demanded urgent action in January."
"The report and its aftermath gives us an historic opportunity to force a seismic change in the relationship between the Commission and Parliament, to tackle the democratic deficit in the European Union and overhaul the system of scrutiny."
"The Commission not only needs to be brought under democratic accountability, I want to see MEPs given tough new powers to tackle mismanagement, fraud and nepotism."
"Now that they have resigned there should be no question of some Commissioners returning to their posts."
"Having volunteered to accept their collective responsibility and resign it would be incomprehensible to the citizens of Europe if the same individuals were to be reinstated."
"This Union's institutions, with Parliament playing a major role, must ensure that a new Commission is put in place soon, charged with the responsibility of ensuring that a complete reassessment of Commission management and structure is initiated and that the new Parliament after June must have its opportunity to judge those who are nominated to the Commission from 2000 onwards."
"Madam President, I will start by reminding the Council presidency of what paragraph 9.4.12 of the Committee of Wise Men's report says."
"I quote: 'the external auditor (the Court of Auditors) produced reports which were clear and to the point (for example in 1992 and 1996 on tourism and in 1996 on MED and ECHO)."
"However, only one of the two arms of the budgetary authority (Parliament) gave them proper consideration'."
"Manifestly, then, the second arm of the budgetary authority - the Council - has been seriously deficient here."
"The fact that on the very day the Wise Men's report came out, the ECOFIN Council made its recommendation that Parliament should grant a discharge for 1997 is, in my view, an illustration of how slack the Council is."
"The Council will be taking great risks if it seeks to reappoint Commissioners who are currently in office."
"We think that the new caretaker Commission should not include any members of the present Commission, because the committee's work is not yet complete."
"All manner of new frauds and other irregularities may yet come to light."
"Waiting for the committee to complete its findings will take too long."
"The new caretaker Commission must take office as soon as possible."
"The Council has a heavy responsibility here."
"If it does not do its stuff quickly, the present Commission will still be around until the end of 1999."
"That is totally unacceptable."
"We have to have a caretaker Commission before the elections."
"People have to be able to see that something is being done."
"Mrs Cresson must go right away."
"On this too the Commission has to face up to its responsibilities, and Article 159 of the Treaty states that the Council or the Commission President can apply to the Court of Justice to have members of the Commission compulsorily retired."
"Mr Santer too has forfeited too much credibility as Commission President in recent months and weeks to be able to remain in office."
"His job must be taken over immediately by the Vice-President."
"We agree with what Mr Cox said on that."
"Mr Van Buitenen must be reinstated without delay."
"Madam President, whatever impression the Commission's dramatic resignation may have given, what is at issue is not the weakness of the men and women involved, but the lack of principle of the institution itself."
"There is no doubt that the Commission is unprincipled because it is neither one thing nor the other - half government executive, half administrative commission - and because all it does is to build a gilded cage around people, trapping them with increasingly interfering regulations and directives gilded with subsidies and patronage."
"Corruption is not the result of human weakness, it lies at the very heart of the European system, since what the Commission - and the European Parliament, incidentally - mainly does is to transform the wishes of numerous lobbies and interest groups into legislation."
"The Commission acts as a screen for the irresponsibility of the Council and the national governments."
"This is why, together with Bruno Mégret, the Members from the Front national - mouvement national do not see the point of simply plastering over the cracks, and we call for the Commission to be abolished altogether and replaced by just a secretariat at the Council of Ministers."
"Madam President, I should like to begin by taking up something said by Mr Martens, whom I normally hold in high esteem but whose reconstruction of this crisis I find unconvincing."
"I would remind him that the last crisis revolved around fraud."
"That, in our view, was an insufficiently sound point of departure."
"The Wise Men's report has proved us right: the current crisis revolves around structural political problems."
"This is what lies behind the crisis in the Commission, and we pro-Europeans believe that this could be a healthy crisis, bringing about a real reform of that institution."
"We are a thousand miles away from last time, when the issue was fraud."
"Having said that, I believe it is in the interest of Parliament and of all pro-Europeans - I repeat the term - to go into the elections with a new Commission, thereby proving that the European institutions are capable of moving rapidly."
"It is therefore very important, now that the Parliament and Commission have acted, that the Council should do likewise."
"Our role was to call for swift action, beginning in Berlin, and here I welcome the very clear statement from the Council President, Mr Fischer, who said this afternoon that Parliament could approve a candidate for President in April, and in May the new Commission."
"This means that the Heads of State need to reach an agreement before the April part-session of Parliament."
"That schedule suits us perfectly."
"We hope it can be adhered to, because it should minimise criticism of the European institutions and enable the Commission to confront the burning political issues rapidly."
"We wish to see swift action and a strong political solution, in other words a solution lasting more than just a few months."
"Furthermore, if possible - and we do think it possible, since it is a matter of political will - the Amsterdam procedure should be followed from the outset because, if the Commission is to be a strong one, it must first of all last for a reasonable period of time - not just until the end of the year - and secondly its President must have the enhanced powers conferred on him by the Amsterdam Treaty."
"This must happen, and all it takes is political will."
"Finally, the presidency must have various tasks: not only to administer the complex structure of the EU Commission, but also to reform it from within."
"Parliament has made a number of suggestions in this respect."
"My own suggestion to the Council is that it should explore in more depth the proposals on reform of the Commission which have been put forward by Parliament in various forums."
"We are convinced that all the European institutions are in need of reform in the run-up to enlargement, and that this crisis has occurred in the Commission because it is the nerve-centre and therefore the body most exposed to the repercussions of past enlargements and the increase in the EU's workload."
"But the other institutions, the Council and Parliament, are likewise in need of reform."
"I therefore believe that the initial step being taken - reforming the Commission and progressing towards a more democratic European Union - is the start of an important journey for the Union."
"Madam President, there is a well-known saying: 'Victory has a thousand fathers, defeat is an orphan'."
"Everyone is in favour of reform today, outbidding each other."
"This was not the case a few months ago."
"Most Socialists - apart from some notable exceptions - voted against allegations of mismanagement and the need for urgent reform of the Commission in December."
"Let us not try to re-write history."
"May history note that the real vanguard for change - as Mr Martens noted earlier - were those who voted in favour of refusing to sign the 1996 discharge."
"Without this act of defiance nothing would have happened and we would have gone on as before."
"Secondly, the Wise Men's Report has totally vindicated the findings of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"Mr Van Buitenen should now be reinstated."
"Furthermore, the enthusiasm of some colleagues, particularly Mrs Green, to take the conclusions of outside experts in a report probably drafted by the same people who have drafted our own reports in the Committee on Budgetary Control would seem to indicate that she takes outside experts' opinions more seriously than those of colleagues."
"Thirdly, when we come to appoint a new Commission, whatever its make-up may be, its real emphasis must be the reform of the Commission, continuing the programme for codes of conduct, the reform of the statutes and the screening report of the resources which are needed."
"Lastly, what we are moving to is a discussion between Parliament and the Council."
"The real question is: Do we want to have the rule of the few or the rule of the many?"
"As Pericles, in his funeral oration in the Thucydides version of The Peloponnesian War , said: 'If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; '"
"We are rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves. Its administration favours the many instead of the few."
"Madam President, I am sure we are all aware that the present situation is without precedent in the history of the Union."
"Times such as these are a test of the strength of the European Union, and reveal whether it is built on solid foundations or whether it is merely a house of cards."
"It is therefore incumbent on us to face this crisis squarely."
"Replacing the present Commission with another is not the only problem."
"What is on the table at the moment should certainly result in reform of the working methods of a single institution. Crucially however, it should also result in reform of all the institutions themselves, that is, Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"If it does not, we shall have squandered a unique opportunity."
"Parliament has every right to be proud of how it has assumed its responsibility and demonstrated its maturity."
"The resignation of the Commission ought to serve as a catalyst for the much-needed institutional reform."
"It is to be hoped that the Council will now rise to the occasion, give priority to the interests of Europe as a whole, dismiss the vested interests of individual Member States and seek a satisfactory way out of this crisis. We shall then be able to congratulate ourselves on having achieved a more robust, transparent and democratic Europe."
"Madam President, first of all, I am disappointed that this House is meeting today and tomorrow, rather than on the scheduled dates."
"Our conduct here smacks of submission to the requirements of the national governments."
"Although this might happen in national parliaments, it certainly would not in regional parliaments, where the sense of democracy is more pronounced."
"Such conduct gives us scant hope that Parliament really will exercise its rightful monitoring role."
"Let us acknowledge that, thanks to an initiative taken by a number of us - and then clumsily hijacked by the majority - we managed to expose an affair which reveals that, however well-equipped bureaucracies, technocracies may be, they are often prone to shortcomings which then lead to such improprieties as have now resulted in the individual resignations of several Commissioners."
"I think that we shall have to be far more vigilant in future and, most importantly, I take exception to the fact that some invoke the Amsterdam Treaty, seeking, that is, to use a new instrument, prematurely, to handle an old affair, belatedly."
"I should never wish to take away any of the new Parliament's powers, and I therefore urge that the new Parliament should be the one to decide on the Commission, so as not to have to live with a Commission on which it has had no say."
"Madam President, 'Shakespeare in Love' has won and Europe is ecstatic."
"You know the quotation from Hamlet: 'though this is madness, yet there is method in it' - it would be a good idea for Mr Santer to study William Shakespeare."
"But this is not madness, it is a revolution for the present and for the future."
"It is a revolution for the present because of the three things that brought it about."
"First there was the event itself: 16 March 1999 will go down in history as the day on which the Commission resigned."
"Then there was the de facto censure imposed by the European Parliament."
"In 1979 we had universal suffrage, and in 1999 we faced up to our responsibility."
"The construction of democracy is complete."
"Then there was the reason that caused the revolution: Parliament's criticism of the general lack of supervision."
"There have been no cases of individual fraud, it should be pointed out - we know this for a fact and anyone who says otherwise is lying."
"In Brussels, at the eye of the storm, people understood what was going on, but the public was alarmed by the lies they read in the Murdoch press and heard from the French populists, nationalists from all parties and populists in all the media."
"We have even heard some of them here today."
"People are being taken in just to win readers or votes and to bring Europe down."
"It is up to us to tell them the truth."
"It is a revolution for the present because of the lesson it has taught us, because Europe has given a lesson in democracy."
"In the Member States there are a good many parliaments and governments that should take inspiration from us to break free and to show greater responsibility."
"But it is also a lesson for the future and a revolution, in three ways, for tomorrow."
"First of all, everyone wants a strong Commission and everyone agrees that we need it, even the UPE Group."
"Jacques Chirac and Lionel Jospin agree on it, which is good."
"Jospin and Schröder agree on it, which is essential."
"Schröder, Jospin and Blair agree on it, which was unhoped for."
"Yesterday Major blocked everything, but today Blair together with France, Germany and the other Member States are all calling for Prodi."
"What a turn-about for the United Kingdom and for Europe!"
"The second aspect of the revolution for the future is new controls, new regulations, and new cultures."
"We have created the single currency, now we need to create common ethical standards for government in Europe."
"The third and final aspect involves elections plus responsibility."
"Our citizens elect us and we approve the Commission and monitor it."
"European democracy has just been born, and it is up to us to ensure that it grows up properly."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, for months we have been issuing warnings to the Commission at meetings and in personal conversations."
"They were not heeded, and the result is plain to see."
"We must recognise that times have changed, because the European Union now has the democratic strength to put its own house in order."
"I believe it is good news for the people of Europe that the system is democratic enough to ensure that an administrative apparatus cannot commit misdemeanours with impunity."
"But we must also recognise that this problem is not really about particular individuals."
"There were many honourable people in the last Commission, and we must not forget that."
"We must realise that this is primarily a structural problem; it is about a lack of efficiency within the European institutions."
"Unless we change the structures within the Commission, we shall be back in this same situation two years from now, because replacing the individuals at the top is only part of the answer."
"For that reason, we need to adopt certain procedures in connection with the installation of the new Commission."
"On the one hand, it is surely the case that the European public needs to see the right signals from us before the elections."
"On the other hand, there must be enough time to ensure that the procedure for appointing the Commission affords the opportunity for a radical reorganisation of that institution, and a good new President will use that procedure and the support of Parliament to gain the upper hand over the apparatus."
"Since the new Commission will want to remain in office for the next five years, we must also take account of our successors in Parliament, who will have to cohabit with and accept the Commission and who will also have to legitimise that same Commission in the future."
"I believe a compromise will take clear shape on this basis, and I think the Council presidency will be able to offer us a time-frame within which both requirements can be satisfied, so that we can manage the reorganisation and thereby create a better Europe."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it was the Wise Men's report that achieved what this Parliament could not achieve, namely to hold the Commission to account."
"That is a shameful admission."
"All those who did not support the motion of censure have been made to think again by the Wise Men's report."
"It is a fact that the 140 pages of the report contain nothing new."
"Be that as it may, the Wise Men did produce one pearl of wisdom when they stated that the Commission as a whole had lost control of its finances and its officials; with that statement, they placed the real problem at the door of the Commissioners, thereby revealing the limits of administrative powers."
"The resignation of the Commission was no heroic deed, but rather a case of the Commissioners jumping before they were pushed."
"The loss of confidence in this Commission is so calamitous that the only option for us is the quickest possible replacement of the entire team, but let me stress that merely replacing individuals is not enough."
"Real reforms are needed, not just tinkering."
"On the one hand the structures of the Commission must be thoroughly reviewed, and on the other hand there is an urgent need for an extension of the powers of scrutiny vested in this House."
"The fact that this debate is taking place is the real achievement of the Committee of Wise Men, because what is ultimately at stake here is the right of citizens to be governed democratically and to scrutinise the actions of those who govern them, and that right must not be allowed to fall by the wayside."
"Mr President, even though the Christian Democrats are late converts to the idea of a Committee of Experts which they opposed in January, we in the Socialist Group welcome the fact that they now support the establishment of the Committee of Experts and we look forward to its second report which will be published within the next couple of months."
"I want to focus my contribution this afternoon on that report."
"However, by way of comment, I would just like to say that the reforms we are looking for in the European Union institutions, as the previous speaker said, do not end with looking at the 20 Commissioners."
"That has been the focus for the last few months but what we need to do now is to find the causes of the widespread problems in the Commission and, more importantly, we want the Committee of Experts to recommend remedies."
"Therefore, I hope that the Committee of Experts when it meets during the course of the next few weeks and when it conducts its detailed investigations into the operation of the Commission, will look in some detail at the structural problems within the Commission."
"This is not just a question of political leadership."
"It is associated with the processes for personnel and financial management."
"It is about the whole management structure of the Commission; the relationship between the staff and their directors; the relationship between the directors and the directors-general; the relationship between the directors-general and the Commissioners and their cabinets."
"So it is extremely important that this second report, which we must now focus upon, looks at the necessary root-and-branch reform."
"I hope that at the end of tomorrow's vote, the resolution we pass will set out very clearly that we want the Committee of Experts to bring forward those recommendations."
"We do not want a generalised polemic from the Committee of Experts; we want specific recommendations about what it has discovered not only in relation to the last four and a half years but about procedures that, as we know, have gone on in the European Union civil service for many years."
"The challenge is how we act upon that."
"The critical thing for the Socialist Group is that we want a new President of the Commission in office as quickly as possible and we want that President to take the report of the Committee of Experts and to make sure that every step is implemented, not just in relation to the 20 Commissioners, not just in relation to the culture of the College of Commissioners, but for directors-general, directors and every level of responsibility and management within the Commission."
"If we do not do that the whole exercise of the last few months will have been a waste of time and we will have made no further progress in what is after all a major event for the public in the European Union."
"Mr President, may I say to Mr Donnelly that the President-in-Office told us we had made use of our democratic right and had done our duty."
"Had the Commission been prepared to give us access to all the relevant information when the scandal first broke, we should not have needed the Committee of Wise Men, and we are every bit as capable as the Wise Men of producing the second report if we obtain the necessary information from the Commission."
"Let me address a brief remark to the Commission and its President. It is not as if the crisis had already begun when the reforms started to bite."
"On the contrary, Leonardo did not appear on the scene until 1998, and the problems surrounding Mrs Cresson have only come to our attention in the last few months."
"That is why this is so disastrous, as is the fact that all the financial transactions which were undertaken by the Commission and which are now being criticised in the Wise Men's report were given the go-ahead by Financial Control."
"Lastly, may I say just a few words on the Wise Men's report and on our activity here in Parliament."
"Does it surprise anyone that the Socialist Group gagged those of its members who were against giving a discharge in respect of the 1996 budget?"
"Does it surprise anyone that the Socialist Group voted against Mr Bösch, the rapporteur on the Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, who is one of their own members, and does it surprise anyone that the coordinator of the Socialist Group in the Committee on Budgetary Control resigned her post in protest at the policy of her group leader?"
"Against this background, it was probably only to be expected that the head of the group would table a motion of censure with the intention of withdrawing it again."
"If the Socialist Group had behaved as consistently back in January as they now claim to have done, we might have had a new Commission up and running by now and could have spared ourselves the crisis we have all been discussing today."
"Mr President, I am afraid all this is what Shakespeare calls 'much ado about nothing', and so I do not think we have the basis for a new beginning or a clean slate."
"The problem of the European Commission, after all, affects all the Community institutions without exception: fraud, nepotism, profligate spending, lack of transparency over subsidies, inflated salaries."
"Who in Parliament would dare to claim that the Commission alone suffers or has suffered from these ills?"
"The fact is that the European institutions without exception, so Parliament as well, are too far removed from their people for normal democratic scrutiny to be possible."
"So the scandal over the Commission should above all lead to greater respect for the subsidiarity principle, drastic curtailing of the European policy of subsidies and hand-outs, and above all a greater exercise of scrutiny by the Member States and Member State governments."
"Until this happens, I fear that nothing much will improve."
"Mr President, I am surprised and saddened at the petty political way in which some colleagues are seeking to profit from what is an extremely serious situation."
"We are in fact facing a crisis in the institutions of the European Union, and we must face it head on."
"The resignation of the Commission was a demonstration of the political and personal sensitivity of all its members."
"However, it also demonstrated that the institutions we have established function and that we need to develop them."
"The European Parliament has displayed commendable composure and maturity in the face of this crisis."
"But the time has now come for our leaders to take some bold decisions which will work positively towards strengthening the institutions of the European Union."
"Some opponents of the European idea may have wanted to use this institutional crisis to strike at the very heart of what has brought us all here today."
"Decisions are difficult."
"However, vacuums and deadlocks are dangerous."
"The Community's Heads of State and Government must make prompt decisions and come up with an unequivocal solution."
"The President-in-Office has taken a positive step by declaring that the name of the new Commission President will be put forward by April."
"I do not think this is enough."
"Swift decisions also need to be taken regarding the other members of the Commission."
"Whatever constitutional issues may be outstanding could be settled and, in accordance with the Amsterdam Treaty, the Council and the European Parliament could work to implement the necessary reforms."
"We have the opportunity to restore the confidence that is needed in the institutions of the European Union. I think we owe this to the people of Europe, and we owe it to the idea of the European Union."
"Mr President, the crisis that is buffeting Europe is both a serious and a healthy one: serious because without a doubt it represents an unprecedentedly difficult moment, but healthy because - as others have said - from now on the topic of institutional reform can no longer be avoided."
"It must be tackled head on, prior to enlargement, and must open the door to economic governance in the Europe of the euro."
"This Europe has given itself institutions such as the European Central Bank to manage monetary policy; now it also requires authoritative political governance, authoritative political institutions."
"We are all in favour of autonomy for the Central Bank, but this should mean autonomy vis-à-vis another, much-needed, political body."
"This issue can no longer be ducked."
"However, what has happened is also healthy because it has at last raised the question of transparency."
"Each of us appreciates from our own experience the urgent need for transparency in the activities of the Commission."
"Anyone who has had connections with that institution, such as applying to participate in a programme, has experience of inadequate information and inadequately substantiated decisions."
"It is likewise healthy in that the Wise Men have established a sort of moral case-law, telling politicians to refrain from doing not just what is forbidden, but also what is inadvisable."
"This lesson in moral case-law could also usefully be learned by the various countries' national political leaders, if the public is to feel at ease with politics and its institutions."
"One must not do what is inadvisable."
"I too look forward to a rapid solution to the crisis and an authoritative Commission presidency, and I too would stress that - if the presidency is to be strong and authoritative - it cannot be a short-term one but must have sufficient time to plan its work."
"Mr President, no one wanted this crisis yet no one did anything to prevent it. Nevertheless, because of the regenerative and creative effect it will have, it should herald a new era in the life of our institutions and make them fit to serve a more ambitious European Union - a more transparent and democratic Union, and, of course, a more political one."
"But it should also be more responsible about the way it operates and controls its affairs, ridding itself of negligence and demagoguery and avoiding a scapegoat culture."
"We are experiencing real growing pains, with dwindling institutional resources required to cope with ever greater burdens."
"So it is not surprising that there is a sharp dividing line between collective and individual responsibility, and between Community and governmental responsibility."
"Nowadays, we cannot even rely on the legal certainty of legislative texts for either the past or the future."
"Mr President, that is why the institutions can only find a way out, a direction, a guideline, in political terms. Which means that it is up to the political powers that be, and in particular the Council and Parliament at present, to act swiftly to resolve this crisis."
"But acting swiftly does not mean acting with undue haste."
"It means that the Council should nominate a candidate to be President of the Commission within a reasonable deadline, and that this President should benefit from the democratic legitimacy bestowed by Parliament, which is absolutely essential for a strong Commission."
"And by strong, I also mean stable, and with a political future."
"Committees are not the way to achieve the necessary reform of the institutions and to imbue them with a fresh sense of drive."
"Parliament will be more than willing to swiftly resolve a crisis which, if it drags on, will only give ammunition to the European Union's enemies and weaken it economically."
"To do this, Parliament's demands will have to be heeded, but it is willing to reach political agreement with the Council on a solution."
"Mr President, the epicentre of this crisis is not Brussels - its origins lie in every single capital of the fifteen Member States."
"It is now incumbent on the Council, and in particular the German Presidency, to put its cards on the table and acknowledge its responsibility."
"We will be waiting here to listen to its proposals."
"Fortunately, according to what the President-in-Office of the Council has told us today, it seems that the Council is on the right track and is adopting a common sense approach."
"Let us hope so!"
"Mr President, in this debate on the resignation of the Commission and the forthcoming summit in Berlin, I would like to start by thanking the good Commissioners for all the work they have done in recent years."
"It is a pity things had to come to such a pass and that a call in January from this Parliament, and from a large proportion of my group's members, to dismiss those Commissioners who were under fire was not acted upon."
"If that had happened in January, both the Commission and Parliament would have emerged stronger from this conflict."
"Now the good Commissioners have been swept aside together with the bad ones."
"That really is a shame."
"And I cast a critical glance at our Socialist friends, because if they had helped us in January with that resolution, all the things which have happened would not have done so."
"We endorse the departure of the entire Commission as something which is inevitable."
"We hope to see a new Commission very soon, starting with a new Commission President."
"But we believe it has to be a caretaker Commission, because a truly definitive Commission can only be appointed once the elections are out of the way."
"That seems to me to be the normal democratic rule."
"In our Member States too we do not appoint governments first and then hold elections; we do it the other way round."
"As regards the President, it would actually be nice if Parliament could nominate a candidate."
"There are, as I understand it, three of them: Mr Prodi, Mr Solana and Mr Kok."
"I would be happy with any of them, but my own personal preference would be for Mr Prodi, the man we know best."
"He has my vote."
"Anyone who can steer Italy's bureaucracy and its economy along the right track can cope with Brussels."
"So as far as I am concerned, Mr Prodi would be a most welcome choice."
"One last remark on Agenda 2000, because this too will be discussed in Berlin."
"I very much hope that changes will be made to agricultural policy, because the way it is shaping up is not good."
"I hope that changes will be made to the Structural Funds."
"I hope above all that the Netherlands will score better on Agenda 2000 than it has done so far, because the current Dutch Government can probably prepare itself rather better than it has been doing."
"As far as that is concerned, we wait eagerly to see if the results are better than they look like being."
"We await the debate on Agenda 2000 and the advent of a new Commission with equal interest."
"Mr President, the view of the Dutch members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists is that the Commission's decision to resign was the only one possible in the light of the Committee of Wise Men's report."
"So that is rather different from what Mrs Maij-Weggen said just now, from dismissing two Commissioners on grounds of alleged fraud and saying that their resignation had to be seen as the preliminary outcome of a trial."
"It is more important for Parliament now to be pulling together to establish a new position vis-à-vis the Council than for her to be claiming which group was the instigator of the trial."
"This new position, this new culture, must be reflected in the implementation of the code of conduct, the development of individual responsibility for Commissioners, a revision of the Staff Regulations, and the Members' Statute."
"This new attitude from the Commission in its way of working and its dealings with Parliament can be summed up as the end of arrogance."
"That is undoubtedly a gain for Parliament, provided it is not replaced by arrogance on the Council's part."
"Perhaps the Council will find it hard to work under pressure of time."
"But it is of the utmost importance to have a new Commission as soon as possible, in advance of the elections to a new European Parliament."
"It will have to draw up an ambitious programme, to be evaluated by the House. The current Parliament can inform the new Commission of the reforms that are required."
"A new Commission will have to commit itself to these."
"With the heralding of the Commission's new term of office in the year 2000, Parliament can then monitor the Commission's performance as it carries out this programme."
"So we want a new Commission for five and a half years, with a six-month probationary period."
"A good Commission does not need to fear a review of this kind by Parliament, because in any normal democratic national parliament, ministers are subjected to constant scrutiny."
"Mr President, anyone who takes the time to analyse the events of the past year will see that many things have been the subject of debate in this House."
"There have without doubt been injustices on an individual level, since many of those who have been forced to resign should not have done so."
"Nor is there any doubt that this whole sequence of events was used to further petty political aims in various quarters."
"The fact is that these events are now in the past, they are over and done with, and we must now focus our attention on the lessons to be learned from these developments and on how to use them for the good of the European Union and the world in general."
"I believe that acknowledging that the European Parliament has a far more important role to play than the other institutional bodies have been willing to accept is a fundamental and crucial point."
"From now on, the European Parliament must fulfil the expectations of the people of Europe as regards the ways in which it should tackle these issues."
"Others have lessons to learn as well."
"The Council of Ministers for instance, was in a great hurry to grant discharge, without examining the real facts."
"And if the Commission had acted differently in certain circumstances, we would not have ended up where we are today."
"However, the basic lesson we must take away from all this is that we must be responsible towards those who are going to vote for us in the very near future."
"Here too, Mr President, the Council of Ministers must take responsibility."
"If it does not make the right decision to allow the institutions of the European Union to act properly and in a cooperative way during this crucial period, and if we remain in a state of partial governance for any longer than is necessary, I fear that we will not have learned the lessons we need to have learned from this crisis and all our efforts will have gone to waste."
"Madam President, at this stage in the debate, virtually everything has already been said."
"Most of those present have observed that while the events of the past week are not something to rejoice over, they served to bring matters to a head and have cleared the air both as regards relations between Parliament and the Commission and in restoring people's confidence in the Union in the long term."
"I think we can now clearly see that we needed the time between January and March to prepare the report, which provides us with a quite different basis from the one we had in January for making constructive improvements in the future."
"I am impressed by the speed and efficiency with which the committee of experts has carried out its work."
"There has been some criticism of the fact that the task was given to outside experts instead of being carried out by Parliament itself."
"However, I believe that our situation is too politicised to allow us to carry out such an investigation."
"I also honestly believe that there are times when it is appropriate to resort to an outside opinion."
"It is a necessary step, albeit a difficult one to take, since it is hard to see how to resolve the problems when one is deeply involved in the work and the procedures."
"Let us now hope that this report really does become a blueprint for a thorough-going reform of the Commission's working practices and, perhaps even more importantly, that the call for openness and transparency which has constantly been reiterated over the past few weeks and which has frequently been made by the European Parliament now becomes a reality."
"As recently as last January, we came up with a very constructive proposal on this subject."
"Mr President, a new era starts here today."
"I am tempted to paraphrase the famous words that Goethe said on the night after Valmy: for the European institutions a new era is beginning and a different culture is required."
"And that culture is the culture of democracy."
"Can we live up to this culture?"
"I think we are all facing a collective challenge here."
"First, the Commission, which has long been a rather other-worldly institution supported by a choir of faithful followers."
"Now it is to become an ordinary governmental organisation monitored by representatives of the people."
"It might be rather annoying for it, but that is the way it is."
"Parliament too is facing a challenge."
"Parliament has become a major player in the institutional game, but as the French say, 'noblesse oblige ': this new responsibility brings new duties with it."
"Can we be a strict partner to the Commission, giving it the strength that is so vital to both our institutions, or will we be interfering usurpers, grasping for power that is not ours?"
"We have to act responsibly."
"This new challenge is also something the Council is facing."
"First of all it must ensure, as the other arm of the budgetary authority along with ourselves, that the Commission is given the administrative resources with which to act."
"We hope to see this in Category 5 of the financial perspective."
"It must also abide by all the rules of the democratic processes."
"Finally, the challenge also affects the Member States."
"The biggest omission from the Amsterdam Treaty was the reform of the Commission."
"Now we need to choose a proper Commission that operates according to either the corporate model or a more presidential one."
"The timetable must be respected and we must meet these challenges together, or else everyone will be the loser."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resignation of the Commission was justified and necessary on the basis of the Wise Men's report, and I am pleased to see so many of my honourable colleagues coming out in support of this report and its outcome, even though they originally opposed the appointment of the Committee of Wise Men."
"But we all live and learn."
"Secondly, the Wise Men's report was hard, but it was not unfair, because I believe that the less say the public have in how their money is spent, the stricter must be the criteria governing the administration of financial transactions."
"Thirdly, the European Commission had to resign, because it was too weak in many respects in relation to the Council."
"On the other hand, it often made a point of showing its muscle to Parliament."
"Fourthly, we need a strong Commission with a strong President."
"Only that sort of Commission will be a worthy and fitting partner for Parliament."
"But being strong also means being open, transparent and certainly not secretive."
"Point five: we need a new balance between the collegiate nature of the Commission and individual responsibility."
"The public must be aware of the collective responsibility borne by the whole Commission, but also of every individual Commissioner's accountability."
"Point six: some people are talking about the Commission crisis as if it were a crisis of the entire European Union, but the EU must stand the test, and it will, especially if it responds quickly, and I hope that the presidency can impose itself at the Council meeting in Berlin."
"Point seven: we need a new team, not just a new President."
"The Commission must be visibly renewed with new faces."
"Point eight: some people see the incapacity and the mistakes of the Commission as an opportunity and a summons to weaken the Commission and even the EU."
"That is the wrong way to react, and I deplore such an attitude."
"Point nine: we have achieved a great deal in this Union, and indeed with the Commission that has now resigned, but I believe that a common economic area and a common currency are not enough."
"And so point ten is that we must continue on the road leading to environmental and social union, on the road leading to political union, and we need a Commission and a Commission President who will not shirk any of their responsibility for the pursuit of these goals."
"Mr President, it is important, as people have already pointed out in this debate, that this is a crisis in the Commission."
"It is not a crisis of the European Union."
"Therefore, at this time our citizens need the reassurance that can only come from the Council of Ministers and Parliament and the administrative people carrying on with the important tasks that have to be done, such as the completion of Agenda 2000, regulation of the euro and reassuring the citizens of Europe that there is nothing in the present crisis that has not been provided for in the Treaties and that cannot be handled."
"There are many people in Parliament who are taking pride and satisfaction in the role that Parliament has played in all this."
"However, to my mind, Parliament has stumbled along rather than charted out a very careful strategy in all that has happened."
"Firstly, the Committee on Budgetary Control, by a narrow majority, agreed to grant discharge."
"Parliament refused discharge but later it voted a motion of confidence in the Commission and its President."
"The leader of the Socialist Group voted to give discharge and also voted confidence in the Commission."
"Mr Cox, leader of the Liberal Group, voted to grant discharge."
"So we should remember that it was not entirely clear from the very start where we were going."
"The Committee of Inquiry came up with its findings and it seems that it is these findings, which contained nothing new, which led to the resignation of the Commission."
"The Committee of Inquiry made its point clearer than Parliament has ever been able to do, so the public was able to read in a very clear way where the failings were."
"I believe that the consequences have been disproportionate to the failure of the Commission as a college."
"The failures of the Commission have been there for a long time."
"The failures have been obvious in that we gave them too many tasks and we did not give them the resources to discharge these tasks."
"I regret that one or two Commissioners did not shoulder their responsibilities but I regret that so many good people, including the President Mr Santer, who have done so much important work and achieved so much success have appeared in the eyes of Europe to be discredited when in fact they are people of honour who have done a good job."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a great deal has been said about the resignation of the Commission being an institutional and political crisis."
"I would call it more of a growth crisis."
"When Jacques Delors was President of the Commission, it burst strongly onto the political stage in various areas of European policy, most of them incorporated in the Maastricht Treaty: the single market, economic and monetary union and European citizenship."
"It had abandoned its traditional role, but we failed to learn any real lessons from this."
"Nor did the Member States, which missed the opportunity provided by the Amsterdam Treaty because they were unable to get to grips with the problems of reforming the Union institutions."
"Parliament too was sometimes too timid in its approach to the Amsterdam Treaty and failed to keep the required distance."
"Finally, and above all, the Commission more than any of the other institutions was in the best position to see just how far its organisation and operation had become completely obsolete in terms of the tasks it was expected to perform, and which it agreed and asked to carry out."
"So now the line which the new President and the new Commission have to take is clear."
"They must behave in practice, even though they are not yet able to do so by right, as a proper European government, with all the transparency and efficient organisation and management that this implies."
"As Mr Bourlanges said, the technocrat culture must give way to a culture of democracy."
"I think this is where the Socialist Group is to be congratulated, since it was our patient strategy which lanced the boil that was sapping the institutions."
"Instead of going in for politicking, squabbling and settling scores, we pushed Parliament into making a political gesture, and if the European Union emerges the stronger for it, then it will be thanks to the actions of our group."
"Mr President, can I first of all make an observation on behalf of many Members about the gross discourtesy of the Commission in not being present for this debate."
"To its credit the Council is at least represented by Coreper."
"I am probably the least surprised person about the findings of the Committee of Wise Men, because, as many colleagues know, since 1990 I have been pursuing a fraud in DG XXIII."
"This has been amplified by the report but there is nothing new in it."
"My view is that the report by our colleague Mrs Wemheuer from the Socialist bench who has not spoken tonight and who resigned in protest at the position of the Socialist Group before Christmas from the Committee on Budgetary Control did indeed examine the institutional questions which were supposed to be examined by the Committee of Wise Men."
"Paragraph 1 of the resolution passed by the Parliament in January actually required the Committee of Wise Men to examine the way in which the European Commission systematically covers up fraud, mismanagement and corruption; and that is not in the report, especially if I may say so in relation to the saga on tourism."
"All we have actually seen is a delay of three months from the report by Mr Elles, which was sent back to ommittee in December despite the Socialist wishes."
"That contained a number of reforms which could have been put into place even then."
"Mr Van Buitenen's testimony on 9 December was widely circulated in the Parliament and had all the information needed by the Parliament to move to a motion of censure, possibly of individual Commissioners, at the time."
"So the crisis that has developed over the last three months must be laid very firmly at the feet of Mrs Green."
"I described her as the most confused woman in Europe and still believe that is the best description of her."
"So the report we have seen debated this evening is Van Buitenen II."
"There is very little new in it, and I would simply say to the Council that the Wise Men's report, if it recommends a fundamental change of the Staff Regulations and the way in which the Commission itself operates, will have achieved something."
"May I just point out to the House that at no stage in the last eighteen months has any Member State made any request through Coreper or otherwise for the reform of the institutions."
"It is high time they did."
"Mr President, the conclusions of the Wise Men's report are quite clear."
"The Commission has lost political control of its administration."
"That is in fact the most frightening conclusion of the report."
"It means that staff in the Commission can just go on in the same way, without any control or overall political guidelines."
"In such a climate, corruption, nepotism and irregularities can thrive."
"Fortunately, the next Wise Men's report will be a shake-up of the civil service culture at the Commission, and that is where the biggest battles will be fought."
"We need a comprehensive staff reform, which in my view should include an end to jobs for life and introduce fixed-term contracts instead."
"Of course, there should not be any witch-hunt against officials in the Commission as such."
"Many of them work diligently and well, but it should be possible to get rid of the rotten apples."
"It will be a tough battle."
"The staff organisations will fight tooth and nail when they see their unrivalled privileges disappearing."
"The Wise Men's report places a collective responsibility on the Commissioners. They have at last accepted that responsibility and resigned en masse."
"We can see that, because they are not here this evening."
"Parliament would have dismissed the whole Commission if they had not resigned of their own accord."
"The Danish Social Democrat delegation is therefore unanimous in not voting for the restoration of a Commission which is almost identical to the one we have just dismissed."
"It is not a question of personalities, although one person tried to make it so."
"It is a question of principles, and we would like to call upon our colleagues to set aside national party political considerations."
"New blood is what is needed."
"Finally, I would like to reprimand the Council."
"There must now be an end to the politics of the 15 rubber stamps."
"The national governments have shown no responsibility at all in this matter."
"Year after year, they have approved the accounts without batting an eyelid, so perhaps we should consider sacking the Council next time round."
"And I would like to say to my friend Mr McMillan-Scott that I think it is a common trick to malign Mrs Green when she is not present, but that is typical of what the Conservatives in England stand for."
"They are a common crew!"
"Mr President, the crisis which has been brewing for months in the European Commission and which has now culminated in the resignation of the Commissioners has sent out a clearly visible and long overdue signal."
"Brussels has its own Watergate, and conclusions now have to be drawn so that the crisis of confidence between the European Parliament and the Commission, between the public and the European Union in general, can be overcome."
"The Commission crisis is not confined to that institution alone."
"On the contrary, it is a crisis of the European Union."
"To dispel it, we need short-term measures and lasting reforms."
"One of the short-term requirements is the nomination of a new President of the Commission by the Member States, in Berlin if at all possible, and the Commissioners who were explicitly criticised in the Wise Men's report must not be part of a future Commission."
"Among the lasting reforms are the earliest possible establishment by the Council of a procedure that will make it possible to call individual Commissioners to account in the event of misconduct, mismanagement and fraud."
"The unavoidable tasks facing the European Union are completely divorced from present-day political reality."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam already provides for considerable improvements in this respect."
"These alone, however, will not suffice."
"A procedure for calling individual Commissioners to account must be laid down at or before the next intergovernmental conference."
"A sustained improvement is also required in the fight against fraud."
"Eighty per cent of all EU fraud takes place in the individual Member States."
"If that scandalous situation is to be remedied, we need more than just an independent Anti-Fraud Office; the European Court of Auditors must also be given wider powers."
"It must be able to investigate cases of fraud at the scene of the crime, in cooperation with regional and national authorities and supreme courts."
"Parliament's right of scrutiny must on no account be diluted."
"The Wise Men's report was useful, but it should be completed by 20 April, and above all it should carry out an investigation at the level of officials. It is unacceptable for this Commission to operate on the principle that Commissioners may come and go but mandarins are forever."
"Mr President, the European Commission resigned because the Committee of Independent Experts which investigated its activities found that it had been mismanaged."
"President Santer made what was absolutely the right decision and accepted full responsibility."
"This process has shown that it was immensely important to have set up this independent committee, as it is only because of their work that we have been able to get to grips with the real problems."
"Without it we would have merely swept matters under the carpet, as it were, having had two or three token resignations from Commission members."
"Reading this report now, it seems unlikely that we would have had sufficient justification for dismissing everyone."
"We have to bear in mind, however, that we will need to cooperate extremely closely with the Council in the future."
"The new Commission must be appointed quickly, and it was very good to hear the President-in-Office of the Council say that the principles of the Treaty of Amsterdam would be respected in this connection."
"Nevertheless, while we ponder these images of power, we must remember that the most important matter on the agenda at the forthcoming Berlin summit is the approval of Agenda 2000, and in the light of the current situation it is vital that Berlin should be a success."
"Certain speakers here have proposed that the new Commission might include members of the current one."
"I believe this has to be examined on the basis of what we want from the Commission."
"The aim must be to improve the Commission's work and management culture, and we must have Commissioners who can do this."
"The current situation should be exploited thoroughly."
"We need time and energy to bring about reform, and capable people to manage it."
"Mr President, Jacques Santer has shown great political courage."
"By resigning along with all the rest of the Commission, he has shown that he accepts full responsibility, and I admire his honesty."
"However, I also regret the fact that a Commission which has done excellent work throughout its term of office should have been forced to resign."
"If Mrs Cresson had resigned of her own accord last January as she should have done, when her dubious practices were already widely known, we would not be in a political crisis in Europe today."
"I hope that the kind of national tricks that Mrs Cresson got up to will no longer be possible in the new Commission, a new and strong Commission which I hope will have the endorsement of the newly elected Parliament in June."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Jacques Santer and most of his Commission, which has launched some historic projects: the euro, enlargement, Agenda 2000."
"He was also determined to carry out fundamental reforms to make the fight against corruption more effective."
"It is through the irony of history that the Santer Commission has become the first victim of its own reforms."
"Let us hope that the measures it has taken will enable its successor to be more transparent, democratic and effective."
"President, I am really appalled at the remark of the Tories and their leader this evening but I am not surprised."
"It just confirms what I have always thought about them."
"This report, however, gives us an opportunity for a fresh start."
"By 'us' I mean all the institutions of the European Union."
"Reform of the Commission is the start."
"The Council of Ministers and the national governments also need to examine themselves critically and ask if they have always acted in the best interests of our Union."
"The Council of Ministers will make very important decisions this week which we know will have a long-lasting effect on the future success and credibility of the European Union."
"Let us hope that they make these decisions in the same spirit of openness and accountability and respect for democracy that they rightly demand of the Commission."
"The Commission has been found guilty of malpractice."
"I would suggest that the way to remedy this would be firstly that all appointments and contracts be openly advertised, decided independently and scrutinised by the Parliament."
"The Commission staff should cease empire-building and behave collectively for the good of the Community."
"The practice of there being a de facto national quota for senior staff appointments in the Commission must end."
"The Commissioners should be entitled to appoint a personal cabinet but this should be done with complete transparency."
"Each Commissioner should have to justify the appointments by publishing details of the individual's qualification for the job to an independent assessor."
"Each cabinet member should be absolutely required to leave office with the Commissioner."
"No more parachuting into important Commission staff positions."
"With regard to the role of national governments, these and other reforms are badly needed."
"The public must be made aware that it is often the practice of governments and the Council of Ministers to blame the Commission when things go wrong."
"As has been pointed out here, most EU funding is actually administered by national governments and there is considerable evidence of fraud and malpractice in this area."
"It is the responsibility of governments to address that."
"And finally, President, I would say that with regard to the role of the Council of Ministers, we know that they meet in private."
"They are one of the few remaining governing bodies anywhere in Europe where decisions are taken behind closed doors, and this must stop."
"Mr President, the uncompromising final paragraph of the conclusions of the report is undoubtedly controversial. According to this paragraph, despite the dilution of political responsibility observed during the inquiry, the Commissioners should accept this responsibility as a body."
"Faced with this conclusion, the Commission had no alternative but to resign, which it has done with its dignity intact."
"This crisis has come at the worst possible time, with the European Union in the final stage of the Agenda 2000 negotiations, the outcome of which will to a large extent determine our collective future, and in particular the future of the cohesion countries, including my own, and of the applicant countries from Eastern Europe and of our farmers."
"The frenetic demands made by certain political forces to get rid of this Commission makes me suspect that it would suit them to have a weak Commission, because a weak Commission would in theory be easier to bend to their minimalist views on the future of the European Union."
"I believe that it would be more reasonable to keep this Commission on in a caretaker capacity, as it is familiar with the dossiers being negotiated and could therefore guarantee more rapid, effective and well-balanced negotiations."
"Nevertheless, we are open to other reasonable solutions."
"The important thing is that the pace and the balance of the negotiations on Agenda 2000 should not be affected and that the strategic interests of the Union should not be jeopardised."
"I also want to emphasise that I am against a second report by the committee."
"We need a strong Commission in which political responsibility outweighs bureaucracy."
"We need Parliament to actively pursue its budgetary control functions and we need a body that will fight effectively against fraud."
"If what we have now is not adequate, then we need to carry out whatever reforms are necessary."
"But we cannot perpetuate exceptional arrangements."
"It is time for the institutions to act and to accept their political responsibilities."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by paying tribute to my fellow-countryman, Jacques Santer, who is not in my party but whom I respect for the important political work he has done as President of the Commission."
"I would like to underline his political successes, but also the circumstances that led to his downfall, for which his own political group, the PPE, bears considerable responsibility."
"As everyone here has said, we need the swift appointment of a strong new Commission that can carry out root-and-branch reforms."
"However, while I naturally agree with this in principle, I would also stress that we shall be in an entirely new situation."
"The new Commission is to be approved by Parliament, which will also vote in the new Commission President on the basis of the Commission's programme."
"There is to be a new relationship between Parliament and the Commission, and it will be the Commission and its programme that Parliament will be approving for its term in office."
"So in approving the Commission, Parliament will be bound by a sort of contract for the term of office, and it will have to be disciplined and show political maturity."
"There will have to be a stable majority if the Commission's proposals are to be implemented, and Parliament will no longer be able to make do with the kind of fluid majorities that expose it to the risk of blackmail, particularly from eurosceptic or anti-European groups."
"The parliamentary democracy that is now being introduced in Europe also requires Parliament to be legitimised by its electors, and this is why I do not agree that it should be the old Parliament that approves the new Commission."
"It should be the new Parliament elected on 13 June."
"Mr President, the Social Democrats must bear a large part of the responsibility for the institutional crisis in which the EU now finds itself."
"Last December, they voted not to hold the Commission responsible for its administration."
"That decision, together with the attitude it reflected and which preceded the vote, meant that the Commission felt under no obligation to carry out reforms at an early stage, thereby possibly avoiding the present situation."
"In January, the Social Democrats also lent support to the Commission by voting against the censure motion."
"In our present situation, we need a new Commission whose mandate will last until the year 2000 to take over before the European elections in June."
"Any other solution would not be understood by the voters."
"The Commission also needs to play a central role in taking initiatives and in ensuring that the Treaty is respected."
"With so many important issues on the agenda, it is essential that the policy-making work continues."
"Whatever the different governments may say, the new Commission's mandate should last only until the end of the year."
"The newly elected European Parliament should approve the appointment of the President of the Commission and the Commissioners for the period 2000 to 2004."
"The result of its vote should be respected, in accordance with the Treaty."
"Several factors serve to complicate both the process and the timetable: the Commission has to be appointed in two stages; the present Parliament's remaining mandate is so short; and two different Treaties have to be applied."
"The importance of the role of the European Parliament in this process stands out clearly."
"The Council of Ministers has not instigated any administrative reforms."
"However, if what Parliament says is to carry any weight, it is essential that no criticism can be levelled against its own position."
"It is fortunate that Parliament, on various occasions, has carried out major changes in its own working practices."
"A new proposal for a Statute for Members of the European Parliament has been submitted to the Council of Ministers for approval."
"This issue also needs to be settled before the European elections."
"Mr President, the resignation of the Commission in the wake of the report published by the Committee of Wise Men was the right decision."
"Since March 1998 Parliament's Group of the European People's Party has systematically highlighted failings in the work of the Commission."
"The results of the report which led to the resignation simply repeat in black and white the findings of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"It would have been reasonable to expect those Commissioners charged with negligence, mismanagement and nepotism to have known when to resign themselves, in the light of information obtained earlier, especially as Parliament does not have the power to dismiss individual Commissioners."
"In the future we will need to analyse the make-up of the institution and examine the functions of Commission officials."
"Continuing the work of the Committee of Wise Men, is, however, not the solution."
"Parliament now has the means to monitor the Commission's activities."
"It is Parliament's task to ensure that the positive reforms now under way in the Commission are carried out and that any problems that emerge are promptly dealt with."
"The situation is an awkward one at the moment as far as the Union is concerned."
"A temporary Commission must therefore be swiftly appointed, so that the Union is capable of operating as soon as the new Parliament commences work after the elections in June."
"Naturally, a temporary Commission would only operate until the end of the year, when the new Parliament will carefully consider the choice of Commissioners for the next five-year term."
"We do not need a Commission made up of failed politicians or those who have been put on the shelf in their own countries."
"In considering the choice of Commissioners we have to take account of the candidates' ability to manage the affairs of the Union and to bear both individual and collective responsibility for their decisions."
"Parliament has now brought about a huge change in policy and it must be ready to take the responsibility for seeing the reforms through to the end."
"We are now altering the course of the Union, making for a more transparent and democratic people's Europe."
"Thank you, Mrs Matikainen-Kallström."
"I have received eight motions for resolutions to wind up the debate, pursuant to Rule 37(2)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 3 p.m."
"The sitting was suspended at 8.35 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m."
"EAEC accession to KEDO, EU-DPRK relations"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report (A4-0104/99) by Mr Tindemans, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the agreement on terms and conditions of the accession of the European Atomic Energy Community to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation (KEDO) (C4-0483/97); -the oral questions by Mr Spencer, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, to the Council (B4-0147/99) and the Commission (B4-0148/99), on the European Union's relations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.As the President said at the beginning of the sitting, the Council has indicated that it is unable to be present because of work connected with the preparations for the European Council meeting in Berlin."
"Mr President, as the House will appreciate, we are dealing here with a very serious matter, namely KEDO and relations with North Korea, a country which is totally isolated at present and which is in the grip of acute food shortages."
"So this is a most serious debate."
"I shall confine myself to three points."
"Firstly, KEDO itself."
"We have already held one debate in Parliament to discuss an initial tranche of funding."
"KEDO came into being as a result of a project to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons in North Korea and draw North Korea more closely into the international community."
"In 1993, there was a fear that North Korea might obtain nuclear materials from its Soviet-type nuclear facilities, graphite moderator reactors, with a view to putting them to military use."
"This fear was further intensified by the North Korean threat to leave the nuclear non-proliferation treaty."
"An agreement was concluded with the United States whereby North Korea would freeze its nuclear programme and possibly close down its nuclear facilities, in exchange for the building of two light water reactors and in the meantime receiving supplies of heavy fuel oil."
"So KEDO was a US initiative, although South Korea and Japan helped to carry it out."
"It may seem odd to seek non-proliferation by building two new nuclear facilities."
"But these facilities, light water reactors, are not only safer to operate but also harder to use for military purposes."
"The European Union was then launching its new strategy for Asia, to develop better relations between Europe and Asia."
"Membership of KEDO was therefore consistent with this policy and was intended to improve security in north-east Asia."
"It would also show solidarity with our Asian allies and might also bring economic benefits to European industry through the US involvement, since European firms would be eligible for KEDO contracts."
"The foreign policy aspects of joining KEDO are therefore significant."
"Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee devoted 18 months and lengthy discussions to preparing a report which was as complete and accurate as possible."
"It also worked with the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Research."
"The other committees directly concerned by this report favour joining KEDO and think that Parliament should do its job and make that accession possible, including in financial terms."
"I must take this opportunity of saying straight away that we were able to work extremely well with the Committee on Research and Technology and the Committee on Budgets, with Mr Ford and Mr Brinkhorst."
"It was a delight, and often when the three of us consulted, we were all in agreement on the conclusions."
"There was one problem."
"The Council decided that the accession agreement would be concluded under Euratom."
"The treaty on which Euratom is based does not contain any obligation to inform or consult the European Parliament."
"The Council and Commission undertook to do that on a voluntary basis."
"But European membership of KEDO will mean expenditure using funds from the budget."
"The three committees and the House as a whole realised this, and so there was a chance that this spending might not be approved unless agreement could be reached to involve Parliament in future international agreements concluded under the Euratom Treaty."
"Well, Mr President, thanks to contacts and an exchange of letters, we have already reached agreement on the first tranche which I mentioned."
"But now what do we find? We, the three rapporteurs plus an official, visited North Korea from 5 to 14 December."
"On 15 December a new agreement was signed by Euratom, that is to say with the involvement of the European institutions, an agreement with Canada."
"I am no troublemaker."
"I do not want to stir things up unnecessarily, but this is totally unacceptable for a directly elected Parliament which has responsibilities and which has to answer to its voters."
"We cannot agree to the conclusion of something like this, since we shall be required to pay for it, since we shall have to authorise the expenditure for it."
"We cannot accept that unless we are properly informed and consulted."
"There has been a flurry of activity over this in the last few days, but I shall not dwell on that."
"In the Foreign Affairs Committee, Commissioner Brittan made a statement which gave us the impression that we were moving towards an agreement."
"We have now seen a letter this afternoon to the President of Parliament, signed by Sir Leon Brittan, telling us how the Commission plans to handle such matters in the future."
"I am pleased to say at this point that we are quite happy with this letter."
"We are also reassured by what Sir Leon said in the committee about how some paragraphs are to be interpreted, so we are able today to commend the entire KEDO dossier to the House."
"But there is one more point I would like to make."
"When we were in North Korea we had some quite fascinating encounters, we three rapporteurs and the official accompanying us."
"Clearly we were going ask for meetings with the leading figures, and we got them."
"We talked, sometimes at considerable length, with the president of the National Assembly, the foreign minister, the deputy foreign minister, the energy minister, the spokesman-general for the army, and so on. We got a fair impression of how things are."
"As I said, there are acute food shortages in this country."
"It is totally isolated."
"We came to the conclusion that humanitarian aid has to continue and that cooperation with the authorities there must improve, so that the help we offer can be more effective."
"We naturally came to the conclusion that we must do everything possible to prevent proliferation, to coax the country out of its isolation and into the family of nations, and that KEDO can help to achieve that."
"We think the Koreans would be prepared, if invited by the House, to meet with Members of Parliament here, and with the specialist committees."
"We advocate this in the motion for a resolution we have tabled."
"And we think that better diplomatic contacts may produce results."
"Of the 15 Member States of the European Union, only Sweden has an embassy - just Sweden, none of the others."
"Might the Koreans not open a liaison office here?"
"Might we not strengthen our diplomatic presence there, with the European Union taking an initiative to that end?"
"We advocate both these things."
"But I will say no more on that particular subject."
"My third point concerns the two questions asked by Mr Spencer."
"Perhaps I can just quote them."
"They are as follows: in the light of the recent establishment of a political dialogue with North Korea, will the Council state its views on the possibility and desirability of further developing relations between the European Union and its Member States and North Korea?"
"How does the Council assess the current security situation in north-east Asia?"
"What discussions on this situation have been held, or are likely to be held, with the Republic of Korea, Japan and the United States?"
"His second question was: 'in the light of the recent establishment of a political dialogue with North Korea, will the Commission state its views on the possibility and desirability of further developing relations between the European Union and its Member States and North Korea?"
"How does the Commission assess the current security situation in north-east Asia?"
"What discussions on this situation have been held, or are likely to be held, with the Republic of Korea, Japan and the United States?"
"Mr President, I am speaking in two capacities - for the Liberal Group and also for the Committee on Budgets."
"It is quite ironic that on the same day that we are debating the consequences of the resignation of the Commission, we should also be discussing the question of KEDO."
"The Committee on Budgets, in a sense, has been the auxiliary committee."
"For us it was very clear when the Council decided unilaterally at the end of February 1996 that KEDO would be supported by financial resources entered in the budget, that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, which had not been not consulted, should give its opinion."
"That story has taken quite some time and still at the present time there is a reserve in the European Union budget."
"The fundamental reason has to do with the debate which we had earlier today."
"It has to do with democracy and accountability."
"Therefore, it has to do with the question of whether in the future we will have the possibility in this Parliament of discussing the very fundamental question - as all normal national parliaments do."
"The Euratom Treaty is 40 years old."
"It provides very extensive powers to the Commission and the Council."
"It provides no powers to Parliament."
"So, when the Commission chose to enter into the agreement, it chose Article 101 of the Euratom Treaty and this Treaty does not provide even for consultation with or information to Parliament."
"It is on those grounds - and I say this unabashedly - that the Committee on Budgets decided to put the resources in reserve until the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy were adequately involved."
"We have been acting on behalf of these two committees."
"In substance it is very clear that it is not the Committee on Budgets that will decide whether or not we should enter into an agreement on energy cooperation with North Korea."
"It is against that background that we are pleased to hear that the Commission recognises that the times are changing."
"We look forward to hearing Sir Leon Brittan, on behalf of the Commission, reading out the results of the discussions we have had and which I hope will lead to a situation where we will have more accountability on Euratom matters in the future."
"It is again very ironic that on a day like this the Council is not even represented at political level and it shows that maybe the next battle for democracy will not be with the Commission but with the Council."
"Speaking on behalf of the Liberal Group, we welcome the fact that the European Union has a strategic energy and foreign policy involvement in North-East Asia."
"We also welcome the very active involvement of Sir Leon Brittan on behalf of the Commission."
"It is against that background that we were deeply disappointed that it was not possible to find an adequate institutional arrangement for this particular point earlier."
"The Liberal Group fully supports Mr Tindemanns' view that it is not only with South Korea but also with North Korea that a new relationship should be developed."
"I would like to ask one question of Sir Leon."
"This morning in the International Herald Tribune there was a strong plea for a new approach to North Korea."
"Apparently the Japanese are more reserved than the South Koreans."
"We should strongly support the 'sunshine' policy of President Kim Dae Jung who has suffered more than anyone in South Korea from the tensions which have existed for more than 40 years between South and North Korea."
"It is against that background that we would like to give our support to a KEDO agreement and also to new relations between Western Europe and North Korea."
"Mr President, like Mr Brinkhorst I am also speaking in two capacities, firstly on behalf of the committee, and secondly on behalf of the Socialist Group."
"Firstly, I should like to congratulate my two companions in this long endeavour: Mr Brinkhorst and Mr Tindemanns."
"We started this process on 21 November 1997."
"If I had known I was going to spend so long with them I would have checked with more care who they were going to be."
"However, I could not have picked two better companions."
"We spent a whole week together in North Korea and ten and a half hours in meetings with the deputy foreign minister."
"This would have produced any personality clashes there might have been."
"Equally, I should like to thank Sir Leon Brittan for all his efforts to try to reach an agreement between the Commission and the European Parliament."
"It has been a long, hard road."
"I will not go into the detail because the points have been raised by the two previous speakers."
"We now have an agreement that I think Parliament can accept on the basis of the letter which has been sent today."
"I am deeply disappointed that the Council of Ministers, which apparently accepted an oral question for debate on relations with the DPRK, has failed to send anybody to participate in the debate."
"Perhaps they have been delayed and I should be glad to hear from you, Mr President, if that is the case."
"I presume we are expected to work out the Council's view on these matters by some form of telepathy."
"KEDO, as you have been told, is a project to build two light water reactors to substitute for Russian design Chernobyl-style reactors that were under construction in the DPRK and which have the ability to produce weapons-grade plutonium."
"To try and resolve that problem we have the US-DPRK Framework Agreement of 1995."
"The European Union was asked to contribute to that and this is what this comes from."
"The Research Committee's view was one of critical support."
"We have a series of concerns."
"Firstly, a financial hole it still exists."
"Japan's contribution of US$1 billion and the Republic of Korea's 60 % and the European Union's US$85m do not make up the full cost of the project."
"It is unclear how the gap is going to be bridged."
"Secondly, we are concerned about how the United States is delivering the promised heavy fuel oil which is meant to act as a bridge until these two nuclear reactors come on line."
"It is being fitfully delivered."
"North Korea is a deeply suspicious country."
"We in the European Union might understand that the checks and balances of the US constitution mean that President Clinton cannot always clearly deliver on his promises but we can hardly be surprised that the North Koreans take a different view when, in the coldest month of the year and when energy is most needed, there was a failure to deliver heavy fuel oil to the Sonbong oil-fired power plant."
"Thirdly, we are concerned about the fact that KEDO is a bat without a ball."
"There is no money being put forward to connect the two nuclear power stations into the North Korean grid system."
"This is only going to cost $100m or $200m, comparatively small beer compared to what is being spent on the KEDO project as a whole, but, clearly, if you do not have the bat and the ball, you cannot play the game. Fourthly, we are concerned about the lack of clarity on the allocation of these enormously large contracts and whether European industry is going to get a fair opportunity to bid."
"Despite these reservations the Research Committee voted in favour of the programme."
"We believe that, overall, it serves our best interests as a Parliament and as a European Union in demonstrating our role in East Asia."
"This debate is not only about Mr Tindemann's KEDO report."
"It also refers to two oral questions to the Council and the Commission with respect to future relations with the DPRK."
"We have been supplying humanitarian aid for some years following a series of natural disasters - flood, drought and tidal waves - that tipped what was a barely sufficient North Korea firmly into the red as far as food production was concerned."
"There is severe malnutrition in North Korea."
"A recent World Food Programme report indicated that 16 % of children between the ages of 1 and 6 are so badly malnourished that they suffer from permanent brain damage; 45 % of children are so badly nourished that they will be permanently stunted."
"So, 300 000 to 400 000 0-6-year olds are permanently brain-damaged and 1 000 000 0-6-year olds are permanently stunted."
"Therefore, I welcome the new agreement to supply further food aid of something over ECU 30m and to target children under 12 and lactating mothers."
"I welcome the agreement by the North Koreans on monitoring."
"After the events of last week it is vital for us in Parliament to be assured that the Commission is spending the money in the appropriate ways."
"I welcome also the assistance on agriculture - new techniques and maybe even new crops."
"I am disappointed, however, that nothing is being done in the non-nuclear energy sector."
"While I was there on the delegation I visited a coalmine and a thermal power station."
"Firstly, there was no power so the coalminers had to be evacuated."
"No coal would therefore be produced over an eight-hour shift and the power station only had three days' supply."
"Both were extremely primitive and I speak as someone whose family were coalminers in the United Kingdom in the 1950s."
"Compared to the cost of KEDO, one-tenth of 1 % of the KEDO project would boost productivity in the coalmining industry - it has been estimated - by something like 25 %, and modernise elements of coal-fired power production."
"On the political side I welcome the result of the Council's low level political dialogue with the DPRK and support the idea of a second meeting when the time is right."
"I welcome the Commission's communication on Korea calling for critical engagement."
"All I ask is that we move quickly."
"The situation is critical."
"We should not miss an opportunity."
"I know the North Koreans have asked for a liaison office to be opened in Brussels."
"I hope we can agree that can happen, subject to reciprocity in Pyongyang, and that subject to the necessary agreements we can move on to more developed relations."
"Finally, I welcome the paragraph in the report that asks for a delegation to come here from the DPRK's Parliament."
"We will have hard and difficult negotiations with them but the dialogue has to start somewhere."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I say first of all that I am pleased that the general issue regarding Parliament's role in Euratom agreements has been settled and I can assure you that the Commission services will implement the practical arrangements we have arrived at."
"Before setting those out, I want to say that I very much agree with what Mr Tindemanns said about the role of KEDO as part of our Asian strategy and being an important contribution to it."
"We will come to North Korea in a moment but we have to look at our policy with regard to the region as one which has to be integrated, comprehensive and positive."
"As far as the problems we have had with Euratom agreements, I am grateful for what has been said about my own role in resolving them."
"I can assure you that I absolutely agree with Mr Brinkhorst that times have changed and we have to reflect that in what we are doing."
"The measures the Commission intends to take are set out in a letter that I have sent to the President of the European Parliament today."
"That letter states first that at the beginning of each year, the Commission will provide a list of all the relevant Euratom agreements under Article 101(2) which are under negotiation or for which negotiations are to be launched in the coming year."
"This list will be regularly updated and forwarded to Parliament under the necessary conditions of confidentiality."
"Secondly, the Commission will provide oral information on request to the relevant parliamentary committee on the conduct of the negotiations under the necessary conditions of confidentiality."
"Thirdly, the Commission will forward the proposals for conclusion of the relevant Euratom agreements to the Parliament at the same time as they are forwarded to the Council for approval."
"That is a significant procedural innovation since it provides a guarantee to Parliament that it will be informed before the Council has taken a position on the conclusion of these agreements."
"Thus Parliament will have the opportunity to make its views known before a decision is taken to conclude the agreement in line with the commitments made in our earlier exchange of letters."
"I should add that the time it takes for the Council to reach a decision on conclusion is generally fairly lengthy."
"That leaves ample time for Parliament to express its view if it so wishes."
"In those cases where the Council may wish to take a particularly rapid decision, the Commission will duly inform the Parliament of this possibility."
"Fourthly, by way of a letter, information will be provided on the relevant agreements under Article 101(2) Euratom which are currently either under negotiation or for which a decision or conclusion has not yet been taken."
"The agreements referred to represent all agreements covered by Article 101(2) Euratom which are under negotiation or for which negotiations are to be launched in the coming year."
"Finally, in order to ensure that there is no further misunderstanding between the Commission and Parliament, the Commission will also convey separately to the Parliament all relevant texts and agreements which should have been covered by our understanding during the latter half of last year and the beginning of this year."
"That is what the letter says."
"With respect to the report on the KEDO Accession Agreement it is a well-presented and interesting document which addresses the fundamental aspects of the KEDO initiative."
"The visit of the parliamentary delegation to North Korea was regarded in a very positive way by the international community and I am grateful for the degree of attention Parliament has given to KEDO."
"I particularly endorse the conclusion which states that Parliament considers that the European Union should play a role in reducing the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation, increasing nuclear safety and encouraging the development of better relations between the DPRK and its neighbours and that membership of KEDO will enable it the better to play that role."
"We are fully playing that role in the implementation of the Accession Agreement."
"We attend all KEDO board meetings and negotiating meetings with North Korea."
"The EU has staff in KEDO, including at director level, is following the procurement aspects - and here I can assure Mr Ford that we have every intention of ensuring that Europe gets a fair crack of the whip - and Europe has the chairmanship of the important International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group."
"We are paying our financial contribution which helps to ensure that the DPRK respects its non-proliferation pledges and we were pleased to note that the DPRK is now going to allow access to the so-called underground facility so as to allay international concerns."
"Security aspects are fundamental to peace and stability on the peninsular and the KEDO project is contributing to reconciliation between the two Korean governments."
"Indeed, it is a unique example of South and North Koreans working together."
"KEDO itself is a special organisation where we are cooperating actively with our American, Japanese and South Korean partners to help improve security in North-East Asia."
"North Korea is also aware of our involvement not only through KEDO but also via the political dialogue which I shall refer to in answer to the question and by the European Union food aid programme."
"Indeed, it is the case that the Commission negotiators have recently reached an ad referendum agreement with their DPRK counterparts on conditions for a new EUR30m aid programme for 1999."
"So we are contributing to a process of engagement with North Korea, seeking to encourage it to become a more responsible member of the international community."
"We have to be realistic."
"There is an important, difficult and ongoing task to ensure security in North-East Asia and underpin the global non-proliferation regime."
"KEDO is a key part of that task and we will continue to remain in close contact with Parliament in the implementation of our participation in it."
"We will have to start preparing soon for the future of our participation in KEDO because the current agreement expires at the end of the year 2000 and we will be in close contact with Parliament following the procedures I referred to earlier."
"So I am very gratified to see that Parliament's opinion records approval of the Accession Agreement which will allow the release of the funds for the 1999 financial contribution."
"It is true that broader financial problems remain but the first thing we have to do is to play our part."
"Turning to the question from Mr Spencer on the broader issue of relations with North Korea, I welcome the visit that was paid by the Members of the European Parliament to North Korea and I am glad that it was a successful bonding exercise."
"The negotiations I have had with the Members of the Parliament to deal with the KEDO problem have been a similar bonding exercise and I thank all concerned."
"There is no doubt at all, as far as relations with North Korea are concerned, that a crisis in the Korean Peninsular would have far-reaching consequences in North-East Asia and beyond and we have a responsibility, commensurate with our new role in seeking to be involved politically in that part of Asia, to do what we can to avoid it."
"President Kim Dae Jung has strongly advocated greater international engagement as a way of handling the problem and I can certainly assure you that we fully support, as Mr Brinkhorst has urged us to do, President Kim's 'sunshine' policy."
"America too is conducting a wide-ranging review of its policy under former Defense Secretary Perry."
"We have been pursuing a policy of limited engagement illustrated by the food aid and other assistance programmes, as well as by KEDO."
"We are currently discussing how that policy may now be taken further forward."
"An important factor will of course be the policies which the DPRK itself pursues in key areas such as security issues, relations with neighbouring countries, human rights and so on. We also have to take account of the need to support our key partners in their dealings with the DPRK."
"The EU regularly exchanges views with our dialogue partners, including the United States, the Republic of Korea and Japan with regard to the situation on the Korean Peninsular."
"The idea that was put forward for further development in the energy sector is certainly one that we want to consider."
"Possibilities are being considered, including a study into alternative energy sources and/or the coal sector rehabilitation."
"On the political side we obviously have to tread warily but not so warily that we do not make progress."
"That is the course we shall pursue and I am grateful to Parliament for its support for it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in his own inimitable way, the Commissioner has not only set out the problems but has also provided us with avenues to explore."
"We are grateful to you, Commissioner, for your letter, which - at the last minute, if I may say so - enabled us to reach our decision on the KEDO project."
"It might have come a little earlier, but we are pleased that you found the right approach along with our Three Musketeers."
"These really are three committed Musketeers, who care about the interests of the people in North Korea and about this issue."
"On behalf of my group I should like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr Tindemans, to Mr Brinkhorst and also to Glyn Ford."
"Although you, as a practised diplomat, tread warily but with undoubted success along the path of rapprochement and cooperation with other countries, you will permit me, as a Member of Parliament who need not be quite so diplomatic, to point out that the KEDO project, like others, must ultimately be judged by the conduct of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in terms of its military activities and its humanitarian inactivity."
"I do believe that the North Korean Government must finally provide conclusive evidence that its military activities do not pose a threat, particularly to its neighbouring states, and that they are not designed to pose a threat."
"We call for access by independent inspectors to nuclear facilities, especially the underground facilities."
"We also really ought to expect the North Korean Government to declare at long last that it will not undertake any more test launches without giving prior notice."
"After all, Japan could not fail to perceive the totally unexpected test launch of a missile over Japanese territory as a threat."
"I believe we must surely agree that a country such as North Korea which is looking for support from the international community must naturally conduct itself in such a way that it is not seen to threaten or act in a hostile manner towards other states."
"So much for the military aspect."
"As far as the humanitarian side is concerned, we are pleased to note, Sir Leon, that you have made progress on the question of providing food supplies for the population."
"But to be honest, I distrust any statistics released by the North Korean Government on the extent of the famine in North Korea."
"I certainly believe it to be essential that we keep in touch with the aid agencies on the ground, because I do not think that even this project can come anywhere near providing the volume of aid that is needed - and Mr Ford has given us some figures."
"The fact that North Korea has money for military actions but no money to buy food for its people is a contradiction that we cannot tolerate if we care at all for the people of North Korea."
"In that respect, I believe we should keep a very watchful eye on that situation, and we should expect the North Koreans to tell us the truth here and to assist us in ferrying supplies to the population, especially in the remote parts of the country."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you may not be surprised to learn that I cannot see this whole situation in such a rosy glow as it has been presented here, especially by Sir Leon Brittan."
"We know each other only too well, of course, from the Committee on External Economic Relations."
"The few good points to be found in the KEDO programme, namely the desire to arrive at an alternative form of energy and to make a contribution to North Korea in terms of promoting reconciliation or improving people's living standards, are swamped by a whole series of points which Mr Tindemans presents in detail in his explanatory statement."
"Mr Ford has also told us what is really happening over there in North Korea."
"I cannot help wondering whether we should not be trying to solve quite different problems there at the present time, rather than helping to build two light water reactors."
"How is North Korea ever supposed to repay the debts it is incurring in this domain?"
"If we reply to this question by claiming that we need to have a foot in the door, economically speaking, and to profit from projects and contracts, then I have to say that this is surely a very mercenary approach; to put it more bluntly, we have taken a policy that is supposed to provide a country with a helping hand in its pursuit of development and have succeeded once again in turning such a policy on its head in spectacular fashion."
"We are building a new white elephant under the guise of development aid."
"That is surely not designed to provide long-term assistance."
"Reactors are to be sited somewhere in the landscape, and there is not even any certainty as to how the energy is to be transmitted from there."
"And what about the disposal of the nuclear waste?"
"That, of course, is another question you have yet to resolve."
"You may find that amusing, Sir Leon."
"But as an aid worker who has worked long enough in the shanty towns of this world, I have to tell you that this sort of solution is certainly not one that springs to my mind."
"Let me conclude by stating the obvious, namely that the way Parliament has been treated throughout the period of the KEDO negotiations has been anything but brilliant."
"If you are now presenting us with a letter, Sir Leon, the content of which I can certainly endorse - well, I have to say that it may have come late, but at least it has come."
"However, we are being given sight of this at a very, very late stage in the proceedings."
"I know that you are always keen to inform Parliament and that you do that and come to our meetings."
"But in terms of substance - and let me make this very clear - we are usually sold short, because our questions often receive extremely flowery answers."
"That is something we very often experience in the Committee on External Economic Relations."
"Be that as it may, I have some different ideas of what would help these countries."
"For that reason, even though much of the content of the report may be right and proper, I regret that we shall have to vote against it."
"Mr President, I understand the Council is not present."
"Is that correct?"
"I repeat what the President said at the start of the sitting: the Council has announced - albeit with regret - that it is unable to attend because of duties connected with the preparation of the European Council meeting in Berlin."
"Mr Brinkhorst, we have come to the end of this debate."
"I understand your comment, which has been noted, but the discussion is over."
"Mr President, you cannot say that the debate is over if one of the two institutions to which we addressed our questions has not even replied."
"It seems to me that it should be up to the President to ask the Council to give a reply."
"If you rule that we will not suspend the debate until tomorrow morning - and I understand that is implicit in what you are saying, though I would question it - could you a least say that the Council will reply in writing to the specific questions put by Mr Spencer on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy and that we will have that reply tomorrow before the vote?"
"It makes nonsense of a debate if there should be two institutions present."
"Sir Leon has given a full reply but the President-in-Office of the Council is totally absent."
"Can you reply to that point?"
"My group's attitude will be very much determined by your reply."
"Mr Brinkhorst, we shall ask the Council for a written reply, but I cannot tell you whether or not we shall have it by tomorrow morning."
"I would now ask Sir Leon Brittan whether he wishes to comment further."
"Mr President, I just wanted to say a word about some of the points raised by the last three speakers, and I will be brief."
"I entirely agree with Mr Jarzembowski that it is essential that North Korean military activity must not present a threat."
"He has spoken in a very clear way."
"I would agree with and endorse it, and what we are doing is designed to deal with the security issue as much as anything else."
"It is indeed put forward explicitly as a way to engage the North Koreans and discourage them from the worst form of military threat that there could be - namely, a nuclear threat."
"It has to be seen in that context."
"Mr Kreissl-Dörfler suggest that we really should be focussing on other problems."
"All I can say is that you have to ask yourself - and I would address this to Mr Dupuis as well - the extent to which we are able to do so with a country like North Korea."
"The fact of the matter is that the gravest threat that it presents to its neighbours is a security one and that in preventing that by the KEDO Programme or diminishing the risk of it in the KEDO Programme, we are actually making a contribution without which it would not be possible to think about any other sort of measures; and I would say to Mr Dupuis that the idea that a regime which has the horrific characteristics that he has described is one that is going allow our propaganda to enter, is frankly an unrealistic one."
"I will say however to him that the new aid programme, in fact, is conditional."
"We have paid particular attention to securing adequate commitments from the DPRK on the monitoring procedures and on a reform policy for agricultural rehabilitation products with increased incentives for farmers, devolution of decision-making, revolving credit facilities and so on. In those circumstances, I really do think that, faced by what was hitherto regarded as an impenetrable regime, we have made substantial efforts both to engage them in the process of the reform and to reduce the security threat that they would otherwise present to their neighbours and the rest of the world."
"Thank you, Sir Leon."
"As I have said, we shall ask for a reply from the Council, which is represented by two officials here in the Chamber."
"I have received a motion for a resolution tabled pursuant to Rule 40(5)."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 3 p.m."
"Emigration from Iraq and neighbouring region"
"The next item is the report (A4-0079/99) by Mrs Terrón i Cusí, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on the influx of migrants from Iraq and the neighbouring region: EU action plan adopted by the Council on 26 January 1998 (5573/98 - C4-0124/98)."
"Mr President, as you have just stated, tonight we are going to debate an action plan on the influx of immigrants from Iraq and the neighbouring regions."
"This report was adopted on 26 June 1998, though Parliament was consulted only a few months ago, when the action plan had already been under way for almost a year."
"The Committee on Civil Liberties and I would have welcomed the opportunity to prepare a report on the measures proposed in this action plan at an appropriate time, and we felt that it was somewhat ridiculous to be called on to do so a year after the plan had been implemented."
"In my capacity as rapporteur, I therefore wished to take advantage of the opportunity provided by consultation and present a political report on this plan and its implementation. Parliament should not be criticised for failing to put forward its opinion at a more appropriate moment as it was consulted at an impossible time."
"As we prepared the report, we put certain questions to the Council which, in our view, were crucial."
"We asked the Council how many people were involved and about the extent of the immigration."
"We asked about the result of the proposed measures, which had already been in force on the ground for almost a year, and we also enquired about the impact of the action plan on illegal immigration and on the criminal activities of those who traffic in people. We also wanted to know how many people had sought asylum and been processed since the action plan had been implemented."
"I appreciate that such information can be hard to obtain."
"Nevertheless, I most earnestly hope that someone somewhere is in possession of it by now, though the Committee on Civil Liberties and Parliament most certainly are not."
"We have not managed to find out anything."
"No information has been made available to us, and we received no response to the questions we asked."
"Notwithstanding this state of affairs, I attempted to analyse all the various aspects of the Council's proposal."
"It should be said in the Council's defence that this action plan represents an attempt to adopt a global approach to a problem which Parliament had already highlighted in a resolution on this issue dated 15 January 1998."
"Certain aspects of the action plan have given me particular cause for concern."
"Firstly, I am unhappy that very different situations are being jumbled up together and dealt with in the same way under the plan."
"When we refer euphemistically to 'immigrants from Iraq and the neighbouring regions', we also include a Kurdish area torn apart by a political conflict which has resulted in strong repression."
"We are therefore dealing here with a displaced population seeking protection in more peaceful areas."
"The action plan refers to this in passing, along with actions aimed at other population groups which are indeed part of the same flow of migrants but for very different reasons."
"Mixed in with these we find actions directed against trafficking in people."
"We are in favour of measures against trafficking in people, but we believe that each of these specific issues should be tackled with the appropriate measures. A distinction should be made between asylum seekers, those who are fleeing a conflict, and the activities of those who traffic in people."
"Although the composition of this flow of migrants is undoubtedly varied, we do not believe that this is a valid excuse for failing to make the necessary distinctions."
"In this context, we are also rather concerned about Turkey's part in the action plan."
"Given its geographical location, Turkey is bound to be the first country to receive these displaced people."
"It is essential, however, that their human dignity be respected."
"Turkey should allow the UNHCR to organise the initial reception process, particularly since, for refugees from northern Iraq and especially those from Kurdistan, Turkey is part of the problem and cannot therefore be considered a safe third country for these people."
"Respect for human rights and for the rights of minorities in Turkey must take precedence over cooperation and aid in this respect."
"Finally, Members of the Council - I trust you are present in the House today, because if you are not, what we are engaged in is fairly pointless - could you please enlighten us as to what exactly an action plan is meant to be?"
"We have no idea."
"We know all about joint actions within the framework of the CFSP, we know all about other procedures, but an action plan is something new, and we would like to be informed of the basis on which this decision was taken."
"It seems to us that the decision lacked a sound legal basis."
"We therefore call on the Commission to present a new proposal in three months' time, and for Parliament to be consulted before the Council takes a decision. We would also like information regarding the budget allocation for all this."
"We sincerely hope that such information does exist and that it will be made available to Parliament."
"Mr President, once again the Council of Ministers is addressing itself to the European Parliament rather late in the day. It is requesting Parliament's opinion on an action plan, as the rapporteur has said, after this was adopted by the Council in January 1998 without prior consultation, as required by Article K.6 of the Treaty."
"Is the content of the action plan so insignificant that this oversight can be forgiven?"
"Quite the opposite."
"The problem that has to be solved is an enormous, complex and extremely difficult one."
"It has arisen in the most sensitive and inflammable region bordering on our continent."
"It is a running sore that is getting worse and spreading to many countries where streams of refugees are taking shelter."
"It is putting our humanitarianism and our civilisation to the test."
"The swarms of refugees and dispossessed persons, be they Kurds from Iraq or, for all kinds of reasons, outcasts from neighbouring countries, are being caught in the nets of those who trade in illegal immigrants and falling into lawlessness and poverty."
"Every day we learn of appalling events, the victims of which include women and children."
"In her comprehensive and very thorough report, the rapporteur rightly calls for a new proposal to be submitted within three months and for consultations with the European Parliament to take place."
"Only in this way can Member States participate in this action according to the letter of the law."
"The Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs is unanimously agreed, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy has delivered a unanimous opinion."
"However, the rapporteur does not fail to point out the weaknesses, the naivety and the omissions that characterise this plan, which has been adopted in fits and starts."
"Nor does she deny that illegal immigration must be tackled with great severity, but this severe approach must not be indiscriminately merciless."
"It is hypocritical of us to ignore the fact that, in this way, the notion of asylum is discredited, when rejection or repatriation is often tantamount to a death sentence."
"The fact that a central, governing role is being entrusted to Turkey, which has just such a past, with its violation of human rights, the state of its penal institutions and, in general terms, its inability to function in a proper judicial way, is simply a joke in very bad taste."
"The fact that it is being entrusted with such a role by the Council in respect of a problem which Turkey itself is trying to eliminate through military operations can only be seen as a very poor joke."
"Mr President, looking at the European Union's action plan of January last, we see a great many sound measures, but also signs of panic."
"Measures were of course needed to cope with the exodus from Kurdistan and so on, but all those measures ought to have been taken much earlier."
"One might say that the Council had been fast asleep for years, and by the time it woke up the Kurdish migrants were already in Italy."
"My first question is this: what has actually come of all the measures taken under that action plan?"
"We have no clear picture of them."
"We think that Parliament really ought to be properly briefed on this."
"On the subject of briefing, another sign of panic on the part of the Council last year was that Parliament as a whole was not properly involved in the decision-making process."
"The rapporteur, Mrs Terrón, made this point and it is outrageous."
"That is tough talk, I know, and I mean it."
"We as Parliament should have given our opinion on these matters."
"Last week saw the resignation of the Commission, but I think that the Council, in matters falling under the third pillar, has possibly treated Parliament even worse."
"So there is work to be done here."
"It means, as paragraph 1 of the resolution says, that there must within three months be a good overview and a proper new proposal on which Parliament is consulted."
"The European Commission has to provide that."
"I trust it will be able to do so."
"This is also relevant to relations with Turkey."
"They continue to be difficult, of course."
"The ELDR Group believes that the dialogue with Turkey must continue on issues such as the acceptance of Kurdish migrants in the region and the improving of human rights generally. On these matters too, both the European Commission and the Council must keep Parliament properly informed."
"Mr President, at this precise moment, when the subject of the Kurds is very much on the agenda throughout Europe, the measures proposed by the rapporteur, Mrs Terrón i Cusí, are urgent necessities."
"Her criticism of the action plan is warranted too."
"The European Union can use its policy as a means of ensuring that the people of that region are able to focus their lives on their homeland and to live on their native soil where they feel at home."
"As long as we in the European Union cannot eliminate the root causes of these refugee movements, as long as there is no peace in the region and as long as the political repression of minorities is common practice, we need an efficiently administered asylum procedure as proposed by the rapporteur."
"My group also supports your proposals on dealing with Turkey as the country of initial reception for refugees from Iraq."
"It is very important to us that the organisation and implementation of this initial reception in Turkey should be entrusted to the UNHCR alone."
"We also subscribe to Mrs Terrón i Cusí's view that the Commission must present a new proposal, on which the opinion of the European Parliament must be heard, before the Council takes its decision."
"That would be an exemplary procedure and would befit the serious nature of the matter under discussion."
"Mr President, this action plan shows once again that the mechanisms and procedures of the third pillar are not working and that European policy is reactive, not proactive, and devoid of vision."
"It is important to devise a policy for the long term."
"The plan designed for large numbers of refugees is largely rendered inappropriate by the decline in the number of refugees."
"This may mean that the policy has worked."
"But we do not have the information which would allow us to assess its effectiveness."
"There is an urgent need for transparency and clarity in the assessment criteria."
"Consulting the European Parliament on the action plan was the first step."
"This policy must also be viewed in its foreign policy context."
"In this region where there is conflict, oppression and a flouting of human rights, we have to be very careful about sending back refugees."
"Sending Kurds back to Turkey at present is inappropriate, to say the least."
"Nor is Iraq's record one which justifies sending refugees back."
"We must be careful not to close our borders before we have conducted thorough analyses."
"It is vital for us to look at the deeper causes and resolve the problems on the spot."
"Let us hope that we can do so."
"Mr President, in her report, Mrs Terrón y Cusí criticises the EU's action plan on the influx of migrants from Iraq and the neighbouring region."
"The report is critical both of the contents of the action plan and of the fact that the European Parliament became involved in this plan only after it had been adopted."
"On the question of form, I can understand the reason for her criticism."
"Parliament should have been able to have its say before such an important document was approved."
"At the same time, the implementation of the action plan is now the subject of a review."
"As you probably know, the Council has set up a special high-level group to prepare action plans for Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Somalia, Morocco and Albania and the surrounding area."
"In addition, the Council has asked the high-level group to review the implementation of the action plan on Iraq."
"The document which the rapporteur has laid before us is therefore extremely valuable."
"The task of the high-level group is to formulate proposals as to who should be eligible to take advantage of the possibilities offered by the EU under all three pillars."
"The reasons are obvious: the situation differs from one country to another, so our migration policy should be adapted to suit the actual situation in each case."
"Naturally, the more political instruments we have at our disposal, the more flexible we can be."
"It also means making use of the whole range of possibilities offered by the Union, and Parliament's views are therefore also very welcome."
"As regards the financing of the project in Turkey, the Commission still firmly believes that it is only feasible if we receive guarantees that human rights are being respected."
"Furthermore, it is also our confirmed opinion that the UNHCR should be involved in any attempt to start up an asylum project in Turkey."
"In the report, the Commission is urged to introduce measures to speed up the asylum process."
"The House may be pleased to learn that on 3 March the Commission, at my suggestion, approved a working document which includes proposals relating to that very issue."
"The purpose of the document is to initiate a wide-ranging discussion with Parliament, the Member States and voluntary organisations on the framing of future asylum procedures in Europe."
"It starts by advocating a speeding-up of the asylum process, but without undermining the right of people to have their requests for asylum considered in a thorough and objective way."
"I passed this working document on to the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs on the day it was approved."
"The Commission intends to put forward a formal proposal after the Amsterdam Treaty has entered into force."
"I assume that before then the Commission will be informed of Parliament's views."
"In her report, Mrs Terrón y Cusí also mentions the need to help asylum-seekers and refugees to return to their countries of origin."
"I should therefore like to recall that, in December 1998, I put forward a proposal to establish a legal basis for a budget line covering asylum provision and repatriation."
"Naturally, I am very disappointed that the discussions relating to our proposals for temporary protection and burden-sharing have not made more progress in the Council of Ministers."
"I am still convinced that vigorous efforts are required to deal with the widespread smuggling of human beings that is going on all over Europe."
"Two protocols to the United Nations Convention on international organised crime are currently under discussion."
"The first is intended to step up the campaign against the smuggling of different types of migrants; the second to prevent and punish, above all, the smuggling of women and children."
"We have a unique opportunity to reach a common position in the Council of Ministers when the negotiations are resumed."
"We should therefore decide quickly on a European set of principles, so that we can defend what we consider to be an effective strategy in that area."
"The issue is now under discussion in the Council of Ministers."
"For that reason, today's debate is of great interest as regards the further implementation of the action plan."
"I gather that the Council is not present and that none of the questions put to it will be answered."
"I would ask you, Mr President, to inform the Council that, as rapporteur, I find its attitude unacceptable and humiliating."
"I am grateful to Mrs Gradin for the explanations she has provided, and I agree entirely with her."
"Mrs Gradin has always adopted a positive attitude towards Parliament and I truly appreciate it."
"Her attitude contrasts sharply with that of certain people who have not even deigned to be present today, as we discuss a plan of action that has been in force for a year and three months, and on which we have belatedly been invited to express an opinion."
"Mr President, I would ask you once again to convey my personal indignation to the Council and also my hope that answers to the questions put to it may eventually be forthcoming."
"We shall certainly make that request."
"As I pointed out a few moments ago, the President announced at the start of the sitting that the Council would not be present."
"In actual fact - and this also applies to the previous debate - Rule 40 clearly stipulates that the institution to which a question is addressed has to give a reply."
"This is an unusual situation, and we shall therefore ensure that Parliament makes a specific request to the Council."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 3 p.m."
"Application of Community law"
"The next item is the report (A4-0092/99) by Mrs Sierra González, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the fifteenth annual report on monitoring the application of Community law (1997) (COM(98)0317 - C4-0377/98)."
"Mr President, the Commission's annual reports on monitoring the application of Community law have two main functions: to provide information on how the Commission is monitoring the transposition of directives by the Member States; and to provide an account of the use made by the Commission of its discretionary power as guardian of the Treaties to initiate non-compliance procedures."
"Concerning the first of these objectives, it has to be said that the Commission has made a significant effort in terms of the transposition of directives, particularly the directives relating to the internal market."
"As a result, the number of directives transposed into national law increased in all the Member States in 1997, and the results were particularly significant in some countries, such as Finland, Denmark and Sweden."
"Nevertheless, we must also point out that the national transposition measures taken have not always resulted in the correct transposition of the directives into national law. Moreover, the majority of Member States did not adopt the national measures needed to transpose the directives until after the deadline for doing so."
"With regard to the second objective concerning non-compliance, considerable progress has been made following the entry into force on 1 January 1997 of a new instrument - the voluntary notification procedure - which seeks to facilitate the swift and uncontentious processing of disputes on the basis of transparency and mutual trust. The introduction of this new procedure coincided with the proposal made by the Commission to the Court of Justice to the effect that once non-compliance has been established, a daily fine should be imposed until compliance is achieved, and this has led to substantial progress."
"The threat of such a fine has had a particularly dissuasive effect."
"Much still remains to be done, however, as regards the implementation of decisions arrived at."
"Delays in their implementation have created a lack of trust in such decisions."
"In fact, 87 decisions handed down by the Court in accordance with Article 169 have yet to be implemented. Nevertheless, this represents an improvement on the previous year, as in 1996, 98 decisions were still awaiting implementation."
"Moreover, 34 decisions relating to Article 171 have still to be implemented."
"Not only do such delays in the implementation of the rulings detract from the credibility of the decisions taken by the Court of Justice, but they also have a deleterious effect on the image of all the institutions, making them appear inefficient."
"Turning to other areas, an overall reduction in the number of infringement proceedings in progress has also been recorded, following the reform of the procedure to shorten the period of time between lodging a complaint or recording a case of non-compliance and the first decision on the basis. The number of infringement proceedings initiated concerning environmental issues and discrimination on the grounds of nationality has nevertheless increased in relative terms."
"Despite the progress made - which certainly deserves recognition - much remains to be done concerning certain specific features of the procedures, such as the strict observance of the terms of any injunction and of the time allowed to evaluate a complaint or a petition, and giving plaintiffs the opportunity to have access to legal arguments which could affect the final decision on a complaint so as to facilitate possible appeals. All these issues will have to given serious consideration in the near future, in the interests of legal efficiency and of the transparency of proceedings as well as to guarantee the credibility of non-compliance procedures in the eyes of the public."
"To this end also, we will have to encourage more detailed knowledge of Community issues among the legal profession and the general public. Subsidising training programmes and simplifying regulations would help in this respect."
"In conclusion, I would simply like to say that it is unfortunate that this annual report has not followed up the recommendations made in the previous report, namely, extending the scope of the report to include new material relating to the implementation of international agreements the Community is party to, petitions and the transposition of social policy directives."
"Mr President, this report by Mrs Sierra González is characterised by new proposals and new improvements, involving the simplification of Community law, better transposition of Community law into the national laws of the Member States, and easier access to Community law for the people of Europe."
"The fact that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights has unanimously approved this text is proof of its more general acceptance, for which the rapporteur deserves our congratulations."
"As rapporteur, I monitored the implementation of Community law in 1994, and since then I have not ceased to stress how important I believe it is to familiarise jurists with Community law."
"My amendment, which was incorporated into the motion for a resolution, calls once again on Member States and universities to make such study compulsory."
"The Schuman action plan to teach Community law to lawyers is an important move in the same general direction."
"On the eve of the new enlargement of the European Union, the procedures to successfully incorporate derived law into the national laws of the applicant countries are of almost self-evident importance."
"This is the basis of my other amendment, also incorporated into the motion for a resolution, which calls on the Commission to provide all possible technical support."
"For the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, there is of course the PHARE programme, but Cyprus and Malta, with which we hope negotiations will begin shortly, are not covered."
"The report now before us is the last in this fourth parliamentary term on the annual monitoring of the application of Community law, and it gives us the opportunity to point out the improvements made over those years thanks to the pressure brought to bear by the European Parliament, which has the power of codecision following the Treaty of Maastricht and is therefore a co-legislator."
"The progress made in incorporating Community law into national law has been quite spectacular, and the implementation by the Commission of Articles 169 and 171 of the Treaty, with the imposition of penalties, has, as Mrs Sierra González has pointed out, compelled Member States to respect the decisions of the European Court far more than used to be the case."
"In a few weeks, the Amsterdam Treaty will enter into force."
"The European Parliament will gain significant new powers of codecision, as well as powers in other areas."
"I would like to express my firm belief that this change will make a significant contribution to ensuring that European Community law moves closer to the people of Europe, and that there will be more transparency in the decisions of the European Union."
"Mr President, I am pleased to see that the rapporteur, in paragraphs 9 to 15, adopts the same approach to Community law as last year's report, as well as the Larive report on business communications."
"We should like to see the procedures speeded up, for example by having regular three-monthly Commission meetings on these issues, a six-month time-limit, and so on. I hope that the new incoming Commission will adhere to any undertakings in this respect so as to ensure that the reforms can be effectively applied."
"We were also pleased to hear the rapporteur mention that there should be more rapid access to the reasoned opinions of the Court of Justice; my colleague Mr Wijsenbeek is still waiting for an opinion on his case from the ECJ."
"Much attention has also been focused on the clarity of Community law."
"We know that Parliament approved the guidelines set out in Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi's proposal for better Community legislation."
"Unfortunately, I have to say that the comments of the language experts relating to these guidelines have not been particularly encouraging: no language experts have actually been consulted."
"At the same time, we know that the English translation service is forging ahead with its attempt to 'fight the fog'."
"The Liberals have tried to focus attention on these efforts, but unfortunately we have still not succeeded in getting everyone to understand that Parliament should put pressure on the other translation services to make them see matters in the same way."
"The written language should be made more user-friendly."
"It is not we who draft the legislation who have to understand it, but the people who actually apply it."
"This would also allow us to make considerable administrative savings."
"I hope and firmly believe that the Finnish Presidency will make this a matter of priority in the autumn, thereby enabling us to promote a better understanding of Community law."
"Mr President, it is difficult to say anything new when discussing a report such as the one before us today which enjoys such broad consensus. Not only has it been approved unanimously, but it goes forward without a single amendment."
"However, a moment's reflection is called for."
"The Commission's annual report concerns the issue of monitoring the application of Community law."
"So, it primarily relates to monitoring and thus the way in which the Commission exercises the monitoring powers entrusted to it in the Treaty as guardian of the Treaties."
"These powers - I am referring in particular to Article 169 and Article 171 of the EC Treaty - have been increased and strengthened."
"And yet as other speakers have already pointed out, we need to increase the transparency of this procedure, particularly as regards the administrative procedure, which takes place within the Commission behind closed doors."
"The Commission is currently under review and amongst other challenges it is being urged to devise a clearer and more transparent procedure with a timetable we are all aware of."
"But what is at issue here is monitoring application."
"Application means knowledge, knowledge means understanding and understanding means clarity first and foremost."
"Community law lacks clarity."
"Mr Anastassopoulos referred to a representative from a country in Eastern Europe, and I remember him saying to me: 'Mrs Palacio, you require us to incorporate the acquis communautaire , but you are constantly changing it'."
"We were dealing with a matter relating to consolidation."
"From the start of the consolidation initiative to the time when Parliament began its report, two directives which should theoretically have been consolidated were amended twice."
"This is a typical example of the lack of visibility, the complicated web of rules which has such a negative effect on Community law in general."
"This is what Declaration No 19 of the Treaty of Amsterdam relates to."
"Another declaration to mention in this respect is Declaration No 39 annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam on the quality of drafting."
"Legislation is being drawn up in 11 languages, embodying legal institutions drawn from different legal traditions."
"All this needs to be harmonised, so we must make a special effort to ensure that the end product can be understood by everyone, as Mrs Thors says. Crucially, it needs to be understood by the experts."
"Initiatives such as the Grotius and Schuman programmes should receive every support, because if Community law is to be correctly applied, the experts, the judges, the lawyers and, more generally, all the courts must to be the first to apply it correctly."
"However, I should like to conclude on a positive note."
"I believe that as Mr Anastassopoulos has pointed out, this review of the application of Community law, the application of the articles on monitoring in the Treaty and, in general, knowledge of Community law have all improved since 1994."
"We must maintain our efforts in this direction as a great deal still remains to be done."
"Mr. President, I have to compliment Mrs Sierra González on her admirable report."
"Monitoring the application of Community law is an essential part of what we are doing in Europe."
"The task of the Commission is to be a guardian of the Treaty."
"We have to make sure that the citizens affected enjoy the benefits that Europe provides, and I am grateful for Parliament's support in this difficult, unending task."
"The Fifteenth Annual Report for 1997 shows that we have taken several important steps in ensuring respect for Community law; and Mrs Sierra González, in her speech today, has referred to a number of them."
"We have substantially improved our working methods."
"Good examples are the efforts to speed up the handling of cases and to encourage the transparency of our actions and all that has been done in close cooperation with the Ombudsman."
"To enforce effectively Community law, we have used all the instruments that we have."
"Cooperation and peer pressures are often an effective tool to increase transposition and correct implementation of Community law."
"That is demonstrated by the successes of the single-market action plan and the bilateral meetings on directives with Member States."
"I would also agree with Mrs Sierra González that producing simple and clear legislation is one of the best ways to avoid problems later."
"Mrs Thors was right to talk about the importance of having user-friendly language."
"I also agree with Mr Anastassopoulos and others who spoke about the importance of teaching law so that those who are lawyers understand what the Community law is all about."
"That having been said, there are occasions when we have to use our powers under Article 169 of the Treaty to launch infringement proceedings; and we, of course, do so."
"We are currently handling more than 3, 200 such cases."
"Our reforms have improved the working of the proceedings, and that is very important for citizens who are at the origin of nearly 50 % of the cases."
"We are handling cases much faster than a few years ago, and the main reasons for that are that we now decide letters of formal notice, recent opinions and referrals to the Court on a more regular basis."
"Cases are now decided on a bi-weekly basis."
"In the past, the system was more rigid and did not allow one to come to a decision as soon as the case was ready for action."
"Secondly, decisions are implemented more rapidly."
"In the past, it could take several months to send a 169 letter."
"Today, the formal notice will often reach the Member State a week after the decision."
"And finally, we enforce deadlines for reply or compliance much more strictly although, of course, the rights of defence of the Member State have to be respected."
"We use all opportunities to solve infringement problems as quickly as possible."
"Only 10 % of the cases go to Court, and reference has been made to the penalty system which now exists, and requests from between 7, 000 and 260, 000 euros per day have been put forward by the Commission."
"It is all for the benefit of our citizens so it is quite right and normal that we should inform them of all the steps of an infringement proceeding which concerns them."
"Here the European Ombudsman as well as the Parliament have played an important and instructive role."
"Information on respect of Community law in general must also be more widespread, and I welcome the support of the Parliament to increase transparency in this area still further."
"To conclude, respect for Community law is essential to bring Europe closer to its citizens."
"We are using all the powers we have to prevent, and if necessary, pursue infringements by Member States."
"That is what our citizens are entitled to expect, and that is what they are getting."
"Thank you, Sir Leon."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 3 p.m."
"Common system of VAT (standard rate)"
"The next item is the report (A4-0129/99) by Mr Secchi, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the proposal for a Council Directive amending, with regard to the level of the standard rate, Directive 77/388/EEC on the common system of value added tax (COM(98)0693 - C4-0711/98-98/0331(CNS))."
"Mr President, you have given the title of this proposal for a directive, on which the Council has asked Parliament to follow urgent procedure. It involves extending the existing system for the current year and, at the same time, establishing a band - between 15 and 25 % - within which the standard rate must fall."
"Colleagues are well aware of the recent developments - significant ones - concerning taxation: there have been various proposals to coordinate the Member States' taxation systems with a view to abolishing harmful fiscal competition and, on the other hand, allowing healthy fiscal competition to take full effect."
"However, alongside this much-needed coordination - which, as I said, has already occurred to some extent - other measures, by their very nature, require fully-fledged harmonisation to allow the internal market to operate smoothly."
"In the action plan for the single market presented at the Amsterdam European Council almost two years ago, the Commission pointed to the need to work towards a common system of taxation in the area of VAT, which would eventually replace the current transitional system, while at the same time modernising and simplifying it."
"A three-stage approach has been agreed: this will involve measures to correct the distortions in the present VAT system, modernising the current system by extending it to new leading-edge services and, of crucial importance, establishing the definitive VAT system by adopting the 'country of origin' principle."
"This approach will allow existing procedures to be simplified and will reduce red tape for national administrations and firms, while helping to resolve the serious problem of fraud in the Community."
"It should also bring benefits for citizens and consumers, because greater transparency and competition between the systems of the various Member States will bring about convergence towards more acceptable levels of taxation."
"But since, as a result of delays, we are still awaiting the definitive system, a directive such as the one now before us is required for the current year, 1999."
"Basically, the proposed directive extends the present system for one year and sets a band - between 15 and 25 % - within which the standard rate must fall."
"I believe that we are bound to accept this request, even though it is already belated, given that we are now at the end of March."
"While coming out in favour of the Commission's proposal, Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs wishes to take this opportunity to emphasise the urgent need to adopt the definitive VAT system."
"The committee has put forward an amendment on this point, stressing that in one sense this is the final extension, and at the same time calling for the definitive system to enter into force on 1 January next year."
"A second amendment, which I have tabled on behalf of my group, reformulates this concept as a recital, adding that the present system - the one providing the transition to the definitive system, as it were - has a whole series of drawbacks, including the ones briefly listed in my explanatory statement."
"I hope that these amendments will be taken up by Parliament and viewed by the Commission as an incentive to proceed towards the definitive system, which is talked about so much but seems to be some kind of remote and increasingly unattainable dream."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with many of the points the rapporteur, Mr Secchi, makes in his well-informed report."
"The Commission's proposal which forms the background to his report deals with the harmonisation of value added tax in the Member States and is an attempt to make up for the delay in reform."
"This is an important issue, which is being hampered by the fact that Union's decision-making machine is not working."
"The rapporteur is quite rightly firm about extending the period of transition currently in force."
"The reform of the VAT system must be brought to a conclusion."
"The Commission's proposal is largely a technical one, but the subject in itself is mainly political."
"The relationship in principle between indirect and direct taxation and the idea of goods and services as a source of indirect taxation are linked to the question of social fairness."
"Switching the focus of taxation to indirect taxes hampers progressive taxation, and it is through progressive taxation that the income gap will narrow. While the Union is involved in the process of harmonising tax policy we should not ignore this important social tool."
"However, what we are discussing here is indirect taxation."
"At least as far as food is concerned, the harmonisation of VAT in the Union would ease the situation in Finland, for example, where the VAT rate on food is, at 17 %, currently about 10 % higher than the EU average."
"Lowering the VAT rate on food would improve prospects for employment through support to the food industry."
"Consumers would gradually turn their attention more to processed foods."
"It is also a question of social fairness."
"The smaller a person's income, the more indirect taxation takes, in relative terms, from that income."
"Lightening the tax burden on food would make an immediate difference to how much money people had in their pocket."
"Furthermore, the level of VAT in the production of services is one of the key issues of tax policy."
"From the point of view of employment, high levels of taxation on services and consumption have hindered growth and, consequently, prospects for employment. It is a sort of phenomenon of suffocation."
"We therefore have to lighten the VAT burden on the labour-intensive service industries."
"However, a certain degree of harmonisation of the standard VAT rate is inevitable."
"We can make a virtue of this inevitability, though, by tying the lightening of the tax burden to policy on employment and growth."
"Easing the VAT burden on food and services would therefore lend support to this policy."
"Mr President, this is a very late hour and a quite improper one at which to be discussing such a serious matter."
"But we are not just here to keep Mr Secchi company while he presents his report on the common system of value added tax."
"It is not only the hour that is late: this amendment to Directive 77/388 was supposed to come into effect on 1 January this year and to remain in force until the end of the year."
"That is why we are here at this late hour, to support the rapporteur in stressing the urgent need for universal adoption of the country of origin principle, to cut down on red tape, to facilitate commercial activity, to combat tax evasion and to reform indirect taxation with a view to total transparency."
"Although the single market is operational, it has still not been completed, and here and in other areas there are signs of distortion of competition."
"The introduction of the single currency and the disappearance of exchange rate competition between the various Member States has exacerbated the market disturbances caused by tax competition."
"Whether you call it tax coordination or tax harmonisation, there is a set of measures that needs to be jointly adopted for all fifteen tax systems in the EU."
"We are talking here today quite simply about defining a band of between 15 % and 25 % as the range for the normal minimum and maximum VAT rates to be applied by Member States."
"However, the scope for applying reduced rates will have to be reviewed in the near future, because of the distortions in competition it causes between certain geographical areas and between certain products and services, whether it be between Belgium and Austria or between Portugal and Spain."
"VAT, which is an intrinsically neutral tax, has ended up being a factor influencing company locations and trade flows."
"This harmonisation of rates and this changeover from the transitional system to the definitive system demands courage and sacrifices of all the Member States if we are to achieve closer alignment of national tax systems, even if this is phased in under a timetable."
"Unless we can end fiscal chauvinism, the single market and economic and monetary union themselves will remain weak and incomplete."
"Mr President, the question we are discussing today may seem dry and technical, but appearances are deceptive."
"This is all about whether the Union can summon up the strength to discuss or regulate properly the conditions of competition in the single market and to eliminate the opportunities for both tax evasion and distortion of competition that exist in the realm of value added tax under the recipient-country principle."
"That is indeed a crucial requirement."
"I can fully endorse what the previous speakers have said on that point."
"This is really the political point of the Secchi report."
"I do not think we should labour under the illusion that it will be easy to meet this target of 1 January 2000."
"But it is right for us as a Parliament to put this demand on the bargaining table again."
"That way, there is a chance that at least the fundamental principle will have been accepted by the target date."
"Mr President, there are some perfectly legitimate aims in this report such as the simplification of the VAT system, which is designed to prevent fiscal distortion between Member States and to simplify procedures by adopting the country-of-origin principle."
"Anything along those lines is certainly welcome."
"However, some of the underlying ideas are much more worrying."
"First of all, the determination to constantly regulate and increasingly limit the Member States' scope for independent action is tantamount to reducing the fiscal sovereignty of the various nations that make up the European Union."
"In our opinion, this amounts to a body-blow for fiscal democracy, in that decisions taken at the level closest to the public are becoming increasingly subordinated to decisions taken at more remote levels."
"Secondly, following the introduction of the euro, we should certainly be concerned about the possibility of short-term asymmetric shocks, since the Member States have fewer and fewer options open to them for regulating their economies."
"In the event of inflation, for example, if all taxation is harmonised, each country can no longer have its own monetary policy or apply its own fiscal policy."
"All that is left is wages and incomes policy, and that really represents excessive state control."
"The choices that have been made keep VAT rates extremely high, with the standard rate planned at 15 to 25 %."
"Why not under 15 %?"
"The VAT differential between the European Union, the United States and Japan is still huge, and is probably one of the things that is to blame for Europe's unemployment rate, which is much higher than in the other two countries."
"This is why although this report is extremely good in the context of the current approach, we are not happy with it and we reject its recommendations on principle."
"Mr President, the European Parliament and the amendments which it has proposed reaffirm its support for the movement towards a new common VAT system."
"The Commission entirely supports the stated objectives."
"Nevertheless, the adoption of a final VAT system by the Council between now and December 1999, I am afraid, does not appear to be realistic."
"Indeed, in its programme the Commission had sketched the broad outline of the VAT system envisaged for the future as well as a timetable based on a gradual approach for the presentation of specific proposals."
"This programme proposed three main headings: modernisation, the simplification of the current system and the change of the place of taxation."
"The Commission has already submitted several proposals, currently on the Council table, which cover simplification and the modernisation of the current arrangement specifically with a view to meeting operators' immediate expectations, that is to say, the transposition of the recommendations for the Slim II exercise."
"These proposals are essential to progress towards the final VAT regime."
"Indeed, the passage from non-harmonisation to complete harmonisation, if it is to take place at all, can only be achieved in stages; and the proposal on the standard rate falls within this context."
"The Council, however, does not show any readiness to follow the Commission's proposals, preferring to maintain the status quo , which does not go in the desired direction of greater alignment of VAT rates."
"Nevertheless, the Commission's view is that general simplification of the current VAT system cannot be achieved without radically amending the current complex rules especially those relating to the place of taxation."
"Consequently, the improvements to the current VAT system constitute an essential phase for the passage to a new system which envisages a single place of taxation, the only way of ensuring the radical simplification of the VAT system demanded by European businesses."
"I am afraid that at the moment the proposals currently on the table of the Council, with a view to simplifying the system and to ensure more uniform application of the tax, are at an impasse while the European Parliament of course has supported then unconditionally."
"I would like to thank you therefore for the support that you have given to this proposal and more particularly, the objective being pursued by the Commission, that of the definitive VAT system."
"Thank you, Sir Leon."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 3 p.m."
"The sitting was closed at 10.55 p.m."
"Liability for defective products"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0068/99), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the common position adopted by the Council (12872/1/98 - C4-0016/99-97/0244(COD)) with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Council Directive 85/374/EEC on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products (Rapporteur: Mrs Roth-Behrendt)."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, you have just heard from the President that today we are considering the second reading on product liability."
"Let me trace its history."
"All of us in this Parliament - unanimously, I believe - said here in November 1997, following the BSE affair - and the way it dealt with BSE has been one of Parliament's major successes - that product liability needs to be amended so that in future we can deal with the damage caused by BSE."
"Thereupon the Commission made a proposal that integrates and includes primary agricultural products."
"That was a welcome development."
"However, Mr Monti, it was the least you could do."
"I have always told you in the past that you pursed your lips but did not whistle!"
"I criticise you for that."
"Were you not at present a member of the Commission but still, shall we say, working in a different capacity, then I would say to you today that what you have done seems almost to date from the stone age."
"So I will not say it."
"In the Committee on the Environment we have now added eight amendments for the second reading of the common position."
"Eight amendments is not very many."
"As rapporteur, I have tried to be very moderate and have only tabled those amendments that obtained a majority at the first reading and that, in my view, could also bring about a compromise in other parts of the House."
"There are of course people in this House and outside it who say: we do not want any amendments."
"Let us accept this proposal as it stands!"
"We should accept the Commission proposal, the common position, as it stands."
"My reply to these people and to the Members who said this at first reading is that Parliament should be consistent."
"Given that we said we need changes in connection with BSE, then if we are to be logical we must also cover the case of people who have contracted the new form, the new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease."
"We all know that the incubation period can last from 10 to 20 years."
"So, in order to be consistent, the Committee on the Environment has extended the period of enforcement of the rights conferred upon the injured person to 20 years in the case of a hidden defect - which is all we are talking about here - instead of 10 years."
"Anyone who contracted Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease would never be able to claim damages because that person or the family may not find out about the disease for more than 10 years after it had been contracted."
"We have also raised the amount of the total liability for damage from ECU 70 million to ECU 140 million and have left this up to the Member States."
"That is not so very drastic either and it should be possible to reach a compromise on it in this House."
"Some of you, including Mr Monti, have said that this legislation is being reviewed in any case."
"After all, a green paper is due by 1 January 2000."
"But even when the Commission was still more able to act than it is now, I doubted whether you could produce that green paper on time."
"Now I am convinced and we all know that it cannot be done by 1 January 2000."
"You yourself said, on behalf of the Commission, that you would not be embarking on any new projects, which certainly also means no new legislation."
"The first thing a new Commission does will not be to produce a green paper."
"Even if we got a green paper, it would take two or three, or even four or five years for the legislation to come along."
"Surely that cannot be what we want!"
"Nor could we accept it."
"Let me now address a few of the Members, and I am looking in particular at the PPE Group, because Mrs Grossetête, who like myself is a member of the Committee on the Environment, said at first reading that people do not want this in the first place and that I would be upsetting all manner of things with this amendment."
"In fact it was particularly with the PPE Group in mind that I totally dropped the question of the reversal of the burden of proof, for example, and questions relating to the burden of proof."
"So my request to you, Mrs Grossetête, is to reconsider your position on these two amendments on the expiry date and the amount of liability for damage; for let me tell you that people definitely want us to attend to their personal, their very personal welfare, and not just before the European elections but quite generally!"
"That is what we have tried to do in the Committee on the Environment, which is responsible for consumer protection and health policy."
"We have tried to do so by tabling eight amendments, some of which were taken over from the members of the PPE Group and concern the definition and revision of the legislation."
"By means of these amendments we have extended the expiry date and changed the amount of liability for damage."
"None of this will bankrupt anyone in the European Union."
"There will however be potential damage, and not just in the case of contaminated stored blood which can cause AIDS; that is something I am not discussing at all, I am sticking to primary products here."
"In cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, we are giving the public security."
"I would hope that these amendments will never be needed because nobody will fall ill."
"But if that should be the case after all, then the people of the European Union are entitled to expect us to create a proper legal basis for product liability and for their claims to damages."
"I think we are doing no more and no less here with these amendments."
"I do not believe we are being over-ambitious or over-demanding."
"I ask you to support these amendments at second reading so that we can endeavour to achieve a sensible solution in the codecision procedure with the Council."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we very much welcome the fact that the Commission has decided to extend the scope of Directive 85/374/EEC to primary agricultural products, as requested by the European Parliament following the BSE crisis."
"However, I must say straightaway to Mrs Roth-Behrendt that we cannot support her proposals because she has taken advantage of this opportunity to amend the content of the directive."
"Her proposals not only change the definition given to primary agricultural products, they also introduce the concept of psychological damage, scrap the lower threshold and remove the financial ceiling."
"Finally, and this is particularly serious in my view, they extend the period of limitation from 10 to 20 years for damage resulting from a hidden defect."
"The fact is that when there is damage as a result of a hidden defect, it is generally discovered at the point when the damage occurs."
"I will now turn to the problem of the poor farmers. It has already proved very hard to tell them that their products will fall within the scope of this directive."
"Our farmers are very concerned about the future and the CAP reform, yet we are now asking them to accept liability which they cannot do in the manner proposed by Mrs Roth-Behrendt."
"In any case, the directive provides for the possibility of the people involved in the production process being jointly and severally liable, so when a problem occurs, such as BSE which Mrs Roth-Behrendt mentioned, liability is already incurred."
"If we approve Mrs Roth-Behrendt's proposals, you can just imagine the insurance cover which farmers would have to take out and which could become exorbitant."
"You are no doubt wondering where the consumer stands in all this."
"My answer is to wait for the Green Paper which the Commission has undertaken to prepare for the year 2000 after consultations with producers, distributors, consumers, farmers and insurers."
"The balance of a directive cannot be changed without taking time to carry out a preliminary study, even where consumer protection is involved, and as I have explained, consumers are already protected by the fact that any producer whose product has caused damage bears liability."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt's good intentions are really just pandering to people's prejudices, because her desire to protect consumers without a proper preliminary study means that farmers are going to be overwhelmed and the courts flooded."
"This is why, regrettably, we cannot support Mrs Roth-Behrendt's proposals."
"Madam President, it is very important for consumers to be able to hold producers liable."
"Only with clear legislation and proper information can consumers be full players in the market who decide for themselves which products are sold and which they want to buy."
"Liability will ensure that producers are careful about how they produce."
"The aim is to preclude all risks to consumer health as a result of product defects."
"If the producer has not been careful enough, the consumer is then guaranteed his rights."
"BSE played a major part in the genesis of this report."
"It acted as a catalyst to ensure that agricultural products are now also covered by the rules on liability for defective products."
"Carelessness has led to the deaths of a number of people from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease."
"If there had been clear rules on liability, the chances of that happening would have been far smaller."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt made one emphatic point at first reading."
"She wanted all unsafe products covered by the rules."
"In principle I agree, and I think that she showed courage at first reading."
"But I did not support her on it."
"I think that such an important and problematic subject calls for a detailed discussion and balanced decisions."
"I did not think it right to decide on that as an incidental point in a different report."
"My group and I wholeheartedly support the amendments which Mrs Roth-Behrendt has tabled now at second reading."
"Madam President, it beggars belief that the common position takes no account at all of the views which the European Parliament expressed at first reading."
"I do not accept the Commission's excuse that the directive in question needs to be extensively revised in the context of Agenda 2000."
"The Council too has failed to take the European Parliament seriously in totally ignoring the proposed amendments."
"The rapporteur is quite right in retabling the amendments in question."
"The acute nature of the BSE crisis showed that liability for defective products needs to be widened as quickly as possible."
"The change should also include the closing of other loopholes which exist at present, so that the work does not have to be done twice."
"Parliament's aims do indeed go further than the Commission's."
"To my mind, that is not in itself a reason to reject these amendments, especially since the President of Parliament has declared the amendments to be admissible."
"I regard the raising of the ceiling from EUR 70 to 140 million as important."
"It is not acceptable for a consumer who buys a defective product to be denied compensation because he is not the first, but the umpteenth person to make a claim."
"And I find it only fair that if damage or loss sustained as a result of a defective product occurs only after ten years, the deadline for claims should be extended to 20 years."
"Madam President, since 1985 we have had a directive regulating compensation for people who have suffered damage from defective products."
"With the current proposal, the Commission is intending to increase consumer protection in regard to the safety of food and primary agricultural products."
"In this extremely sensitive area, the directive is to be extended so that it also covers agricultural raw materials, which were excluded until now."
"Amendments Nos 1 and 2 must certainly be supported, because they ensure that those who produce genetically modified seeds can also be held responsible for any consequences."
"Farmers must not be held liable for damage for which the large undertakings are responsible."
"Unfortunately, the Commission proposal was also used as an opportunity to table certain amendments that seriously impinge on national civil law and have no real basis."
"That is why we cannot endorse the extension of the directive to cover agricultural products."
"Madam President, let me begin by thanking the rapporteur for her proposals and for taking the opportunity to put forward proposals by Parliament that go beyond what the Commission proposed."
"I believe that even at the time it proposed these legislative changes we could have expected the Commission to make further-reaching proposals, instead of spending years discussing something that should have been done a long time ago."
"We are now told we will be getting a green paper next year, but I cannot imagine that we will have completed the legislation before the year 2002."
"Let me just point out that so far there has been no follow-up at all to the green paper on the future of food legislation which we voted on a year ago and concerning which everyone fully endorsed Parliament's proposals. That is to say, no law was proposed to implement what we decided at the time."
"I do not find it acceptable to let time pass and do nothing in an area that is so important to every citizen of the European Union."
"In fact I am very surprised to find that my colleagues on the other side of the House have suddenly forgotten a great many of the things we once decided here unanimously and jointly a year and a half ago in the wake of the BSE decision."
"There is another matter to which I would draw attention. If we include liability for primary agricultural products in the directive on liability, then in my view we really will have to complete the chain."
"In fact I tabled an amendment on the subject at first reading, which was accepted."
"I do not think we should hold the farmers alone liable, without enabling them to go back to the producers of their primary products."
"That is essential."
"Perhaps it is not so much a chain as a circle that we have to close here, to ensure that in the end every producer is responsible for what he puts on the market, but that he also assumes this responsibility over a fairly long period of time especially for products which we know can cause illnesses that cannot be detected after one year or even after 10 years."
"I really would ask colleagues to consider that if we grasp this opportunity we should be pleased about it."
"We are taking speedier action on European legislation this time and we should not hang about and expose ourselves to the criticism that we are leaving the consumers out in the cold!"
"Madam President, I fully support Mrs Roth-Behrendt's report. I believe she has carried out very useful work on both the subjective and the objective and circumstantial aspects of the directive."
"As regards the subjective aspects, the notions of producer and product have been broadened. The latter now includes products derived from agriculture and cattle breeding as well as manufactured goods."
"Intermediate products are covered in addition to end products."
"The great importance of precursors has already been mentioned this morning, and genetically modified material which has not been properly inspected ought to be added in the future. It is wise to extend the time period, as symptoms may take more than 10 years to appear in the case of bovine spongiform encephalitis and other known diseases."
"I feel it is extremely important to include the mental consequences of these diseases as well as the physical ones. Given our experiences with rape oil and methylated spirit, we in Spain are very conscious of how dreadful the mental consequences can be."
"As far as compensation is concerned, the sum of EUR 70 million referred to earlier seems insignificant set against the whole economy of the Union. I feel it is quite right to increase it to at least EUR 140 million."
"Finally, I should like Parliament to follow up the good idea of partially reversing the burden of proof in this field."
"It should be borne in mind that producers often build up a particular atmosphere or context to make consumption of their product appear natural and normal. In such circumstances, it should not be up to the consumer alone to produce the evidence, when there is general awareness that the disease has resulted from dangerous methods of production."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is extremely important in economic terms."
"We have very grave reservations, especially concerning Amendment No 4, which drops the retention provision, and Amendment No 5, which extends the expiry date to 20 years."
"I wonder whether we should not reconsider them."
"The case of Amendments Nos 1 and 2 is different."
"They define the raw materials of agricultural and forestry products."
"I know that the Council working group discussed whether a definition should not be set out at least in the recitals."
"The line then taken was that a producer who genetically modifies seeds would in any case have to be regarded as the producer of a raw material and it was not considered necessary to clarify this further."
"I think that is quite wrong."
"I believe it is absolutely essential to endorse these two amendments."
"They would ensure that farmers who use genetically modified products can have recourse to the producers of the genetically modified seeds."
"That could not be done under the proposal as it stands now."
"Farmers, any small farmer, could be held liable for damage caused by genetically modified products - a quite inconceivable and unthinkable situation! - while those responsible for the genetic modifications, large companies like Monsanto and Novartis, would not be in any way liable."
"That cannot be in our interest!"
"So I urge you most sincerely to endorse these two amendments."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have been in this Parliament long enough to not really believe that a debate of this kind can actually change people's minds, and yet I will still try to do so;"
"I am not referring to you, Mr Monti, you are no longer our partner. The Council will be our partner in the codecision procedure, but I am looking to the other side of the House."
"I am addressing you, Mrs Grossetête, because we have discussed this matter directly in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and here in the Chamber too."
"You said I was amending the content of the directive too much."
"You referred to the definition."
"That is precisely where I am protecting the farmers, as your colleagues have just said."
"Mrs Flemming has just said it again too."
"These are amendments that I have taken over and that came from your group and my group and I am assuming that you will have to endorse Amendments Nos 1 and 2, particularly if you want to support the farmers."
"Moreover, I would ask you again to look very closely at Amendments Nos 5 and 6, the question of extending the expiry date for hidden defects and of increasing the total liability amount."
"With regard to the question of extending the expiry date for hidden defects, in the past few weeks 10 people have contracted the new variant of CJD, 10 people!"
"These people have been infected with the disease at some point in the last few years, in the last 15, 18 or 20 years, we do not know exactly when."
"It was a hidden defect and the people who have been injured have to prove this themselves."
"The injured person is responsible for proving it!"
"You can imagine how often he would succeed in doing so, and yet we want to offer that chance."
"I am convinced we must do so."
"At the same time, some Members said that increasing the liability amount we allow the Member States from EUR 70 million to EUR 140 million is something we leave up to the Member States and is still not an enormous total amount."
"Mrs Grossetête, you said something that worried me a little but to which I would also respond."
"You said that farmers fear the future in any case."
"But what we are doing is precisely to protect the farmers!"
"Just consider this: a farmer may buy animal fodder in all good conscience and feed it to his animals in the conviction that it contains no animal protein because it is not labelled as such, these are still not labelled."
"Yet it does contain animal protein and his animals contract BSE and damage occurs."
"Then it is not he who is responsible but the supplier of the animal fodder!"
"What we are doing is precisely to protect the farmer with the amendments on hidden defects."
"So I would ask you again to take a look at Amendments Nos 5 and 6 and at least to try to support them, in addition to Nos 1 and 2, so that we can perhaps fight together for an even better solution during the conciliation procedure."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, following the European Parliament's recommendations on BSE, or more specifically the recommendation to extend - by the end of September 1997 - the no-fault liability regime provided for in Directive 85/374 to primary agricultural products and game, the Commission presented its proposal on 1 October 1997."
"The 1985 directive establishes the right for any victim to be compensated for injury caused by a defective product, without having to prove the fault of the producer."
"In extending this right to the agricultural sector, the Commission is reverting to its original proposal of 1976."
"At Parliament's first reading, in November 1998, a majority came out in support of this principle."
"The Council was likewise in favour of it, adopting the Commission proposal unanimously."
"Unfortunately, there is nevertheless a risk that the aim shared by all three institutions - namely to extend the regime to the farm sector - might not be achieved, should Parliament and the Council disagree on the timing of a thorough review of the 1985 basic directive, going beyond the limited aim I have just described."
"Indeed, by resubmitting the amendments adopted at first reading, your committee responsible is encouraging you to amend the common position."
"As I said, the Council unanimously approved the Commission's text, ruling out any possibility of reviewing the 1985 directive on this occasion."
"In the Commission's view, this is an important and very urgent matter."
"It is crucial that an agreement should be reached on the basis of the common position, thereby extending the rules on civil liability to the agricultural sector."
"Therefore the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 3 to 7, relating to mental injuries, exemption, the time-limit for claims, the maximum amount, and amendment of the directive in the year 2000."
"The other three amendments, relating exclusively to primary agricultural products - Amendments Nos 1 and 2 on liability for injury caused by intermediate products and the means of production, and No 8 on the obligation to present an impact study in the year 2000 - are superfluous in view of the interpretation generally given to Articles 2, 3 and 21 of the 1985 directive."
"Madam President, as the Commission stated last November, the best time and the best way to engage in a review of the 1985 directive is when discussing the report on the application of the directive, which the Commission must present to Parliament and the Council in 2000."
"That report will be preceded by wide-ranging consultations, open to all the sectors concerned, in the form of a green paper to be presented as soon as this proposal has been adopted."
"This is the fastest way of producing a proposal for an amendment taking full account of the importance of the directive to the socio-economic fabric and encompassing all the elements relevant to a review of the 1985 directive."
"I therefore hope that the European Parliament will support this approach, without altering the Council's common position, thereby not only enabling its own recommendation of 19 February 1997 to be carried out, but also bringing forward the start of consultations leading to the year 2000 report."
"Thank you, Mr Monti."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 3 p.m."
"Global governance and UN reform"
"The next item is the report (A4-0077/99) by Mr De Melo, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the challenges of global governance and the reform of the United Nations."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, over the final years of this century we have witnessed an increasing trend towards globalisation in politics, not only on security issues but also on economic and social matters and environmental protection."
"If we are to deal with all these issues at global level it is vital to have a world organisation capable of formulating rules governing universal conduct that will be respected and complied with once they have been accepted."
"Although the scope of its activities is limited, such an organisation has already existed for so long that it is part of modern history, and the role it has played, its conduct and the actions it has taken deserve general praise."
"One slight criticism of this organisation is perhaps that it has failed to widen its range of powers and the scope of its activities, which have virtually become set in stone."
"I am, of course, referring to the United Nations Organisation, which is to be applauded for the pivotal role it has played in solving many world conflicts and problems over the last 50 years."
"For these reasons, which I think are hard to contest, I am convinced that the United Nations Organisation is the right platform for centralising the efforts of the international community to rise to the challenges of globalisation."
"But to do this, the UN needs to have at its disposal the means required for effective management of political issues at world level, starting with the changes needed in the philosophy and logic of international relations."
"First, in the field of peace and security the UN needs to be given effective means of action and these actions should be legitimised by a clear right and duty to intervene."
"The creation of the International Criminal Court has been a great step forward, in that it establishes the international criminal responsibility of the individual."
"The Security Council, whose composition reflects the outcome of the last world war, needs to be reformed to reflect the world's current geopolitical balance."
"A parliamentary dimension needs to be introduced into the UN system, so as to give the organisation more weight in its relations with parliaments throughout the world."
"Second, economic globalisation and the liberalisation of trade and financial markets have brought about a shift in decision-making centres from the political authorities towards economic power."
"This means that in most cases crucial decisions for the world economy are being taken by a small number of globalised companies unrestrained by any democratic scrutiny, often with negative social and environmental consequences."
"For this reason it is becoming necessary to steer globalisation on a more controlled course."
"Let me say it again: a more controlled course for economic globalisation is needed."
"Mutual recognition of cultures, an ethical approach and fairness in international negotiations are essential in restoring a balance between political power and economics."
"To ensure international observance of these principles, it would be advisable to create a Global Security Council that would coordinate and monitor not only security issues as such, but also problems of economic development, social justice and environmental protection."
"Third, the UN and all its member countries should be obliged to make the principle of the universality of human rights and of duties, freedoms, solidarity and justice an essential condition of any pact between the institutions and the states."
"We should also reiterate our support for the creation of the World Environment Agency, and for the reaffirmation and consolidation of environmental protection policy in international relations that this would entail."
"For the reasons that I have presented briefly here and have developed at greater length in my report, together with the generally helpful amendments tabled by honourable Members, I ask you to vote for this resolution."
"Madam President, the European Parliament must basically answer two questions during today's debate: firstly, is it possible to introduce into a world marked by globalisation strong elements of governance over the most important international processes?"
"And secondly, is the United Nations Organisation the appropriate forum in which to develop this desire and capacity for governance?"
"We answer both of these questions in the affirmative."
"Yes, it is not only necessary but also possible to deal democratically with the major problems and challenges facing humanity: security, poverty, the environment and so on."
"The UN should not of course be viewed as a monolithic body."
"Its tasks must be set out clearly, and the necessary synergies must be developed with the Member States, with regional organisations - first and foremost the European Union - and with other international institutions."
"At the same time, the UN is in urgent need of a number of organisational and operational reforms."
"Among the ones which we outline, I would stress those relating to the composition and functions of the Security Council, the establishment of a global 'economic security council' and the streamlining of the structures of the specialised agencies."
"Matters such as the worldwide challenges of human development and the fight against poverty and marginalisation must receive particular attention at the UN."
"To this end, we are convinced that - contrary to what has happened until now - the work of bodies like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund must be brought into line with the aims of the United Nations."
"The opinion which I have drawn up on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation contains all our detailed proposals in this context."
"Much will depend, however, on the EU Member States adopting a coherent approach at the UN over the next few years."
"This will be the acid test of an effective European common foreign and security policy."
"I should like to end by complimenting the rapporteur, Mr De Melo, on his excellent work on this report."
"Madam President, first and foremost I should like to congratulate Mr De Melo on this excellent report which tackles the fundamental issue of wise global governance. His report is certainly timely as the concept of globalisation features prominently in all statements and studies attempting to explain what is going on in the world."
"Indeed, globalisation must not be allowed to get out of control as we are currently witnessing, particularly in the financial sector. Instead, faced with a global reality that is increasingly leading to a single entity, it is incumbent upon us to create a framework of appropriate legal and security arrangements."
"Hence, a report such as the one before us today is not simply a theoretical study, but is extremely relevant."
"It is worth pointing out that there is uncertainty concerning the European Union's responsibility in terms of the future of the UN."
"The 15 Member States currently contribute 38 % of the UN's operational budget, and our payments are up to date."
"The problem is that we are contributing as 15 individual states and not as a single entity, so our contribution does not carry enough weight."
"The same is true of our contribution to all the buffer and peace-keeping troops and to mediation efforts, that is, what are known as the' Petersberg missions' in European jargon. The Member States of the European Union make a vital contribution to these."
"Our involvement in development aid should also be highlighted."
"This state of affairs is particularly regrettable since the European Union is a regional organisation based on the principles of peace and cooperation. As such, it has an automatic vocation to establish links and to promote the United Nations."
"I think that more work on these issues is called for. We must continue with our efforts as we approach the new legislature, particularly since now that the cold war has ended, when its operations were very much restricted, the UN is being called upon to undertake a wide range of missions and is swamped with requests, though it lacks the resources to deal with them all."
"This may put us in mind of a problem we are experiencing much closer to home at the moment."
"Clear criteria on the creation of an Economic Security Council are therefore needed, as is a common European position on the composition of such a council."
"There is currently no consensus or basic agreement on this issue, not even amongst the Member States."
"Secondly, our involvement in peace and security missions and in the establishment of the International Criminal Court certainly deserve a mention. So too does the ongoing search for dialogue with the United States, which in my view is fundamental in ensuring the future of the UN."
"Sustained efforts are also required to develop the economic order following Bretton Woods. This will mean agreeing on solutions and modifications to the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation, thus defining their future role."
"Madam President, my group welcomes this excellent and important report and congratulates the rapporteur."
"Some two weeks ago I was in New York talking about this report to the secretariat and I was distressed to learn that the whole process of UN reform, which was supposed to culminate in the year 2000 at the Millennial Assembly, is blocked."
"The European Union must play its role in unblocking this process of reform with considerable urgency."
"Secondly, I want to stress what has already been said by other speakers, that we need to be holistic about the way in which this reorganisation is carried forward."
"It is not just the United Nations institutions, it is also the Bretton Woods Institutions which, at a time of financial dislocation and global environmental challenge, all require a consistent policy to be developed so that they interact better with each other."
"That became very apparent last week in Geneva at the WTO High Level Seminar on Trade, Environment and Development which was Sir Leon Brittan's initiative."
"It became very clear by the conclusion of that seminar that the chances for a successful Millennial Round of the WTO will depend on a parallel reform and enhancement of the other global institutions."
"I would like to draw attention to one particular idea in the report which is valuable in terms of the legitimacy of these institutions of global governance."
"That legitimacy can only flow from parliamentarians."
"I do not believe that the time is yet right for a full Parliamentary Assembly at global level."
"We know our own problems in running a Parliament even in a coherent single continent such as our own."
"But I endorse the idea of parliamentary Oversight Committees composed of the chairmen of the specialist committees of the planet's parliaments."
"Meetings of all the chairmen of the foreign affairs committees, or all the chairmen of the trade committees relating to the World Trade Organisation, or all the chairmen of environment committees relating directly to the World Environment Organisation or to UNEP could be creative."
"I conclude by saying that we are facing the critical decade from the year 2000 to 2010 for the survival of our species."
"There can be no better way to mark the Millennium than to equip humanity with the global institutions which it needs to pass on its heritage to its children."
"Madam President, internationalisation and globalisation are proceeding apace."
"Unlike some others my group has no problem with this, but good management of the world order does require an effective world body."
"We have that world body in the form of the United Nations."
"But the UN is still not being given the resources and procedures and indeed the respect it needs in order to be effective and I am glad that Mr De Melo has spelled that out in his report, for which we thank him."
"The loss of credibility which the UN has suffered in matters of peace and security must be remedied quickly."
"And what does quickly mean?"
"There has to be an end to decision-making methods which tend to end in deadlock."
"In specific terms that means, for example, a rapid reaction force."
"The UN must be able to react quickly in the event of a humanitarian disaster."
"That can be easy enough."
"The process of decision-making simply has to be adjusted in order to make it possible."
"There is no place here for vetoes."
"And finally, the UN has to be properly financed."
"It is scandalous, I am sure you will agree, that the USA has for so long failed to meet its financial obligations, and international pressure must be brought to bear on each and every country which is behind with its contributions to make it pay its dues."
"Mr President, the United Nations is an institution that was established in the wake of the catastrophes of the Second World War and, with all its weaknesses and deficiencies, contributed to the extent its powers allowed to bipolarisation and the cold war period. However, it also contributed to security and, if you like, to the avoidance of greater confrontations and conflicts."
"But since the 1990s, a fundamental question has arisen: does the United Nations really exist?"
"Does it now play any substantial role in ensuring international security and peace?"
"This question is becoming an increasingly topical one."
"In the space of a few minutes, or a few hours, there may be military intervention in Kosovo, in the Republic of Yugoslavia."
"Where is the UN?"
"When did the UN meet?"
"What has Kofi Annan said?"
"We are hearing from Mr Solana, Madeleine Albright and Mr Holbrooke. But where is Kofi Annan?"
"Why does he say nothing?"
"Is it possible for the UN, in a climate of total monopolisation in which the European Union is totally submissive and compliant, to play any special role?"
"Having said this, I would like to stress that, of course, the proposals from Mr De Melo are very positive and interesting and should be promoted."
"However, I do not think we will find an answer simply by putting in place a network of measures, unless the major powers in the world today, such as the European Union above all, abandon their childish dependency, unless they acquire a sense of independence and self-belief, unless they move forward and take on a substantial role and call into question this suffocating monopoly that is being established by the United States."
"The UN is absent from Kosovo and from Kurdistan; the UN is closing its eyes to the intervention in Yugoslavia and to the total indifference to the rights of the Kurds. The UN is maintaining this unacceptable policy of two steps forward and one step back, and in this way it is impossible for the UN to move forward."
"All this hinges to a great extent on the European Union today."
"Madam President, Mr De Melo has produced an excellent report, and I congratulate him on behalf of the Green Group. At present a sort of global constitution is taking shape, though, unfortunately, it is all happening very undemocratically."
"We have often seen cases where national parliaments accept these agreements, and because they take so long to debate, the details can no longer be examined at such a late stage, and so important issues are decided among governments in what are ultimately secret negotiations."
"I believe that the European Parliament is one of the best forums for voicing opinions, one where we have had the courage to take a position on these agreements, such as the one on the World Trade Organisation."
"Furthermore, I have the impression that national parliaments do not always have the courage to exercise whatever rights they have with regard to their governments, when agreements are being negotiated."
"Perhaps the situation would improve if we were to have something like parliamentary meetings for international organisations, like the World Trade Organisation."
"These would most certainly have the important task of guaranteeing improvements in communication as well as transparency and openness."
"We should be aiming at a sort of global federalism, in which some of the decisions are taken globally as openly and democratically as possible."
"Madam President, this excellent report by Mr De Melo needs to be amended in certain areas, particularly with regard to the Security Council issue."
"I agree with other Members, such as Mr Barón Crespo, who have suggested that we have taken a step backwards."
"Whereas in the previous report we asked for the European Union to be represented on the Security Council, this point does not appear in this report."
"In my opinion, the Security Council question is central but for different reasons from those put forward by my friend, Mr Alavanos."
"I feel that the Security Council is currently demonstrating the limits of the United Nations."
"With regard to Guatemala, we saw how China blocked the peace process because of the veto which it holds on the Security Council."
"The same thing recently occurred with regard to Macedonia where, again because of China, the peacekeeping force had to change its mandate."
"Now with Kosovo, Russia is bringing strong pressure to bear because of its right of veto."
"This has very serious implications for the continuation and possible strengthening of the United Nations system."
"We are now increasingly being forced to rely on American leadership and, unfortunately, the absence of European leadership in order to undertake peacekeeping operations outside the United Nations, such as those that are probably about to take place in Kosovo."
"This is highly regrettable and demonstrates the need to change the way the Security Council operates."
"The veto system leads to a complete stalemate, and I am sorry that Mr De Melo did not stress this point more in his report."
"Madam President, I am grateful to Mr De Melo for his excellent work, following on from that of our former colleague Mr Trivelli, who produced an extremely important resolution on the United Nations in 1993."
"The debate in this House has reverberated with the echo of a protest, heard throughout the world in recent years, concerning the tragedies in Africa, Bosnia and elsewhere."
"Much has been said about the failure, the impotence of the UN, almost as though the United Nations were some kind of club of associates, without assessing the crucial role played by the most important associates, these of course being the United States and certain other countries."
"What, then, is the problem?"
"It is, as Mr De Melo quite rightly says in his report, that the reform carried out must be in keeping with the major changes which have occurred in modern times."
"We can no longer think of the United Nations in the way we did during the cold war, when the Soviet Union still existed and there were still dictatorships in South Africa and South America."
"We must reinvent the UN, and this new UN must play a role in the most significant fields: the historical, traditional one of conflict prevention, the increasingly relevant one of championing human rights, that of preventing economic and financial turbulence, and that of coordinating measures against old and new forms of crime."
"In this light the question of reforming the Security Council, already referred to here, is a truly enormous one."
"We shall have to be rather more bold."
"One of the most important associates of the future must be one which is currently divided into 15: the European Union."
"As Mr De Melo suggests in his resolution, we must seek to ensure that this reform of the Security Council is implemented as soon as possible."
"Mr President, we find ourselves at a transitional stage in the development of a new world order, first envisaged at the end of the cold war. Progress during this stage appears to consist of taking one step forward and two steps back."
"Previous speakers have pointed out that the transition is characterised by two main features. In political terms it is marked by a tendency towards single polarity, and in socio-economic terms - which are also political in their broadest sense - by the acceleration of globalisation."
"I agree with my colleague Mr Vecchi that the question here is whether or not we are in a position to control this process of globalisation."
"In my view, we can, and we should ensure that we do so. International procedures must be democratised and socialised."
"They must be controlled, thus promoting the interests of efficiency as well as the interests of justice."
"Greater efficiency will facilitate conflict prevention and better handling of crises."
"It should prevent further financial crises like the one we are currently experiencing, and do away with the north-south divide. We must remember that the gap between the rich and poor countries of the world is actually increasing at the moment."
"You may wonder how all this could be achieved."
"I envisage specific courses of action. First, we must strengthen and develop international law."
"It does exist in theory but is often ignored. Suitable instruments are required if international law is to be properly implemented, beginning with the United Nations."
"I agree with Mr De Melo that despite all the criticism levelled against it, the UN's usefulness cannot be disputed."
"Its inefficiency should not be blamed on the UN itself. It is really due to a lack of political will on the part of its members, to a failure to implement and observe its charter, to the fact that it has not been granted genuine decision-making powers or adequate resources, and to the absence of real democracy."
"The UN should not be done away with."
"It must be reformed, strengthened and developed and the European Union has a major role to play in this respect. European public opinion demands it, because who will take the lead if the European Union fails to do so?"
"Mr President, to my mind this report on the challenges of global governance and the reform of the United Nations deserves support, and I should also like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur."
"As I see it, his aim is to identify a way of changing direction and establishing some kind of balance between the leading players and civil society."
"If global decisions are to have legitimacy, then of course they must be representative."
"Consequently, civil society should also participate in laying the foundations that underpin the decisions taken at global level."
"If one looks at the financial crises that are occurring all over the world, the widening gap between rich and poor and the growing number of environmental problems, there is good reason to take heed."
"It is high time we did so and showed more sympathy towards the establishment of global links between such things as investment and development."
"Before an agreement such as the MAI comes into existence, it should be compared with the evaluations which have been made and the decisions which have been taken, as set out at the major UN conferences."
"One hundred and fifty Nordic organisations have taken the initiative and said that if talks are to continue on an MAI agreement in the WTO, they must take place under the auspices of the UN in order to give them legitimacy."
"I also think that it was appropriate to single out the USA in the report. It is really shameful that this country has not paid its contributions for so long."
"Promoting peace and security is, of course, the UN's most important function."
"I should just like to add that, in my view, NATO should delay its bombing campaign so as to allow the issue to be discussed by the UN Security Council."
"President, speaking on Mr De Melo's excellent report, I commend to you my own amendments from the Development Committee in support of the UN's work in relation to indigenous people, Amendment No 13; the UN High Commission for Refugees, Amendment No 23; and our call to revive the UN Centre for Transnational Corporations, Amendment No 24."
"However, I want to restrict my speaking time specifically to support the proposal for the creation of a UN Economic Security Council."
"Mr Camdessus, Head of the IMF, is on record as saying that the UN is just one of the four pillars of the world system. This view sees the IMF, the World Bank and the WTO handling the serious economic business whilst relegating social affairs alone to the UN."
"No wonder that the World Bank and IMF have evolved in a way contrary to their founding objectives to reduce poverty."
"They have imposed structural adjustment programmes in response to the third world debt crisis of the 1980s, which have actually had the effect of increasing unemployment and eroding social welfare provision for the poor."
"The only answer is to integrate the Bretton Woods agencies effectively in the UN system, to make them more directly accountable to all the nations of the world irrespective of ability to pay, to spread the principle of poverty reduction from the UN's development programme into economic decision-making worldwide."
"Mr President, the United Nations has been, remains and, we all hope, will continue to be the only framework within which disputes are peacefully resolved and peace maintained."
"It has had this role for more than 50 years, since the catastrophe of the Second World War."
"Of course it has had - and still has - weaknesses and shortcomings, and it may have more to come."
"Let us look for the causes."
"There have been powers, in particular the United States and those close to it, and NATO itself, which have undermined its authority, bypassed it, disowned it and taken initiatives that run counter to what the United Nations should have said. We are now moving towards the brink of an explosive situation, with unforeseeable repercussions not just in Yugoslavia and the Balkans."
"Consequently, I would have liked the report by Mr De Melo, which correctly recognises the unique nature of the United Nations, to stress the need for the UN to arm itself against these attempts to undermine its authority and to take initiatives, to put forward ideas and proposals, to strengthen itself further so that it can assume its role."
"As regards the issue of the veto which applies in the Security Council, I too would be in favour of abandoning it, but this would simply be jumping out of the frying-pan into the fire. If this were to happen, the UN would become, in institutional terms, the puppet of the United States, of a bloc of questionable interests which would manipulate the Security Council for its own benefit and to the disadvantage of the people."
"One final point: I am concerned about the role of the International Criminal Court."
"I am afraid that, under the slogans of 'terrorism' or 'crimes against humanity' - and I repeat that these are just slogans - it may be used as a tool to suppress and quell what are clearly national liberation movements."
"Just look at the way the Kurdish movement is being treated, and the fact that it may even end up being punished before international courts!"
"Mr President, in discussing the De Melo report, we need to distinguish between two issues: one is reform of the United Nations, which could be a matter of adapting its ageing structures to changed requirements and to geopolitical transformations on the various continents; the other is Europe's continuing inability to speak with one voice and act with the necessary diplomatic force."
"Here the UN could be the ideal terrain on which to build an EU common foreign policy to consolidate all of our economic successes to date."
"As for the specific reforms required, the UN Security Council needs to be updated along democratic and non-élitist lines; moreover, this subject already appears as item 59 on the agenda of the General Assembly."
"Many countries are hoping for such a reform, so much so that, from its original complement of 30 members, the 'Coffee Group' has grown to 49, and even the Durban summit of the 113 non-aligned countries rejected by a large majority the temptation to abandon recourse to Article 108 of the UN Charter, pursuant to which the vote on the reform principles requires a two-thirds majority of the Member States."
"Reform is of course a lengthy and complex business which cannot be summarised in a minute and a half."
"We now have the single currency; the next step has to be the common foreign policy, and the United Nations could be the basis on which to work towards this important goal."
"Mr President, I too must compliment Mr De Melo and all the other Members who have worked on this report, which is comprehensive and so very much geared to the future."
"It comes at a time when we are all looking to the challenges of globalisation."
"A time too when many people can see the negative aspects but cannot agree on solutions."
"We must ensure that the great potential advantages of globalisation are realised, and that this works to the benefit of all countries."
"Like you, I believe that the solutions have to be found within an improved multilateral forum."
"In this context, a leading role is marked out for the United Nations, but also for the international financial organisations and for the World Trade Organisation."
"Our Member State governments must ensure that the reforms currently under way are indeed continued."
"The many important aspects you mention in your report, such as human rights but also economic, social and security aspects, must be integrated into general policy."
"The numerous international organisations must seek to coordinate their measures and approaches closely."
"We believe that the UN millennium summit scheduled for the autumn of 2000 will provide an excellent opportunity for acknowledging the challenges of world management and defining more precisely the role of the United Nations for the twenty-first century."
"It is also our sincere hope that the enlarging European Union will play an important part in this whole debate and will contribute its experience of problems and opportunities in integrating these various aspects of policy into general policy on a multinational basis."
"But if the Union is to be a credible voice in this debate, as this House has remarked on numerous occasions, it must also have a more powerful, more consistent and more easily recognisable common foreign and security policy."
"The necessary institutional measures must be taken and the necessary instruments put in place."
"We very much hope that this will be done shortly."
"May I add a brief footnote on the institutional provisions at the end of the resolution now before the House, although I appreciate that these are directed mainly at the Member States."
"The EU memorandum is an integral part of the statement which the President of the European Council makes each year to the UN General Assembly."
"It is a very broad summary of recent EU policy and measures and it covers a broad range of issues and geographical areas."
"As such, it is a very useful reference document."
"However, because it covers such a diversity of issues, I do not think it is well suited to serve as the basis for joint action within the meaning of Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Joint actions of this kind can be devised for more precisely defined subjects and should be less descriptive in nature."
"And that was the comment made yesterday at the General Affairs Council when we looked again at joint action by the EU in its relations with Russia, to be approved in Cologne."
"As regards the request that the Commission should report on the Union's position concerning the specific points in your resolution in the context of forthcoming UN assemblies and other relevant gatherings, the Commission will certainly, as usual, continue submitting communications to the Council and Parliament in advance of important international events which require a position of consensus from the Union."
"The Commission will naturally also continue to keep the relevant committees of the European Parliament informed of any significant developments in the foreign and security policy of the European Union."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 3 p.m."
"Guidelines for the draft general budget for 2000"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0109/99 by Mr Bourlanges, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the guidelines for the 2000 budget procedure: Section III - Commission; -A4-0120/99 by Mrs Müller, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the guidelines for the 2000 budget procedure: Section I - European Parliament, Annex: OmbudsmanSection II - CouncilSection IV - Court of JusticeSection V - Court of AuditorsSection VI - Economic and Social Committee and Committee of the Regions and Joint Organisational Structure."
"Mr President, we are just now concluding the three-way discussions with the Commission and Council, or at least what remains of them, and I feel as if I am reporting on a state of limbo, as Cardinal de Bernis would say, given the current situation of extreme uncertainty."
"On the one hand institutional uncertainty is at a peak given that this Parliament is to be dissolved on 13 June."
"From July therefore the budget procedure will continue potentially with a rather different Parliament and speakers who will not necessarily be the same."
"Uncertainty has also been created by the resignation of the Commission which will therefore have to prepare its preliminary draft budget in a state of political weightlessness."
"I must thank Commissioner Liikanen for respecting his obligations."
"As he is here I hope that he will speak, even though he has resigned, because the Commission is still responsible for preparing the preliminary draft budget."
"It is therefore right that he should speak."
"There is also very great uncertainty about the institutional conditions."
"We do not know whether there will be any financial perspectives."
"We do not know whether there will be an agreement on Agenda 2000."
"We do not know whether there will be an agreement between Parliament and the Council on the overall management of the systems."
"In other words, we do not know whether the next budget will be an annual budget based on Article 203 or a budget under the future financial perspectives."
"In this context, it is very difficult to establish satisfactory and precise priorities for Parliament."
"We have stressed two key issues: rigour and the concentration of priorities."
"We want a rigorous budget on several levels and we want a concentrated budget."
"In Category 3, which is of particular interest to us, we are stressing the need to concentrate efforts on decentralised information measures, the reception of refugees and the financing of Eurodac."
"We want the 'greening' of the budget to be extended to new areas."
"We also want the Commission to use this budget to prepare the ground for extending the powers of the European Union in the fields of public health and consumer protection."
"Finally, with regard to the research programme, we want a balance to be achieved between the system's funding requirements, the need to keep within the overall budgets agreed and the provision of sufficient margins in the area of internal policies. The Fifth Framework Programme for Research must not dominate all the other spending under Category 3."
"In Category 4, we are happy to concentrate aid on the poorest countries, as requested by the committee responsible."
"This is our aim in terms of priorities."
"However, yet again everything needs to be clarified."
"The crux of our message is the rigour which we want to apply."
"We consider that considerable efforts need to be made with regard to management."
"Firstly, in Category 1, the management of the agricultural appropriations needs to be more rigorous, without ignoring the principle of adequate funding."
"In Category 2, it must be possible, by reforming the nomenclature of certain funds, for expenditure to be managed not according to the distribution of administrative services, but according to the objectives of the Structural Funds. We therefore call for the nomenclature to be reformed accordingly."
"Above all, effort is required in Category 5."
"There is a problem of management here."
"We want to see the gradual dismantling of the Technical Assistance Offices."
"We also want the staff requirements for the work involved to be reassessed."
"In particular, before 30 June, we want the Commission to come clean and clearly indicate how many staff it needs to perform its tasks."
"We must have a clear answer here in order to identify the Commission's precise requirements so that the budgetary authority can decide and weigh up, in full possession of the facts, the tasks to be completed and the resources to be provided."
"This is the message of rigour and clarification that we want to press home."
"Applause"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the attention that has been devoted to the European institutions over the past few weeks perhaps adequately reflects for the first time the political importance now attached to the decisions taken by the EU institutions."
"This implies tasks that go far beyond simply seeing new faces take over."
"The people - as also the staff of the institutions - now rightly expect us to undertake structural reforms, and in saying 'us' I am specifically including the Council and the European Parliament."
"Today the people expect a modern administrative management that makes the public administration as effective as that of the private sector."
"The Five Wise Men's Report focuses on the concept of responsibility."
"I too believe this is the key to the need for reform."
"In future we need first and foremost a clearer attributability of success and responsibility, not just at Commissioner level but indeed also at official level, not just in the Commission but also in the European Parliament."
"That is why I, together with my colleague Jean-Louis Bourlanges, suggested looking at experiences gained in the individual Member States or regions in relation to budgeting, or what is called activity-based budgeting, and supporting the Commission in its efforts to that same end."
"I am sure that this is also in the interests of colleagues in this House and all the other institutions."
"Decentralised and transparent responsibilities produce a stronger motivation, as shown by a variety of experience in the Member States and regions."
"The attention currently being paid to our institution in relation to its carrying out its control function reflects another responsibility we have to live up to."
"We all know that we still have quite a lot of homework to do."
"For instance, if Parliament's budget estimates for the year 2000 provide for a sum of EUR 3.8 million just for setting up a supermarket, that means that here too, as I and the Committee on Budgets are suggesting, we must carry out our control function."
"Facilities that are not connected with the institutions' activities should not be financed with subsidies from Parliament's budget but should be self-financing."
"Prior to the budget deliberations I had asked the administration to calculate the possible budgetary costs of the European Statute for Members that is still pending before the Council."
"This gave figures of EUR 60 million in compulsory expenditure and EUR 45 million in non-compulsory expenditure."
"By budgeting for these resources, we should show the Council in the year 2000 that we are serious about the statute; and if I rightly understood Mr Verheugen yesterday, the German Presidency is endeavouring to have this statute adopted before the end of the presidency."
"Let me turn now to another sensitive subject, namely the voluntary pension fund for Members of this Parliament."
"This is a quasi-private fund and its management decisions, such as fixing the contributions and the benefits, are taken by the Bureau."
"In the past, incidentally, that also contributed to the familiar deficit."
"Irrespective of my critical attitude to the fund as such, of which you are aware, I would urgently request that you all join the all-group reform alliance and at least allow for the institutional separation of Parliament and the voluntary pension fund, as set out in Amendment No 6."
"For the rest, colleagues on the board of the fund take the same view."
"Incidentally, on the question of Members' declarations of interests, we should also go on the offensive, or to be more precise, on the Internet."
"The Commission collectively accepted responsibility for its omissions because Parliament assumed its control function."
"In two months' time the voters will be assuming their control function over us."
"So let us do all we can with a view to the 2000 budget to signal that we are building up a modern, efficient, transparent administration in the institutions!"
"Applause"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in his very good introduction our general rapporteur on the 2000 budget, my friend Jean-Louis Bourlanges, drew attention to the institutional problems, especially in the area that particularly interests me as rapporteur for the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy."
"To put it quite simply, we want to see adherence to the results of the legislative process for the fifth framework programme of research and the full assertion of Parliament's rights."
"We fought for that during the conciliation procedure."
"The negotiations were tough."
"It was a question of what is known as the guillotine clause, which concerns the effects of the financial perspective on the overall financial framework of the fifth framework programme of research."
"Here we managed to assert Parliament's rights in full, and of course we will also insist during the coming budgetary deliberations that Parliament is fully involved."
"In the field of energy, we are yet again seeking to ensure that the responsibility the European Union has assumed in regard, for instance, to reducing greenhouse gases, is also covered in budgetary terms."
"Declarations are one thing, their political implementation, their reflection in budget headings, are another, and that is what we must do."
"By adopting a framework energy programme we have created the necessary legal conditions, and of course what we want is for this to be adequately reflected in the budget."
"Those, in a few words, are the wishes of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy for the 2000 budget and I hope Members will find their way to supporting them during the further procedure."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Bourlanges has included in his motion for a resolution a number of important principles, in particular the principle that the 2000 budget must safeguard a policy of sustained development and cooperation."
"This is actually the very essence of the European Union's identity which has solidarity as its central theme, and it will also help to put the European Union in a stronger position in the world."
"The Committee on Development and Cooperation unanimously wishes to point out to the Commission that the prospects of enlargement and the Structural Fund and CAP reforms must on no account be allowed to result in the European Union abandoning or disengaging itself from this field."
"The priority given by the Commission to countries geographically close to the Union must not lead to a reduction in appropriations for the ACP countries."
"The Development Committee regards the reduction of poverty as a priority, which is why a larger proportion of spending under Category 4 needs to be allocated to the poorest countries."
"The aim here is an ambitious one as it involves halving the number of people living in extreme poverty by 2015."
"In this respect, we would urge the Member States to comply in full with the United Nations' recommendations to increase their development policy contributions to at least 0.7 % of their GNP."
"We therefore reaffirm our desire to see the EDF incorporated into the budget and to see unused appropriations reallocated to low-income countries, for example through the PHARE, TACIS or MEDA programmes."
"We want to see adequate humanitarian aid and we will also continue to fight for certain thematic lines such as the environment, tropical forests, equal opportunities, anti-personnel mines, and so on."
"With regard to regeneration and reconstruction, the lack of coherence and the scattering of resources caused by allocating appropriations by geographical region should prompt us to reorganise the budget lines."
"Finally, we fully support the work of the NGOs and hope that line B7-6000 will be given adequate payment appropriations."
"We will seek to ensure that the small NGOs are not penalised in relation to the large NGOs in any new arrangements which the Commission might make."
"Finally, I wholeheartedly endorse the comments made by the rapporteur on Category 5 regarding the staff shortages in the Commission in particular."
"I must emphasise that the problem is particularly crucial with regard to DG VIII and ECHO."
"Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of our Group on both reports."
"First of all, can I turn to Mrs Müller's report and thank her for the work that she has done."
"We do not always vote for her text or her amendments; but she knows that like most groups in the Budgets Committee, we are aiming for the same objectives."
"We just have different ways of getting there."
"Can I say that the rapporteur's sentiments and the sentiments of the committee are summed up in the first paragraph of her report, paragraph 1, where she calls on the institutions and committees - and I stress the words 'institutions' and 'committees' not 'organs' as Mrs Müller's amendment seeks - to produce a strategy to enhance efficiency by improving transparency, motivation, mobility and further training."
"That is what we are looking for from guidelines."
"Some of the other comments were not necessary, and that is why we voted against quite a few paragraphs within this report."
"I have to be critical of the fact that Mrs Müller as rapporteur has tabled eight amendments."
"This is not a prerogative of the rapporteur who is the servant of the committee."
"She should be presenting the committee's report to Parliament and not tabling amendments in the name of her group."
"All the amendments she has tabled fall into two categories."
"There are those which have already been defeated in the Budgets Committee which, of course, we will vote against because we voted against them before and there are some entirely new ones."
"The fact that we have had no debate on these new ones, once again means that we will vote against them in the plenary."
"I would hate to think that these amendments were being tabled just as a political ploy or for a press release, because they call for the citizens of the Quartier Leopold to be able to use the facilities within the Parliament such as the shops."
"Now, I would hate to think that we were going to be criticised for not supporting the people who live around here."
"Apart from that, they are not guidelines and should not be in this report."
"I turn to Mr Bourlanges' report and thank him for the work that he has done."
"It is not the text we would have written but we will be voting for it, as he knows."
"Paragraph 2, as he said in his speech, sets out Parliament's priorities, especially in relation to job creation."
"That has to be at the forefront of all our minds."
"But there is also a reference to the 'BATs'. This is an issue which will not go away and which will be at the forefront of everyone's conversations and strategy for the 2000 Budget and beyond."
"But, of course, if we achieve what we are seeking with the elimination of the 'BATs' where the Commission can do the work, then Council and ourselves have to recognise the possible consequences of such a move."
"That brings us on to Category 5."
"If Category 5 does not grow by 1.5 %, then 4, 000 jobs will be lost between the Year 2000 and 2006."
"We still have the problem of 850 unfilled vacancies within the Commission."
"That is why the Interinstitutional Agreement is so important and the work of Mr Colom I Naval and the other people on the trialogue which met this morning."
"It is so important that we get an agreement."
"We vote on this report before Berlin, and we assume that there will be agreement in the Council on Agenda 2000 and between the Council and Parliament on the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"If not, then the Recital C and paragraph 1 of the Bourlanges' report will certainly have to be taken note of."
"It is not unlike the situation in 1994, I have to say, or for the 1994 Budget, where we went right through to December before we knew what the final situation would be."
"Let us hope that we can get this concluded well before December."
"Mr President, Terence Wynn has made a few points of criticism about my position and my actions."
"So I would like to put him right."
"Firstly, all the amendments I am tabling are amendments that were considered in committee."
"The new one on public access to a supermarket was not tabled in my name; it was tabled by a member of my group."
"Secondly, the press conference I held was given together with Jean-Louis Bourlanges in order to present the report and in the Committee on Budgets we decided the precise amount relating to the supermarket by a majority. That means I only told the press something that formed the basis of the outcome of the vote in the Committee on Budgets."
"That was not a point of order, Mrs Müller."
"Mr. President, our rapporteurs have always given us excellent introductions from the Committee on Budgets."
"Mr Bourlanges has rightly underlined the uncertainty which we face in this budgetary procedure."
"I must admit, having been on the Budgets Committee since 1984, that we have become used to uncertainty in our budgetary matters We reject budgets; we go on to twelfths; we have a whole range of negotiations with the Council, but actually somehow through all this period we managed to keep the show on the rails."
"I am certain our rapporteur will do that in these difficult circumstances, particularly as we have never had to be guided without having a European Commission in place."
"I welcome the fact that the Commission, although not in office, has taken the trouble to be with us and will no doubt be speaking in this debate."
"I have two comments in speaking on behalf of my Group for the European Parliament Budget and then for the Commission Budget."
"I would like to say to Mr Wynn that we will be supporting most of the amendments that Mrs Müller has put on the Agenda."
"These have been discussed in committee. We felt that they were reasonable and therefore they deserve our support."
"In particular, I regret that the Council is not here today because I would have liked to find out from them the chances of having the statute for Members and for assistants which are mentioned in the report and on which we need decisions by the European Council as soon as possible."
"Turning to the budget of the Commission, it is clear that we have once again a rigorous budget in front of us."
"The Commission, the Council and ourselves have had rigorous budgets for the last few years."
"This will be no exception."
"Indeed, the priorities too will be fairly similar to those which have been put in the draft budget of the Commission."
"The real issue of this 2000 Budget though will be on the administrative expenditure and the follow-up to the Wise Men's Report."
"What are the resources which will be needed?"
"What are the real needs?"
"What are the programmes that the Commission is going to be running?"
"This is a debate we will no doubt have later in the year, but at this stage I would like to conclude that so far as our Group is concerned, we will be looking at this particular aspect of the budget in a much more critical way than any other."
"Mr Chairman we live in the age between the ages as Reinhold Niebuhr said, and other colleagues have made that point very clearly."
"It is very welcome that two experienced colleagues like Mr Bourlanges and Mrs Müller will be guiding this Parliament and the next Parliament through the difficult period of the Budget."
"I have two specific comments."
"First of all, the coming period will be less concentrated on new monies as was the case in the past and more on the management of existing money."
"It is, therefore, very important in this period of uncertainty that the Parliament itself indicates that it is fully aware of its central responsibility on this point."
"Over the last five years we in Parliament have made enormous progress in the quality of implementation and the involvement of other committees than the Budget Committee."
"The other committees' involvement is essential for the future if we are going to meet our responsibilities."
"A better institutional balance is, of course, absolutely essential."
"It is perhaps again ironic that today, the day before Agenda 2000 is being discussed and also the whole financial structure, the Council is absent. We must continue, and I hope that the new Parliament will pursue this point."
"Essentially, we need an interinstitutional agreement but not at any price."
"Therefore, the open situation which Mr Bourlanges indicated - that perhaps we may have a budget according to Article 203 - needs to be underlined."
"As far as Mrs Müller's report is concerned, the essential point is the activity-based budgeting, as she indicated."
"I welcome that Commissioner Liikanen underlined that earlier."
"We must highlight the contradiction in the Council today."
"On the one hand the Council wants cuts and, as Mr Wynn has said, this may lead to enormous cuts in personnel."
"On the other hand, we see from the Committee of Wise Men, the essential contradiction that if we leave things to BATs we will have problems of management."
"That contradiction will be focussed on by the Parliament throughout the coming period."
"I hope and trust that Mrs Müller will be a good guide for this process."
"Mr Chairman, since it is probably my last budgetary debate here I would like to say how much I hope that the new Parliament will continue to make progress under the good guidance of our two colleagues who have been appointed for the Year 2000."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the 2000 budget procedure begins, I have to say that I am deeply concerned about the total uncertainty that surrounds the current situation."
"We still do not know whether the Interinstitutional Agreement will be renewed and whether new financial perspectives will be established for the 2000-2006 period."
"What is more, as has just been made clear, the rapporteur himself does not know the answers to these questions."
"To paraphrase Sacha Guitry, I would say that the Council is hesitating, the Commission is dead and the rapporteur does not seem particularly courageous."
"What causes me particular concern is the more or less stated aim of the majority of the Council delegations whose primary and perhaps only concern is to pay as little as possible to Europe. This means a budget of zero growth or financial stagnation in Europe."
"In the absence of an agreement on the new financial perspectives, it is clear, as the excellent Mr Bourlanges has described in detail, that the financial framework for the 2000 budget must be established by adjusting the ceilings for the various headings, pursuant to Article 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 29 October 1993."
"This means that the budgetary authority must comply with the amounts already earmarked for the pilot schemes and preparatory actions."
"In other words, the 2000 budget must be another austerity budget, maintaining budgetary discipline while at the same time guaranteeing that the necessary resources will be available to implement the European Union's policies, as pointed out by the rapporteur, in accordance with Article F(3) of the EU Treaty."
"Therefore, whatever the current difficulties, it is right and even advisable that the joint budgetary authority should prepare a responsible, rigorous and effective budget for the year 2000 in line with the EU's political commitments and according to the spirit and letter of the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"Unfortunately I do not believe that the Council understands this, and if we enthusiastically approve the guidelines defined by Mr Bourlanges, we are just as vigorously denouncing the lack of political responsibility and Community solidarity shown to date by certain Council delegations."
"I was particularly shocked by the content of 'La Tribune ', published yesterday in Le Figaro and written by Ms Hewitt, a British junior minister, which was quite simply a call for the CAP to be dismantled through renationalisation."
"Although at this stage the Council's priorities for the 2000 budget have not been identified - these particularly depend on the results of the Agenda 2000 negotiations - it seems clear that the aim of most of the delegations is to ensure that Community expenditure does not develop more than national expenditure."
"We seem to suffer permanently from the Fontainebleau syndrome."
"This concept is clearly out of step with the EU's development plans, and we would be entering a very difficult procedure with an uncertain outcome if we tried to prevent an abstinence budget being imposed which ignored the objective requirements of the EU's policies and was entirely subject to the electoral whims of the finance ministers."
"We are realistic and we accept rigour but, unlike the Council, we want to see progress combined with respect for rigour and for the political commitments made by the Heads of State and Government and also for the agreements to which the Council itself has signed up."
"To forget all that would be to forget Europe itself."
"Finally, with regard to Mrs Müller's excellent report which is less affected by uncertainty, our group will support this as amended in committee."
"Since I cannot split myself in two, I now have to give my position on Jean-Louis Bourlanges's report."
"The strategic approach to restructuring this budget must focus on internal and foreign policies because they account for a large share of compulsory expenditure and multiannual programmes."
"So I very much welcome our joint call for an increase in the share of development policies in the Community budget."
"But we must bear in mind that the development impact of each euro must be enhanced with a view to sustainability, and here I mean both ecological and economic sustainability."
"More emphasis must now be laid on good governance as a condition for granting any aid that goes beyond emergency aid."
"We must look more closely at the macro-economic impact of our food aid and put the interests of the agricultural budget in second place."
"I would remind you of our debate on aid for Russia."
"And as the World Bank notes in its report on 'Assessing Aid', development aid should where possible be multilateral, which means it should also be shifted from the Member States to the Union."
"But if we are to remain credible, we should also say where we are prepared to economise, which in my view should primarily be in relation to the disputed KEDO project."
"But we must also radically rethink the export promotion programmes, not just with a view to creating European added value but also against the backdrop of the question of whether this should be an object of common European action in the first place."
"How willing are we in fact to be serious about what we have been demanding for days, namely concentration on the essentials?"
"I very much hope that with the dialogue on Jean-Louis Bourlanges's report and priorities we will be able to take a major step forward in regard to development policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is taking place in a very difficult context, which is at the forefront of all our minds."
"From this point of view I wish to compliment the Commissioner, Mr Liikanen, on both his presence and his work."
"He has cooperated very constructively with the Committee on Budgets in the past few years, even though we as a Parliament must examine our collective conscience - something we have not done sufficiently, judging by what has happened in recent weeks."
"In this sense, the Bourlanges report gives the thumbs down to one of the guiding principles of this House, the Budgets Committee and our whole mind-set in recent years: the belief that the number of measures and activities could continue to rise, while promising public opinion zero growth, and that everything could be constantly improved on the basis of the same statutory internal and personnel resources."
"For the first time now, these guidelines do not stress that principle which, in my opinion, was one of the causes - perhaps the main one - of so many negative developments. I therefore welcome a new approach which ought to guide us in future years and which the Council President, Mr Fischer, stressed very responsibly yesterday."
"Finally, I would just say one word on the Müller report: in the committee we adopted a well-balanced and coherent report."
"This is the line which our group will pursue, by supporting the report as it emerged from the committee."
"On the Bourlanges report, Mr President, one of the biggest problems as regards the year 2000 budgetary procedure is the enormous scale of monies still unspent."
"To tackle this as quickly as possible, the rapporteur is suggesting that 50 % of the payment appropriations should be included in the budget for 2000."
"If we add the expected 'fresh funds', this will give us a budget of EUR 95 billion."
"Leaving aside the question of whether the Council is likely to welcome so big a budget, I do not think this is the answer."
"How is it, I would ask the rapporteur, that payments can fall so far short of commitments?"
"You mention the restrictive budgetary policy in recent years. But is that the real reason?"
"In recent years, the budgetary authority has saddled the Commission with a mountain of commitments."
"Is it not rather the case that the Commission's services are unable to manage it all?"
"Given the findings of the Committee of Wise Men, I fear that it may be."
"So a forced increase in payment appropriations for the year 2000 is not the right way."
"It is asking for trouble."
"The solution should instead be sought through sensible self-restraint."
"The commitment appropriations must be matched to the Commission's capacity for implementing them."
"Europe must confine itself to policy areas where acting together as a Union is beneficial."
"Programmes which cannot be managed efficiently must be scrapped, and quickly."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, either the 2000 budget is the first budget under a new financial perspective or it is based on Article 203 of the Treaty on European Union."
"We will find out in the course of tomorrow and the day after."
"We had a trilogue this morning and discussed the question of the minimum requirements for the trend of categories 3, 4, 5 and 7 that we will set as the condition for a possible interinstitutional agreement."
"In that respect, we must always view what Mr Bourlanges has just said against the background of the 'both-and-also' or 'either/or' alternative."
"If we chose the 'either/or' alternative and did not have an institutional agreement, then as we made quite clear in the trilogue this morning, in economic terms we would have more money available than we would if we did conclude an interinstitutional agreement."
"The situation is quite clear: only if the national budgets constantly showed a deficit of 0.9 % and growth remained below 1.5 %, only then would we have a situation where the expenditure arising from half the ceiling rate was lower than the expenditure under a financial perspective yet to be agreed."
"I am addressing these words more to the Council, which is not here, than to Members, for the Council should know exactly what the financial resources in categories 3, 4 and 5 will look like when it decides the question tomorrow and the day after."
"There is another point I want to make in this connection."
"I believe Mrs Müller has already raised it."
"Should what the Council is currently discussing in relation to staff costs and administrative costs become the basis of the budget for 2000 and the following years, the freezing of the budget would mean that the European Union would have to lose 3 880 posts in all."
"These would be distributed between Parliament - a loss of 420 posts, the Commission - a loss of 3 000 posts, the Court of Justice - a loss of 182 posts, the Court of Auditors - a loss of 58 posts, and the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee - a loss of another 220 posts."
"Just to make it clear: if you talk about freezing the administrative budget, that will cost 3 880 posts."
"So we cannot on the one hand say that we want steady growth in these programmes and on the other hand say that we will freeze or even reduce administrative costs."
"Lest there be any misunderstanding, I do not mean that we should say that we want to increase the costs and employ more staff; instead, I am saying that freezing money would mean losing jobs rather than creating additional ones."
"For this reason Parliament will be called upon to create the corresponding appropriations in this area also."
"I also want to say something about the backlog."
"The backlog this year is partly because in connection with Community expenditure the public is concentrating increasingly on payments and less on commitments."
"But our budget is split into two components, namely the commitments we enter into and the payments which are then graded accordingly."
"The reason these resources were not paid out does not lie with the Commission, as the previous speaker said; it is a problem connected with the Member States or the non-Member States, namely the Central and Eastern European countries, for it is they that correct or regulate the flow of resources into the Structural Funds, into research policy or foreign policy programmes through their activities."
"Whether intentional or not, a backlog has occurred here accounting for more than 40 billion."
"We cannot reduce that simply by saying we will dump it onto the budget, for then - and you are quite right here - we would find ourselves in the situation of having growth rates for the 2000 budget that were beyond good and evil but had nothing to do with the actual trend of expenditure but only with the burdens of the past that we are dragging along behind us and that we now have to slough off."
"That is why we are in favour of Mr Bourlanges's proposal to divide this into two parts rather than having it in a single budget, in order to distinguish between growth and the burden of the past that we have to deal with."
"Mr President, it is clear that today's debate is taking place during a very critical period for the European Union."
"In two days' time, we shall have the debate and the decisions of the European Council on Agenda 2000 and the financial perspective."
"I hope these decisions will be taken, because as you know, there has been indecision for quite some time now."
"Personally, I am one of those who believe that policy cannot be made without money, but such a view has now sunk to the status of heresy in the European Union."
"Be that as it may, speaking as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Policy on the budget for 2000, I would like to recall the three basic points made by the committee in respect of the new budget."
"Firstly, we draw attention to the need to guarantee sufficient payment appropriations, so as to avoid liquidity problems for the programmes being carried out under the Structural Funds, and this should be done in relation to Agenda 2000 and the new structural programmes."
"Secondly, we are asking for outstanding commitment appropriations under Category 2 for 1998 to be incorporated into the 2000 budget, so as to comply with the Edinburgh agreements."
"Thirdly, the committee calls on the Commission to show some degree of flexibility when extending the programmes being carried out under the Structural Funds, where this is justified, which will allow the Delors 2 package to be implemented effectively and in full."
"In the motion for a resolution, there are two paragraphs concerning Category 2, paragraphs 12 and 13, which are extremely important and which raise crucial technical issues."
"However, we in the Committee on Regional Policy believe that the motion lacks the proper political direction and the necessary political vision that we wish to see for the Structural Funds in 2000."
"Mr President, the two rapporteurs have produced reports on the guidelines for next year's budget, both of which form a good basis for further discussion."
"I would sincerely like to thank Mrs Müller and Mr Bourlanges accordingly."
"I would like to focus on just two questions."
"The EU Staff Regulations must be revised and the responsibilities of officials clarified."
"The observations which the Committee of Independent Experts, the so-called Committee of Wise Men, made regarding personal lack of responsibility must be taken seriously, and there must be an end to all this hiding behind one another's backs amongst the authorities in the EU."
"The increase in the number of staff employed must be strictly controlled, and this is a point on which I disagree with the Committee of Wise Men."
"We can achieve much more with staffing levels as they are at present, as long as the Staff Regulations are flexible about the sensible use of resources."
"Along with the review of the Staff Regulations we should also clarify how financial administration is monitored."
"Administrative responsibility for the justification and approval of expenditure must be delegated."
"We have to emphasise the importance of the responsibility for how revenue is used."
"Only in this way can the importance of personal responsibility be underlined and payment settlements be speeded up."
"As it is, I support strict budget policy, which is in line with government budget policy in the Member States."
"Mr President, I must first thank Mr Bourlanges for his work on the guidelines for the budget for 2000."
"Parliament generally gives its approval at this time of the year and makes a start on the annual budgetary procedure."
"I am sure the House agrees that on this occasion the guidelines are being produced against a background of almost complete uncertainty. Indeed, if the debate could be postponed until Friday we might be in a better position to make specific decisions."
"Nevertheless, the guidelines are not usually concerned primarily with figures but rather with setting the priorities of the House with regard to the budget."
"I should now like to focus on two specific aspects of the guidelines for the budget for 2000."
"To start with, I must draw attention to a matter of grave concern which Mr Samland, the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, has already mentioned, but which is worth highlighting again."
"It is nothing new, as it was discussed previously in connection with the budget for 1999, and it involves the relationship between commitments and payment appropriations. This is specifically mentioned in the Interinstitutional Agreement, which refers to an equitable balance between commitments and payment appropriations."
"Nevertheless, in recent financial years, as Mr Samland also pointed out, payment appropriations have not been increased in line with commitments in order to ensure that the budget has been strictly controlled, although this has not been the case."
"We are now faced with what has become known as 'the burden of the future', that is, the burden acquired during the current year plus, in some cases, a backlog of credit to be cleared. By the end of 1999, this could amount to more than 200 % of the commitments undertaken."
"Nevertheless, I wish to make it quite clear to the Member States that the time for making false economies is over. This considerable backlog must be at the forefront of our minds as we prepare the budget for 2000."
"Secondly, I am sure the House agrees that the budget must be rigorous, Mr Bourlanges."
"However, I do not agree that rigour is an end in itself, and I never will."
"Rather, rigour must be a response to sound and efficient administration, whilst also guaranteeing the resources required to implement the Union's policies, as stated in the Treaty."
"Allow me to repeat what I said earlier: the average European expects the Union to find a way of meeting our expectations."
"Through the Member States, the people of Europe have transferred certain competences to the Union. They have even surrendered some of their sovereignty to ensure that the Union is in a better position to respond to their needs."
"My own view is that the Union's budget is on quite a different level from that of the Member States."
"It complements a Member State's budget, but should not be compared to it."
"This certainly does not mean that the European Parliament will fail to act and cooperate responsibly during the financial year in order to smooth the path of the euro for the Member States. What it must mean, however, is that the Union's policies respond to the wishes of the people of Europe."
"Mr President, before the Commissioner speaks I must quickly clarify two or three points."
"Firstly, I totally agree with Mrs Dührkop Dührkop that rigour does not mean austerity."
"Rigour indicates a desire to match resources to objectives."
"This is not actually the main priority, but when it comes to priorities we should not forget that we are currently discussing a budget in which one third of the legal bases are uncertain."
"Secondly, as I did not have time to say this earlier, I too must quickly emphasise the importance of the payment arrears problem."
"Several speakers have mentioned this, including the chairman of the Committee on Budgets."
"I must also stress the desire of this House to see this issue resolved, but not to the detriment of future commitments and real payments corresponding to real commitments."
"My third observation concerns the technical assistance offices, the TAOs."
"I only had time to say that we favoured their gradual dismantling, but I must clarify that this does not mean their total dismantling."
"We realise that certain TAOs are necessary because they carry out temporary or technical work."
"What we do not want are the TAOs which only serve to make up for the Commission's staff shortages."
"We therefore want many of the TAOs to be dismantled but not all of them, just those which are not operating correctly."
"Thank you, Mr President, for allowing me to clarify these three points."
"Mr President, when the Commission resigned it decided to continue to carry out its essential legal functions and obligations."
"The budget is a legal obligation for the Commission."
"If no Commission is nominated within a certain period then this Commission must present a budget to Parliament."
"On that basis, I shall make a few comments on what the rapporteur and some other speakers have said."
"Firstly, the Commission is very happy about the rapporteur's idea of bringing the other parliamentary committees closer to the budgetary procedure."
"It is very important to increase control of the quality and the sectors in the budget."
"So, it is good that the committees responsible for a certain area have direct discussions with the Budgets Committee."
"Secondly, the Commission is also happy that Parliament has confirmed its commitment to the procedure of the amending letter on agriculture between institutions."
"This has been one of the major innovations during this parliamentary period and it is important that it continues in the future."
"Thirdly, the Commission agrees with the preoccupation of the rapporteur as far as the famous RAL, reste à liquider , the backlog, is concerned."
"It is very important that it will be directly presented in next year's budget."
"It will show what comes out of that budget, what payments have not been made and which are due to commitments in the past."
"We will follow in our budgetary presentation the wish of the rapporteur."
"Fourthly, on BATs, I was going to say much the same as Mr Bourlanges."
"We should not simply say that all technical offices are out."
"That would easily lead to a situation that very temporary technical tasks had to be done by the permanent European administration."
"That could be very expensive and very impractical."
"It is, of course, very clear that the whole review of the budget question, which was started last year when the first decisions of the Commission were taken and where the preparation for the vademecum for BATs continues, is of major importance."
"I hope this vademecum can be presented to Parliament by the new Commission as one of its first acts."
"We are making the technical preparations."
"As to the resources, the broad exercise which the Commission is embarking on should be coming to an end by the spring."
"It is continuing in the services and I hope that in the context of the budgetary procedure we can give more information about its results."
"On activity-based budgeting, I must say that the profound reform of the budgetary procedure so that we can always treat the operational and administrative requirement at the same time is activity-based budgeting. This idea was launched by the Commission this year and the Commission decision was taken on the basis that the budget for 2001 will be based on activity-based budgeting."
"It will mean transparency."
"It will mean a procedure for operations so that all the requirements are attainable."
"Finally, as you all know, the Berlin summit is starting tomorrow."
"There are big questions to be decided but I will only comment on one of these, which we have already mentioned a few times."
"It is the question of administrative expenditure."
"The Commission proposal aimed at stabilisation of the staff at the levels of one year ago."
"The Council majority position has been the stabilisation of administrative expenditure which would lead to a reduction of 4 000 civil servants in all institutions with 3 000 in the Commission."
"We cannot accept this."
"The Commission has presented proposals for a reasonable reinforcement of the staff in the financial perspectives."
"Every 1 000 officials will cost EUR 100m in the financial perspectives."
"We heard yesterday that the presidency was more open than previously to this idea but it is very important that the Commission and Parliament work together to get such an interinstitutional agreement that reasonable but strictly controlled staff increases can be guaranteed for the forthcoming period."
"Mr President, I just want to thank Mr Liikanen for his words and for the excellent cooperation we have always had with him."
"In my opinion he is a really first-rate Commissioner with whom it has always been a pleasure to work in an atmosphere of warmth and great personal trust."
"I felt this should be said."
"Thank you, Mr Bourlanges."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 3 p.m."
"Police cooperation"
"The next item is the report (A4-0110/99) by Sir Jack Stewart-Clark, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on the draft joint actions:"
"I.on police cooperation on the verge of the adoption of standards for joint operations (14061/98 - C4-0047/99-99/0908(CNS)); II.with regard to combating international crime with fuller cover of the routes used (14060/98 - C4-0048/99-99/0907(CNS))."
"Mr President, firstly let me say that I am disappointed that I do not see the Council here but I am extremely glad to see Mrs Gradin."
"The first of these drafts - headed No 130 - looks to the creation of a committee of senior police officers at a senior level within the framework of Article K3 of the Treaty of European Union."
"While such a committee is undoubtedly necessary, since there has been virtually no forum until now where such persons can meet, it does not really achieve the objective of real cooperation in the field of law enforcement at operational level."
"Consequently, my main amendments to this draft wish to see the creation of a multi-disciplinary group which comprises heads of police, customs and other law enforcement agencies, for example top civil servants in interior ministries."
"Secondly, we think it is important that Europol should be given a more specific role."
"The text implies a half-hearted involvement of this body."
"Consequently, my amendments beef up the role of Europol by calling for its involvement in discussions, planning and implementation measures."
"Thirdly, after consultation with, amongst others, the German presidency and the British Home Office, I have been more specific about some of the tasks which this new committee should carry out."
"These include establishing mixed inspection operations at the external borders and the setting up of an effective information exchange and early warning system."
"The second of these two drafts - No 129 - wishes to see the deployment of large numbers of police on recognised routes."
"In this case we have included the vital element of intelligence and changed the text to read 'if necessary the deployment of large numbers'."
"Here I just want to say that it really is important that we make use of intelligence resources and not simply put larger numbers of police and customs on the biggest routes."
"Large criminal organisations are sufficiently intelligent themselves to know where the police have their resources."
"Therefore, we have to counter that by improving our own intelligence resources."
"Secondly, we do not like the words 'to ensure maximum possible police success, especially in the form of arrests'."
"We have substituted the words 'tracking down criminals and their organisations and bringing them to justice'."
"Police and customs success should not be measured just by arrests but by success in bringing criminal organisations to justice."
"It is my hope that the Council, the Commission and ourselves will be able to get together to make certain that these modifications take place in what are two thoroughly worthwhile initiatives which this Parliament has been able to improve upon."
"Mr President, the proposals before the House on closer police cooperation in Europe are good ones."
"That applies, firstly, to the idea that when the Council group on police cooperation meets, those who actually do the work must also be involved, namely the police officers."
"Secondly, I agree with the proposal that the police should carry out operations on recognised routes."
"This approach has already been tested successfully in the cooperation between the Schengen states."
"It works."
"The experience that has been collected - I have spoken to a police officer who is organising something of the kind - justifies introducing this as an instrument of police cooperation in the European Union."
"Sir Jack has tabled amendments that we welcome."
"We also do so because we know these proposals are based on talks with experts."
"In particular, we endorse all his proposals concerning the joint action on police cooperation and agree with him that it should cover not just the police but also those working in customs and other relevant authorities."
"Mr President, we have a problem with the German translation."
"The phrase 'law enforcement agency', whose meaning is clear in English, has been translated into German as 'Vollstreckungsteam ' and 'Vollstreckungseinrichtung '."
"They mean something quite different in German. In German, Vollstreckung relates to the execution of death sentences or orders to pay."
"It means something quite different."
"So we have tabled an amendment to rectify this."
"I fear we have a similar problem with Sir Jack's proposal about operations on routes."
"The English phrase is 'the best and most sophisticated intelligence'."
"All I can say is that he is right."
"This was translated into German as 'die besten nachrichtendienstlichen Instrumente '."
"In German that means including the secret services."
"There are Member States, including mine, in which the secret service is strictly separate from the police."
"So we emphasise that the English version is the authoritative one."
"Then we can endorse the proposals."
"I offer the remaining seconds of my speaking time to any one of the speakers to follow!"
"Mr President, Sir Jack Stewart-Clark's report is short, to the point and effective."
"If only the authorities entrusted with enforcing the law in a spirit of liberty, security and justice could be as swift, direct and effective in fighting both organised and spontaneous crime, which unfortunately are constantly on the increase."
"Nevertheless, cooperation between the police and customs authorities has become a key factor in the success of this fight."
"We therefore support the rapporteur's recommendation that a European-level multi-disciplinary group should be set up, with the power to make decisions on improving exchanges of information and on harmonising technical communications systems between the various national authorities."
"We need to ensure that investigations at the external borders of the EU are effective and to investigate the main routes used for illegal activities."
"It is therefore essential to beef up Europol's role, and that is the aim of the amendments we have proposed."
"Although Europol has only really existed since October last year, following the protracted process of ratifying the 1995 Europol Convention, the Treaty of Amsterdam gives it a specific role."
"It is not a European police force, but an instrument which the police authorities of the Member States must not fail to exploit to the full."
"This process of police cooperation has proved its worth through the intergovernmental Schengen agreement, which has acted as a genuine test-bed."
"This success obviously owes a great deal to the possibility of deploying large numbers of police officers when necessary, as recommended in the Enfopol no 129 draft, but as the rapporteur has quite rightly said, the success of these cooperative actions on crime should be measured in qualitative terms and not just by the number of arrests made."
"Mr President, in bullfighting there is something we call the ' espontâneo' , when someone from outside spontaneously jumps into the bullring to join in."
"I could not resist the temptation to jump in myself and give my opinion on Sir Jack Stewart-Clark's report, as what shines through this report is the special attitude of someone who wants not just a police force, but a top-rate force."
"In fact, the class of crime itself has risen over the years."
"Crimes are no longer committed by men with gold teeth or with only one hand."
"They are committed by the sort of people we invite to dinner, who have the same education as us, who went to the same universities, and even by people from excellent families."
"Crime has nowadays become more refined, so I believe that the multi-disciplinary force proposed in the report is an extremely commendable idea."
"The people who devise crimes have now become so sophisticated that we really need criminal science to beat them."
"So it is not just a question of cops and robbers any more, crime has taken on an extra dimension because of the globalisation that has changed the world we live in."
"I therefore welcome Sir Jack Stewart-Clark's proposals, as I think that they are in line with what we need to create a sophisticated, multi-disciplinary Europol, with high-calibre people, graduates and so forth."
"Mr President, cooperation between the police forces in the different countries, as well as between police and customs, is a welcome development in combating crime."
"Much of Europol's work also contributes towards achieving the same end."
"On the other hand, it is important to ensure that police cooperation stops short of effectively placing national police forces under EU command or making them subject to supranational decisions."
"In the long run, as Europol continues to develop, there is also a risk of duplicating the work of Interpol."
"It is essential that Europol should complement Interpol, rather than replace it."
"I should like to comment on one particular point in the report, namely Amendment No 11 on the transmission of personal data."
"The amendment is commendable in every way and highlights the importance of adhering to the relevant Council of Europe convention."
"However, I am doubtful as to whether it goes far enough."
"In my view, Europol currently has a number of serious shortcomings."
"Article 10(1) of the Europol Convention and its implementing provisions allow considerable scope for compiling records on persons convicted or suspected of having committed a crime."
"It is possible to record a great deal of sensitive personal data."
"I therefore believe that it is essential to exert tighter control and that there should be an effective supervisory body when the register comes into operation, so as to avoid similar problems to those experienced with the SIS register under the Schengen Agreement."
"In practice, the register should be more strictly controlled and better supervised."
"It is already having a detrimental effect both in terms of integration and combating crime."
"In my view, it should be a basic requirement that registration applies only to those people who have been convicted or are suspected of having committed a crime."
"Mr President, with regard to the first text, Amendment No 4 to Article 2 haphazardly introduces all kinds of multinational inspections which do not correspond to any operational requirements but are rather for purposes of political show."
"I therefore believe that this amendment should not be included."
"With regard to the second text which concerns fuller monitoring of the routes used by criminals, I am astonished to see just how politically correct and unoriginal the amendments proposed by the rapporteur are."
"Amendment No 1 in the French version deletes illegal immigration and Amendment No 4 omits the expression 'police authorities'."
"You are living in cloud-cuckoo-land if you think that by deleting these words you can eliminate what is happening in reality."
"We must therefore act rationally and reject amendments that spring from a superstitious fear of the aspects of reality which are perhaps distasteful to the rapporteur."
"Illegal immigration is a real problem."
"Police authorities are a necessity in any civilised society."
"I would also add that frank words are a step forward, not a step back."
"Mr President, the great challenge for police cooperation in Europe in the future will not be the harmonisation of legislation, but the creation of practical cooperation at grassroots level among all European states."
"Without a common approach and shared resources the various early warning systems in place to prevent criminal activity will never function satisfactorily."
"Europol must be granted significant powers and a clear role in both the coordination of checks taking place on the Union's external border and in the development of the information exchange and early warning systems used by the authorities."
"It is important that, with the aid of Europol, we should be able to establish permanent cooperation in police and customs matters between officials in the Central and Eastern European countries that have applied for EU membership and those in the Union."
"One of the greatest concerns and hopes of the citizens of the EU, with regard to the enlargement of the Union, is that the single market should be kept secure with more being done to make the task of combatting international crime more effective."
"For this reason, one of the strategies prior to membership should be to focus to a greater degree than is currently the case on training the police and customs authorities in the former Communist bloc."
"Applicant countries must forge lasting links with cooperation agencies that operate under the auspices of Europol, such as police and customs officers' work groups, well in advance of EU membership."
"The extraordinary summit meeting scheduled to take place in Tampere during the Finnish Presidency will be devoted to the internal security of the Union, including action to combat drug trafficking, which is rife in the single market."
"At Tampere there must also be broader debate on the future challenges facing police cooperation in the Union, with special focus on the problems stemming from the enlargement process."
"Mr President, Sir Jack Stewart-Clark has compiled an excellent report on these two joint actions."
"The presidency intends to strengthen European cooperation and coordination in order to combat organised crime, an aim which the Commission wholeheartedly supports."
"For a long time now, we have been aware of the need to improve both the system for exchanging information and the cooperation in passing on intelligence about criminals within the Union."
"Schengen cooperation has already set us on the right road, and now it is up to the Union to exploit its achievements fully."
"In our view, there is also a need for clearer guidelines for carrying out joint operations, as well as for education and training activities."
"We also note with satisfaction that Europol has been given an important role in both joint actions, particularly in relation to the development of strategies to uncover the routes used by smugglers."
"We regard this as a very constructive step."
"The Commission and the Member States will consider together the most effective ways of implementing the two joint actions."
"In particular, I am considering the possibilities for allocating project support through the Oisin and Falcone programmes."
"Finally, the Commission is able to support the amendments tabled by the rapporteur and the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs."
"In our view, they help to make the significance of both instruments substantially clearer."
"Thank you, Mrs Gradin."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 3 p.m."
"Leonardo da Vinci programme"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0108/99), on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the common position adopted by the Council (13380/2/98 - C4-0001/99-98/0196(SYN)) with a view to adopting a Council Decision establishing the second phase of the Community vocational training action programme 'Leonardo da Vinci' (Rapporteur: Mrs Waddington)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the Leonardo Programme has been at the centre of the crisis in the Commission."
"It has attracted attention, not because of its aims and purpose to be the flagship for the European Union's vocational training policy, but because it has become associated with mismanagement, fraud, secrecy and nepotism."
"My task as rapporteur has been to help prepare a new programme, Leonardo II."
"My primary concern has been to ensure the new Leonardo Programme, which is due to begin on 1 January 2000, is of real benefit to the citizens of the European Union; that it makes a contribution to modernising vocational training systems through encouraging mobility, transnational cooperation and dissemination of good practice."
"The Leonardo Programme should be a laboratory of innovation that encourages and enables a wide-range of partners and trainees to gain access to new opportunities and new ideas."
"So, my main focus has been on the beneficiaries."
"It is significant that this Parliament has demonstrated its commitment to its beneficiaries of the programme by continuing to work to investigate, to consult and to propose improvements to Leonardo II despite the crisis in the Commission."
"The Commission, or certain parts of it, have let us down and have let the beneficiaries down by not ensuring the efficient and proper administration of the current Leonardo Programme, but I believe that we, as Members of this Parliament, have a mandate to increase opportunity by improving the programmes that are funded by the European Union."
"I am therefore recommending two amendments to the Parliament after considering the Audit Report and that of the Wise People."
"Neither the Socialist Group nor the PPE on the Social Affairs Committee want to see a system perpetuated which allows a contractor to misuse Community resources and then declare itself bankrupt."
"We are therefore calling for the accountable Commission services to undertake the administrative work for Leonardo II. That is why I have agreed to support Amendment No 34 which could be described as being either Old Labour or New Conservatism or indeed a new third way."
"I now turn to the details of the other amendments agreed by the Employment and Social Affairs Committee."
"Firstly, I am pleased to say that the Council has agreed to many of Parliament's amendments which were determined at first-reading stage."
"In addition, I understand that the presidency are supporting the spirit or the letter of several of the amendments that have been retabled for this second reading by the Social Affairs and Employment Committee."
"The amendments which have been retabled cover complementarity between Leonardo II, the European Social Fund and the Employment Guidelines."
"They give greater priority to life-long learning as opposed to exclusively concentrating on youth training. They give greater emphasis to access and systems of access to support those vulnerable to exclusion and discrimination including disabled people, and they extend the range of partners to include nongovernmental organisations and SMEs."
"The re-tabled amendments also aim to improve evaluation and monitoring systems and streamline and improve the management and decision-making procedures."
"In brief, I am aiming at defining Leonardo II as the programme which is concerned with developing vocational training systems for all, an inclusive approach which helps influence and develop training opportunities across the European Union and will link in with the European Social Fund and the Employment Guidelines."
"The aim of these amendments is to prepare for a new programme which is not associated with fraud, but with an increase of opportunity, rigour and transparency."
"I am also aware of the importance of agreeing these proposals today to ensure there is proper time for preparation for the new programme, and that it starts on time on 1 January 2000."
"This timetable would not be achieved if we waited until the Amsterdam Treaty comes into force in May."
"So just as the Leonardo I Programme has been central in illustrating the shortcomings of the Commission structures, this new programme, Leonardo II, and our decisions today will illustrate a new beginning and a determination by this Parliament to continue to work for employment and training opportunities for Europe's citizens."
"Mr President, Mrs Waddington, who has done a splendid job with this report, focused in her presentation on the content of Leonardo, and rightly so."
"I shall focus on the management of it."
"The lack of decent management for Leonardo may be seen as one of the root causes of the crisis in which we find ourselves at the moment."
"So it would be foolish not to spend some time on it in today's sitting."
"However, it would be wrong to look at the conclusions to be drawn from the work of the technical assistance offices only in terms of what should happen with Leonardo in the future, since technical assistance offices are a general phenomenon seen in all the directorates-general."
"So it seems right and proper to me to draw general conclusions."
"In effect, those conclusions have already been drawn in the report of the Wise Men, where it says that the Commission should never delegate essential political responsibilities to individuals and that any contracts concluded must contain strict provisions to ensure that the general interest is served at all times and not the interest of the private company."
"It also says that the authorities must exercise such tight scrutiny that there can be no question of the external advisors being over-dependent. Mrs Waddington made that point too."
"These are lessons which we think the Commission has to learn, but it would be laughable to talk only of lessons for the Commission."
"There are lessons here for the European Parliament and the Council too, because one of the lessons to be clearly learned is that budgetary policy is one of the reasons for the crisis."
"Many things have been called for by Parliament, but there are few resources structured into the budget."
"I think we have to draw these conclusions clearly in the budget debate and especially in the second reading in September, and that means finding solutions to the problems of the past and it means a bigger budget for recruiting in-house expertise."
"That is not to say that I am suggesting a permanent ban on the use of technical assistance offices."
"If they meet the criteria, they can certainly help to ease the load temporarily."
"Lastly, we find ourselves in a very strange position."
"Mrs Waddington has dealt mostly with the Council, since the Commission is not functioning for the moment."
"So a special responsibility rests with the Council."
"Normally, unanimity is needed in the Council to reject an amendment by Parliament if it is acceptable to the Commission."
"That situation does not exist at present."
"It means that the Council could overrule the agreement between Mrs Waddington and the German Presidency."
"I think that this situation provides grounds for obliging the Council to stand by the agreement it has concluded and thus prevent a unanimous vote in the Council to reject the agreement concluded with Parliament."
"That is a particular aspect which I think deserves special attention, not only in connection with this subject of our debate but with subsequent ones as well."
"Mr President, since our debate on the second phase of the Leonardo da Vinci programme on 5 November last year, much has changed."
"What remains the same is the objective."
"We want to supplement Member States' European vocational training actions and achieve complementarity between them."
"With a view to making them more effective, we are seeking to network them with other training programmes such as Socrates and Youth, as also with Community initiatives and the Structural Funds."
"Vocational training makes an ideal contribution to innovation, to creating new jobs and to achieving long-term competitiveness on world markets."
"However, there are two preconditions: firstly, integrated systems and, secondly, adequate funding."
"Various key concepts remain topical, such as promoting a higher level of vocational training, integrated in our lifelong learning strategy, equal opportunities for men and women, the removal of all forms of discrimination, qualified access to further training and paying special attention to re-training, to the reintegration of marginalised, disabled and older workers and the constructive dialogue with non-governmental organisations."
"It also remains most important substantially to boost the resources for Leonardo, as we have called for."
"Nobody would seriously question that need, given the new scope, the new duration and the new, much expanded field of application of the programme."
"What has, however, changed drastically, is how the programme is implemented, for one of the reasons for the European Commission's resignation early last week was the mismanagement of Leonardo."
"The ad hoc committee of inquiry, which is known as the Committee of Wise Men, confirmed in full the findings of the European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control."
"It found a large number of irregularities which, it said, 'must be considered an incitement to corruption'."
"The tender procedures were not evaluated on a neutral basis."
"Instead, organisations that had close links with the clients were given preference as contractors or contracting partners."
"Think of the times interested parties have complained to us, the responsible Members of the European Parliament, about a number of dubious decisions!"
"Mrs Cresson omitted to inform the President of the Commission or the European Parliament of them."
"As the Wise Men's Report also says, and I quote: 'It is elementary 'common sense' that the Commission should have supported the Parliament's decision-making process.'"
"Facts were indeed kept from us that could have served as background on how to structure the successor programme."
"I call on Sue Waddington, who has once again done an excellent and detailed job, to support the PPE Group's amendments."
"We want the Commission, when it implements Leonardo, not to turn to outside bodies but to restructure, Mr Liikanen, and turn to staff from its own ranks."
"It must remain responsible, must not leave the right to act to others and must undertake to monitor actions and resources carefully."
"The tasks of national administrative authorities - and this is our second amendment - must also be performed by internal staff and not by third parties."
"On the basis of these amendments the Commission should manage to create transparency and ensure precise supervision of tasks and expenditure."
"This new departure is worth it for the sake of the vocational future of hundreds of thousands of young Europeans!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, technically speaking this is a good programme."
"The previous Leonardo programme was technically a good one too, and ten times oversubscribed."
"So there is great interest in this programme amongst the people of Europe."
"Mrs Waddington has done an excellent job, but that is not the problem."
"The problem for me is that we are here today as if nothing had happened, as if there were no Committee of Wise Men's report and as if there were no lessons for us to learn from it."
"I do not think it would be a wise move to approve this programme today."
"We still do not know what the European Council intends to do about the future of the European Commission, how quickly solutions will be found to the problems which have arisen, so that they can be consigned to the past."
"We are again proposing to increase the budget for Leonardo in due course, and I too am in favour of doing that, but on the other hand we still have no guarantee at all that the problems which have arisen will be resolved adequately."
"So when it comes to the vote, I shall ask for a postponement until April."
"That is perfectly feasible, because Coreper is meeting on 14 April and there will be time to vote before then."
"In that event, we shall at least be sure that the European Council takes the crisis seriously and is keen to resolve it."
"I am amazed to find that there is little support for this idea amongst other honourable Members."
"I cannot understand that, because if we do not vote for a postponement, we shall lose the leverage we have at this time."
"And my group will face the difficulty of having to choose whether to vote or not."
"I shall then have to look for a list, and I am not all that keen to surrender my chance to vote."
"So perhaps we can think of some other means of putting pressure on the Council."
"But the preferable course and the best political signal we can give is to postpone the vote."
"I would once again urge the House to follow this course."
"Otherwise we shall be doing just the same in political terms as we have always done before."
"Mr President, I am pleased that the administration of the Leonardo da Vinci programme has come in for very detailed scrutiny."
"The most troubling aspect of the findings has been the wasted money which has not been used for training."
"We know that the programmes are always the subject of trade-offs or rather tussles between the Council and Parliament over the budgets agreed."
"If we start using the money correctly, we will reap the rewards in effectiveness."
"The programme has nevertheless been satisfactory."
"Its purpose is not in doubt but it needs to change, particularly with regard to its priority target groups."
"If Europe is accused of creating unemployment, it must provide solutions such as the Leonardo programme, which is designed to improve the employability of people and create more companies."
"The fact remains that the Council and Commission are wrong not to have accepted the amendments giving priority access to this programme for disabled people and allowing special access for the most disadvantaged."
"The complementary nature of this programme with regard to the ESF has also not been accepted."
"Why seven years for the programme?"
"Surely this is too long."
"What purpose will interim evaluations serve if the programme is fixed for so long?"
"Finally, I am sorry to see that once again the common position does not give much room to the social partners in the administration of the programme."
"In Europe, Leonardo da Vinci is the symbol of creativity and ingenuity."
"These virtues cannot be said to have inspired the Council and Commission."
"This is why our citizens do not believe in the added value of Europe and this is to be regretted."
"We must ensure that Parliament provides the stimulus for the Commission and Council to take the people into account."
"Mr President, I think we really do now have a classic example of the problems involved in the European programmes."
"A good, indeed an essential programme, is simply not a carte blanche for mismanagement."
"During the last discussion we also said that in the interests of Leonardo II it was urgently necessary that Mrs Cresson put her house in order."
"The situation has turned out to be rather more acute in the meantime, but the house is being put in order."
"In that respect, we are seeing progress."
"Leonardo II has made it possible to create the European dimension of vocational training, to give access to lifelong learning, not just as a slogan for those who lack qualifications but as an opportunity."
"Here Parliament has a special responsibility to bring about progress through dialogue with the Council."
"Of course we have to consider how we can effectively resolve the question of public accountability for the use of public monies."
"We will not be able simply to fall back on old models of public administration."
"They are no longer appropriate."
"We need modern models that also use the instruments of contract awarding."
"But that cannot mean handing over the money to industry or to mafia-like structures and letting them manage it themselves."
"That is bound to lead to the results we have seen."
"We must put an end to that."
"We need to return to public accountability."
"That is the central task to which the Council and Parliament must now apply themselves together and which the new Commission must resolve."
"I hope the caretaker Commission will take supportive action towards this aim."
"Mr President, this Leonardo programme is important but has been badly managed."
"The mismanagement and irregularities which came to light made me keen to go to the courts, for fear of a cover-up otherwise."
"Happily that did not happen."
"On the contrary, things came to a head in the crisis and we now know for certain that this Augean stable at any rate is going to be cleaned out."
"But we are still not totally reassured, and I would ask the Commission to be especially careful, because there is currently the risk of a real foul-up and people are hiding behind the fact that the cases, the dossiers, have been sealed by the courts."
"At present there is no follow-up to the Leonardo programme, and that is not a good thing."
"The programme is in danger of grinding to a halt because even the applications are not being processed."
"But the situation can be saved if qualified staff from the former TAOs are put on to the job at once."
"The argument that the dossiers are sealed does not stand up, since there are duplicates of all files which can be used, provided there is sensible and urgent liaison by the Commission, the trustee and the investigating magistrate."
"In future the practice of TAOs must be avoided as far as possible, if not banned altogether, if only to prevent the operation by these TAOs - under the noses of our own Social Affairs Committee - of a staff policy which is totally at odds with any form of social legislation in the Member States."
"I would therefore ask the Commission, the Council and Parliament to sit down together and insist that the dossiers are processed, so that a programme which all of us here think is so important can indeed continue in the future."
"Mr President, I think that Parliament's position in relation to the Leonardo II programme must be based on two principles:"
"firstly, the need for prompt, timely and fully prepared implementation of the programme, which means that the procedure must be completed and the programme must start now; -secondly, that in the light of the problems which arose with the Leonardo I programme, this preparation must be comprehensive, proper, and carried out with a view to and on the basis of the priorities which have already been discussed.I am not ignoring the very important issue of the technical assistance offices."
"I am not going to mention this matter - not because I underestimate it, but for quite the opposite reason."
"I think it is an extremely important issue, because it has a bearing on transparency and proper administration."
"I agree with the debate that has already taken place and with the position of the rapporteur."
"But I believe that we must not allow this issue to become part of the more general and very important issue which we debated yesterday and which we shall be voting on this afternoon."
"I would prefer to focus on the importance of the Leonardo programme, since it is linked to the Socrates and Youth programmes."
"On the basis of this principle and the action associated with these programmes, and in the context of the Structural Funds and the Social Fund in particular, we must not lose sight of the priority we are highlighting, which is to promote the message and the means to tackle unemployment through vocational training and to encourage the active and responsible citizen."
"All the things that unite us culturally will thereby provide the values that are fundamental to the European Union. I believe that the emphasis must remain where it should be, and that the European Parliament must move forward today and finalise its own contribution."
"Mr President, I too agree that this programme is very important, and my sincere thanks to Mrs Waddington for all the hard work she has put in on it."
"In a European jobs market, I think it is most important for people to gain experience of working in other Member States, and that is what this programme makes possible."
"That is obvious, from the degree to which it is oversubscribed."
"I shall touch on the question of the TAOs, because this is what has exercised us most of late."
"I totally agree with what Wim van Velzen and Thomas Mann said on the subject."
"But I think there is something else going on here."
"The Commissioner told the Committee on Budgets that anyone opposed to the TAOs was in fact 'old Labour'."
"I felt very strongly, as someone whose grandfather in the Netherlands stood on the Malieveld to prevent a socialist revolution from breaking out in the Netherlands, about being described as 'old Labour', when there are major questions to be asked about these TAOs."
"I agree with those who say, and also as Wim van Velzen said, that TAOs are all right in certain cases, but in very restricted cases, in my view."
"In general, we have a problem with what might be called the core business of government."
"That was the problem here."
"When a firm goes under, you then realise the difficulties we face."
"Everything stops, because a Belgian judge has to decide on something which is in fact a European case."
"I do not think that is right."
"How would people feel if, for example, the whole administration of Finland's social security system was contracted out to Sweden, and the Swedish firm then went bust?"
"I think it might create a few problems in Finland."
"I believe we should be mindful of this."
"In creating a TAO we are exceeding the Union's legal powers, so if a business fails you have to consider how far the Union's interests may be harmed."
"Another point which is of course very relevant is the question of social security contributions."
"In ten or so cases, these have either been underpaid or not paid at all."
"The Commission has not exercised adequate scrutiny here."
"Vis-à-vis the Belgian authorities, TAOs often claim to be part of the EU apparatus, which is not the case because they are subject to Belgian law."
"That gives rise to a very disagreeable situation."
"So I think that in this programme certainly, which spawned the whole concept of the TAO, we must not allow TAOs."
"We cannot afford to."
"The Council cannot afford to, at least not if it really is intent on cleaning up its act."
"We cannot afford it, and we must find budgetary solutions to remedy the situation, otherwise things will be impossible."
"We cannot allow just one TAO to remain."
"If we do, we lose all credibility, and for that reason we have tabled an amendment."
"That amendment resolves the matter, I would say, and this TAO will then in any event be reduced to what it is."
"In this case, the TAO is NBG - it is a bad thing, and we must not forget that."
"Madam President, this is a praiseworthy report which should promote access to education, employment and experience, combat discrimination and enhance equality of opportunity and the integration of handicapped people into the labour market and working life."
"It has particular significance for small and medium-sized businesses and industrial and manufacturing enterprises."
"It is essential that the labour market partners are included in the cooperation process from the outset in order to reinforce employability, since the whole point of education is to have a job at the end."
"Together we must each play our part in reducing unemployment and increasing employment opportunities in Europe."
"It is one of our major tasks."
"However, a totally different system of control and evaluation and of keeping Parliament regularly informed needs to be introduced, as well as openness and transparency, in order to improve the programme's credibility."
"I think that in reality it would be somewhat challenging to deal on the same day with both the departure of the Commission and the Leonardo da Vinci programme, which was in fact one of the main reasons for its resignation because of the fraud, nepotism and mismanagement associated with the programme."
"It would seem sensible to postpone a vote until the problems arising from the financial mismanagement of previous projects has been investigated."
"I hope that others will also realise that this is important, not least in terms of the way in which our work in Parliament is perceived."
"In any event, our group will stress this aspect before a decision is taken."
"Madam President, I am here in exceptional circumstances so I will be very brief."
"Firstly, the Commission can accept 30 of the 33 amendments tabled to the Waddington report."
"The amendments which the Commission cannot accept are Nos 12 and 21."
"With regard to Amendment No 26, which is the major amendment concerning the technical assistance offices, I will set out the Commission's reservations in written form."
"We had discussions earlier in this Chamber on that very point when we talked about budgetary priorities for the year 2000."
"The position of the rapporteur then was that one should not on principle abolish all technical assistance offices but should guarantee that they do not exercise public sector tasks."
"We have been working on the general rules of that area and I would just like to say that it is clear that the ways the technical assistance offices have been used have been too vague and they have exercised two different tasks."
"We need to arrive at a situation where the task given to the technical assistance offices could be clearly defined: the rules for unprofessional conduct, the rules on the correct management of funds and - last, but not least, the very important important made by Mr Pronk - that there should be an external authorised auditor on every technical assistance office to guarantee that all national legislation is being fulfilled."
"This would create a different basis for their function."
"But I do not want to go into detail on this discussions."
"We must come back to that in other contexts."
"However, it is clear that in the short and medium-term we need some solutions for those tasks which are temporary and short-term and which must be done quickly."
"For the European public administration we must transfer those which have the element of decision-making, where political power, so to speak, is being held."
"I will give the details on that position to Mrs Waddington later."
"Thank you, Mr Liikanen."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 3 p.m."
"The sitting was suspended at 12.10 p.m. and resumed at 3.05 p.m."
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to welcome the recipient of the Nobel Prize for literature, Mr José Saramago, who is present with us in the official gallery."
"Loud applause"
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I know that we all complain of a lack of interest in the work of Parliament but that is partly our own responsibility."
"At 8 50 p.m. last night a member of the Japanese mission attempted to gain entry to Parliament to listen to the debate on Mr Tindemans' report on KEDO."
"He was told by our security staff that the session was over."
"As I was here between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. with a large number of Members of Parliament, maybe we could give our security staff not only a calendar of part-sessions but also a timetable."
"We will immediately look into that and take the necessary measures to avoid a similar situation occurring in the future."
"Mr President, I have just learnt from Reuters that weapons have been seized in Brussels from a car belonging to Mr Le Pen. To be exact, a pump-action shotgun, tear-gas grenades and a handgun were found in his car."
"I should like to know what the Chair can do in order to ensure that the prestige of Parliament is not damaged by events of this gravity."
"Applause"
"Mr Duhamel, I believe that Mr Martinez is going to explain why these weapons were there, assuming that this is true."
"Mr President, you are right to say 'assuming that this is true'."
"On a previous occasion Mr Duhamel informed you that a president of the Chilean Senate who was a Pinochet supporter was present, to which you replied that he was not representing Pinochet."
"The same applies today."
"The weapon in question is a spray-type tear-gas grenade which can be bought in any supermarket."
"This is Mr Duhamel's 'riot gun' or whatever he called it."
"So what is the situation?"
"I gave you a letter about this at about 11.30 this morning, Mr President."
"Our colleague and group chairman, Mr Le Pen, enjoys official protection provided by the French Ministry of the Interior. This protection stops at the Franco-Belgian border, since there still is a Franco-Belgian border, which means that the official agents of the French Socialist Ministry of the Interior cannot continue on to Brussels."
"For the journey from the border to Brussels, Mr Le Pen has his own official bodyguard and a chauffeur to protect him."
"The official bodyguard is officially permitted to carry firearms just like all bodyguards."
"And that is what this is all about."
"There were no rockets, missile launchers, booby-trapped cars or any trafficking of Serbian or Albanian weapons."
"It was simply a small tear-gas grenade and the firearms carried by an official bodyguard."
"This being the case, the arrival of spring together with the climate changes must have affected Mr Duhamel's brain, unless he has been eating British beef."
"This was all it was, Mr President, that Mr Duhamel got so worked up about."
"Applause, calls of approval, beating on tables by Members"
"As there are no terrorists, no weapons and no rockets, there is no crime."
"My letter to you, Mr President, basically asks you to ensure that the immunities enjoyed by MEPs are respected."
"Very well, I think everyone has got the message."
"Anyone wanting more details can ask me for a copy of your letter."
"The matter is therefore closed, and I will not allow anyone else to speak on this."
"We should not be discussing questions in this House which are a matter of Belgian law and order."
"There will be no personal statements."
"Mr President, I am not going to talk about arms, but another kind of terrorism."
"We have had a splendid building constructed here, the Parliament building, with smoking and non-smoking areas clearly demarcated."
"I am not against smokers: they may smoke in peace to their hearts' content, but I wish they would respect those who do not smoke and keep well clear of the non-smoking areas, allowing us to enjoy a smokeless environment."
"Applause"
"I hope the President will bring this to people's attention in the corridors, coffee shops and restaurants."
"In principle, these measures already exist. One should expect 'no smoking' notices to be complied with, but reminders will be issued if necessary."
"VOTES"
"In the absence of written opposition, the resolution contained in this report is deemed adopted and will be published in the Minutes of today's sitting."
"Mr President, I am wondering whether our own amendment is admissible."
"The French version already contains the words I wish to add: 'the members of the Commission'."
"Is the French text or the English text the authentic one?"
"If it is the English text, I maintain the amendment, because I do not think it includes this reference."
"Otherwise, I think the amendment should be withdrawn."
"It is the English version, and we shall put your amendment to the vote."
"Before the vote on Amendment No 14"
"Mr President, I feel that Amendment No 3, which appears in the voting list after paragraph 9, serves the same purpose but goes further."
"I think it should be put to the vote before Amendment No 14."
"Your amendment is included in the vote, but later on."
"This one comes after paragraph 2 and the other after paragraph 9, I believe."
"So I shall put it to the vote afterwards."
"Mr President, in this case Mr Fabre-Aubrespy is right."
"It deals with the case of Mr Van Buitenen."
"Amendment No 3 goes further. It should be voted first."
"I have no objection if that is the case."
"Before the vote on Amendment No 19"
"Just a word, Mr President, about Amendment No 19."
"This is a very important amendment which simply requests that the Committee of Experts, of which we quite rightly have such a high opinion, should consider Parliament's administrative and financial operation."
"At a time when the public at large is watching what is going on ..."
"The President cut the speaker off"
"On Amendment No 12"
"Mr President, I would like to withdraw the first part of my amendment, paragraph 5a, since I see that this aspect of the Commissioners' individual accountability is also covered by Article 5; but I will maintain paragraph 5b, demanding of the Council that a procedure be laid down as soon as possible which enables individual Commissioners to be called to account."
"The author of an amendment can withdraw it and, if no one takes it over, it stands withdrawn."
"The first part of Amendment No 12, paragraph 5a, has therefore been withdrawn."
"We shall now vote on paragraph 5b of Amendment No 12."
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy has the floor."
"Mr President, I wished to say that I was taking over this amendment but proposing a modified oral version to the House."
"This version is extremely simple and reads as follows: 'insists that members of the Commission who have resigned under no circumstances be allowed to be members of the new Commission'."
"An oral amendment can only be put to the vote if there is no opposition from the House."
"I think there is clearly opposition to this vote, so I cannot accept the amendment."
"Are there 12 Members who are opposed to this oral amendment by Mr Fabre-Aubrespy being put to the vote?"
"That is the case, so I cannot put it to the vote."
"Will you take over the amendment as it stands, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy?"
"I have seen what has happened in public and before the whole Parliament, and I am quite happy."
"On Amendment No 1"
"Mr President, with regard to the next amendment - Amendment No 1 - could I ask Mr Cox if he is prepared to accept an oral amendment."
"I have no problem with the principle he is trying to introduce, namely that we should have a new Commission by the end of this Parliament."
"However, I think that allows us a bit longer than 5 May, should we need it."
"I would be obliged, if he were willing to accept as an oral amendment: 'for a vote of approval by 5 May or at the latest by the end of the life of this Parliament'."
"This would allow us a bit more flexibility."
"Mr President, this is like a TV quiz show - I am getting different advice from each side."
"I am happy as long as we indicate a preference in timing while being realistic enough to realise that we do not control all the possibilities."
"We would like the Council to assist us with the earliest possible time but if they fail to approve the Commission by 5 May, then at least we should have as a fallback that we can approve the Commission within the life of the Parliament."
"I would like to keep the date and I can accept the fallback as an addition to the text, if that meets with the approval of the House."
"More than 12 Members were opposed to the oral addition to Amendment No 1"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the text of the resolution we have just adopted will be available this afternoon in all the languages."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have just adopted the resolution calling for the summit to appoint a new Commission."
"We are now being asked to vote on what should happen about the Leonardo report, a report by Mrs Waddington which in itself has nothing wrong with it. Mrs Waddington has done an excellent job, but my group thinks that voting on this report at the present time sends out a very bad signal, as if nothing were amiss, when we do not know if the Council is going to shoulder its responsibilities and come up with the right proposals at the forthcoming summit."
"It is technically possible to postpone this vote until April."
"My group very much favours doing that, and commends that course of action to the House."
"Mrs Boogerd-Quaak, if I have understood correctly, you are asking for this vote to be postponed pursuant to Rule 131."
"I shall therefore call one speaker in favour and one against, but first give the floor to the rapporteur."
"Mr President, I would like to say that I am opposed to the proposal from Mrs Boogerd-Quaak to refer this back."
"There are no matters for us to consider within the committee and we want to send a strong message today to the Council and the Commission for the new programme. It is vital that both the Council and the Commission have the time to introduce the new programme on 1 January 2000."
"Preparations must be carried out now and since there are no disagreements amongst us, we believe that the vote should be taken this afternoon."
"Applause"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must learn to distinguish between European programmes and their poor management by the Commission."
"Mrs Cresson did not have carte blanche to do what she did and say: it is a good programme so I can do what I want."
"But conversely, we must not now jeopardise a good programme by postponing it because of poor management."
"We should really distinguish between the two, which is why we should vote today."
"Applause"
"(Parliament rejected the request)"
"(The President declared the common position approved as amended)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Foreign Affairs Committee has tabled three amendments to its own motion for a resolution, in order to take account of what Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said here yesterday evening in the debate about the European Parliament's involvement in international agreements concluded under the Euratom Treaty."
"The Foreign Affairs Committee is tabling three amendments and has decided to delete paragraphs 4 and 5 of the draft text which proposed blocking funds for KEDO."
"As rapporteur, and in agreement with the draftsmen for the Committees on Research and Budgets, I would therefore ask the House to adopt Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3 and reject paragraphs 4 and 5."
"Parliament adopted the resolution"
"Last night during the debate on the oral question the Council was absent."
"I asked on behalf of those present whether the presidency could reply to the question before the vote today."
"Has the Council replied?"
"I am told that we have in fact received a reply, Mr Brinkhorst, so your intervention has produced results."
"Mr President, could you please have that circulated to Members?"
"We shall obviously circulate this reply, if it has indeed been received."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say a word or two about the amendments tabled by the Group of the European Radical Alliance to the motion for a resolution on relations between the European Union and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea."
"We were unaware of these amendments yesterday evening when we debated this, so I was not able to give any verdict or comments then."
"The motion for a resolution on which we have to vote in a moment was introduced by the Foreign Affairs Committee as a complement to its report on KEDO and with the express aim of making a justified attempt to dispel suspicion in this most isolated state of North Korea and to bring it closer into the international community."
"The three rapporteurs for the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Budgets and Research were involved in this."
"We were eager for contacts and meetings and to see how these might be brought about, how we might find ways of perhaps creating mutual trust, including contacts between our two parliaments."
"We had to forge links which would make dialogue possible."
"As convinced democrats, we naturally found many things to criticise, and the amendments tabled by the ARE Group are clearly based on criticism."
"But I have to say that the motion for a resolution did not set out primarily to be critical."
"We were very much aware that if we could not establish better links with North Korea, if we could not persuade North Korea to join the international community, we would have to expect a humanitarian and perhaps even a security disaster of enormous proportions."
"The motion for a resolution was drawn up very carefully by the Foreign Affairs Committee and with input too from the draftsmen, Mr Ford and Mr Brinkhorst."
"So I would urge you not to adopt the amendments tabled by the ARE Group and to maintain the motion for a resolution tabled by the Foreign Affairs Committee unchanged and in its entirety."
"Mr President, as far as the procedure is concerned, I must say that it would really be the last straw if we could not vote on these amendments."
"We were not able to table amendments in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and it seems we cannot table amendments in the plenary either."
"I think this is really too much."
"In substance, Mr Tindemans is advocating trust."
"We hold the opposite view, since no trust can be placed in a psychopathic regime."
"This regime needs to be placed under international supervision, and this should be done straight away!"
"Thank you, Mr Dupuis."
"In any event, I would confirm that these amendments will be put to the vote."
"There is no problem with the procedure."
"Parliament adopted the resolution"
"Mr President, I simply wish to say that I would like to withdraw the ends of two of the amendments tabled by my own group, in the interests of preserving the consensus that prevailed throughout the drafting of this report."
"From Amendment No 1, I should like to delete the end, after 'draws attention to Turkish incursions into the area'. And from Amendment No 4, I also wish to delete the end, that is, the part following the sentence: 'Calls on the Member States, the Council and the Commission to renew their efforts to formulate a common foreign policy, in view of the challenge posed by the repression of the Kurdish people'."
"I would like this revised wording to go forward to the vote."
"In addition, I should like to join my colleague Mr Brinkhorst in regretting the Council's absence during yesterday's debate on this report."
"This is a Council document which was only referred to the Committee on Civil Liberties for consultation a year after it had been approved."
"Moreover, the fact that we do not even know at this stage whether or not the Council has acknowledged receipt of this report seems quite unacceptable."
"I should also like to know if the protest I made yesterday and my request for a response have been forwarded to the Council."
"Thank you, Mrs Terrón i Cusí."
"Parliament adopted the resolution"
"Mr President, I regretfully had to abstain in this vote and I would like to explain why."
"Basically I was very much in favour, but there were two points I could not accept."
"The first is that this resolution leaves the road open for this so-called Committee of Experts, which has indeed done well here, to go on working for ever."
"It is quite simply a mistake on the part of Parliament to bring in outsiders instead of assigning these tasks to the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"That is the first reason."
"The second is that I find the resolution far too weak."
"We could have taken a much more vigorous and definite approach since this was after all an affair in which Parliament has finally shown a bit of muscle, which could have been reflected more strongly in this resolution."
"Mr President, as I was not given the floor yesterday in the debate, I would like first of all to say how very much I regret that, following the Committee of Independent Experts' report with its rather arbitrary conclusions and the ill-considered and irresponsible reactions of some people in this Parliament, some of the public have been led to believe that the process of European construction is just a sordid business of fraud, waste and irresponsibility."
"Fortunately, this is not the case, and I very much want to pay tribute to the four years of work done by the Santer Commission, which carried out all of the political programme that Mr Santer presented to Parliament."
"Moreover, we cannot deny that it was Mr Santer's Commission that took decisions and measures designed to clean up the Delors heritage of administrative and other anomalies."
"The Santer Commission does not deserve to be described by the independent experts as irresponsible when it comes to supervising its own administration."
"I particularly regret that it was a female Commissioner who failed to act as a decent politician and face the consequences of her actions and her evident favouritism in time by resigning."
"She has set a bad example which is detrimental to all women involved in politics in Europe."
"Finally, I did not vote against the resolution."
"I abstained, because it does salvage something by calling for a reasonable timetable for appointing a new Commission."
"Nonetheless, I was not able to vote in favour because there is a lack of balance in paragraph 2 with its overly positive assessment of the extremely arbitrary conclusions reached by the Committee of Experts, which unfortunately has been asked to continue its work."
"Mr President, I too voted for the resolution."
"Nevertheless, I do not think Parliament has exactly covered itself with glory."
"It would have been better had we had the courage in January to call on Parliament to take matters further towards their logical conclusion."
"I believe that in future we must not just call for the restructuring of the Commission but also become more self-confident vis-à-vis the Commission ourselves."
"Let me give an example: in my opinion the way in which the Commission fobs us off with our written questions is quite appalling!"
"Some of what it puts in its answers is ridiculous and I really wish that the President of the Commission, but also the Bureau of Parliament, would make it clear to the Commission that we expect proper answers and indeed answers which stand up in law against the Commission."
"We do not want information we already know!"
"Secondly, I would really like to see a rigorous investigation into whether there really was any indirect party funding."
"I hope these reports will be made public before the European elections so that we can give the taxpayers the opportunity to make it clear who they are choosing."
"In short, I believe that Parliament should not just accept the way it is treated by the Commission, which is why I emphatically ask the Bureau to seek to ensure that in future questions to the Commission are answered in more precise and exact terms."
"Mr President, the title of the resolution should be amended to take account of Amendment No 16, which was adopted."
"It should refer to the resignation of the members of the Commission."
"As to the substance, I would point out that most Members of Parliament have failed to learn the lessons of recent events both in relation to the replacement of members of the Commission and the Committee of Experts."
"Concerning the replacement of the members of the Commission, it was a mistake to reject our Amendment No 20, which recommended that none of the Commissioners should be reappointed."
"The Committee of Experts' report is actually very clear."
"It condemned the collective responsibility of the Commissioners themselves and also of the Commission as an institution, both the present Commission and the preceding one."
"By adopting paragraph 7 of the resolution, most Members of Parliament have shown that they have not learned from this report and, above all, from the many statements made by the experts since then."
"Things should have been sorted out once and for all, and a special interim Commission brought in, made up of management experts, with the task of providing a remedy, just as the independent experts provided a diagnosis."
"With regard to the Committee of Experts, it was wrong to give it until 1 September to produce a report."
"We have tied down the next term of office; we have refused to let the committee look into the way Parliament works."
"Once again, the powers of the European Parliament have been whittled away."
"Mr President, I abstained in the vote on this resolution, largely for one reason: I too consider it a bad thing that this resolution virtually extends the mandate of the Committee of Independent Experts."
"It has indeed done good work, but I voted against this Committee of Experts at the last vote too because I am convinced that there is no legal basis for that committee."
"This has been confirmed by various opinions, for instance that of Siegbert Alber, a former Member of Parliament who is now Advocate-General at the Court of Justice."
"He too took a clear stance and said there is no legal basis for this so-called Committee of Wise Men."
"That is why I could not vote in favour."
"But I must also say that there were some very good things in this resolution, not just that it calls on the Council to lay down a procedure which enables individual Commissioners to be called to account but also the fact that it reproaches the Council for failing to assume its responsibilities to some extent, for it should already have taken a position on several occasions, which it did not do; in the end it was mainly thanks to the work of the Committee on Budgetary Control and this Parliament that we saw any movement at all here."
"Mr President, this is the first time I have given an oral explanation of vote, so I hope I am doing it correctly."
"As regards this resolution, I decided to abstain in the individual votes and to vote in favour of the resolution at the end, since pressure of time has made it hard for me to keep abreast of the numerous changes."
"So I decided to abstain in the individual votes, but obviously I believe that issues such as protection for informants, openness and so on, which are included in the resolution, are important."
"Consequently, I decided to vote in favour in the final vote."
"Thank you, Mrs Palm."
"You can see that you have done it very well."
"I have always believed that a strong Commission was vital in protecting the interests of smaller countries."
"It is important for the future of the European Union that we have a strong Commission at the centre of our political life."
"The history of the past 25 years has amply demonstrated that Irish interests have been supported both fairly and generously by successive Commissions."
"Notwithstanding the events of the recent past I still believe this."
"Inevitably the interim Commission will be perceived as a lame duck - but sometimes lame ducks can surprise us."
"We expect the Berlin Council to appoint a new President so that a new Commission can be established as soon as possible."
"Many governments will decide to reappoint the sitting Commissioners for pragmatic reasons."
"The interim Commission must make reform of the Institutions a top priority."
"It is equally important that we recognise that the really serious evidence of fraud is confined to the individual Member States and a large share of it is specifically in the administration of the common agricultural policy, as the Beef Tribunal in Dublin has clearly established."
"In future we must have a strong, reformed and independent Commission capable of preventing fraud and giving Europe the political impulsion it clearly needs."
"We did not vote for Parliament's resolution following the Commission's resignation, as we felt that it was rather hypocritical: on the one hand, it calls for the accountability of the Commission and the democratic dimension of the Union to be strengthened (paragraph 4), yet on the other hand it requests that the independent experts' second report on fraud should not be submitted until September 1999."
"The idea is to avoid embarrassing issues being displayed for all to see during the campaign for the European elections."
"Is this really the democratic behaviour called for in the resolution?"
"In any event, we challenge the majority position of this House, which claims that the solution to the crisis lies in giving the European Parliament greater powers."
"This is nothing but a political hijacking exercise orchestrated by the federalists."
"In substance, this supposed remedy would not cure anything; in fact it would do quite the opposite."
"Before clamouring for increased power for Brussels, we should first ask why fraud has occurred."
"We would then see that European federalism, which is all of a sudden being proposed as a cure-all, has from its earliest days been the very cause of the wrong we are condemning."
"In reality, fraud has developed because an ivory tower has been built in Brussels, cut off from the people, with vast sums of money passing through it and with direct supervision by the Member States still not allowed."
"Of course, according to the Treaties, the European Parliament does have control over the Community budget."
"But despite all the obvious irregularities this had never really worked."
"Now it has at least been put into practice once, thanks to the diligence of the Europe of Nations Group."
"So much the better."
"But this welcome development proves neither that the European Parliament is the best instrument of budgetary control, nor (in fact, even less so) that it fulfils the fundamental conditions for becoming the high assembly of a federal Europe, sweeping away the main powers of the national parliaments at a stroke."
"This Parliament is not the best instrument of budgetary control because in fact it is hand in glove with the institution it is supposed to supervise, namely the Commission."
"The European Parliament dreams only of extending its power, and to achieve this dream, it knows that it needs to extend the sphere of Community activity, which is what the Commission spends most of its time doing as well."
"The two institutions are hence allies pursuing the same goal."
"And throughout its whole existence, the European Parliament has never condemned the most flagrant irregularities committed by the Commission, including recently - just a few months before the current scandal blew up - the commitment of expenditure without any legal basis at all."
"It eventually took the tireless work since last January of a few MEPs, unintentionally put at an advantage by the blunders of the federalist group chairmen, to trigger an event which Parliament for the most part did not actually want to happen at all: the Commission's resignation."
"We now know very well that because of their very structure the European Parliament and the Commission play into each other's hands, and that control can only come from outside, from the Council and the national parliaments, whose powers should be increased."
"It seems hard to believe that France pays an annual contribution to the Union, yet its MPs do not have the right to say 'no' when the budget is put to the vote or to check for themselves what becomes of taxpayers' money."
"Until these obvious points are understood, all that will happen is that spurious controls will be introduced in Brussels and wrongdoing will continue."
"Furthermore, the European Parliament does not fulfil any of the conditions required for it to become the high assembly of a federal Europe."
"We should not lose sight of the fact that Europe is not a nation, but an association of nations, and that this essential character provided the justification for its unique institutions, where national sovereignties play a pivotal role and must continue to do so."
"In particular, the European Parliament, a specialised assembly, may be of use in carrying out specialised tasks, but never in the general exercise of sovereignty."
"It does not represent a European people."
"In practical terms, in budgetary matters for example, we cannot see the French agreeing that their taxes should be decided by a majority of Germans and Spaniards."
"Nonetheless, these are supposed to be the 'European people', the vital bedrock of 'European democracy'."
"Therefore, if we wish to put a stop to fraud and mismanagement in the European institutions, we should not hide our heads in the clouds."
"We should not make the even greater mistake of suggesting that extra powers be transferred to Brussels in the guise of democracy, an artificial democracy which would soon bring renewed disillusionment."
"The 'off-the-peg' federalist ideas which have blocked all proper solutions over the past few years should not be allowed to get a new lease of life in a different form, after the collapse of the Commission."
"On the contrary, during the campaign for the forthcoming European elections, we should advocate the only effective solutions: reestablishing the Member States' control over Brussels, subordinating the Commission to the Council and giving the national parliaments the right to see how their citizens' money is being spent."
"We broadly support the joint resolution on the events surrounding the Commission's resignation, and we voted in favour of it."
"We too take the view that a caretaker Commission must be appointed as quickly as possible for the remainder of the outgoing Commission's term."
"We cannot have this Commission which has resigned remaining in office for a further nine months."
"That would do nothing for the Union's authority and credibility."
"However, we would have liked to see a number of points in the joint resolution which were not in fact there."
"For that reason, we tabled a resolution of our own and did not put our names to the joint motion."
"A major aspect which is not dealt with is whether or not members of the outgoing Commission should be appointed to the caretaker Commission."
"We do not think that the new caretaker Commission should include any members of the present Commission, because the work of the committee of experts is not yet finished."
"All kinds of new cases of fraud may yet come to light."
"If the committee's further investigations show that certain Commissioners are free of all blame, we have no objection to them returning to office in the next Commission term from 2000 to 2005."
"Another aspect not clearly spelled out in the joint resolution is the remit of the caretaker Commission."
"The next nine months must be dominated by a radical clean-up of the administrative and financial systems and the improving and modernising of the financial management."
"The caretaker Commission must do no more than that."
"There is no need at all for it to implement all manner of lofty plans for the further building of Europe, accompanied by a further extension of the Commission's remit, and certainly not in the next few months."
"Recital D and paragraph 4 of the resolution call for a strong Commission, which is paradoxical given the malfunctioning noted by the Committee of Independent Experts that led to the resignation of the Commission."
"It was precisely because the Commission felt strong, in fact too strong, that it allowed itself to make major management errors, even going so far as to withhold 'important documents from Parliament', according to recital B of the resolution."
"Because of an error stemming from the Treaties establishing the European Union, the Commission has far too great a role to play."
"This institution, which through the very way in which it is appointed is the least democratic in the Union, should go back to playing the role which is normally given to an administration: carrying out the orders of the highest political authority, the European Council."
"The founding fathers of Europe created the Commission following the model of the ECSC's High Authority, because they did not have faith in democracy."
"We should turn the current crisis to our benefit and let good sense prevail."
"In a democratic system, the Commission must be the Council's executive and nothing more than that."
"The Treaties should be revised to this end."
"The pressure of circumstances is certain to force us to do this in the future."
"In accepting its political responsibility and offering its collective resignation, the Commission has made a gesture we should appreciate. We should also express our appreciation of the political work undertaken by the Commission during its term of office."
"It now falls to the Council to accept its political responsibility, as Parliament did in December by refusing to grant discharge for 1996, and appointing a Committee of Independent Experts to investigate irregularities which had come to light."
"It is essential for the Council to resolve the institutional crisis resulting from the resignation as quickly as possible."
"The potential dangers of the crisis do not lie in the resignation itself, nor even in the reasons for it, but in what could follow, depending on how the Council chooses to deal with the situation."
"On the pretext of the mismanagement and lack of financial control revealed in the report by the Committee of Experts, the Council could be tempted to put forward a President lacking in political standing. It could also use this opportunity to weaken the Commission and restrict its competence."
"If the Council does react like this, nothing will have been gained from the crisis and it will have negative consequences for the future of the European Union, which would be particularly unfortunate given the crucial stage we are currently at. That is why I voted in favour of the resolution on the resignation of the Commission."
"The resolution sets out the course the Council should follow as it seeks to appoint a new Commission. It also clearly expresses Parliament's conviction that this crisis must serve to strengthen the political and democratic nature of the European Union."
"And this calls for a stronger Commission."
"A strong and effective Commission is most certainly needed and it must be appointed according to the provisions laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, that is to say, it must enjoy democratic credibility. Only then will the new Commission be able to assume the role of guarantor of the common interest of the European Union allocated to it in the Treaties, and become the driving force behind the European integration, taking us closer to the global Europe we are striving for."
"I voted in favour of the joint resolution on the resignation of the Commission since I agreed with it in its entirety, especially paragraph 8 calling for an ambitious and thoroughgoing programme of radical reform, which obviously presupposes an authoritative Commission, beginning with its President."
"Paragraph 7 should be interpreted in this light too, from the perspective of a Parliament which, while recalling the need to respect the Treaties scrupulously, calls at the same time for a rapid decision and a convincing solution."
"I therefore hope that the Council of Ministers in Berlin, taking up these suggestions, will reach agreement on the designation of a Commission President who will measure up to the task of providing a competent and representative government for the Union, so as to find a lasting solution which will guarantee a period of stability and reform."
"The Commission must now consider carefully what administrative reform, as insisted on by the European Parliament, really means in practice."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam requires the Commission to draft a new regulation concerning public accessibility to European Union documents."
"This must not be left to one side; indeed, in the light of the events of recent weeks, it is even more important that the Commission should produce its proposal promptly."
"The regulation must carry guarantees that the people of the European Union should be entitled to the maximum possible access to the documentation of all the institutions of the Union."
"On a recommendation by the Green Group, the European Parliament today resolved that there should be a substantially larger number of women members in the new Commission."
"At present a quarter of the members of the Commission are women, which cannot be regarded as satisfactory if we consider the new provisions in the Treaty of Amsterdam that emphasise the importance of equality."
"It is important that the new Parliament in June should have a real chance to participate in the appointments process for the Commission, and that it should have a free hand in helping to choose a Commission that it favours for the next five-year term."
"In view of the contents of the experts' report and the findings of the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Court of Auditors, the resignation of the Commission was inevitable."
"The question now is what conclusions we should draw."
"In our opinion, the Commission has failed on two counts: it has been found guilty of nepotism and of mismanagement."
"On the grounds of nepotism, the Commission had no alternative but to resign, and in the light of the mismanagement, the Commission's future role needs to be reviewed."
"In future, the number of tasks assigned to the Commission should be reduced."
"Part of the Commission's present work could be carried out more effectively by the Member States themselves."
"The Commission should not concern itself with detailed regulation in areas where it lacks the necessary national authority."
"Consequently, we do not support the resolution when it calls for a strong Commission for the European Union."
"In spite of this, however, we have decided to vote in favour of the resolution."
"We voted against the Lehne report."
"The EU is coming increasingly to regard refugees and asylum-seekers as a threat to national security."
"In general terms, the number of countries whose citizens are required to have visas to visit the EU is growing."
"In addition, more vigorous action is being taken against asylum-seekers with false identity papers."
"We are increasingly turning away refugees on those grounds alone."
"'Shedding' one's identity is not a simple matter, but something one is forced to do when different escape routes are being blocked."
"We voted against the Evans report on a European Student Card."
"In Sweden we have a student identity pass which works very well and is issued, free of charge, to all high school and university students."
"The card is self-financed and is distributed by local student unions."
"Cards are also available from international non-profit-making organisations, such as the ISIC pass."
"The Left Party fails to see why a common university pass would be any better than the existing European and international student cards, and would stress the importance of ensuring that the EU does not curb the vitality and enterprise of the student movement and other non-profit-making organisations."
"One of the issues raised in the report is how to make it easier for students to avail themselves of student discounts."
"The rapporteur believes that the Commission should carry out a feasibility study into whether this can best be achieved by introducing a common student card or by a European logo on existing cards."
"We agree with the content of the report and its conclusions."
"Regardless of the method chosen, we nevertheless feel that it is important to extend the system to students outside the Member States."
"Furthermore, we would point out that we do not support some of the reasons given for introducing a student card in the future."
"The report states that a student card might turn out to be a good way of creating a common identity for European students."
"Basically, we are sceptical of any policy that aims to create an identity for people."
"Mr President, let me too begin by saying that I sometimes find the voting goes too fast."
"I did ask for the floor during the vote, but unfortunately the President did not notice."
"That is why I want to say right away that I mistakenly voted against Amendment No 19 by the I-EDN Group on the joint resolution on the resignation of the Commission and the appointment of a new Commission, although I had in fact intended to vote for it."
"But let me turn now to my oral explanation of vote."
"Even at first reading of this report, we voted for the new Leonardo II programme."
"We did so because the principle of lifelong learning must of course be supported and must be implemented by means of practical measures."
"A particularly positive aspect of this report are the amendments to the accompanying measures."
"The introduction of concrete spheres of responsibility and the possibility of employing temporary staff are first steps in the right direction."
"We firmly support these amendments, and this is also why we voted for this report."
"The operational implementation of the third pillar, to combat all forms of international organised crime, is vital if public opinion is to support European integration, of which the single market is one of the essential elements."
"The single market means the free movement of people, goods and services."
"Under no circumstances can it mean the free movement of traffickers and criminals."
"It is clear that our fellow citizens will reject the idea of Europe if, rightly or wrongly, they hold the single market responsible for what they experience as growing insecurity."
"Moreover, I fully agree with the rapporteur that in addition to setting up a committee of senior police officers we should also establish a multi-disciplinary group made up of heads of police, customs and other law enforcement authorities so as to bring about genuine operational cooperation as swiftly as possible."
"Of course, a member of Europol should be invited to the meetings of this multi-disciplinary group and should play an active role in it."
"Furthermore, I also endorse what the rapporteur says when he points out that police performance should not be measured in numbers of arrests but in success in bringing criminal organisations to justice."
"While I therefore lend my support to the draft joint action as amended, I would stress that inspection operations carried out by mixed teams should not be limited to the Union's external borders (including ports and airports) but should also take place right inside the territory as often as is necessary."
"The report contains many commendable proposals for the introduction of an effective system for exchanging information and an early warning system for identifying criminal activities."
"However, police forces should not be placed under a common EU command."
"Cooperation with Interpol should be strengthened in order to prevent any duplication of activities."
"Only people who have been convicted or suspected of committing a crime should be entered in the personal data register, in order to prevent a 'register breakdown' and any possible loss of integrity, as happened in the case of Schengen's SIS register."
"I have two comments on the procedure and two on the substance, Mr President."
"On the procedural side, apart from the fact that we are discussing this report here in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg, where budgetary matters should be discussed, I would point out that in recital B of the report adopted by a majority in Parliament, we welcome the conclusions of the informal European Council in Berlin, which actually takes place tomorrow and the day after."
"I am afraid this reflects not just a straightforward timetabling error but also the fact that very often we pre-empt what goes on between the institutions."
"This proves that the way the European Union works leaves something to be desired."
"On the substance, I am astounded by what is said in paragraph 2 of the report, on the one hand, and then in paragraph 3, on the other."
"In paragraph 2, we say that the budget for the year 2000 should safeguard the prerogatives of the European Parliament."
"This is an unfortunate illustration of the fact that very often most of the Members of the European Parliament think in terms of conflicts of competences and powers, far more than they consider straightforward budgetary arguments or the interests of the taxpayers in Member States."
"Nor are these interests taken into account when we point out in paragraph 3 that the European Parliament has observed budgetary discipline over the last three years, because it adopted a budget below the level of the preliminary draft budget."
"And when we say that we have, together with the Council, recognised the need for rigour, we are forgetting that on each occasion we have increased the Council's budget."
"The rigour is not, therefore, equally distributed between the two institutions."
"It would be advisable, for example, not to carry over unused appropriations which, as indicated in paragraph 10, amount to 243 %, 142 % and 110 % of commitments."
"Genuine rigour should be exercised in the European Union - an effort required of the Member States as well."
"Mr President, it was in fact with great regret that I voted against some of the amendments tabled by my friends in the ARE Group because in principle they were certainly right."
"In justification I would therefore say that we studied this question at length in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy."
"For we are in fact looking at two things here."
"On the one hand we are looking at external security, for which we must now be prepared to give something."
"For if we leave the North Koreans to get on alone with their nuclear development, something dreadful will come out of it."
"So we have to try to become involved here and exert control."
"As for the second point, there is something we must realise: there is unimaginable misery in North Korea."
"Mr Tindemans has just been there and has reported back to us."
"It is quite atrocious, almost worse than ever seen before."
"We must find ways of providing humanitarian assistance."
"I believe that is necessary in spite of all our reservations and in spite of our abhorrence of the North Korean regime."
"We should be prepared to help a little and see if we can alleviate even to some small extent the dreadful misery of what are in other respects really very decent people."
"On the Tindemans report, like Mr von Habsburg, I should like to point out that North Korea is suffering from a serious food shortage."
"I am pleased that this is mentioned in the report, even if that is not where the emphasis lies."
"One has to ask oneself if we have got our priorities right when we choose one-sidedly to support energy development and do not at the same time at least help the starving people of North Korea."
"Not so very long ago, the Union decided to provide food aid for Russia."
"We supported that as well."
"An official request from North Korea for the same kind of help has been pending before the Commission since the summer of 1997."
"Hitherto, the Commission has said that surplus stocks of beef and veal were not earmarked for food aid and that it is not the right kind of aid from a nutritional point of view."
"However, I must say that I find it totally incomprehensible that we are investing huge sums of money through Euratom for power supplies while leaving meat to sit and rot in surplus stores, when we could in fact be helping starving people in North Korea."
"In the light of the massive inflows of migrants from Iraq and the neighbouring region, we believe that the situation demands attention, and we therefore welcome Mrs Terrón I Cusí's report."
"However, in this explanation of vote we should like to make a point which we regard as important."
"The wording in paragraph 16 to the effect that refugees should be 'looked after in a culturally similar country as far as possible' is unfortunate, as it might be taken to mean that refugees are not welcome in other countries with different cultures."
"In our view, refugees should clearly have the same opportunities to seek asylum, regardless of their own or another country's specific cultural orientation."
"The globalisation of trade and the resulting internationalisation of large and ever stronger companies, ceaselessly striving for greater competitiveness and constantly increasing profits, leads to a considerable transfer of power away from legitimate governments to major economic, and to an even greater extent financial, decision-makers."
"Although this phenomenon was previously restricted to what we used to call, not without contempt, banana republics, over the last twenty years or so it has tended to spread to our own Member States."
"It is therefore urgently necessary to establish an international political counterweight in order to restore a proper balance of power between economics and politics, a balance which today is heavily weighted in favour of the former."
"An in-depth reform of the United Nations system would really make sense here, without affecting the primary duty of the Security Council, which is still to keep the peace between nations."
"It is hardly an exaggeration to say that, like the European Union, the Security Council lacks a head and an arm."
"On an economic and social level everyone agrees that we need a mechanism for coordinating the international institutions."
"In the same vein, it would be desirable to set up a global agency for the environment and sustainable development, bringing together the various United Nations agencies which deal with these issues that are so vital for the future of mankind."
"In all cases, the activities of the international institutions should be made more transparent and legitimate."
"This is why I particularly support the idea of introducing a parliamentary dimension into the United Nations system."
"The report we are voting on today is ambitious."
"It is just as ambitious as the founding fathers of the European Union were when they reached the conclusion that there was no other solution but to unite the peoples of Europe if they wanted to stop them waging war on each other."
"The United Nations is the principal body for promoting peace and security in the world."
"It is also unique in that it has an almost universal membership - virtually every country in the world belongs to it."
"In our view, the UN should have effective diplomatic instruments at its disposal and be capable of exercising preventive diplomacy and giving early warnings in respect of potential conflicts."
"On the other hand, we do not think the UN should have at its disposal a rapid action force with military capability, and so we cannot support paragraph 8 and Amendment No 3."
"We also have reservations concerning paragraph 29, which contains a proposal to amend the UN's Charter so as to enable it to intervene in national conflicts."
"Thank you."
"Parliament has now come to the end of its agenda."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"The sitting was closed at 4.40 p.m."
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Tuesday, 23 March 1999."
"Statement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, a terrible fire broke out in the Mont Blanc tunnel on 24 March killing at least 40 people, some of whom have yet to be identified."
"The scale of this tragedy caused great dismay not only in France and Italy, but throughout the European Union."
"Although it occurred some weeks ago, I am sure I am speaking for all of us in expressing our sorrow at these deaths and our sympathy for the victims' families."
"We hope that the investigations being carried out will prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future."
"Agenda"
"The next item is the order of business."
"The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed. The following amendments have been proposed."
"Monday and Tuesday: no changes"
"Wednesday:"
"At the request of Mrs Bonino, who has to return to Brussels to prepare for humanitarian measures relating to Kosovo, I am proposing that we take the report by Mr Böge and Mrs Roth-Behrendt on the BSE follow-up before the report by Mr Herman on the functioning of the institutions."
"If this debate is not concluded before Question Time, it will be continued immediately afterwards, before the suspension of the sitting."
"If there are no objections, we shall take that to be approved."
"Are there any comments?"
"Parliament approved the proposal"
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists is asking for the report by Mrs Myller, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, on accession strategies for environment, to be brought forward from Friday to Wednesday and included in the joint debate on the seven reports by the Foreign Affairs Committee on accession applications."
"Mrs Green has the floor to present this request."
"Mr President, it seems entirely logical that this report, which is dealing with the enlargement of the European Union, should be taken with the pre-accession reports on Wednesday."
"We would ask that it is brought forward and taken at the same time"
"Thank you, Mrs Green."
"Does anyone wish to speak in favour of or against this request?"
"That does not seem to be the case."
"I put to the vote the request by the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"Parliament approved the request"
"Thursday:"
"The Group of the European People's Party is asking for the joint debate on financial services - the reports by Mr Crowley on collective investment in transferable securities and Mr Fayot on a framework for action for financial services - to be brought forward from Friday to Thursday morning."
"I would remind the House that the first item on Thursday morning is the joint debate on the two annual reports by the Committee on Petitions, in which the European Ombudsman will be taking part."
"The reports by Mr Crowley and Mr Fayot can in any event only be taken after that debate."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has the floor to present this request on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party."
"Mr President, I have just been able to have a word with the rapporteur, and as I understand it, we shall be very happy if the Crowley report and the Fayot report can be voted on in May."
"So we have no changes to make to the agenda, assuming we can agree on that."
"Our services tell me that there is no difficulty with that."
"The agenda for Thursday therefore remains unchanged, and the request by the Group of the European People's Party is withdrawn."
"Friday: no changes"
"The order of business was adopted thus amended"
"Mr Ephremidis has the floor."
"Mr President, as you have now come to the end of the amendments to the agenda, I am struck by the fact - and I think it will come as some surprise to the public that is following the debates of this Parliament - that, though the issues on the agenda are important and interesting, we are nevertheless facing a war in Yugoslavia!"
"This is a war which threatens to spread to the whole of the Balkans and goodness knows where else."
"Perhaps therefore, on your own initiative and on that of this Parliament, we should debate this issue in the presence of the Council and the Commission, since it concerns the present and the future of the people in the Balkans and in Europe."
"War!"
"Has the penny not dropped that people are being slaughtered, that a major disaster is unfolding?"
"I am not concerned about where the responsibility lies."
"We will find this out in due course and we will discuss it in good faith."
"What are we going to do to stop this threat against the people of the Balkans and of Europe?"
"Mr President, I feel very strongly about this issue, because people of my age have lived through such events. But I also feel strongly because of the position the country I represent finds itself in."
"Mr Ephremidis, we all enjoy your speeches but what you are requesting is already included in the agenda."
"On Wednesday afternoon, a debate will be held on the situation in Kosovo, following the statements by the Council and the Commission on this issue."
"This will naturally incorporate the corresponding resolutions, which are to be tabled this afternoon."
"Parliament has therefore already taken the situation into consideration."
"Civil liberties"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report (A4-0133/99) by Mr Bontempi, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on the draft action plan of the Council and Commission on how best to implement the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam on an area of freedom, security and justice (13844/98 - C4-0692/98-98/0923(CNS)); -the proposal for a recommendation (A4-0064/99) by Mr Nassauer, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on Europol: reinforcing parliamentary controls and extending powers; -the report (A4-0091/99) by Mr Wiebenga, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on criminal procedures in the European Union (Corpus Juris); -the report (A4-0141/99) by Mr Schmid, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on the draft joint action, adopted by the Council on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union, to combat child pornography on the Internet (10850/5/98 - C4-0674/98-98/0917(CNS)); -the report (A4-0185/99) by Mrs d'Ancona, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on the report, including key elements of a post-1999 EU drugs strategy, from the Council to the European Council on activities on drugs and drugs-related issues under the UK Presidency (7930/2/98 - C4-0409/98).The rapporteurs will have the floor in the order in which their reports have been announced."
"Mr Bontempi is therefore the first speaker."
"Mr President, today's sitting is an important one, not only for our committee, which has been working on these matters for months, but above all - I hope - for the European people."
"This thorough groundwork - resulting in the reports which I hope the House will adopt - for the extraordinary meeting of the European Council in Tampere, which is to lay down the guidelines for future EU policy on security and justice, is a most important contribution."
"Everyone realises that the greatest innovation of the Amsterdam Treaty - due to enter into force a few days from now, on 1 May - is the 'area of freedom, security and justice', a brand new concept which constitutes a major step forward for the Union, following the establishment of a single currency and the attempts to launch a policy on employment."
"Indeed, to involve the Union in fulfilling such fundamental requirements as freedom, security and justice is, firstly, to recognise the close linkage between these three requirements, none of which can be fulfilled without the other two - after all, freedom is only meaningful in a secure environment, based on a reliable legal system - and, secondly, to regard the Union as the appropriate framework for the protection and furtherance of such values, irrespective of individual legal traditions or practices."
"The other merit of this new and innovative part of the Treaty is that it is fundamentally, explicitly and clearly based on protection, promotion and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"By expressly recalling these principles and, what is more, setting out a procedure for calling to order Member States which fail to respect them, the Fifteen have finally laid the foundations for a European public order, for which the European Convention on Human Rights is the handbook and the area of freedom, security and justice the most obvious expression."
"Therefore, we really are facing a significant turning-point in the life of the Union. Our concern, owing to the pitfalls dotted throughout the Treaty itself in the numerous clauses and the usual complex structure, is that in order to achieve the anticipated results in this field, all the institutions will have to engage in a fully-fledged war, or perhaps battle."
"I say this because our task is complicated by the surviving distinction between the first and third pillars and of unanimous voting within the Council, plus the weakness of parliamentary control both nationally and in the EU."
"This report has already been discussed at a conference with the national parliaments, with representatives of governments and of European civil society, and a broad measure of consensus has, I believe, been achieved."
"The report is the result of intense cooperation among the political groups;"
"I should especially like to draw attention to the amendments on which we shall be voting tomorrow, almost all of them making significant improvements, put forward by Mrs Palacio on behalf of the PPE Group."
"I think we were right to work together in this way, since much is expected of us and we must uphold certain principles: solidarity - the Member States must cooperate in this field, since only by doing so and by overcoming national apathy and egoism will we achieve our aim; a commitment to transparency, which must apply to the conduct of all parties, including the Council; and, in a clear break with tradition, a commitment to full participation in the decision-making process."
"Only recently, Parliament's role - a key role in the democratic process but also a factor of efficiency - was still being ignored."
"I would say in conclusion that this report represents a call for guarantees and effectiveness."
"The Council has to understand that, when it comes to sensitive matters concerning citizenship and legality, unless there is ample cooperation not only with the European Parliament but also with national parliaments and civil society, it will be hard to make our existing array of virtual laws comprehensible and meaningful to the people."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europol will finally begin its work on 1 July, by which time approximately four years will have passed since the legal basis for a European Police Office was laid down in the Maastricht Treaty."
"For Europol these have been four difficult years during which its establishment has been delayed and obstructed, not least because of so-called national sovereignty."
"And I fear that these four years of national sovereignty have served no purpose whatsoever."
"The fact that Europol could not begin its work, however, has undoubtedly given organised crime in Europe a further advantage."
"For this reason we want Europol not only to be able to begin work on 1 July but also to be able to work effectively from this date."
"The European Parliament supports the work that is due to begin on 1 July."
"Even in its first report the European Parliament was cautiously in favour of extending Europol's powers."
"We proposed considering giving it operational powers."
"This does not mean a European FBI that could take responsibility for prosecution, nor does it mean armed and uniformed Europol officers arresting criminals."
"None of this is part of Europol's tasks."
"What we mean is that Europol should have the power to coordinate cross-border investigations responsibly and the accompanying right to issue instructions to national police authorities."
"This is the cautious path that the European Parliament has chosen."
"We are calling for this not because we are blindly demanding policing rights for Europe but because these demands are in line with policing needs."
"If organised crime is planned, organised and carried out centrally, it makes sense that we should equip ourselves with a prosecution authority that also plans and acts centrally."
"This is why we need Europol."
"Any police authorities which have the right to encroach on citizens' rights need parliamentary controls."
"Europol is currently a purely intergovernmental organisation, and as a result the European Parliament has no powers of supervision."
"Under the Treaty we are to be given only occasional and limited information, but we cannot exercise controls."
"Monitoring Europol is therefore clearly the task of the national parliaments, and I can only call upon our counterparts in the national parliaments to do their duty here."
"This is also appropriate as things stand at present."
"In the area of data processing Europol has only very limited rights of intervention, but there are now almost universal demands that Europol's rights be extended."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam, which will enter into force in only a matter of days, points in this direction."
"The President-in-Office surprised us here only a few weeks ago when he called for Europol to have operational powers to take action."
"If that is the case we must certainly review the issue of parliamentary control."
"The idea of Europol being controlled by 15 national parliaments in The Hague is totally unrealistic."
"We also do not want some parliament to be constantly looking over Europol's shoulder in The Hague to see what it is doing, as this would also be nonsense."
"However, parliamentary control means that this police unit must be placed under the responsibility of a political body that in turn must be answerable to parliament."
"This is what parliamentary control means."
"So if Europol acquires new powers - as we hope - we need a Commissioner who is responsible for Europol, and the task of monitoring this body must be transferred to the European Parliament."
"Only on this condition, rather than in any event, do we call for new rights for Europol. In other words, we call for these rights only if parliamentary control is possible."
"That is what we are insisting on in this report."
"Applause"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for many people the Internet has allowed access to a wealth of stored information."
"In social terms it could almost be described as a revolution, one in which participation in knowledge is made generally accessible."
"The Internet is therefore something positive and cannot be blamed simply because, like other instruments of communication, it is misused for the purpose of criminal activities."
"No one would dream of saying that the telephone is something bad just because criminals also use it."
"One of the criminal activities found on the Internet is the trade in and exchange of child pornography material."
"The alarming thing about child pornography is not the fact that it is pornography, in other words that it involves images of naked people involved in sexual acts."
"When this takes place among adults it is not a criminal offence."
"I find it disgusting but there are people who do like it."
"The reason child pornography has been made a criminal offence is that it involves the portrayal of real live children being sexually abused."
"That is what is disturbing about it."
"In the interest of children, therefore, prosecution must continue to be possible."
"Of course trading and exchanging child pornography material existed in the past, before the Internet was introduced."
"It is nothing new."
"But it was difficult for individuals to find a supplier since things that are against the law cannot be advertised publicly."
"What is new is the possibility, via the Internet, to supply and trade worldwide, and to do so under conditions that make prosecution considerably more difficult."
"It is therefore right that the Member States have proposed joint action, on the basis of Article K.3 of the Maastricht Treaty, to combat child pornography on the Internet more effectively."
"However, the proposal is full of phrases talking about having to look into things or referring to possible courses of action."
"Hardly any concrete or binding decisions are taken."
"This reminds me of the remark attributed to the Austrian Emperor Franz Josef, who is believed to have once said 'Gentlemen, something must be done, but nothing must be changed!' This is a good description of the present Council proposal."
"The Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs has therefore tried, by means of amendments, to make the non-binding phrases in the text binding so that there is some point to all of this."
"Secondly, there are two places where we are trying to make it possible to prosecute such acts on the Internet."
"Two problems arise in dealing with the prosecution of child pornography."
"The first is that there is no uniform protective age for children, which makes it incredibly difficult in the case of cross-border investigations."
"The second is that such material is very often put on the Internet using anonymous electronic mail, so that the image that appears in a news group cannot be traced back to the individual responsible."
"We are therefore calling for anonymous e-mail to be prohibited or at least largely restricted."
"A few comments, Mr President, to add to my report on the Council report on a post-1999 European Union drugs strategy."
"I will start on a positive note."
"For the first time, we have seen the Committee on Civil Liberties able to approve a report on drugs virtually unanimously - it was unanimous really, but for one abstention."
"That says something about the fact that, by virtue of having listened to one another over the years, we have at least made a start on taking ideology out of the debate on drugs."
"I think that is a good thing."
"In this instance it was rather easier, because as rapporteur I did not have to talk about a completely new drugs policy, but was able simply to give a verdict on the strategy first mooted under the UK Presidency."
"My committee was unanimous in agreeing with that verdict."
"To start with, we thought that under Article K.6 of the EU Treaty and given the codecision procedure, we should have been consulted beforehand."
"We thought too that the Council should have drawn on Parliament's various pronouncements on dugs."
"We have already adopted so many reports on drugs over the years that the Council should have looked at them."
"There is not really any sign that they did so."
"We thought too that account should have been taken of the findings of an evaluation study, because we now have the excellent monitoring centre for drugs."
"How can you draw up a new strategy if you have no idea what the effects were of the old strategy followed between 1995 and 1999?"
"So we were highly critical on that count."
"Stranger still is the fact that the Commission will be unveiling its 2000-2005 action plan on drugs any day now, when we in Parliament do not know exactly what the relationship is between the Council's plan and that of the Commission."
"From what I have heard, the Commission plan is in any event more ambitious than that of the Council."
"I hope that will prove to be the case; it is the impression I have formed from one thing and another."
"These criticisms have of course prompted us to make a number of recommendations."
"We think there has to be better coordination of policy on drugs, and our committee has adopted an amendment to the effect that in the near future we want to see a Commissioner given responsibility for coordinating drugs policy within the Commission."
"I think the current Commissioner will also have had a hard time of it, given that the responsibility was spread so widely."
"Both for us and the Commission, it would have been better if just one Commissioner, Mrs Gradin for example, had been the Commissioner responsible for coordinating policy on drugs."
"A second recommendation I would mention is that we feel strongly that better use should be made of the European monitoring centre."
"I find it absurd that the Council does not draw on research findings."
"And it would be a good idea, now that the Council and the Commission - perhaps both of them - are drawing up a new and coordinated strategy, if meanwhile we were to build in fixed reference points, reference points which will allow us to see later whether the strategy has worked well, in which respects it did not work well or worked poorly."
"We have also advocated better and more intelligent use of the UNDCP in providing substitute crops, not by destroying drug harvests in third world countries, but by adopting an integrated approach to development which offers a real alternative to poor people in those countries."
"There are some good examples of this."
"Lastly, we have done our best, myself as rapporteur but above all the committee as a whole, to strike a balance between prevention and information, reducing the risks to health and the opportunities provided by a coordinated approach on justice."
"In accepting amendments, I am keen to preserve that balance."
"So I shall not comment on whether or not I like some of the amendments."
"I think the balance we have struck needs to be preserved in the plenary too - a balance which will be established in practice if the Member States can pool their practical experience as far as possible."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur, Mr Bontempi, talked today about weak points in the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam which affect the implementation of the Schengen Agreement."
"The Committee on Institutional Affairs, on whose behalf I am speaking here today, sees these as much more than weak points. In fact, it sees them as critical developments for civil rights, the rule of law and the role of Parliament in the area of internal security."
"I believe it is important to draw the attention of the House to this today."
"Our criticism applies even to the way in which Parliament is being consulted, which is unfortunately nothing new."
"The Commission shows little intention of involving Parliament in any serious way in this vital issue."
"In a letter of 9 December 1998 we were asked to deliver an opinion, but the Council of Justice Ministers had already adopted the action plan on 3 December."
"Here consultation becomes a farce, and the inclusion of Parliament nothing other than a pretence."
"Our second criticism concerns the Treaty of Amsterdam itself, which says little or nothing about the institutional framework in which the freedom of movement for persons is to be realised."
"On the implementation of the Schengen Agreement there is merely a protocol."
"The crucial question of whether the Schengen acquis should be incorporated in the first or third pillar, in accordance with Article 4 or Article 6, has not been settled."
"This has serious implications for the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and for Parliament's right of codecision after five years, and there are also serious implications for the budget."
"The whole question of the legal status of Schengen has not even been settled yet."
"As the preparations show today, the Council seems to have no desire to choose the democratic, constitutional method, with the full involvement of the Court of Justice and the European Parliament."
"I believe these are not weak points but truly dangerous developments for the rule of law and for democracy."
"Mr President, my colleague Luigi Florio was to speak as the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights but as he is not here, I shall speak instead."
"I am going to be somewhat more positive than my colleague Mr Voggenhuber and I am also going to mention a point that was raised by Mr Bontempi. Indeed, I would like to thank Mr Bontempi, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, for his cooperation, and in a moment I will also have the opportunity of thanking him on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party."
"Mr Bontempi said that what we are dealing with is a very complex structure."
"What this actually means is that we have to incorporate Title IV on visas, asylum and the free movement of persons; a substantial part of what remains under the third pillar; the Schengen acquis through the relevant protocol; and the special protocols."
"It could not be any more complex."
"This is the major challenge we must face if - as Mr Bontempi also pointed out - we want the European Union to change for the better and become a Union that represents guarantees and efficiency, citizenship and lawfulness."
"We are ready to meet that challenge."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs stressed the importance of the following issues, which are also covered in Mr Bontempi's report: the right to a fair trial with all assurances, the guarantee of access to justice - which should include granting aid where those involved cannot afford to go to court - and the presumption of innocence as a fundamental principle of European law."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs also highlighted an issue that has been mentioned in other reports: the need to monitor jurisdiction."
"It is possible that during this very complex process, we may pay less attention to monitoring jurisdiction. We must therefore ensure that such a measure is taken and we must also demand that Parliament be given the right to exercise democratic control."
"If we do not exercise democratic control and monitor jurisdiction, we will never get past the stage where Europe is simply a market and we will be unable to rise to the challenge we are now facing."
"Mr President, we have a group of five reports and I should like to congratulate all the rapporteurs."
"They have all done a very good job in producing reports which make an important contribution to this issue."
"I should like first of all to focus on the justice and home affairs area which is covered by Mr Bontempi's and Mr Wiebenga's reports."
"They make a valuable contribution by stressing the need for the European Union to achieve a greater degree of harmonisation and of cooperation in this area."
"It is an area that has been sadly neglected compared with the great strides which the Union has made in harmonisation in the fields of economic and financial policy, agriculture, transport, the environment, etc. This area of justice and home affairs and freedom has lagged far behind."
"It is not that we want every country to adopt the same legal and judicial system - that would be absurd."
"Indeed, even within certain regions of existing Member States there are long-standing differences in the way that the law is administered and operated."
"We need much greater cooperation."
"We are facing a situation where we have a proliferation of organised crime on an international basis."
"The criminals do not worry about issues of subsidiarity and frontier controls and whether the niceties of national law versus European law are properly abided by - they operate in whatever way makes them the biggest profit and achieves their objectives."
"Unless we are able to establish a proper system of international cooperation in this area then we will not be able to deal effectively with these issues."
"This is also important in order to protect the rights of individuals."
"There is a tremendous disparity in criminal and indeed in civil law."
"There are many activities which are criminal in some countries but not in others."
"Sentencing policy varies widely."
"This is becoming more and more important as greater numbers of our citizens and residents of the European Union are working, living and carrying out their activities in other Member States."
"It is unacceptable that somebody should have fewer legal rights if they are charged with an offence in a country other than their own than they would in their own country."
"Furthermore, problems have arisen of people being held for long periods without trial because of bureaucratic delays caused by translation problems and because of the lack of proper legal aid."
"These matters must be tackled and resolved, and the reports suggest some very important and useful ways in which that can be done."
"Mr Nassauer's report on Europol has the balance right."
"We must have effective collaboration between national police forces, and the Europol Convention provides for the proper and effective exchange of information to enable the police forces of our Member States to cooperate and to act more effectively by proper interchange of information, ideas and practices."
"Without this, police forces operating in the sphere of law and order will be working with one hand tied behind their backs compared with the criminal organisations."
"One thing Parliament has always stressed from the very inception of Europol is that any international police organisation - perhaps in the course of time with operational powers, however limited they may be - can only be allowed to exist if there is a proper system of democratic control and accountability - just as we would expect proper democratic accountability by our own national police forces."
"We must respect the principle that policing can take place only with the consent of the communities being served."
"Police forces that see themselves as some kind of external force coming in to impose rules and operations which are not acceptable to the community at large will fail."
"We need good effective policing with the consent of the communities."
"Finally, Mrs d'Ancona's report on the complex and vexed area of drugs balances very difficult issues: the question of not condoning the use of dangerous drugs but, at the same time, recognising that a purely punitive approach to this issue will never succeed and that there must be proper emphasis on education, health matters and so on."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by touching briefly on Mr Wiebenga's report on criminal procedures (Corpus Juris)."
"It is an excellent report which deals with a particularly sensitive and neglected area."
"The report should be seen as a step on the road towards increased coordination of criminal law in the EU, which is something that is desirable."
"At the same time, certain differences in the Member States' legal systems must be respected in any coordination process."
"It is emphasised in the report that national legal traditions should be respected, thereby enabling the Corpus Juris project to proceed on a realistic basis."
"This debate also includes Mr Bontempi's report concerning an action plan on an area of freedom, security and justice, and I have nothing but good to say about it."
"It includes all our main prerequisites from a legal point of view."
"I should now like to move on to Mrs d'Ancona's more controversial report on the EU's strategies in the battle against drugs."
"I am pleased that we have succeeded in persuading the Social Democrats to agree that the drugs issue is sufficiently important to be discussed in plenary, so that our citizens are kept informed."
"The report specifically reflects the idea that it really is a battle against drugs - and that means all drugs."
"Such an approach ought to underlie the strategy which the Commission is drawing up."
"The very long drawn-out and intensive discussions on drugs which have taken place during the present term have shown where the boundaries of cooperation lie in this area."
"The committee has scored a notable success in that the report makes no further mention of prescribing heroin as a means of combating drug abuse."
"But nor is prescribing methadone for drug addicts a satisfactory way of helping them to overcome their dependency."
"We therefore regard the development of less addictive alternatives to methadone as a hopeful sign which should resolve the remaining political difficulties in terms of the way in which the majority in the House views the drugs issue."
"The ultimate objective is, of course, the total eradication of all dependency on drugs and pharmaceutical preparations."
"The approach of the PPE Group has been successful."
"Mrs d'Ancona, the rapporteur, has been very willing to cooperate and listen to our point of view."
"I should therefore like to praise, in particular, her perceptiveness as regards the appropriate approach to take in the area of drugs."
"The report before us today is significantly more balanced than previous proposals."
"The debate in Parliament has played an important role."
"To begin with, we adopted a very different position from everyone else, but now we have arrived at a common European approach."
"Those of us who come from the Nordic countries have succeeded in gaining sympathy for some of the basic common principles we apply in combating drugs-related problems in our countries."
"The report conveys a clear message about the actions required to reduce supply and demand."
"My long-term goal is a drugs-free society, and I believe that the fight against drugs in Europe in the future will be underpinned by the same three basic elements that we in Sweden have for so long held to be essential in the battle against drugs, namely prevention, repression and rehabilitation."
"Mr President, firstly we must thank all the rapporteurs for their work, as these reports deal with an area at the very heart of European values, namely the principle of the rule of law."
"I believe it is very important that we remind ourselves that social mobility and the integration of the people of Europe must be accompanied by harmonisation of the law."
"In my opinion, therefore, it is not a disadvantage but in fact important that we should bring our civil law and in particular our criminal law into line in response to the fact that we in Europe are living increasingly close together."
"I also consider it important that we place great emphasis on legal culture not being lost in practice."
"This applies in particular to future members in Central and Eastern Europe."
"We are already seeing in the accession talks and preparations that it is very difficult there to identify, support or promote a legal culture that allows people to live together in a common economic and legal framework and in an area of freedom and democracy."
"With regard to fundamental rights, I would say the following."
"Mr Nassauer referred to Europol."
"It is very important for us to have effective policing instruments, but they must be accompanied by judicial and parliamentary monitoring instruments."
"In my view it is not enough that only the national parliaments should fulfil this role."
"The European Court of Justice and in future also the European Parliament should have a very crucial monitoring function here."
"My last point concerns the right of asylum."
"It is very important for Europe to be open and we must ensure that asylum does not fall by the wayside."
"We must also ensure that the burden is shared fairly within the European Community."
"The right of asylum must be considered as a sacred European value."
"We will not tolerate anything less."
"Mr President, today's debate is timely as the 50th Eurobarometer report which has just been published clearly shows that concerns about unemployment are only just higher than the citizens' desire for action against drugs and crime."
"I want to say straight away that I do not support the resolution calling for the appointment of an independent European public prosecutor."
"However, it must be safe for European citizens to walk in their neighbourhoods."
"It must be safe to do business in Europe without fear of financial fraud."
"It must be safe for children to attend school without fear of being lured into drugs."
"It must be safe for children to use the information highway and not be abused by deviants using the Internet for pornographic purposes."
"Paedophilia on the Internet must be prosecuted."
"The European Union, in line with the commitment entered into in the Amsterdam Treaty, must become an area of freedom, security and justice where citizens enjoy a high level of safety."
"Next October governments will hold a special meeting to consider the establishment of a European area of freedom, security and justice."
"They must put forward a common strategy which recognises and responds to the clearly established demands of our European citizens for action against drugs and crime."
"Organised crime operates at a professional level."
"It has enormous resources and access to the latest technology, which it can use to subvert democracy and for the purposes of money laundering and fraud."
"It is essential that police cooperation in connection with Europol be extended to new areas such as counterfeiting Euro notes and coins."
"I believe that convicted drug barons should be given a minimum forty-year jail sentence in view of the fact that the European Union does not have the death penalty."
"The European Union must be equally professional and use all its combined forces to tackle these crime barons throughout the European Union."
"As far as possible serious crime must carry penalties which result in long jail terms."
"In my own constituency in Dublin only this weekend I have seen a family who have lost two young women during the last year as a result of drug abuse."
"It must be one of the priorities of the European Union to tackle drugs."
"There is no point in people coming into this House and talking about liberal proposals when you look around and see young people dying from drug abuse, while the people who import and sell these drugs are getting away scot-free."
"We must give every cooperation to Europol and do everything we can to prevent this drug abuse."
"Mr President, as the rapporteur, Mr Nassauer, has already said, parliamentary supervision of Europol's police activities of is one of the most important tasks of this House, particularly for us as politicians concerned with home affairs."
"For this reason we in the Green Group in the European Parliament consider it to be very important that Europol, as an intergovernmental organisation, does not acquire any additional powers that would be inconceivable for our national police authorities and that violate the rights of EU citizens."
"An example is the Protocol on the privileges and immunities of Europol."
"Of course we are in favour of Europol as a European authority that is necessary for the internal security of the European Union and plays a crucial role in cooperation between national police authorities."
"But we are in favour of a European authority that can be democratically controlled."
"Police activity needs to be supervised above all in areas where it interferes with civil rights, especially fundamental rights."
"For this reason we are not satisfied with the current supervision of Europol that is supposedly carried out by the national parliaments."
"Mr Nassauer has made some good proposals, which we welcome."
"But they are not sufficient."
"In our opinion it is very important that parliamentary supervision of Europol's police activities should be carried out by the European Parliament, but there are unfortunately still no proposals that would allow us to exercise genuine control."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we naturally support the majority of the points made in each of these reports, that is, the reports by Mr Wiebenga, Mr Nassauer and Mr Schmid."
"I would like to take a moment to look at the report by Mr Bontempi as, in my view, it is extremely important and it covers almost all the areas that still require work in this process of European integration."
"Firstly, as regards the communitarisation of judicial and police cooperation, all the points highlighted are of fundamental importance. These include reducing the length of asylum procedures, establishing conditions and procedures for issuing visas, moving towards a uniform visa, defining a statute for legal immigrants, and effectively combating illegal immigration."
"We are also very much in favour of the free movement of legal immigrants between the Member States."
"We will finally be able to guarantee that all decisions are taken impartially and, above all, that those most directly affected can have complete peace of mind."
"As far as police cooperation is concerned, the development of Europol and the use of databases are vital. It is also essential to eventually incorporate the Schengen information system into Europol's activities."
"However, many countries are still reluctant to allow the judicial authorities of one Member State to operate in the territory of another Member State."
"We need to resolve this issue and move towards a general harmonisation of our laws on most offences and crimes."
"In terms of creating an area of freedom, security and justice, we believe that freedom is the most important aspect, and we will have to integrate the Schengen acquis into our own operations."
"Two key objectives must be retained."
"The first will involve dealing with the crisis we are experiencing in Europe today, that is, the incidences of mass immigration, by collectively offering temporary protection on a large scale to those who are the victims of persecution."
"In any event, the right of asylum must be based, now and in the future, on the fundamental legislation we already have, in other words the Geneva Convention and the other protocols."
"Finally, as far as security is concerned, we need to combat organised crime and eradicate the living conditions that have given rise to violence in our cities and hooliganism."
"I would like to say a brief word about the report by Mrs d'Ancona on the use of illegal substances."
"It is interesting to note that it in no way calls into question the policy pursued up to now in relation to the use of these substances, which has yet to produce any convincing results, and that is the least we might say about it."
"The collective progress made have not been taken into account and no consideration given to the assessment of the experiments currently under way."
"A certain degree of caution and a conservative attitude were adopted and resulted in an agreement on the lowest common denominator."
"Realism has, however, now prevailed in favour of a multisectoral approach."
"Mr President, the report by our colleague Mr Schmid raises some very valid points and puts forward some excellent ideas, particularly the proposal to prohibit the sending of anonymous e-mail."
"However, in my opinion, this report has one fundamental flaw: it makes a distinction between pornography that is supposed to be acceptable and child pornography, which is the only type that is supposed to be reprehensible."
"First of all, it claims that the problem of identifying the age of a child is extremely delicate and that there is no solution. However, ladies and gentlemen, it is pornography itself - just like racism and other evils we quite rightly condemn - that must be looked on as an attack on human dignity and respect, which form one of the cornerstones of our democracies."
"Otherwise, how are we going to arrest those involved in child pornography who are so unbalanced as to end up actually committing the act because of having constantly watched pornographic tapes involving adults?"
"There is a certain lack of realism here and I have great difficulty in making any sense of it."
"As regards the report by our colleague Mrs d'Ancona, again I am not going to look at this matter in terms of its many economic problems and the distinction between the crackdown on traffickers, which must be ruthless, and the approach focusing basically on young people, since it is a very delicate issue as far as they are concerned."
"Instead, I will look at an aspect that, to my mind, is vital and that does not receive enough attention."
"We are told that we must look at the issue from the supply side and this is certainly true."
"But why do young people use drugs?"
"How have we failed?"
"Adults throughout Europe must examine their consciences, be they parents, teachers, social leaders or, in fact, any adults that come into contact with young people, in other words all of us."
"We must ask ourselves why we have not managed to provide our young people with reasons to live, with the desire to live, and with the moral strength to face the difficulties we all encounter throughout our lives."
"Life on earth has always been very difficult."
"There is a basic problem here that should lead us to work together and on that level. In conclusion, I would like to draw your attention to a particular point: we are constantly talking about language teaching, but from an increasingly utilitarian point of view."
"Instead, if we made literature, the great literature of all our European countries, accessible to young people once again, it would perhaps set them on the right track and prevent them from getting involved in drugs and other such behaviour."
"Mr President, the prospect of Europol as an effective instrument to combat organised crime has been held out for longer than I have been in this House."
"Yet it has still not been set up."
"The preparatory work has not yet progressed far enough to allow it to become fully operational in The Hague."
"Of course we are all interested in a functional Europol as an appropriate weapon against organised crime."
"It is generally recognised that we need an effective instrument in the fight against crime that is increasing particularly in qualitative terms."
"However, instead of vehemently demanding that the preparatory work be concluded, today we are discussing a development that goes too far and, in our opinion, in the wrong direction."
"The security aspect does not require Europol officers to be given the right to issue instructions to national officers, not does it require the setting-up of a central European body."
"For these reasons we reject the report."
"Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party and I think that at this stage we need to take a clear look at the situation."
"The European conscience is clearly experiencing a significant and undoubtedly serious crisis at the moment."
"Public opinion has developed in our Member States to the point where people now want much more than the plan that limited European integration to the completion of the single market."
"I do not think there is any doubt today that the people of Europe hope and believe that rather than being just a common market, Europe is a project for civilization."
"I did not want to have to mention the recent situation in Kosovo and the need for Europe to assert itself on the international stage, but I think that it is unavoidable."
"However, for Europe to assert itself in this way, we must ensure that Europe is clearly defined and consolidated internally: it cannot be just a market."
"The democratic process in the Member States is extremely demanding and we, as representatives of the people, must be aware that through our work, with this Bontempi report and with the four reports that are also being debated today, we must take the Treaty of Amsterdam to its legal limit."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam is clearly our legal framework, but we must take it as far as we can in terms of the legal scope it offers. And, where this is not sufficient, we must make a clear commitment to change the Treaty in order to meet what has become an obvious demand from the people."
"The Tampere summit is therefore very important, since the Member States are going to tackle all these issues at the very highest level."
"The report by Mr Bontempi is significant because it defines what we are actually hoping for in terms of the area of freedom, security and justice that is currently proposed by the Treaty."
"The Tampere summit is going to put this all into practice, and the Bontempi report sets out certain fundamental ideas here."
"I would naturally like to thank Mr Bontempi for his kind words about me."
"I must say that I had the benefit of the fullest cooperation during my work on this document and I am as proud as he is of the final result, which I hope will receive the support of the majority of the House tomorrow."
"We want to put an end to discrimination and we hope that a sense of European citizenship can be developed. We also feel that issues such as the free movement of persons, visas and immigration - and I am not going to go back over the events that are taking place at the moment - all need to be resolved as soon as possible if we want to make any progress on the objective set out in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Further, we must improve the public's access to justice."
"They must feel that they are protected by all the legal systems throughout Europe, rather than believing that, as far as justice is concerned, there is no difference between being involved in a legal dispute with a French citizen than with a citizen of any other country in the world, as someone in Spain once said to me."
"Finally, we must change our working methods and the way in which the institutions cooperate."
"These are the main issues covered in the Bontempi report."
"In conclusion, I would like to thank the rapporteurs of the other reports, which relate to the three cornerstones of freedom, security and justice, and I would stress how important they are."
"Mr President, there is something unusual about this joint debate on several reports."
"The very way in which the reports are divided gives the impression that the challenges we face are fragmented. Yet there is no doubt that we are dealing with the very crux of European integration and the European project to build a community of citizens."
"Mr Bontempi's report leaves me with the impression of a form of European citizenship that evolves progressively, almost in stages, through the positive step of establishing a number of freedoms, but also - and we have already seen this in the progress made on the free movement of persons - by creating a new category: the Community citizen who is no longer a complete foreigner in any of our countries."
"The idea of fragmentation is heightened when we see that certain concepts are ignored, particularly the concept of secularism. This is at the heart of European citizenship as defined by the Treaty of Amsterdam through fundamental rights that transcend any division into categories, beliefs, dogmas, ethnic groups or religions."
"In Europe, we are building an area of freedom and citizenship which goes further than that and which is much more important."
"That is precisely what the founding fathers of republican secularism hoped to do: they wanted to tear our people away from concentrating on their separate identities and to instead focus their attention on the universal nature of rights."
"In conclusion, I would just like to say that it is unfortunate that this basic dimension of secularism is not dealt with in detail in such an important debate."
"Mr President, the purpose of these reports is to give an interpretation of how cooperation in the European Union between police and justice authorities ought to function."
"Mr Nassauer rightly points to Europol's lack of accountability."
"I believe the answer to this lies with the national parliaments and the Council."
"Broadening Europol and giving it police powers amongst other things seems to me a very bad idea, in view of the problems we have at present with scrutiny and accountability."
"Turning to Mr Wiebenga's very clear report, the creation of an open Europe without internal borders has indeed prompted the need for partial harmonisation of our criminal laws."
"The report itself rightly says that we do not want a European penal code."
"Less logically, however, the rapporteur advocates a European public prosecutor's office."
"A solution which goes as far as that is not at all necessary."
"I can be brief as regards the Schmid report: I wholeheartedly endorse it."
"I have a good deal of difficulty, however, with the report by Mr Bontempi."
"In a torrent of words, he covers all manner of widely divergent issues."
"He stridently asserts that public opinion is outraged by the absence of European legislation in all manner of areas and the supposed dismantling of national legal systems."
"The fact that he quotes this as a cause of organised crime and social problems is truly appalling."
"There is no pressing public demand for something like European citizenship."
"For freedom, security and justice, yes."
"The way that is achieved is of little interest to most people."
"To say that it can only be achieved through European policy is simply daft."
"Another example is a Union charter of human rights."
"The point of this completely escapes me, unless you want a European constitution as the first step towards a European state."
"There is much more I could mention, but suffice it to say that I shall not be voting for this text, which is one-sided, in some parts strident and in any case muddled."
"Mr President, the Austrian Emperor's remark quoted by Mr Schmid is a very appropriate description of the draft joint action by the Council to combat child pornography."
"The amendments tabled are therefore a significant improvement."
"The increasing and totally unrestricted distribution of contemptible paedophile images and activities via the Internet is turning modern information technology from a blessing for humanity into a curse."
"Professional crime in the area of child abuse and misuse of the Internet can only be combated successfully if the EU takes joint action and if the Member States in particular cooperate more closely with each other and with third countries."
"However, for this is it necessary to harmonise certain concepts in criminal law such as age limits, otherwise totally absurd situations can arise."
"For example, a German national sentenced in Belgium to five years in prison for child abuse is currently living freely in Germany and cannot be extradited because the crime he committed in Belgium is not an offence in Germany because the age limits in the two countries are different."
"Mr President, I should like to concentrate on the d'Ancona report, and I will begin by thanking the rapporteur."
"We have had many debates here on drugs, some of which have been extremely intensive and emotional."
"I must say that the d'Ancona report is a great improvement on the reports we have discussed before."
"In my view, it prepares the ground for an objective discussion on a future drugs policy."
"It does not mean, however, that in future there will be agreement on all the details."
"I do not think that will be possible, since we all come from different countries with different traditions."
"In my opinion, for example, we sometimes set too much store by 'harm reduction', while I would prefer the emphasis to be placed on timely intervention and preventive actions."
"However, I have to acknowledge that I agree with nearly all the rapporteur's views, for example that one of the Commissioners should be given the task of trying to find alternatives to imprisonment, which has already been shown to be an unsatisfactory solution to drugs-related problems."
"I also think that we should carry out an evaluation of the methods currently used to deal with the problems - we know that some methods are better than others, but there has been no proper evaluation."
"Finally, I think we should be proud of one particular matter where the joint efforts of Parliament and the Commission have met with success during this period, namely in combating synthetic drugs."
"If we have achieved anything through our common efforts during this parliamentary term, then it is to have begun this very important task of combating synthetic drugs."
"I should like to thank my colleagues in both Parliament and the Commission for that."
"Mr President, what we are really doing today is holding a security debate in two blocks."
"In the first block I would like to look at the problem of drugs."
"There is a simple reason for this: currently more than 5 million young people in the European Union are taking synthetic drugs."
"Overall, it is clear from all the reports that drug consumption and the trade in drugs are unfortunately increasing spectacularly."
"We need effective anti-drugs strategies in the European Union, but our problem here is that because we try to do so many different things as part of our strategies people do not always really know what is going on."
"The anti-drugs strategies come under three pillars; we have several action plans and a variety of reports on the drugs problem."
"We urgently need to adopt a single position and recognisable strategies."
"I would like to address a number of points which I believe are essential."
"Firstly, we should send out a signal by trying where possible not to talk about drugs strategies but about anti-drugs strategies."
"This also applies to all reports on the subject."
"Secondly, we must support what we have decided here in the long term, in other words in future there must still be no liberalisation or legalisation of the production, sale or consumption of drugs."
"The future of the European Union must not be one where hashish is sold in tobacconists and heroin is given on prescription."
"This must never become a reality for us."
"Thirdly, we must remove ideology from our drugs debate."
"We need pragmatic, effective solutions ranging from prevention through repression to support for addicts."
"However, I think that we should concentrate our prevention efforts on schools, because there we can reach all the young people of the European Union."
"I would propose yet again that we should promote voluntary measures, and the Commissioner has also kindly promised support here."
"So schools in Europe should be declared drug-free zones on a voluntary basis."
"Cooperation with the chemicals industry, for example in combating precursors, should be improved and increased."
"With regard to repression, the aim must be to extend Europol, support the police, promote judicial cooperation and generally to introduce help for addicts."
"Finally, Europe must be seen in all its strategies to be a Community of security."
"I have no fears in this respect when I look at reports such as those by Mr Nassauer and Mr Wiebenga."
"These call for strong measures and I am hoping for further strong measures at the Tampere summit."
"Mr President, this can be said quite simply."
"The idea of introducing a common European public prosecutor should be scrapped."
"We should not have a common European criminal law or public prosecutor."
"We can fight crime just as effectively with the existing instruments, including Europol and the convention on extradition and mutual judicial assistance."
"We can easily strengthen cooperation between Member States on investigations and the pursuit of justice, without necessarily having completely uniform rules and a European public prosecutor."
"We should not harmonise for the sake of harmonising, and in fact the differences between the criminal laws of the Member States are not so great that they cannot be overcome by using existing intergovernmental instruments."
"We can easily ensure effective investigations without handing them over to supranational authorities."
"Europol is a good example of the fact that this is possible, and Europol should remain intergovernmental."
"It must not develop into a European police authority with operational powers."
"The Nassauer report proposes that Europol should be put under the direction and control of the Commission, with strengthened supervisory powers for the European Parliament."
"That is a very bad idea."
"Formally speaking, parliamentary supervision of Europol is well placed in the hands of the national parliaments, although one might doubt that they themselves are aware of it, so it is perhaps a good idea to also report to the European Parliament, which takes its supervisory role seriously."
"Control of personal information is well placed with the national registration authorities."
"Europol is a form of intergovernmental cooperation and, fortunately, the Amsterdam Treaty excludes any proposal to make police cooperation supranational."
"Mr President, we all agree that supervision by Parliament of what takes place under the third pillar is important."
"I only know that this has been very difficult to achieve, especially when we only have 'soft' rights to exercise control."
"I have often been extremely irritated by the fact that we look at recommendations which have been dealt with by a Council working group, but it turns out that our first chance to discover what they really mean comes at the implementation stage."
"I feel that the same issues will come up again in relation to telephone tapping."
"In this respect, the Council's attitude is very important; our rights should be respected, and we should be given enough time to be able to have our say."
"One such recommendation, which is now on the point of being implemented, concerns reversing the burden of proof in respect of the seizure of property that has been criminally appropriated."
"I am concerned that the rules which apply here are rather 'soft' and can be used in a way that infringes people's rights."
"Even in my own country, Finland, the recommendation is in the process of being implemented."
"Mr Bontempi, the rapporteur, would also like us to explore the possibility of having a European 'Charter' on human rights, to be drawn up by the Union."
"The German Presidency has also mentioned such a possibility."
"I would say to you: let us investigate this by all means, but we should proceed with caution."
"I do not believe we need any new instruments, but instead should implement those we have more effectively."
"I should like to see the European Social Charter become part of the acquis communautaire , as well as the existence of effective mechanisms for following up on this."
"Finally, like everyone else here, I hope that the extraordinary summit in Tampere in Finland is a success and that we come up with concrete decisions."
"We do not need lengthy action programmes, but we do need concrete and balanced measures that will be of benefit to ordinary decent people."
"Mr President, when the Treaty of Amsterdam becomes effective next month the Union will have a lot more scope than at present to act to ensure the single market can work effectively."
"This is a good thing, but the problem is that the Member States have not up till now had a clear enough vision of how cooperation under the third pillar might be more effectively developed."
"For example, there is an inexcusably wide difference in standards among the Member States when it comes to surveillance of the Union's external borders."
"The problems that are rife in the single market, such as drug trafficking, the growing availability of illegal drugs and trafficking in human beings, and the contributory cause of all such problems, which is the less than perfect way surveillance is carried out on the Union's external borders, all call for Europol to play an even greater role in the future than is provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Europol cannot be allowed to remain just a bureaucratic central agency."
"If cooperation between the police and the customs authorities cannot be made closer, the future is hardly rosy for the single market, especially as the Union's future enlargement to the east will in any case mean extra pressures and totally new challenges with regard to the surveillance of the Union's external borders and our efforts to combat organised crime."
"Mr President, tonight's debate has shown how much still remains to be done in the area of justice and home affairs."
"The new Treaty will soon enter into force, providing us with an ambitious goal to work towards, namely to preserve and at the same time to develop Europe as an area of freedom, security and justice."
"The combined concepts of freedom, security and justice provide a clear and simple indication of the direction for our future work."
"Cooperation should relate to the conditions governing people's everyday lives."
"At the same time, there is the difficulty that so many different spheres of activity are involved."
"Our goals therefore have to be tailor-made to fit each individual area of cooperation."
"It is a delicate task which I hope will be one of the main topics for debate at the Tampere summit in the autumn."
"The Bontempi report makes an important contribution here."
"It serves to confirm that we have to become accustomed to thinking of Europe as a common judicial area."
"In particular, I welcome the fact that Mr Bontempi, in his report, has stressed the rights of the individual."
"The new Treaty brings advantages in a number of different areas."
"Schengen, for instance, becomes one of the Union's areas of cooperation, hopefully making the free movement of persons a complete reality at last for the people of Europe."
"Freedom within Europe cannot be reserved exclusively for European citizens."
"It must extend to absolutely everyone who lives in or lawfully visits our countries."
"This is an important message with potentially far-reaching implications for all future cooperation."
"I hope that Parliament takes the same view."
"Furthermore, freedom implies more than just being able to move around freely."
"Freedom also means being entitled to live in a society where there is effective intervention against those who consider themselves to be above the law."
"The European idea therefore continues to be that all the Member States should have confidence in each other's ability to deal effectively with serious organised crime, for example."
"That is largely what Europol is about."
"Its mandate is a broad one, and we have created the long-awaited instruments for combating organised crime."
"Mr Nassauer, in his report, points out that Europol's operational powers need to be extended, and quickly."
"I agree that in the long term, Europol should be given powers that would make collaboration between police and customs authorities in the Member States as effective as possible."
"The Amsterdam Treaty offers precisely this possibility."
"Hitherto, it has been a question of Europol exploiting its current mandate to the full."
"The organisation's credibility depends to a large extent on the added value which the police and customs authorities in the Member States see in their cooperation activities."
"The benefit derived from Europol stands in direct proportion to the number of crimes solved, in which context it can be said that the support provided by Europol has taken the work forward."
"Another issue concerns how the organisation is to be supervised in the future, and in this respect the different Member States have different experiences."
"When a new Treaty comes to be drawn up, this aspect should without doubt be one of the main issues."
"When we talk about fighting crime, we are also talking about judicial cooperation."
"When the work of the police and customs has been completed, it is time for the prosecution services, the lawyers and the courts to play their part and the differences in criminal law in the various Member States then become relevant."
"What is regarded as a criminal offence in one country is not necessarily regarded as such in another."
"For instance, there are variations in what constitutes organised crime, or in the definition of a child in terms of sexual exploitation."
"Moreover, there is not enough cooperation between the courts."
"Among numerous examples, fraud is an important area in which the situation has been exploited by those engaged in organised crime."
"I therefore agree with Mr Wiebenga that we must find a solution to the problem."
"Quite simply, we have to plug all the loopholes that exist."
"In my view, we should first of all try to agree on the types of crime that should be regarded as the most serious in all the Member States."
"Corruption, trafficking in persons, drugs smuggling, rape, the sexual exploitation of children and terrorism are examples of crimes which should carry uniformly harsh penalties."
"In this respect, the Amsterdam Treaty provides a chance to agree at least on a set of minimum rules."
"It is also essential that these rules operate in an internationally organised judicial environment."
"It is a question of ensuring that our judicial authorities work effectively together, in spite of the differences that exist."
"This would make legal systems more genuinely accessible to people, irrespective of which Member State they happen to be in."
"The Wiebenga report on criminal procedures (Corpus Juris) puts forward a model that would enable the different judicial systems within the European Union to work together more effectively."
"Central to the report is the protection of the Community's financial interests."
"The report proposes, amongst other things, a far-reaching harmonisation of criminal law in this area."
"It also contains a proposal for the establishment of a European public prosecutor to deal with crimes affecting Community financial interests."
"The Corpus Juris model is certainly ambitious, and many would say unrealistic."
"For my part, however, I think it is too early to dismiss Corpus Juris."
"Instead, we should await the results of the follow-up study."
"I agree with the rapporteur that in any event there is good reason to strengthen cooperation between the prosecution services and examining magistrates within the Union."
"In the last few months, we have been shocked by the number of instances of child pornography on the Internet."
"Boys as well as girls have been subject to exploitation of the most heinous kind."
"Our concern for these children should lead us to take forceful action against such crimes."
"It is also, however, a question of cleaning up the Internet."
"We must as far as possible rid this unique communication and information network of all child pornography."
"The Schmid report describes the difficulties involved."
