"Text"
"My intention is therefore to propose what in German is called 'ein Vorschlag zur GÃ¼te ' , an idea that can cut corners, to counter the feeling of frustration and powerlessness that national parliamentarians often feel towards European construction."
"To the extent that we are in a system of delegation of powers, this is only a rightful reversal whereby those who delegate also have the means of checking whether or not those powers entrusted to Community bodies are effectively used properly and in the framework of the delegations accorded."
"It is therefore essentially to avoid the undesirable inflation of a blank cheque that I am proposing that the national parliaments should become parties to the European Union's jurisdictional system, alongside national governments and the Union's institutions."
"The main quality of the Neyts report is the interest that it takes in the main function of national parliaments in the European Union."
"As parliamentarians we should acknowledge that the citizens are, above all, attached to their national parliaments because they are close to them and have a historic and traditional role to play in their countries."
"That is why, if we want to strengthen democracy within the Union, we must as a priority seek to enhance the role of national parliaments in the European system."
"Although strengthening national parliamentary controls over European legislation is up to the parliaments themselves, a certain number of measures could be taken at European level in order to increase their involvement."
"For that purpose, the Neyts report contains a large number of precious ideas."
"We welcome the fact that proposals such as improving the information of national parliaments in terms of European matters should be taken up in the protocol on the role of national parliaments presented by the Dutch Presidency, with a view to the Amsterdam Summit."
"We also note that the report does not sufficiently take into account the lack of democratic legitimacy of the European Parliament."
"Too much is expected of the strengthening of the EP's powers."
"Although the European Parliament is elected directly by the citizens, increasing the role of the European Parliament does not narrow the gap separating the Union from the ordinary people."
"Ordinary people are hard put to identify with a parliament in which national political pluralism has difficulties in breaking through and where linguistic barriers prevent a genuine political debate from taking place."
"Consequently, an effective democratic representation of a genuine diversity of citizens, languages and cultures in the European Union in Brussels and Strasbourg will remain problematic by definition."
"As a result, the European Union's political agenda should limit itself to tasks with obvious added value in terms of the national approach."
"That will be the best way of helping to bring ordinary people closer to European policy and filling in the democratic deficit."
"Madam President, the rapporteur, our honourable colleague Mrs Neyts, whom I warmly congratulate from the other side of the barrier on her report which I disagree with, is wrong according to me when she states that the democratic deficit can notably be combatted by granting this institution, the European Parliament, greater powers."
"I think that the European diversity of peoples, languages, cultures and political systems is so great - and I think that this diversity is a wealth that should be defended - that increasing this institution's powers or that of any other federal institution would only contribute more to the grey areas."
"I note, for example, in my country, Flanders, that all the political parties in the Flemish parliament are opposed to introducing the right of vote to all Europeans."
"The protest of the whole people is not taken into account or even respected in the European Parliament."
"That is a very good example of the democratic deficit in my view."
"That is why I recommend in particular maintaining all Member States' right to veto in the hope that my country, Flanders, can as quickly as possible become a Member State of the European Union in its own right."
"Madam President, there is, we know, a kind of ill-feeling between the national parliaments and the European Parliament."
"The former complain that they have been relegated to the rank of chambers for rubber-stamping decisions taken elsewhere, including the European Parliament."
"The latter wants to preserve and even increase its democratic powers, something often taken badly by the national parliaments, which are afraid of losing even more of their own powers."
"Faced with that ill-feeling, I think that the Neyts report is an excellent clarification of this issue and shows that the European Parliament and the national parliaments have the same fight to fight: that of democratizing Europe."
"This report shows above all that instead of rivalry, we should talk of complementarity. The national parliaments have an enormous wasteland to cultivate."
"It includes all of the Council's legislative activity, that of the national governments and the whole area of intergovernmental cooperation."
"Having sat in my national parliament before becoming an MEP, I can testify to the difficulty faced by national parliaments in committing themselves to European politics."
"Apart from the small number of MPs very much committed to European politics, most national MPs are barely interested in it, not for lack of political will, but for a whole set of practical reasons."
"Often, the national parliaments have neither the time nor the means to follow the development of European issues."
"Many things are complicated, bureaucratic, in Europe, and the simplification of the Treaty, we can predict, is not going to be done straight away."
"Transparency has never been the key word of European construction."
"All that could facilitate the work of national parliaments should be done, but I should like to put people on their guard against a recent trend in certain countries, in certain national parliaments, which consists in wanting to create a new institution out of the national parliaments."
"Adding to the number of assemblies has always been a democratic retreat rather than an advance, as each assembly tends to develop its own lease of life and wants to assert itself to the detriment of the others."
"Let us find ways of understanding each other, cooperating, respecting each other's competences, facilitating our respective work."
"Once again, Mrs Neyts' excellent report is a major contribution to that."
"Mr President, I cannot help getting the impression, when I travel around, that there are two Europes."
"There is a Europe of the institutions, i.e. the Commission, the Council of Ministers and Parliament, on the one hand; on the other hand, there is the Europe of the people."
"I feel that here too, on the eve of the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference in the Netherlands."
"Thus the problem of understanding the interests of the general public is still there."
"Also, what is often called Eurospeak, now as ever, acts as a barrier to ordinary people."
"The language of the EU hardly catches the imagination, and it is full of acronyms of all kinds."
"One sometimes gets the impression that the institutions are in some spaceship far above the earth, communicating with one another in a special coded language."
"We can pick it up here on earth, but cannot understand what it is about."
"It is full of terms like subsidiarity, variable geometry, comitology and the like."
"The result is that people find it uninteresting and sometimes downright annoying."
"That is the reaction in news offices wherever you go."
"Precisely in such a context it is important to highlight the role of the national parliaments: quite simply, they need to discover Europe."
"The national parliaments are after all closer to the people than the European Parliament, so the obvious thing is to use the national parliaments to make the whole system more relevant to the people."
"As has been so forcefully pointed out here today, it is necessary."
"And I say all of this in the recognition that what we regard as national home affairs policy has in crucial respects also become European home affairs policy. Precisely as an extension to this recognition, it is important to involve the national parliaments in the European context, so that they do not just hover out there like satellite stations."
"Hence my support for this report, which is a good and practical contribution to strengthening the role of the national parliaments, also in relation to the European Parliament."
"Mr President, of a report intended to be part of the grandiose work of European construction, we expected a hymn to joy."
"Instead we have a pop song for school girls, with a fashionable refrain, repeated fifteen times over, about the democratic deficit!"
"The old parties have just discovered the summer hit for 1997, just as last year they did the same in Belgium, after digging up the bodies of four little girls - they discovered the summer hit for 1996, the breakdown of Justice and its institutions."
"Dear liberal colleague, dear compatriot, you know that it is pathetic to speak about the democratic deficit these days."
"When, for example, most European parliamentarians and federal parliamentarians in Belgium tolerate the fact that, in our country, the elections, both national and European, are systematically fixed by taxpayers' money which all parties receive, apart from mine, the Front national, by the media in Belgium where the press is free but subsidized, by the courts which ban the Front national list for the Senate for no good reason - and tomorrow, why not, the list for the European Parliament - and by the authorities which regularly throw my party's militants into prison just because they want to brush aside corrupt politicians and finally give people a say in things."
"I might still vote for the Neyts report, however, because it is even more beautiful than it is useless."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my ceterum censio has nothing to do with the destruction of Carthage."
"It is, rather, directed against the lack of transparency in the Union, its lack of closeness to the citizen and the existing democratic deficit."
"I should therefore like to offer my sincere congratulations to the rapporteur."
"Even though I cannot share her opinion on everything, I have admired her work on this report in committee - her circumspection, her sharp eye for essentials and, not least, her stamina."
"In my opinion, acceptance of the European idea - and, of course, opinions may differ as to what form that idea should take - will be crucially dependent on overcoming the problems listed in the report."
"Only an increase in democratic control, and especially a working involvement of the national parliaments, can ensure that the European idea is put across to the citizens of the various Member States."
"But the absence of these proposed improvements will mean a further increase in the existing euroscepticism, even without any contribution from those right-wingers mentioned - perhaps by force of habit - by Mr Corbett."
"Mr President, the European Commission believes, and has already stated on many occasions, that the national parliaments must play a major role in the process of democratization, in particular of the European Community."
"That is why the Neyts report is of capital interest."
"The role of national parliaments is important primarily because they have to ratify any changes made to the Treaty and they also have to approve the main decisions taken by the Council."
"Secondly, the national parliaments can help to reduce the democratic deficit by exercising democratic controls over their own governments."
"That is important in areas where the decision-making process is still essentially an intergovernmental matter, such as the common foreign and security policy, as well as justice and internal affairs where, like the European Commission, I feel that the European Parliament's role is still too limited."
"Well-informed national parliaments can play a major and useful role in the current decisive debate on European integration."
"We cannot over-emphasize the importance of involving national parliaments more closely and especially not excluding them, and thereby turning them into precious and highly thought-of allies in terms of this process."
"That does not mean to say that we should further complicate the decision-making process nor slow it down by creating new institutions and structures."
"For all of these reasons, I go along with the political message contained in the Neyts report which stems from discussions according to which a certain number of measures have to be taken at the intergovernmental conference and elsewhere in order to strengthen the role of the parliaments of Member States of the European Union and to optimize their collective influence, while respecting the single institutional framework, without creating new formal structures nor undermining the constitutional provisions or parliamentary traditions of each nation."
"I fully approve this point of view."
"By way of conclusion, please allow me to add a few words on the intergovernmental conference."
"It seems that the role of the national parliaments is to be extended by means of a protocol on two major aspects."
"First of all, national parliaments must be better informed of the Union's activities by granting - as Mrs Neyts has already emphasized - a four-week period for them to examine the Commission's White and Green Papers as well as legislative proposals."
"The second aspect concerns the consultative role of COSAC which has already been mentioned."
"This structure must be strengthened, in particular in terms of subsidiarity, justice and internal affairs."
"We think that the measures aimed at strengthening the controls exercised by national parliaments should remain principally the responsibility of those parliaments and that they can help to fulfil their role within the European Union with greater effectiveness."
"Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner Van den Broek."
"The debate is closed."
"Thte vote will take place at noon tomorrow."
"Legal and judicial area to protect EU financial interests"
"The next item on the agenda is the debate on the oral questions tabled by Mrs Theato on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control and by Mr Bontempi on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs to the Council (B4-0168/97) and to the Commission (B4-0169/97) on the establishment of a European legal and judicial area to protect the European Union's financial interests against international crime."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, these two oral questions follow on from the knowledge obtained during the hearing in April on the legal protection of the EU budget and therefore of its tax revenue."
"At the same time, they constitute an urgent appeal to the Intergovernmental Conference to adopt effective measures to combat the problem of fraud."
"That hearing produced conflicting information."
"First, there are already a number of instruments to deal with fraud, corruption and international organized crime."
"Examples include the convention for the protection of the Community's financial interests, with its first protocol on the corruption of EU officials and second protocol on money laundering."
"Other proposals are on the table, such as the high-level expert group on international organized crime and the planned joint action by the Commission against organized crime and corruption in general."
"I would remind the House of the reports by the Member States on national legislation to combat fraud, and also of the notable study of a corpus juris on criminal law and criminal law procedures, which was produced at Parliament's initiative."
"This makes it apparent that the ideal way of providing effective protection for the EU's financial resources would be a kind of European public prosecutor who could shift the obstacles to co-operation between the national legal institutions without violating the sovereignty of the States concerned."
"All these legal texts, proposals and studies show how sensitive the public is to the abuse of Community funds and to international fraud."
"But if we turn to reality, we find it both disappointing and contradictory."
"Although we have achieved a degree of protection in administrative law, through the Regulation on Administrative Penalties and on-site Inspections, we are lagging far behind in terms of criminal law."
"The convention I mentioned earlier, signed as long ago as 1995, and the two associated protocols have still not yet been ratified."
"Indeed, I fear that it is becoming more and more improbable that they ever will be ratified by all Member States."
"So these texts remain a dead letter."
"But even if all the Member States were to ratify them, that would not automatically achieve balanced protection of the EU's financial interests."
"The fact is that some Member States have let it be known that their legislation is already harmonized with the convention."
"That this is not the case is apparent from their own national reports."
"But even assuming that the convention were to be properly implemented, harmonization would still turn out to have feet of clay, because a number of aspects are not covered - such as the conciliation procedure, the limitation period, and the flow of information from administration to jurisdiction."
"Clearly, we cannot sit back and wait for the possible ratification of what is in any case weak legislation."
"Action must be taken, over and above the present framework."
"We therefore make the following demands. First, the Member States must accept their responsibility and ratify the convention and the two protocols by next year; secondly, if this ratification does not take place, the Commission should be called upon to propose more effective action."
"Thirdly, the Intergovernmental Conference should, as previously agreed in Dublin, reinforce Article 209a of the EC Treaty to give Parliament the right of codecision."
"Fourthly, the text of the corpus juris should enable the Commission to phase in proposals on criminal law and the law of criminal procedure, having due regard to aspects of constitutional law in the Member States."
"In conclusion, I appeal to the Commission and to the Member States, as a matter of urgency, to do everything possible under the existing regulations to combat fraud, so that the public -and we in this House - are not constantly being horrified by subsidy scandals, real or imagined."
"Madam Minister, Madam Commissioner, we tabled two questions to prompt this debate, which is really intended to raise another strong warning from the European Parliament about the fight against organized crime, which everyone proclaims to be a priority, yet in practice little is done and what is done is not very effective."
"I think the reasons for this glaring contradiction between what is said and what is done are now clear."
"To put it briefly, we are in the presence of an international criminal situation, and the legislative, administrative and institutional framework designed to contain it has become generally obsolete."
"To counter this crime wave we find a static and alarming situation: fifteen national legal systems which are heterogeneous in substance and procedure, and between which there is no effective and rapid communication."
"And all the vast array of treaties and administrative and legal cooperation conventions that have been signed is not worth much if these instruments frequently remain the dead letters denounced by Mrs Theato."
"So on one side there is speed and incisiveness - unfortunately on the side of the criminals - and on the other there is delay, discontinuity and inefficiency."
"So, especially after the hearing we have held, and after the strong warning that has reached us from the seven European judges who launched an appeal from Geneva just a year ago, it is clear that, given these difficulties and this powerlessness, we need to consider new instruments for a European legal area, new instruments for the European taxpayer where fraud is involved, but for the European citizen full stop in terms of the way this organized crime affects their safety."
"We have received suggestions and pointers."
"I think some of these absolutely must be kept in mind and we must seriously think about converting them into reality, into concrete provisions."
"I refer to lifting banking secrecy when international assistance is requested, introducing rules which would allow a European judge to talk directly to his colleagues, without going through tortuous, lengthy and wearisome procedures, and the importance of new common types of offence, especially where economic crime is concerned."
"In truth we have adopted plenty of instruments in recent times."
"I want to mention, over and above financial interests, that something interesting has happened: a convention on corruption has been approved, there is the Commission's communication on anti-corruption policy in general, the Council is making a major drive against organized crime, and, amongst other things, a convention on mutual legal assistance is also being discussed."
"We do not undervalue either the content of the political importance of these acts, but - I want to stress this - without a revolution, cultural as well, which goes beyond traditional instruments of international law and also beyond the historical nationalistic inertia which characterizes the legal systems, it will be very difficult for the measures, however good, to produce satisfactory results."
"The case of the conventions is a disturbing warning: we have so many, but there they are, they lie there, they await ratification, they are not operational."
"So I think the moment has come, with these questions, with this debate, but above all faced with the appointments which await us - the ratification of the conventions, but most of all the Intergovernmental Conference and then the opportunity offered us by the corpus iuris - for a great qualitative leap. It is time to move from declarations, from statements, to action."
"Legality and protection, both of the taxpayer and the citizen as such, themselves indicate the path we must follow."
"There are four courses of action, which are clearly contained in the motion for a resolution."
"The first is reform of the third pillar: it is not very democratic and it is not very effective either."
"We expect important results from Amsterdam on this, although the text we have seen is certainly far from satisfactory."
"The second is an extraordinary initiative that this Parliament is ready to take to obtain ratification of the outstanding conventions."
"The third is experimental, at least as regards the financial interests of the Community: drafting common legislation on law and criminal procedure contained in the corpus iuris ."
"Here too it should be stressed that this must operate with every democratic guarantee, the guarantee of parity for the prosecution and the accused, but certainly something must be done in the direction of common legislation."
"The fourth is giving the UCLAF the functions of coordination and technical support to the national legal authorities."
"These are the four courses of action that the European Parliament is indicating."
"We are not a Parliament which just complains, we are also a Parliament which believes it has practical proposals to make on these issues."
"Madam Minister, Madam Commissioner, please give serious consideration to the results of this debate and vote."
"Debates have been held in the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs on setting up a legal area which would protect the financial interests of the European Union against international crime."
"Members of the European Parliament, Mrs Theato and Mr Bontempi, have asked questions on this subject."
"You are emphasizing - rightfully - to what extent we need to combat fraud within the Union."
"I support your position."
"This fraud costs millions of ECU every year and it is the Member States and Union citizens who pay."
"The Council and European Parliament support each other in the fight against fraud and crime."
"The Council therefore thinks it is important to ensure a permanent exchange of ideas between the Council and the European Parliament."
"Such an approach would be stimulating for both institutions."
"During the Dutch Presidency, this exchange of views has been fruitful."
"I have had the privilege of discussing on several occasions with the responsible committees in the European Parliament the subject of progress made in negotiations within the third pillar, and also on the ground, in the fight against fraud."
"On this score, I have fortunately noticed that the European Parliament also attaches considerable importance to this information and exchange of views."
"I am, therefore, happy to be able to discuss this issue with you here today."
"I shall also be willing to answer the questions put by Mrs Theato and Mr Bontempi."
"In my reply, I shall deal with the decisions taken under the Dutch Presidency and the Council in the field of fighting organized crime in general."
"Organized crime really is a growing threat to our societies."
"It is becoming harder and harder to maintain the values that we all find so important."
"That is being blocked by the fact that crime - as we all know - is increasingly transgressing the limits of the Member States' jurisdiction."
"Criminals are helped by new technologies."
"The free movement of persons, services and goods means that Member States need to work out better methods to combat growing transfrontier crimes."
"However, we all have the impression, you and I, that we are going backwards."
"If we want to turn Europe into an area of freedom, security and justice, we must all do our best to improve prevention and fighting organized crime."
"The Council and the European Parliament must throw themselves behind that aim."
"It is also with this in view that an action plan has been worked out at the request of the European Council under the Dutch Presidency to take a European approach to fighting organized crime."
"This action plan will be subjected to the approval of the European Council in Amsterdam."
"On 28 April last, the Justice and Internal Affairs Council gave its opinion on this plan at an extraordinary sitting."
"This debate led to unanimous support for the content of this plan by the European Union Ministers responsible for justice and internal affairs."
"At this Council meeting, I told my colleagues of the importance of proper parliamentary and judicial controls when measures aimed at combating organized crime are being worked out."
"I have conveyed to you the text of the action plan and held a fruitful discussion with the Committee on Civic Liberties and Internal Affairs - as you recall - on the measures proposed in this action plan."
"It is now for the Council to urge action on working out particular points in consultation with the European Parliament."
"As you know, the action plan contains a large number of measures which should jointly help us to fight organized crime in Europe effectively."
"It goes without saying that this European approach is necessary."
"You have insisted here on a rapid implementation of Europol and I go along with that."
"I am not going to go into detail of the content of the action plan."
"You all know it sufficiently well, I think."
"However, I should like once again to emphasize the importance of this plan."
"It is a framework in which we should tackle fraud in terms of the European Union's financial resources and as such I should emphasize the foundations of the European legal area within which the Member States can cooperate in the best possible way, within the framework of their common approach to dealing with organized crime."
"The Member States ought, of course, to be assisted in this matter by an effective Europol."
"In my opinion, this is the framework and corresponding measures referred to by those two speakers."
"I should also add that they obviously know their limits, given the current structure of the third pillar."
"That also means that the Council and the European Parliament will quite frequently be discussing isolated measures worked out by the Council and I hope that there will be a constructive and lasting cooperation between the Council and the European Parliament."
"I should like to add another word about the declarations made by Mrs Theato and Mr Bontempi on implementing these measures, something I have already said on several occasions: they are, of course, fine texts but what we really have to do now is implement them."
"The Treaties must be ratified and the measures implemented."
"The States must therefore use these instruments."
"The questions put to the Council refer specifically to the fight against fraud in terms of Community funds."
"For many years now the Council has been taking a great interest in the creation of effective tools."
"This interest is reflected in particular in the multiannual work programme on cooperation in the field of justice and internal affairs."
"In other words, the Council really is taking this seriously."
"It also emerges from the fact that the most binding instrument in the framework of the current structure of the Treaty on the European Union is the conclusion of Treaties."
"It is a great advantage for the judicial practice and relevant services of the Member States."
"The precise definition of mutual obligations can only strengthen the effectiveness of that cooperation."
"However, there is a major disadvantage which has been highlighted by the members who put these questions."
"I repeat it here: entry into force depends on the state of completion of national ratification procedures."
"Of course, it is a fact that these constitutional procedures are the very basis of our parliamentary democracies."
"That is a fact, but let us make it quite clear, you really must act quickly."
"On this score, the Member States are consequently urged to speed up the ratification of the Treaty on the protection of the Community's financial interests by means of the first protocol."
"The Council has answered this expectation by going along in full with the recommendations which emerged from this action plan."
"It is stipulated in practical terms that these instruments must come into force by mid-1998 at the latest."
"The second protocol to the Treaty was examined at the meeting of the Justice and Internal Affairs Council of 26 and 27 May."
"We reached a political agreement on all the questions which were still outstanding."
"The second protocol I refer to contains regulations on the liability of corporations, criminal or administrative sanctions for corruption or fraud, sanctions applied to money laundering, the seizure and confiscation of advantages illegally obtained by means of fraud corruption and also encouraging cooperation between the Commission and the Council in this field of action."
"I must emphasize the importance of the liability of corporations, a novelty in European Union regulations."
"Consequently, this text is now ready for submission for signature and I hope that this signature will take place under the auspices of the Dutch Presidency."
"The judicial area cannot be achieved by treaties alone."
"Both speakers also emphasized that."
"The Council shares this vision which emerges from the action plan."
"I would not be fully performing my informative task unless I told you of the other achievements of the Netherlands Presidency."
"Staff of the European Community and Member States of the European Union have signed an agreement to fight corruption. They did so at the meeting of the Justice and Internal Affairs Council."
"This instrument is also a major weapon in the fight against fraud and corruption."
"Activities on the draft agreement on mutual judicial assistance in criminal affairs - another important matter - have not yet been completed but we have made substantial progress on this."
"Various detailed reports have also been drafted, for example on the Treaty on the protection of the Community's financial interests and the agreement on extradition, which should in any case make it possible to speed up ratification procedures."
"All the instruments I have just referred to are, together with the framework offered by the action plan, the best means of achieving an efficient protection of the Union's financial interests."
"In this respect, measures aimed at fighting fraud and corruption are being complemented by other measures to fight organized crime."
"There is still a lot of work to be done but this does not seem to be close to changing. In my opinion, the European Parliament is going to play a lasting role in these developments."
"Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, a great deal of work has been undertaken in recent years to improve the protection of European Union financial interests."
"The fact that the fight against fraud in the EU is now considered a clear high priority task demonstrates that this work has yielded results."
"There is no common legal framework in Europe which regulates all matters involving fraud."
"This, in itself, is only natural, of course."
"In many cases we are talking about areas where previously there has not been any particular form of co-operation at all."
"I agree with those who say that a lot can be done to improve co-operation between the existing legal systems but I am also convinced that we must be open to change where this is required."
"The agreements which have been concluded in recent years must be viewed as a big step forward in this area."
"I refer particularly to the Convention on the Protection of Community Financial Interests."
"A great deal of effort was required to reach agreement on this issue."
"I am as concerned as Mrs Theato and Mr Bontempi about the fact that this Convention has still not been ratified."
"After all, two years have passed since it was signed."
"I can assure this Assembly that I will take every opportunity open to me to remind the Member States how important this is."
"I will do this not only at Council meetings but as a general rule every time I give an interview, write an article or give an address during a visit to a Member State."
"Of course it would help enormously if you, ladies and gentlemen, would also put pressure on as many people as you can in the course of your contacts with National Governments and Parliaments."
"As you know the slow process of ratification is a problem in other areas as well."
"So far only Great Britain and Denmark have ratified the Europol Convention and only Great Britain has ratified the Extradition Convention."
"Everyone is aware that both of these instruments will have an important role to play in the future in the fight against internationally organised crime in Europe."
"So it can be very difficult explaining to people why it is taking so long for these Conventions to come into force."
"It is my conviction that the methods of working which we have at our disposal are not effective enough."
"This is also the reasoning behind the Commission's proposal to transfer everything except police co-operation and criminal law from the Third Pillar to the First Pillar in the governmental negotiations which are currently underway."
"Furthermore, co-operation on those areas which remain in the Third Pillar must be made considerably more effective."
"I have also seen, just as Mrs Theato pointed out, that there is also a proposal to the Intergovernmental Conference to give Article 209a greater force. I expect and hope, just as you do in this House, that the summit meeting in Amsterdam next week really will give us the tools we need."
"I also welcome the fact that the top level group, in their action plan on internationally organised crime, have strongly and clearly reiterated how important it is that the ratification process is finalised as quickly as possible, and that a timetable for this has also been proposed."
"This particularly applies to the three additional protocols to the Convention on Fraud on which there is now agreement and which concern corruption, notification and legal aid."
"This latter protocol was agreed, as Minister Sorgdrager said, at the meeting of the Home and Justice Ministers on the 26-27 May."
"It concerns issues such as money laundering, legal aid and the opportunity to demand accountability of legal persons."
"This would mean that the Commission, for the first time, would have a role to play in criminal law proceedings."
"Although this is only a limited role I still see this as a big step forward."
"As far as the Commission is concerned, we will of course continue to develop those instruments required to protect the EU's financial interests in the best possible way."
"We have already proposed regulations on the mutual recognition of evidence, direct co-operation between legal authorities, centralisation of the legal examination of fraud cases and the introduction of a register on fraud committed."
"All of these proposals will be raised for discussion during the Autumn."
"The 1996 report on fraud to the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament clearly shows how difficult it is to legally examine cases of cross border fraud."
"There is an obvious risk that the lack of proper co-ordination, both at a national level and between Member States will lead to such divisions that a legal trial would be impossible in practice or in any case would not give a result."
"It is precisely for such cases of cross border fraud that the UCLAF should strengthen their competence in criminal law. By introducing a legal co-ordination unit, what we would call a judicial interface, consisting of a judge, a prosecutor and other legal experts, UCLAF would be able to exercise the current well managed co-ordination role and could also have a supportive and advisory function towards the Member States."
"Mr President, the Commission will naturally examine the themes which are taken up in corpus juris, in other words in the study which has been carried out at Parliament's request and in which the Commission has been an active participant."
"The introduction of a European public prosecution function which has the right to pursue criminal cases involving the protection of the Union's financial interests is an enticing thought."
"It goes without saying that there is room for further initiatives to improve the conditions for legal aid and in the exchange of information in cases of criminal law."
"Mr President, thank you for allowing me the floor again."
"First, let me once again offer my sincere thanks to Commissioner Gradin - she knows how much we always value her support, and her resolute approach."
"Rome was not built in a day."
"But I do have one specific question for the President-in-Office, whom I also thank for her remarks."
"Perhaps I did not fully understand what she said."
"Mrs Sorgdrager, can you assure us that you expect the protocols, and the convention too, to be ratified by mid-1998, or were you referring to the protocols alone?"
"That would be somewhat unbalanced, because, in principle, the convention itself is the basis and the protocols are supplementary to it."
"Perhaps you can answer that question for me."
"Mr President, it is a fact that we have jointly agreed in the action plan that we will make sure that treaties and protocols are ratified by mid-1998. Do you want a guarantee?"
"I will have to answer that it is impossible."
"Obviously, I have no control over the procedures in the other Member States but we have reached a common agreement and I therefore hope that everyone will stick to it."
"Mr President, in terms of effective organization, the European Community's efforts to combat organized subsidy fraud is roughly equivalent to Michael Schumacher trying to win a Formula I race in a horse-drawn cart."
"This is not the fault of the European Parliament."
"There are knowledgeable Members of this House, notably Mrs Theato and Mr Bontempi, who have long been trying, with a wealth of knowledge and persistence, to make something happen."
"So this charge has to be laid at the door of the Council."
"After all, it is really endearing when Mrs Sorgdrager refers to the mutual exchange of ideas between Parliament and the Council, but I cannot help suspecting that this cosy chat will leave organized crime somewhat cold, and will certainly have no impact on its activities."
"And it costs little to talk about Europol at every opportunity, especially when the convention which is supposed to provide the basis for Europol has not even been ratified yet."
"The reason why our organization is so wretched and so detrimental to the reputation of the European Union is that we are talking here about system failure."
"We have vested the European Community with powers of disposal over money."
"But we have failed to give it the authority to defend that power of decision against abuse, by making use of the criminal law where necessary."
"That situation does not exist in any Member State."
"There, whoever has the power of disposal over money can haul the perpetrators of fraud before the courts and have them sentenced."
"The European Community cannot do that; it has to rely on the Council, on the individual Member States, to do it, and that is precisely where the system breaks down."
"For the Community to take action under the criminal law supposedly violates national sovereignty."
"Since the most important power of government, the power to distribute money, has already been transferred to the Community, it would only be logical if, in addition to that power, the Community were to be authorized to protect that money by recourse to the criminal law."
"Because any other approach is ineffective."
"We know that from experience, and from the comic if appalling example that Mr BÃ¶sch has just quoted."
"So unless we are prepared to ensure that the Community has criminal law jurisdiction to act in certain areas where it already has responsibilities, then we are always going to be impotent to deal with the criminals."
"And that is a responsibility that no one can really take."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yet again we are dealing with the scourge of fraud."
"We have set about this a hundred times over, but we have to admit that the results have been few compared with the size of the problem."
"I would even say, without irony, that the problem is so great that we cannot even assess the size exactly."
"What does fraud represent? 5-10 % of the European Union budget, according to estimates, or even more."
"Billions of ECU, in any case, which stray every year from the European Union budget."
"We know that fraud can be found everywhere, that it rots away at Community policies, especially the EAGGF but also the structural policies, the Union's internal policies, like tourism."
"The European Parliament's ad hoc committee of inquiry into Community transit, which conducted a remarkable piece of work, revealed that as the European Union's single market works it has become the favourite playground for international crime."
"So who is to blame, you ask?"
"It is sometimes hard to establish responsibilities, which lie in many quarters, but one fact seems significant to me."
"The European Convention on the protection of the Community's financial interests, signed in July 1995, has still to be ratified by the Member States' parliaments."
"It is therefore not operational and even useless."
"At best we might expect it to be ratified next year."
"Is that serious?"
"The ambitious plan for combating fraud, indefatigably demanded by the European Parliament and well defined by the Commission has broken down because the Council, by its attitude of profound inertia, opposes all progress."
"When it comes to fraud, the Council and the Member States are more concerned with protecting themselves from Commission prerogatives than with the bold deeds of the fraudulent."
"They have chosen the wrong adversary and that error will cost the European Union's finances dearly."
"The real difficulty is the absence of political will in the Council."
"It is the Member States which see to the execution on their territory of nearly 80 % of Community expenditure and they should recognize that the Union's institutions, the Commission in particular, have genuine, undeniable rights to control and intervene in the running of the Union's own resources, given that Community money is going missing."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to hope today for once that the Council will make an explicit and courageous commitment."
"Europe's credibility in the eyes of its ordinary citizens is at stake."
"Do we really want the sieve to be the image of Europe?"
"Mr President, this debate is getting to be a wearisome business - after all, it is nothing new."
"I find it depressing to hear time after time 'we hope...' , ' we believe perhaps...' , ' we expect...' ."
"Our answer from the President-in-Office today is that we will perhaps get the Convention on the protection of the Community's financial interests ratified in mid-1998, i.e. three years after it was agreed."
"I am sorry, Madam President-in-Office, but to me, it sounds like yet another in a series of poor excuses from all Council Members, including those representing both your country and mine, for having done nothing to ratify the conventions."
"The fact is that the governments are dragging their feet on the ratifications."
"It shows a lack of respect for what they themselves joined together in deciding."
"It is all very well to sit round a table and agree on something and then not bother to transpose the text into their own legislation."
"I think what we are witnessing is a show of contempt for the problems we are grappling with. This conduct is in my view disappointing, and, as things look now, when the Intergovernmental Conference is still in progress, we do not even see any signs that the governments seriously plan to do something in this area."
"We need to get a change in procedures."
"It may well be - as you pointed out, Madam President-in-Office - that Parliament has an important role to play, but our problem is that we have no decision-making power."
"If we had that, we would ensure that serious efforts were made to control fraud. But this situation is embarrassing."
"In conclusion, Mr President, I appeal to our colleagues in the national parliaments to take a closer interest in this subject and to put pressure on their own governments."
"My colleagues have already asked the vital questions."
"So I would just like to take up one additional detail."
"The basic problem is serious fraud."
"What is the reason for it?"
"I think that one important reason is that there is no sympathy for the EU and its money."
"If you go out and talk to people in EU countries you get the impression that the most important thing is to 'milk' the EU of its money and to get hold of any EU subsidies available."
"This creates an atmosphere in which any method of getting hold of EU subsidies is permissible."
"Soon the loopholes also become obvious."
"Of course this cannot be allowed to continue."
"But is the cure for this to give the EU so much more power in this area, when credibility for the EU, for Europol, for Conventions etc. is already so low?"
"I think instead that we should have a 'clear out' of some of the subsidy rubbish which exists, establish clear rules on how EU subsidies are to be granted and ensure that they are not granted so freely."
"I think that drastic action is required in this respect."
"I wish Anita Gradin good luck - her work in the EU is now concerned with managing this problem and it will be no easy task."
"Mr President, the proposals under discussion today prefigure the inclusion in the treaty of a legal base for anti-fraud regulations, to give shape and effectiveness to the political will to fight against fraud, which is damaging the Community budget in a truly impressive way."
"But in harmonizing the existing rules and Community cooperation, we want to keep our feet on the ground and ask the Commission if it really believes, itself, in the ratification of the 1995 convention, given that the difficulty of coordinating the political will of the fifteen Member States is compounded by the fact that the ratification is linked to two additional protocols, which do not relate to the responsibilities of civil servants alone, but also commit governments, Members of Parliament and institutions."
"Mr President, in expressing approval for the initiative by Mrs Theato and Mr Bontempi, I would like to emphasize the merit of certain essential points. First of all, the fact that our internal frontiers are now completely obsolete in the face of the phenomenon of Community fraud and the phenomenon of large and small-scale crime which has considerable technical and financial resources available to make crossing them easy."
"That is what makes this initiative so very important."
"Secondly, legal cooperation and even communitarization have now been superceded as regards the current problem areas, and as regards the substantial differences that exist in the legal and juridical systems of the Member States. So a European corpus iuris , a European legal area, is needed."
"But what I want to know is whether it is possible to set clearly defined criteria and responsibilities for taking criminal proceedings and whether there will still be the principle of parity between prosecution and defence."
"As long as there is, we will be creating an effective Magna Carta of rights and freedoms, as well as, obviously, security for the citizens."
"Mr President, Mrs Kjer Hansen has said that we have been holding the same type of debate for some time now which is becoming quite depressing."
"I am somewhat tempted to go along with this point of view because I think that the way in which the European Parliament deals with the fight against crime is quite different from that adopted by the European Council. It is not my intention to say that these two attitudes are wrong or that both of them are quite correct."
"You must therefore try to find a way of developing appropriate instruments in order to fight organized crime."
"'Appropriate' does not necessarily mean that everything must be put at European level but that we should at least put into practice what we have already agreed - and that is far from being the case as I said."
"From that point of view, I think and can confirm to everyone who has been looking into this problem: let us try to keep our feet firmly on the ground."
"In my view the most important - and here my reasoning is part of the current structure of the third pillar - is that we should implement our agreements and common interventions, that everyone should ratify them and when people say here that it is too slow I would say to them: I agree entirely."
"I am using all of my powers to make sure that this situation can be settled as quickly as possible in my country."
"I also know that we are not the first to deal with this situation, but I am looking into it and I hope therefore that the other Member States will do the same."
"Of course, we only have a text."
"Then we have a convention."
"We have a Treaty but it should not stop there."
"It must be implemented by means of practical measures which must be taken - this is the work of the police - in particular, on the basis of the legal possibilities created for that purpose."
"It is the system which is currently being exposed."
"Nonetheless, I hope that that will work but we are going to have to be realistic."
"The third pillar activity is quite recent."
"Since the beginning of this pillar's implementation, in other words barely three or four years ago, we have made some progress."
"Not enough, I grant you, but we must realize that some progress has been made."
"What makes me angry is to see that a majority of the over 200 decisions that we have taken have not yet come into force."
"I would like to be able to have a control system in order to monitor, quite independently, whether or not the Member States are really honouring their commitments."
"For me this is a vital point at this time."
"Fighting fraud is a very delicate matter."
"It is relatively easy to syphon off European Union funds but there is also the matter of the quality of the regulations."
"I am not only referring to true fraud but also misdirected subsidies, European taxpayers' money which is prevented from being spent as intended."
"These are also aspects that we will have to monitor to make sure that everything happens as agreed."
"Mr BÃ¶sch was obviously right when he said that fighting fraud presents difficulties. You only have to think of how to recognize everyone's proof."
"Of course, this is a problem that cannot go on in Europe."
"I agree."
"There are obstacles that we have to eliminate."
"The same goes - I am not going to repeat to this here but I did refer to it in my introduction - for mutual judicial assistance in criminal cases."
"It is, however, inconceivable in Europe that we should come up against so many procedural problems which prevent mutual assistance in criminal cases."
"I have spent a lot of time on this question."
"Unfortunately, I hoped that we were going to reach a final conclusion, but it is not the case, although we have made some progress and I would like to be able to predict an agreement on this subject around the middle of next year."
"Mr Giansily asked what the extent of fraud is."
"We ourselves do not know."
"That is one of the special features of illegal acts."
"We can never know the whole situation but we do observe what goes on and in what conditions fraud takes place."
"Mr President, I am putting a supplementary question to the Minister because I understand the concern for realism - I am a realist - but not when it becomes an excuse for maintaining the status quo ."
"I would remind him that scandals causing great popular outcry in other sectors, for example the Dutroux case in Belgium, have produced intense acceleration of the process of agreement and understanding at European level in the fight against paedophilia or the trade in human beings."
"We should not have to wait for another scandal to break: the scandal of fraud is already there."
"I really wonder whether the time has not come to make a qualitative leap."
"Everyone has said so."
"In a system which seeks to protect our resources, I ask the Minister whether or not it is realistic to face up to the problem as it is, and not as we would like it to be, in other words using methods which do not have any effect."
"I do not think that I recommended maintaining the status quo."
"All I said was that we have reached a good many agreements and established treaties and adopted decisions which have not yet been implemented."
"I expressed my dissatisfaction with this."
"This is what I wanted to say."
"There is an agreement on paedophilia, agreements on fraud."
"Now we just have to put them into practice."
"Thank you very much, Minister."
"I have received a motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with the terms of Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure ."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at noon tomorrow."
"Question time (Council)"
"Here is my answer to these two questions."
"At the meeting of the United Nations Committee on Human Rights in Geneva, the European Union will submit to a far-reaching examination its current information sources concerning the human rights situation in China in order to adopt a coherent approach in the framework of future policy, thereby taking on board the various points of view of the Member States."
"This process of evaluation of policy will take place over the coming weeks and months in the appropriate fora of the European Union's Council of Ministers, such as the Council regional working group, the Council working group of human rights, the Political Committee and so forth."
"The questions put by the honourable members of the European Parliament will be attentively examined during those debates."
"The European Parliament will be informed in due time of the outcome of the debates held in the Council of Ministers on the assessment and drafting of a coherent European policy on the human rights situation in China."
"Mrs Van Dok-Van Weele, welcome to the European Parliament."
"We sincerely thank you for giving us this official answer. I would like to put a supplementary question: what genuine instruments does the Council wish to implement in order to respond more satisfactorily to Chinese economic pressure, which is genuine pressure?"
"Can you think of any other solutions apart from setting up various committees and working groups or study groups? I think that the Chinese situation has already been studied enough."
"I would tell Mr Bertens that when we refer to assessing a policy it has to be examined as a whole."
"In the current circumstances I would not like to pre-empt the outcome of the assessment that I have just referred to."
"This was really not much of a reply from the Council."
"First of all it ought to be possible to give a proper answer to this question, which is what do we intend to do about the fact that several EU countries, including the President's own, have been the subject of reprisals from China."
"What else is solidarity for if we cannot get an answer to this question?"
"Secondly, I would like an answer to my original question on what will happen if we move further towards a common foreign policy."
"What opportunity will the smaller countries have to do as Denmark and the Netherlands have done with regard to China and in connection with the UN Commission for Human Rights?"
"The larger countries will be able to vote down the smaller countries."
"Is there a policy to cover this?"
"You must, after all, have considered this point!"
"Judging by the extremely weak and empty response which we received here, I must say that it would appear that the Council representative has not thought these matters through."
"I think that that emphasis was already laid in the first part of my answer."
"I specified the idea of taking on board the various points of view of the Member States."
"It is, therefore, a priority to respond within Europe, in the manner described, to the various points of view which currently exist."
"It would obviously be wrong to envisage at this moment in time such a consensus on a range of actions and possible political positions when no agreement has yet been reached."
"I have a question I should like to put to the representative of the Council: is the plan you have put forward, for a serious study of the human rights situation, an area where you will introduce general principles that apply equally to all?"
"Because I too often have the impression that there are some states, China for instance, which are unpopular here, so that things are applied to them that are not applied to others."
"What we need is a common European policy."
"Are you prepared to devise a European policy of that kind, which would then apply to all countries, not just one in particular?"
"In order to reach a policy and a common position we must have all of the ingredients and the basic arguments of the consensus and it is precisely for that reason that I gave you this answer."
"It is absolutely useless to anticipate the outcome of this type of study and debate since that would offer absolutely no solution to what you call a common policy."
"Madam President-in-Office, European Union relations with the People's Republic of China are complex."
"The burning issue at present is that of the forthcoming handover of Hong Kong to the People's Republic."
"This is highly paradoxical since the Chinese authorities are honouring the Sino-British agreements of 1984, whereas the British authorities have not as they have developed democracy which did not exist before 1984."
"However, the new decisions by the Chinese authorities may mean that a democratic handover of Hong Kong in respect of human rights on 1 July 1997 will be possible, if the letter of pre-existing agreements is respected."
"Does the Council intend to adopt an approach to this situation?"
"Has it undertaken any initiative in face of the decisions taken by the Chinese National Assembly on the legislation in Hong Kong?"
"I would like to, Mr President, but my answer is not yet ready."
"It is an interesting question."
"I would like to answer it later on, either during question time if that is possible or later on, in writing."
"Question No 3 by MarÃ­a Izquierdo Rojo (H-0384/97)"
"Subject: Job protection under the proposal for a regulation on the COM in raw tobacco"
"Will the Council give priority to job protection in the new regulation on the COM in raw tobacco?"
"What specific improvements has it in mind for the benefit of producers in Granada, Extremadura and other highly disadvantaged Objective 1 regions?"
"Notwithstanding the clear concern with tobacco-growing in Austria, on which the attention of certain EU institutions is so intensely focused, will the Mediterranean countries be treated fairly?"
"In response to the question on the raw tobacco COM, I would like to recall that the Council discussed the Commission report on the matter at the beginning of the year."
"That report includes an analysis of the social and economic situation of the market in question and the outcome of the reform of this regulation which took place in 1992."
"It also contains a certain number of possible scenarios for a new Community policy in this sector."
"In the light of the debate held in the Council of Ministers, I would principally point out the following points: first of all, all delegations expressed considerable respect for the Commission report and the analysis of the situation on the tobacco market contained in it."
"As far as the approach to be taken, the objectives and main elements of a reform of the raw tobacco COM, it was virtually unanimous even if some different points of view did emerge, concerning the extent of the reform and the nature of specific measures to be taken."
"Finally, Mr President, the Commission has shown considerable consideration for the comment on the basis by the delegation."
"It declared that it would study these remarks with all the necessary attention in the framework of preparations for its formal proposal."
"To conclude, the Council urged the Commission to introduce these proposals as quickly as possible, as soon as it had all of the necessary information and data, including the European Parliament's point of view on the report."
"Once these proposals have been made, the Council would obviously then have to take due account of the European Parliament's opinion on this matter."
"Madam President-in-Office, your answer was most improper."
"It is improper for the Council to answer in this bureaucratic, descriptive way to a question not referring to the report presented by the Commission but a question about jobs ."
"I want to ask the Council: What are we going to do with the southern farmers, if they can grow neither tobacco nor oliveoil?"
"My question is about jobs: what you in your speeches call 'the first priority of our policies' : jobs."
"Yet, when you are asked about a huge reform of tobacco-growing, your answer is just 'bla, bla, bla...' ."
"Do you not think that preserving jobs has to be the condition, the basic premise of any actions provided for by the Regulation to be approved by the Council?"
"Please answer that question."
"What impact is it going to have?"
"Do you have studies?"
"Have you conducted them?"
"What will the social and economic consequences be?"
"I can tell you that in Granada over 2000 families live off this crop."
"They do not live in luxury but this is their mainstay."
"How can you just answer by saying that the Commission report is 'bla, bla, bla' ?"
"You are in charge of the European Union and you are stopping the European Parliament from having any further powers."
"I appreciate the member's heartfelt arguments in favour of this cause, which does indeed deserve all of the European Union's attention and I hope that the European Union will recognize this later on, when the IGC discusses the matter."
"But I will only answer the subject contained in the question."
"It is obvious that employment is on the agenda of everything that we undertake."
"I think that an employment policy does not always have to be approached as an item in itself but should also be dealt with as a whole - otherwise, arguments are always put forward when we are dealing with the agricultural policy, to examine the available resources but also the corresponding market and labour possibilities, in the limited framework of the local and current causes of a strong competitive position and the difficult position of competitors on the market in terms of prices."
"I go along with your insistence that the Union take measures in favour of employment, but I do not agree when you say that all we do is speak and do nothing."
"That is unfair to the way in which this subject has been dealt with, and at the same time you are not doing justice to the information that I gave you in my answer."
"Madam President-in-Office, the subject of the importance of jobs in relation with the future of tobacco-growing in the Mediterranean countries of the European Union is a recurring theme in the European Parliament - I myself have already asked questions about it to the Commission and the Council. Today I wish to raise this matter again, since we now have the opportunity to discuss the COM on raw tobacco."
"This is a worrying matter for many modest families, for example in the Spanish provinces of Granada and CÃ¡ceres, we are waiting for the decisions to be taken by the European institutions."
"We think that the solution is to reject measures to abandon tobacco-growing, for the simple reason that it would not lead to a drop in tobacco consumption but an increase in tobacco imports, with perverse consequences and increased joblessness in European tobacco producing areas."
"We think it unwise to change the premium or take similar measures."
"However, it would be more proper to increase the percentage for research funds from 1 to 2 %."
"You mentioned measures to be taken by the Council. What can you tell us, Mrs Van Dok, about those measures?"
"It is not my intention to hold up the procedure that I described."
"I have already said that the Council has urged the Commission to put forward proposals as quickly as possible in order to take note of the necessary information, and once those proposals have been introduced to take into account the European Parliament's opinion on this subject."
"I do not think it is a good idea therefore to describe in detail what I have already mentioned in my reply, in accordance with the usual and precise procedure."
"Madam President-in-Office, in my Autonomous Community of Extremadura, tobacco has been of considerable economic and social importance for more than half a century."
"It is an Objective 1 region, with a GDP per capita of 7322 ECU, and tobacco offers the population high levels of employment, generating intensive labour for most of the year, during both the growing and processing stages."
"1, 600, 000 direct daily jobs are generated by the growing process alone, to give some idea; that is without counting indirect jobs generated by related activities."
"My question to the Council - although you have already given an answer and I am afraid that you will give the same answer again, but I shall still ask it any way - is: do you not think that reducing premiums, as the Commission document proposes, would wipe out many small farms in the southern part of the European Union and only lead to bigger imports of tobacco, with negative consequences for farmers, who have no other means of earning a living?"
"This is a committee entrusted with regulating the market and therefore it examines the place of a product, the location of the production of that product vis-Ã -vis the market as a whole and the way in which premia function in case of differences."
"In this respect, as I have already emphasized, we are also looking into the question of employment."
"I would like to insist on the fact that we should not conduct a superficial debate here when in fact what we need is a proper analysis and proper proposals."
"I have clearly described to you the current situation and although I can well imagine that you are concerned with precise aspects of the possible outcomes, nonetheless I wanted to ask you to stick for the time being to the elements of my answer concerning the procedure."
"The questions put by Mr Andersson and Mr Lindqvist concern the possible consequences of Community support in terms of regional policy on the shutdown of undertakings in general and the Ericsson factory in particular, with a view to relocating production plants."
"As the honourable member of the European Parliament knows, the structural funds are governed by special regulations adopted in June 1993 by the Council."
"According to those documents, the management of the structural fund is entrusted to the Commission by the Council."
"That is why the Commission seems better placed to answer those questions."
"More generally speaking I would like to tell you that the Danish delegation has sent a memorandum to the Council asking it to take a closer interest in the effects of the structural policy and regional public support, in order to monitor competition within the European Community."
"We could also define the best way of helping the less-developed regions of the Community by means of a structural policy, without that having negative effects on other parts of the European Union. For example, forcing factories to shut down."
"This question was therefore on the agenda of the Industry Council of 24 April 1997."
"At that meeting the Council invited the Commission to report as quickly as possible on the matter."
"I think that a debate has therefore been started and can be continued in the second half of this year. In other words, your question is on the agenda."
"Thank you very much for the answer even if I am none the wiser."
"I can understand that there are divisions of labour between the Commission and the Council but I cannot understand why the Council has not tried to find out what conclusions the Commission have arrived at during the long months since the question was asked."
"I would like to know why we cannot get a proper answer on whether companies in Scotland have received regional political aid or other aid from the EU."
"This is extremely important for the Swedish economy and for the thousands of people employed at Ericsson."
"If it is the case that regional political aid has been paid to a company in Europe which has then attracted workers to it but which at the same time has led to unemployment elsewhere then I would like a general answer to a general question: does the Council think this is wrong and how will the Council attempt to prevent something similar from happening in the future?"
"I would also like a proper answer to the first question since it is crucial for us."
"I am answering these questions as President-in-Office of the Council and I would simply say that his subject was on the agenda of the Industry Council meeting and - according to the normal procedure - the committee has been invited to analyze the situation and report back to the Council so that a solution can be found."
"The Council cannot act independently on this subject since, according to the normal procedure, we must submit a request of this type to the Commission which the Council may consider to be of extreme urgency."
"I think that it can now be made a priority thanks to Denmark, as the question asked by Denmark has been well received and again been placed on the agenda by the usual means."
"I would also to say thank you for the answer."
"It is a good thing that the question is now on the agenda but this hardly helps the employees in NorrkÃ¶ping - a town which has experienced major structural change and has a high level of unemployment - if they cannot get an answer to the question which they have asked us and which we have tried to get an answer to, namely whether regional political aid has been paid out in this case."
"I happen to know that companies in Scotland have previously received regional political aid of 10 million during 1994 from RSA, Regional Selective Assistance."
"My question is: has aid been paid out recently as well and if it has, has it contributed to relocation?"
"If this is the case it will be extremely serious."
"Both I and the employees in NorrkÃ¶ping want an answer to this."
"A considerable misunderstanding is likely to come about not only about the procedure and powers but also the analyses."
"Europe has indeed foreseen a support, a structural policy for the weaker regions, which does not mean to say that you should necessarily establish a direct link between the reason why an undertaking relocates and the fact that subsidies have been granted because these subsidies are designed to offset other weak factors in a given region."
"That is certainly why it is not possible to say every time something happens: prevent the undertakings from relocating by granting them subsidies, but instead you should look into the extent to which excessive competition results from subsidies, regardless of the fact that the region is receiving those subsidies because it is relatively undeveloped."
"It is not therefore possible automatically to establish a cause and effect relationship between a subsidy and the disappearance of an undertaking."
"I know that this is not convenient."
"We also have the situation in the Netherlands, and so I shall not answer the question as to whether subsidies have recently been granted."
"We know where the powers lie."
"It is far more interesting to know to what extent analyses enable us to conclude that competition really has been upset in this sector and in what specific location."
"I heard that reply from the Council with considerable interest."
"Mr Smith and I have an interest in this, particularly Mr Smith's constituency."
"It is nothing new for this to happen."
"What I am concerned about is, while Commissioners Flynn and Wulf-Mathies are fiddling with the rules, the dole queues in Sweden and elsewhere are getting longer and longer."
"It is small comfort to the unemployed workers in Sweden to know that the Commissioners are studying the problem."
"I do not think this is good enough."
"Would the Dutch presidency look at the change in the structural funds policy when they come to redraft the rules, or would they assist Luxembourg and the United Kingdom, by writing in some kind of guarantee in structural funds to obviate much of this development and try and make sure that there is proper worker consultation and work involvement?"
"There must be basic minimum standards of wages and conditions."
"One of the firms, ICI, has a very bad record in this respect."
"First of all, I would like to repeat that the shutdown of an undertaking providing jobs in a given region is always painful."
"In fact there is generally a tendency to examine the obvious reasons for the relocation of investment in another region."
"I already emphasized in my first reply that it was too early to condemn the structural policy."
"I find the Industry Council's approach far more balanced, in other words carrying out a serious inquiry on the basis of a signal that you have given and on the possible presence of elements which can distort competition and their origin, including subsidies."
"Legally speaking, when we have a good report and examine distorted competition then we can adapt the situation."
"You are asking me to anticipate a debate which has not yet taken place whereas discussions have now been completed concerning the activity of the Commission and the Industry Council."
"Following on from what the Minister has already said, I would like to put two propositions to her."
"First of all, the main reason why businesses relocate within the European Union is not simply because of structural funds or other incentives but maybe because people in those areas have the capacity to work harder and more efficiently and perhaps there is less tax to be paid in those Member States."
"Secondly, with regard to the question of utilizing structural funds in the way that has been suggested, yesterday we had the Commission reporting on the abolition of duty-free, saying that it would allow for state subsidy for certain regional transport sectors to ensure that they were not at a disadvantage."
"But we all know in this Parliament that any kind of subsidy, whether it is structural funds or state subsidy funds, cannot last indefinitely in the near future."
"Maybe the Council should now look again at some of its own decisions, particularly with regard to areas like duty-free and other decisions to exempt those areas from attacks of this kind."
"I think that the honourable member of the European Parliament has raised a very interesting point which also supports my answer and points out that we should adopt a more analytical approach to the matter."
"I go along with the idea that support granted to less well off regions should be seen as a catalyst which can help us achieve a Europe in which there is no more major structural lagging."
"From that point of view, he is right in saying that we should not believe that this policy is going to go on forever."
"I hope not."
"I hope that we are going to reach a situation in which we will have competition 'on a level playing field' ."
"I thank the President-in-Office for her reply."
"There is a little confusion here."
"Regional selective assistance - perhaps the Council can confirm this - is not drawn from any European Union fund."
"It is primarily United Kingdom Government money."
"That does not deal with the issue."
"Is it not true that you cannot prevent this sort of issue from happening?"
"The reason we cannot prevent it is because of the economic system we live under."
"We know why it happens."
"We know, for example, my area is supposedly the beneficiary of Ericsson's decision."
"But we are pretty confident that Ericsson is not coming to Scotland because it thinks that it can do us the world of good."
"It is because Erikson's profits motives demand that."
"In general, how does it profit any of us in the European Community if we deal with unemployment in one area by creating unemployment somewhere else?"
"That is surely not the answer."
"The question was the following: how to avoid doing away with jobs in trying to get rid of unemployment."
"The questioner was quite right in saying that this is not just a question of European subsidies. Excuse me if I gave that impression but this is a question of support from States themselves within the limits granted by the Brussels system."
"If we went further we could even talk about illegitimate government support."
"We are speaking here of legitimate support which may be granted in a certain number of regions."
"In certain cases, an assessment is carried out in order to determine whether there is still sufficient reason to maintain that support for those regions."
"This approach has been carried out quite regularly on the basis of strict criteria, in particular in the field of employment and the general situation's explaining the relative delay."
"I think that even in the absence of the aid system, jobs will continue to be relocated."
"That is what we have seen in Europe but also even more clearly in the rest of the world."
"Some people examine the immediate results of a relocation: it is, of course, distressful for a whole region."
"On the other hand, we note in the Netherlands that the globalization of our undertakings has led to a considerable strengthening of general prosperity and employment."
"Briefly, let us not directly link the relocation of jobs to the aid policy."
"Perhaps we should not consider the effects of these relocations solely in a European framework but also in the light of globalization."
"I agree with the Council representative that there is continuous relocation; companies move and rapid changes take place."
"Of course there is not an automatic link, the setting up of new companies depends on the economic climate as a whole."
"I wonder how to find out the facts on whether aid has been paid out to the companies involved."
"One of the most important tasks of the EU is to defend competition on equal terms."
"If it is proven in the study which will be carried out that the current EU structural policy distorts competition, and it is proven that competition in this case has been distorted, are we prepared to make reductions in structural policy so that it covers fewer areas and there is less money to dispense in order to restrict the harmful distortion and avoid setting old structural problems in Europe in tablets of stone?"
"I go along fully with Mrs Carlsson when she says that we need to follow the situation very closely in order to determine the effects of aid granted to regions which are less developed to such an extent that they are unable to take part in what I call 'competition on a level playing field' ."
"What needs to be defined is exactly when aid is justified, appropriate and admitted and when everything is balanced. That is when we must say: now aid will have a distorting effect."
"That is precisely the reason and I am also referring to the Commission's policy for which the choice of regions is so often submitted to a very strict evaluation based on certain criteria, including unemployment and a weak economic structure."
"As all of you possibly know, a common position on antipersonnel mines was adopted by the Council on 1 October 1996."
"It is in three parts, as follows."
"The first part concerns the total banning of all antipersonnel mines and the implementation of all means possible to reach as quickly as possible an international agreement stipulating a formal ban."
"The strategy then contains the idea of extending a European Union moratorium on the export of antipersonnel mines to exports towards all destinations."
"The final part, and the most complex, considers the elimination of all existing antipersonnel mines."
"We wish to act internationally and 7 million ECU have been earmarked for this and should be paid by the end of 1997."
"Since this common position was adopted, the European Union has pursued its implementation dynamically and following this position all of the Member States adopted an agreement in Ottawa along with over 50 other countries, which consists in general cooperation in order to reach as quickly as possible a binding international agreement banning antipersonnel mines."
"Since then other conferences have been held by Austria and Germany, in keeping with the Ottawa process."
"The Brussels Conference scheduled for the end of June is the main follow-up meeting to the Ottawa Conference."
"The European Union feels that it is important to take part in the Brussels Conference, which is an initiative that will mark the turning point in the developing of activities following the Ottawa Conference Declaration, something which the European Union heartily applauds."
"Alongside these efforts, the European Union is also trying to have the conference on disarmament adopt a mandate aimed at negotiating as quickly as possible a binding international agreement within the conference with the objective of banning the use, planting, production and transport of antipersonnel mines throughout the world. That would give us an appropriate set of measures."
"Just a few more words on the European contribution to the elimination of mines in an international context."
"To this end the European Union recently took a decision to earmark 3.9 million ECU to the benevolent fund for the elimination of mines, at the United Nations."
"This amount will be spent on projects in Angola, Mozambique, Bosnia, Croatia, Somalia and Tazhikistan. and a further 3.5 million ECU have been earmarked for Community action in order to meet demands from regional organisations or the authorities of other countries."
"It has been agreed to earmark 2.07 million out of this to a regional initiative on mines launched by the Southern Africa Development Community."
"Ways of spending the rest, some 1.3 million ECU, are currently being studied."
"As far as the Member States' obligations to fulfilling common action are concerned, members of European Parliament will know that Article J.3 of the Treaty of the European Union, in particular, stipulates that Community action is binding on Member States which must adopt positions and pursue the action undertaken."
"That article also stipulates that, in cases of serious difficulties in the fulfilment of a common action, a Member State must submit them to the Council which will debate them and look for appropriate solutions."
"Question Time has been going on for about an hour now and, in that time, four people have already been killed or maimed by a landmine somewhere in the world."
"That is how desperately serious it is."
"We talk about mine clearance which is vastly important, and I appreciate all the work that has been going on as far as the European Union is concerned."
"However, 100, 000 mines were cleared last year and 2 million new ones laid."
"You do not have to be good at mathematics to work out that, unless we have a global ban, the problem will never be solved."
"The most important conferences in Brussels and then in Ottawa are coming up."
"This is a tremendous window of opportunity to do something about this horrendous problem."
"What will the Council do to ensure that all 15 European Union countries will sign up to a global ban in Ottawa, and what will it do to promote the idea not only in Europe but throughout the rest of the world?"
"I am pleased that you have again emphasized the urgency of this problem and its consequences."
"That is why I gave a very detailed reply concerning the various aspects of European Union strategy."
"Let us add this: alongside efforts made in the framework of the Ottawa process, the European Union will continue to try and have adopted by the conference on disarmament a negotiation mandate in order to introduce a total ban on antipersonnel mines."
"The European Union believes that international efforts made in the light of the Ottawa declaration within the conference on disarmament must be complementary."
"The European Union will continue to look for every means possible to come even closer to working out a truly effective agreement as quickly as possible."
"I have a supplementary question on the budget, with a number of different aspects. We know from information received from the UN that it will take 4000 years to clear the land mines in Afghanistan alone."
"So the financial resources available to us are a drop in the ocean here."
"Is the Council going to increase those resources?"
"You have come out in favour of a specific prohibition, a total, universal prohibition."
"When is the EU going to set an example, and are there funds for companies which are still producing now to enable them to stop producing immediately?"
"Also, I have recently read that Dasa Dornier, a subsidiary of the armaments giant Daimler Benz, which produces mines, is currently benefiting, together with the French arms company Thomson CSF, receiving from the Commission of the European Union a contract worth DM 100 million for research into new military direction-finding and radar systems."
"The argument being that the systems can be used to pinpoint mines."
"We decided here that anyone producing mines, which includes Daimler Benz, should not receive any additional money for mine clearance."
"How can the Council explain this?"
"Will it take action here to ensure that this money is not wasted for that purpose?"
"I find that it is always very difficult to respond to questions that are so emotional by treaties."
"However, it is the only way of defining limits."
"Why is the European Union's strategy so good as a whole?"
"Because a various number of possibilities are allowed for."
"In the beginning you could say: you have to ban antipersonnel mines."
"But you must also ensure that they are no longer planted or used."
"A quite supplementary measure and one that can be controlled is to attack the trade in these mines, in other words the import and also export of this type of product."
"Banning mines will indeed call for a great deal of energy."
"On that score, I think money but also technology and good organisation are extremely important."
"I am aware of the situation referred to by the Member."
"I do know, however, that it is crucial for us to take advantage of all the experience that we have gained on the ground in Europe and elsewhere in order to get rid of mines as quickly as possible and not waste any time on procedures."
"I think we really have to get down to work on this."
"Madam President-in-Office, it would be a good thing if the Council were to turn to China in respect of the production of mines and their international trade."
"You said rather smugly that the European Union has decided to spend 3 million ECU on this campaign."
"I do not need to remind you of the Council's attitude over this matter for the 1997 budget and who it was who put in those 3 million ECU - the European Union and its budgetary authority."
"I hope that the Council will be more sensitive this year for the 1998 budget, at least your colleague in the Finance Ministry."
"I should like to ask whether, given that we are cutting back European armies, the Council could not take the decision to send mine defusing experts into many of those countries."
"This is a constant demand, for example, in Angola, where there is a lack of qualified staff to instruct mine deactivation brigades."
"Could the Council not take a decision to send that type of instructor to trouble spots?"
"I must confess that I am not really au fait with the details of the systematic procedure for eliminating antipersonnel mines."
"In my reply I concentrated on our administrative activities - in other words, support for organisations which can act thanks to our financial support and other supplementary measures."
"Please excuse me but I cannot give you a more detailed reply."
"As for your question about China. Of course, it is important that the largest possible number of countries should subscribe to this agreement as was the case for chemical weapons and others."
"I will begin by thanking the President-in-Office for her answer."
"I am glad that there is agreement in the Council too that it is immensely important that these matters be discussed at the Ottawa meeting."
"In relation to what has been said, I would like to ask: what progress has been made in the Council in getting these things in place?"
"As I understood it, you are agreed that we should have them in place, so what progress has been made in the negotiations on coordinating views so that it will be possible to arrive at a common position for the Ottawa meeting?"
"Is it your view, Madam President-in-Office, that a situation will be achieved in which there actually is a common position in favour of a ban at the very important meeting in Ottawa?"
"Briefly, with my approval and to my great pleasure, I can tell you that all the Member States of the European Union will be taking part in the forthcoming Brussels Conference. Two of them, Greece and Finland, will probably be present as observers."
"All partners have approved the European Union's coordination vis-Ã -vis the Ottawa process."
"I should sincerely like to thank the Minister for her enthusiastic reply."
"Mr Cunningham and myself are rapporteurs not for but against antipersonnel mines - or rather I would prefer to call them anti-people mines."
"You rightly refer to the Ottawa initiative which will be continued next week in Brussels and perhaps by the end of the year will lead to the signature of a 'wholehearted' convention, as it were."
"Would the Council like to comment on the fact that the true forum which should have been chosen, the United Nations Anti-nuclear Conference, is still beset with differences of opinion between the United States and India over nuclear weapons?"
"I hope that this is not going to be a bottleneck causing the Ottawa Convention to fail at the end of this year."
"I shall be brief for the interpreters."
"I go along entirely with your point of view and I too hope that this situation will not arise."
"Question No 10 by Mr Arthur Newens (H-0392/97)"
"Subject: The EU banana regime"
"Would the Council make a statement about the future of the Banana Regime in the light of the latest developments?"
"As Mr Newens knows, the WTO panel recently made a negative declaration against the Community in the framework of the dispute over the European banana import policy or the regulation of the markets."
"In accordance with existing procedures, the Community has 60 days as of the date of the announcement of the panel report to all members of the WTO to adopt a point of view."
"As you know, it is primarily for the Commission to decide on the follow-up to be given to the panel report and in particular to decide whether it should be appealed against."
"The Commission has already announced that it does intend to appeal against the WTO panel's findings."
"As soon as the WTO takes its final decision - because in fact it has not yet happened - the Council will definitely hold - according to the applicable procedures - a debate on the consequences to be drawn from this final decision."
"Of course, this is a matter of the main elements of the banana import policy, set out in the market regulation, while bearing in mind the European Union's specific obligations towards the countries which signed the LomÃ© Convention and, of course, the Member States of the WTO."
"In this respect, we should remember that the Commission has already put two proposals to the Council."
"First of all, the proposal of 8 March 1996 aimed at amending the common regulations governing the banana market."
"Secondly, the proposal of 6 April 1995 which enables the ACP banana producing countries to make provisional transfers of traditional category bananas and others between ACP states within the same geographical region."
"This means - and here I am addressing in particular those who are not familiar with this jargon - that quotas can be modified."
"These proposals are still being studied by the Council bodies, pending the outcome of the WTO procedure."
"While thanking the President-in-Office for her reply and expressing the strongest support for the decision to appeal against the WTO ruling on bananas, in view of the devastating effect this decision could have on the fragile economies of Caribbean and other countries, some of which rely in some cases for more than 50 % of their foreign exchange earnings on bananas, will the President-in-Office do everything possible to ensure that we fight to the last ditch on this issue?"
"Is it not a fact that the real beneficiaries of the World Trade Organization decision, if it were implemented, would be American-based multinational companies which already control over 90 % of the world trade in bananas, and have we not therefore a duty, if we want to fight poverty in the world, to stand very firm on the agreement we made with the banana-producing countries?"
"First of all, Europe will do all it has to to defend its policy if there is complaint, a divergence of opinion or tensions vis-Ã -vis the WTO panel."
"When you say 'pursue to the end' , I would nonetheless like to make a comment concerning the hierarchy of interests within the WTO panel."
"We quite rightly set up the WTO panel to deal with differences of interest, and I am not only referring to the interests of big countries but also to those of small countries such as Honduras, Guatemala, Mexico or Ecuador, in this case - so that they can have a reference in order to be able to react to any disturbance to their markets, in particular in order to face up to the bigger countries."
"In these matters, I attach considerable value to the fact that we now have a WTO panel."
"That does not mean to say that because we are satisfied with the existence of that panel, we should not use it to defend our own personal interests."
"That is really the thrust of my proposal."
"Madam President-in-Office, I listened to what you said, and your words about the ACP countries, but neither you nor Mr Newens mentioned Community banana production, which now amounts to 720, 000 tonnes, produced in the Canaries, Madeira and Crete, etc."
"For these regions, which have the scantiest means of defence, the disappearance of the banana would be like the disappearance of dairy cows in Holland."
"I do not think that the Dutch would like to see that happen any more than those regions would like to see the banana disappear."
"This matter is of important economic and social value."
"Secondly, you know that the peaceful solution of conflicts at the WTO is not carried out by a court of justice in the strict sense but the procedure seems linked to certain trade negotiations and I hope that the Council bears that aspect in mind, i.e. the need for negotiations or compensations in order to solve this matter."
"I am sorry that I forgot European taxpayers even though I have just visited Spain in order to discuss in detail this subject with my colleague there."
"I think that we are talking about two different issues, i.e. the status of the WTO panel and taking into account WTO declarations concerning market disturbances and the European Union's position. The EU must still take a final decision in order to be able to defend its own interests through the WTO panel."
"I think it is rather foolish to say: let us call into question the value of that panel."
"That is my opinion."
"I think by using a fairly good instrument our interests can be defended to the best possible extent."
"That will play a role in the case of bananas but also, increasingly, in the case of all products which are still protected throughout the world in the light of the agreements reached in Marrakesh on the ending of subsidies, quotas and other limits and forthcoming negotiations on new tariff reductions in a whole series of areas."
"We must therefore be aware that international trade organisation is going to lead to changes in commercial relationships and new opportunities will arise on the same market."
"By referring to this specific situation I would like to repeat to you that we still have a possibility to appeal and we are still studying that. We do defend our interests on the WTO panel, but the WTO panel is a precious instrument in this area, not only for those who are accusing us today but also for the European Union."
"I am somewhat bemused by the reply about the complaints and the appeal from the Commission legal services because I have just done a BBC World Service interview which says that the appeal has been lodged today."
"Either the BBC is wrong or the Council's sources of information are somewhat limited in this instance."
"I am very interested in what you say."
"I would like to know whether you consider that it would be a majority view in the Council, including the view of your own country - the Netherlands - that we should continue with a banana regime and continue to support the banana regime."
"I would also ask whether you think that it is appropriate that a country that has no direct involvement with the banana industry should be able to lodge a complaint in this way and to obtain a ruling of the kind obtained by the United States after they lodged their complaints."
"Finally, I would also like to ask you whether you think it would be appropriate, now that apparently the appeal has gone in, for the ACP also to put in a parallel appeal and for the European Union to provide funding, resources and support for them in order that they can make their appeal as effective as possible."
"I emphasized in my reply that the Commission has already announced its intention to appeal."
"I might imagine that you have concluded that this is therefore a decision."
"I have no other news."
"I do not see any major difference between Mrs Kinnock's conclusions in respect of the decision and my analysis of the situation."
"Let us turn to the decision."
"At the moment - as I have already stressed - the complaints procedure is part of the Commission's remit, which does not mean that the Council should not take any decision nor that it should discuss any proposal."
"You would like to know the Netherlands' point of view as a Member State of the European Union."
"I am afraid I cannot satisfy your demand, because I am not here to represent my country."
"I am trying to defend the interests of Europe with a certain neutrality."
"The procedures for making a complaint or for appealing are carefully determined within the WTO. They will, therefore, play a role in the new declarations to be made."
"You also mentioned the matter of funds, compensation, etc."
"This is a problem which calls for specific attention in the European Union."
"It is not currently being dealt with by the WTO panel's review procedure."
"Question No 11 by Mr Felipe CamisÃ³n Asensio (H-0393/97)"
"Subject: 'Open skies' air transport agreement between the EU and the USA"
"Can the Council provide information, in view of the recent work carried out by Transport Ministers in this area, on the possibilities of reaching an 'open skies' agreement between the EU and the US on commercial air transport in the near future?"
"Mr CamisÃ³n Asensio's question concerns negotiations for an open skies agreement between the European Union and the United States."
"My response is the following."
"On 17 June 1996, the Council adopted the negotiation mandate enabling the Commission to open, on the European Community's behalf, negotiations with the United States on air traffic."
"One of the basic principles of these negotiations is the idea of a common air traffic area between the European Community and the United States, and this agreement should ultimately replace the current system of bilateral relations between isolated European Union members and the United States."
"Since 1995, the United States has contacted several Member States of the European Union in order to reach so-called 'open skies agreements' , and some of those Member States have reached agreements with the United States while others are still being negotiated."
"The European Community's new approach, however, implies the organisation of structured negotiations with the United States which should in due time lead to an agreement aimed at setting up a common air traffic area."
"I should like to emphasize the fact that these negotiations will take place over a number of stages."
"Initially the European Community would examine with the United States the possibility of introducing a set of directives which would be applied to air companies based in the European Union and the United States in order for them to be submitted to similar competition rules, the so-called 'soft rights' ."
"If this led to substantial results, the negotiations could then move on to a second stage, that of regulating common air traffic as a whole, i.e. the so-called circulation or 'hard rights' ."
"In this framework, the Community, represented by the Commission, and the United States held talks on 30 and 31 October in Washington and 3 April in Brussels."
"At the Transport Council meeting on 17 June, the Commission reported on the results of the discussions which had been held so far."
"Madam President-in-Office, having listened to you, we are afraid that the negotiations are being stalled."
"Secondary aspects are being dealt with and the real crux of the matter is being neglected, namely that of establishing traffic rights beginning, once and for all, with access to third markets, to benefit ordinary people."
"Once again we see the overriding need for union in our European Community - which you have begun and which I urge you to continue."
"It is obvious that if the 15 Member States united their forces, the agreement would be a better one and strike a perfect balance between the United States and the European Union, with neither winners nor losers."
"This is another great opportunity for the European institutions - especially the Council - to show how agile and efficient they are."
"This agreement is urgent, especially with the possible - perhaps imminent - integration of American Airlines with British Airways, a group that Iberia seems to be joining forces with, which is perfectly reasonable and understandable given the facts."
"Could you tell us about this urgent matter?"
"First of all, we need a certain dynamism in order to reach a good result on the basis of a 100 % win situation."
"I told you that the interest of these two stages is first of all to ensure that there are equal competition opportunities, the so-called 'soft rights' , before turning to a more extensive regulation which should enable us to reach an 'open skies agreement' ."
"But quite a lot of factors have to be taken into account - as you very rightly stressed - including the question of the merger of airlines."
"That is one of the issues which comes into the first stage, i.e. the process of establishing equal competition opportunities."
"This is, therefore, one aspect which will definitely be on the agenda during the first stage."
"In order to give the whole process a boost, on 17 June 1996, we adopted the negotiating mandate and I have just pointed out that the Transport Council meeting of 17 June has already reported on the initial findings of the process."
"As the authors are not present, Questions Nos 12, 13 and 14 lapse."
"Question No 15 by Mr SÃ¶ren Wibe (H-0406/97)"
"Subject: Follow-up to future elections in Albania"
"In the recent parliamentary elections in Albania held in May 1996 there was organized electoral fraud which clearly favoured the ruling Democratic Party."
"International observers at the elections protested but there has been no diplomatic follow-up by any other European country against the Albanian Government."
"The result has been an authoritarian regime which did not draw the line at machinating its way back into power and has also systematically been involved in corruption and out and out fraud throughout the country."
"Armed insurrection has been the result."
"Talks are now taking place between the political parties together with the rebels."
"There is disagreement over the electoral system and the timetable for the rebels to disarm has been ignored."
"Strong feelings have also been aroused over the question whether President Berisha should continue in office."
"Will this situation be repeated?"
"Will the EU Member States react and demand new elections if there are irregularities in the forthcoming parliamentary elections in June?"
"What is our threshold of tolerance of future electoral fraud in Albania?"
"This is my answer to Mr Wibe's question."
"The Council has often expressed a wish for free and honest elections held in Albania."
"Recently, the General Affairs Council, meeting in June, expressed its satisfaction on receiving the declaration by the Albanian authorities on the holding of elections on 29 June, calling all parties to take part in those elections with the promise of respecting the outcome of the ballot."
"The Council has also stressed that this country's future depended, above all, on the Albanian people."
"Nevertheless, it is our duty to assist the national reconciliation government in preparing free and honest elections in which all the parties will take place, if possible on the scheduled date."
"The European Union fully supports the efforts of the Council of Europe on this score, in particular the framework of the common position adopted by the Council on 2 June on the basis of Article J2 of the Treaty on European Union."
"In it, the Council urged the international community to support the electoral process in Albania by supplying the necessary number of observers."
"The European Union also emphasized its support for the multilateral protection force which during its mandate will ensure that the elections take place in full security."
"If the electoral process were to be threatened by a policy of internal pressure in Albania, the European Union and the international community should review their position in respect of that country without any question."
"I would like to emphasise to the Council the importance of maintaining a high profile on this issue."
"Exactly one year ago, just after the Albanian election had taken place, I asked the same question of the Italian Presidency as it then was."
"As there were clear signs of vote-rigging, I asked whether we should introduce some form of sanctions."
"I received the response then that 'this was not necessary, Albania was already on the way to a democratic government' etc."
"Now we have the results to hand."
"There was almost a civil war in the country."
"We have already seen some indications of fraud here and there."
"For example, I think that the so called 'car accident' which President Berisha is supposed to have had is the work of his own staff to draw public attention to him."
"I would just like to ask the Council: can you give a guarantee that we will introduce immediate sanctions against the government, if we notice the slightest indication of vote- rigging this time?"
"I think that Mr Wibe is warning us against being excessively or glibly optimistic about this process."
"On the other hand, it is obviously very positive that elections are being held and that a balance might be restored, so that something can be rebuilt in the country."
"That is why I gave a positive response, but I was also careful in pointing out in my first sentence - I might even say that it was the safety net of my pessimism - what you have just commented on. However, for the time being, I stand by the answers that I gave in respect of the support that might be given to the country."
"Mr President, the written question is, in my view, not a question at all but a horror story."
"But I do have a clear question to put to the Council."
"First, is the Council not also of the opinion that stabilization in Albania includes striking a balance between the re-elected President Berisha and the former opposition, which, I am happy to say, now forms part of the coalition government?"
"Secondly, how are elections to be held unless these armed bands in the south of the country are disarmed?"
"And thirdly, how can democratic local authorities be re-established there?"
"There is a danger that massive economic interests which support those armed bands will simply seize power from the streets."
"That makes it very important to re-establish democratic local authorities."
"You might interpret that as a question, but what you are describing is our concern and yours that the electoral process should be carried out correctly and everything that is related to that."
"I share that concern, but I simply wanted to demonstrate how the position of the European Union and other bodies might actually lead to conditions and circumstances which might allow these operations to take place properly. I also said that the Albanian people have considerable responsibility."
"Once again I agree with you, but I just wanted to try to follow up my previous thoughts."
"That concludes Question Time to the Council. Questions Nos 16 to 31 with be answered in writing."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.15 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"China-Europe relations"
"The next item is the report (A4-0198/97) by Mr McMillan-Scott on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy on the communication from the Commission on a long-term policy on relations between China and Europe (COM(95)0279 - C4-0288/95)."
"Mr President, this evening we are discussing a document produced by the Commission - a communication on EU relations with China in the long term."
"The European Parliament has taken a close interest in China and over a number of years has adopted many resolutions, almost all of them highly critical of China in many respects."
"During the time we have been preparing this report we have tried to establish a new way of working with China, and in particular with the National People's Congress, against a background of hugely expanding trade with the People's Republic, where all our Member States are closely involved in the economic development that has taken place in China since 1978."
"But we are also conscious that China remains a one-party state - in some ways a tyrannous regime - and has been justly criticised, both here and elsewhere, for its human rights problems."
"However, the theme we have chosen for this report is not just 'business as usual' but also 'politics as usual' , seeking to underline that while we welcome the development of trade, at the same time we are seeking to establish some form of political dialogue with the Chinese political elite."
"So it was, for the first time, we gave the delegation from the National People's Congress, which visited Brussels in April, the opportunity to discuss in detail the draft report."
"I was pleased they were able to do so - we sent them an advance copy and they looked through it in detail and, of course, were highly critical of certain aspects."
"It is important to try to engage the Chinese in some form of dialogue, and so we based the report on the Maastricht criteria, which are democracy and the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, and we hope that over time all these four conditions will find their place in Chinese life."
"The Commission is involved in the promotion of democracy in China, through the village democracy programme."
"The Commission is involved, as are Member States, in the promotion of the rule of law, without which human rights cannot operate in any territory."
"As to fundamental freedoms - the most basic aspect of political life - these are still not available in territories such as Tibet, and we deal in some detail with that question in the report."
"We seek also a more cooperative approach with China."
"For example, an EU-China summit, raising relations to a new level and not just through the ASEM process."
"We would like to see a new trade and cooperation treaty replacing that of 1985 and including the standard human rights clause."
"We would like to expand the European Union's programmes in China."
"At the moment they are not significant in monetary or, indeed, in real terms, and they should be much more addressed to the size of China and its potential in the world economy and, indeed, in world politics."
"We would like to see an office opened in China for the European business groups which wish to take advantage of the trade."
"But, above all, I have tried to indicate in my report that there is a great deficit in China: the so-called internal market does not function - indeed never has."
"The Commission has a great deal to offer the Chinese in the experience we have had in creating the single market in Europe and in converting the economies of the former Soviet Union to market economies."
"We look at the experience we have had in operating the CFSP: the failure, for example, of the European Union in Geneva this April."
"We look to the resumption of the Troika discussions on human rights with China."
"We would like to see added to that a six-monthly report, not just on human rights, but also on the economic aspects of our relations, to look in particular at the approach of China towards WTO and OECD membership."
"These are all aspects which are covered in the report."
"Of course, we deal with the transition back to Chinese sovereignty of Hong Kong."
"We say quite specifically that we repudiate the legitimacy of the Provisional Legislative Council and we look forward to the Chinese honouring the promises they have given both to us and the international community in respect of Hong Kong's civil and political rights."
"I am grateful for all the help I have had from academics, business people, colleagues in the European Parliament, the Commission and Parliament's staff in the production of this report."
"Mr President, as we debate in this Parliament, the American Congress is debating too."
"I want to highlight the symbolism of this coincidence: perhaps the Conference of Presidents of our Parliament has not really understood the importance of this strategic definition of relations between the European Union and China, probably the most important political and economic issue affecting development and stability in the world at this time."
"It has not understood, because we are being forced to have a debate under these conditions, to put it politely, while in the American Congress it seems this is a subject which actually draws crowds."
"This means we still have a long way to go before our parties, this Parliament and indeed the European Union, achieve full awareness of the importance of defining a long term relationship with China which is effective and useful for peace, stability, cooperation and development."
"Today, with this report, Parliament has the opportunity to start pointing the way forward for a comprehensive organic policy which is long term and does not consist merely of occasional though often justified denunciations but which fail to take account of the whole range of issues involved in relations with such a large country."
"China is necessary to peace, stability and economic growth."
"The right line is not to isolate China, a position which would anyway be virtually unachievable, given the size and, now, the international relations of that country."
"The right line is one of dialogue and cooperation applied with sincerity and clarity, gradually leading that country to weigh up the advantages of cooperation to its development, growth and welfare and also the advantage, to obtain all this, of respecting international rules on agreements and treaties, human rights, and the solution of certain major problems still outstanding, like Hong Kong, Tibet and Taiwan."
"Engagement with China is the only possible way."
"I see that in the American Congress Mrs Albright has upheld this view, which is also our own, and has mentioned four areas - I do not have time to cover them all - where China is, to a degree, entering positively and constructively into international policy issues."
"A very important one is its contribution to the approval of the nuclear test ban treaty, a second is helping control the instability on the Korean peninsula, supporting peacekeeping operations in Cambodia and elsewhere, the beginnings of effective control over exports of important and dangerous technology, and positive discussions, according to the Americans, about China's entry into the World Trade Organization."
"I could go on."
"Of course, there is still the human rights chapter."
"I believe it is right to create a clear, open and fair policy on China, in which a will to cooperate is announced and sustained."
"Action must follow this and not accusations about differences, because I actually think intensification of relations and development of economic cooperation will contribute to shifting opinion even amongst the Chinese leadership and lead to political changes which are already partly in progress."
"So I believe this is an important report."
"It does not exhaust our drive to define the right policy, which, as a Parliament, we have only just begun, but it is a good start."
"Mr President, adapting something that Heine once said about Germany, ' To think of China in the night puts all my hope of sleep to flight.'"
"That is doubly valid here."
"All our plans for the evening have been put to flight by this important subject, but the important subject itself causes us deep concern."
"And the topics of foreign policy and foreign trade policy, which create so much debate in the European Parliament, also include topics connected with China, with China's role in the world, and especially matters relating to those regions that are politically and/or culturally connected with China."
"Mr McMillan-Scott has presented us with a comprehensive report, covering many different aspects."
"I should like to confine myself to one: human rights, which after all is the most critical for us."
"The attitude of the European Union is becoming a test case here, not just as regards a common policy towards China but also as regards its attitude in future negotiations with other countries."
"Many countries produce a hostile reaction if tackled on the issue of human rights."
"They will see our attitude to China as a yardstick."
"The McMillan-Scott report imposes requirements in the human rights areas that make our principles clear."
"In this sensitive area, especially, we should not become entangled in contradictions and so weaken the demands we make on other countries."
"Economic relations are also political relations."
"Anyone who sets his hopes on contributing to the democratization of a country is supporting that precise argument, but human rights are part of democracy."
"Good relations with China are something for which we all hope, including in particular greater openness towards people in China."
"China, for its part, has expectations to live up to."
"The handover of Hong Kong will show how far it stands by its obligations under the handover treaty, which will provide a pointer for international co-operation."
"No one would dispute that the restructuring of a gigantic empire into a modern state involves many problems, especially in the case of a state which is home to many nations."
"But China's government should have the courage, too, to proceed towards the rule of law, human rights and democracy."
"Thousands of years of Chinese culture can give it the strength to do so."
"The same applies to its attitude towards Tibet and respect for an equally ancient culture."
"And it applies, too, to a peaceful settlement of relations with Taiwan, which is an area where trade relations really should lead to changed relations."
"Mr President, I greatly appreciated the report by Mr McMillan-Scott, but I share Mr Colajanni's view that this Parliament is not demonstrating a serious attitude in holding the debate on such an important issue before a half-empty Chamber, in competition with football matches and so much else."
"I agree with Mr McMillan-Scott that a framework agreement, for example, should be reached on economic and trade cooperation, because I also feel sure that human rights tend to be better understood and protected in societies open to free trade and free movement of investment, persons and ideas."
"But I think the importance of the human rights issue cannot be understated given what is happening daily: illegal practices, systematic violation of human rights, growing recourse on a vast scale to the death penalty, even for minor crimes."
"Many people are detained just for peacefully expressing their own political or religious ideas."
"Well, we cannot keep quiet about it, or we would be false to ourselves, just as we cannot keep quiet about the fact that Hong Kong will provide concrete proof of whether the intentions of the Chinese government are good."
"We cannot relax our vigilance over the maintenance of the provisions in force on freedom of expression, of the press, of association and of the right to hold demonstrations."
"Whether a framework agreement with China is seriously possible soon will depend on this."
"Mr President, the Liberal Group is satisfied in general terms with Mr MacMillan-Scott's report."
"We congratulate him on it. The report accords considerable importance to relations between the EU and China and they are looked at from many angles."
"We are pleased that human rights issues have a central place in the report."
"In this connection I should like to stress that we must also be consistent in these matters."
"What we demand from China we must also insist on from others."
"On behalf of the Liberal Group I have tabled two amendments to this report which concern environmental questions."
"In the committee after the vote, a recital was adopted on a proposal from the Greens stating that the West, including Europe, should reduce the use and pollution of natural resources."
"In my opinion it is important for environmental issues to be included in the operative paragraphs of the report too."
"My first amendment aims to do this."
"The substance of the paragraph is the same as that of the recital already adopted."
"In addition, I am proposing a new wording for paragraph 9."
"The form of words I am proposing places the EU and China on an equal footing with respect to each other and is more diplomatic than the original version."
"I hope that I will have wide support from Members of this House for my amendments."
"Mr President, the first paragraph of the resolution on long term relations with China rightly points out that they should be based on cooperation rather than confrontation."
"Unfortunately, the rest of the resolution heads in the opposite direction, with heavy interference in China's internal and external policies."
"The starting point for any cooperation consists in considering the partner country as a sovereign state."
"This resolution does not do that, and demands that China make social choices that are not its natural ones, especially concerning its territorial integrity."
"Without giving ground on the concept of human rights, which the European Parliament upholds, it would have been possible - and, I think, far more useful - to deal with this matter in such a way as to contribute to a positive evolution in China in this field, rather than make demands of it which are not even always respected by the European Union's Member States or allies."
"An historic step has just been taken in the case of the handover of Hong Kong, in the conditions of a positive negotiated settlement of a difficult dispute. There is not a single word in this resolution to salute that smooth handover, alas so rare in the modern world."
"The pressure demanded of the Commission in favour of Taiwan's accession to international organisations and the plan to open an information bureau in Taipei would be provocative and irresponsible rather than favouring normal and balanced relations with China."
"None of this is reasonable and has nothing to do with the desire for relations based on cooperation and mutual respect, which would only be beneficial in terms of economic and social matters as well as human rights, peace and security."
"A lot has changed in China since 1995, even though many problems remain, and it is quite regrettable that the update of the Commission's communication dating back to 1995 should be done in such a negative way."
"I hope that Sino-European relations, a major challenge for the 21st century, will soon be looked at from a completely different angle."
"Mr President, I must congratulate Mr McMillan-Scott on an excellent report which is in no way vitiated by the fact that practically all of the amendments from the Green Group were accepted by the external affairs committee."
"As President of the China Delegation I often have to listen to the complaint, when I am in contact with representatives of the Peking Government, that we pursue a unilateral and unjustified campaign against China."
"I think that this report makes it clear that we are laying the foundation for constructive co-operation, that we have noticed the small but nevertheless real improvements which have taken place in China while at the same time we openly and without reservation level the necessary criticism, which is absolutely justified, against the very serious shortcomings in the Chinese system when it comes to democracy and human rights."
"We must continue in this vein."
"This is why it is all the more regrettable that it has been impossible to co-ordinate a collective criticism at government level in our respective countries."
"It is particularly regrettable that some of the larger states, with France at the head, have put free trade before human rights."
"This must be severely criticised by Parliament."
"Mr President, there are not many of us here but we have the pleasure of having the Commissioner with us, which I think is particularly important."
"I do not say this for Mrs Moreau, but I think that when we speak of human rights we also speak of democracy and our aim is also to ensure that the world does not become one big Singapore, with development but no democracy."
"Our work as parliament is therefore to define a policy that helps to bring about democracy in China as quickly as possible."
"This report is, I think, a first important step in that direction."
"It will also enable us to harass Commissioner Brittan, but that is only a tiny part of the problem."
"I think that we all remember the serious events that have occurred in terms of defining a common European police for external matters, and the respect of human rights in China."
"We all recall Geneva and the disaster that befell the Union's policy."
"Then there was President Chirac's trip to China, where promises that we are still awaiting were made, and last week the Italian Prime Minister, Mr Prodi, also visited the country and repeatedly told us that he would be very firm and would demand specific commitments by China over human rights."
"We are still waiting for a practical outcome to that trip."
"What I mean to say is that what we are doing here is very important but we have to be very hard on the Council in the coming months - the Council announced earlier that it is redefining its policy on China."
"If that policy is based on the McMillan-Scott report, I think that that would be a first step in the right direction."
"On the other hand, if that new policy is a confirmation of Mr Chirac or Mr Prodi's approaches, then I think we are heading straight for disaster."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I would like to congratulate Mr McMillan-Scott on his report, which has kept to a realistic line and avoided the usual mistake in dealing with China of taking an ideological approach rather than a political one."
"In general there are two kinds of excess: the mercantilist culture and the radical culture."
"Instead a more pragmatic approach is needed, the one our rapporteur has adopted, which takes account of the different history and the different objective conditions of a country with one billion two hundred million inhabitants, the weight of its tradition and of its enormous contradictions."
"So we need to make an effort to understand and support a possible transition, trusting to the culture of development and freedom: this is a more difficult path, but a safer one, and anyway it is the obligatory path."
"In the next twenty years we will have to reckon with China, which will be the greatest factor for change but also for uncertainty, so there will either be strongly absolutist and nationalist growth which will constitute a danger for the surrounding area and for the entire world, or progressive movement towards the market and freedom."
"A great deal depends on us."
"Head-on confrontation is a mistake, because in the Chinese tradition it leads to them cutting off relations. It is also wrong to try to export the worst of our culture, like consumption, corruption, and the law of the strongest."
"We must focus on economic, technical, scientific and cultural cooperation to help China's development effort, and export the culture of freedom, of diversity understood as richness, of tolerance, pluralism, human rights, peaceful co-existence, and respect for minorities."
"If we gamble on cooperation and on the attraction of our values, then in time we shall certainly obtain political fallout."
"The policy of the Chinese government - one country, two systems - will demonstrate the superiority of the market, but at the same time the cultural influence of the values of western civilization will convince the Chinese people to take the road of freedom."
"Mr President, there are some positive things in Mr McMillan-Scott's report."
"There is the explanatory statement, and in the resolution there are between 30 and 40 points which are positive and underline China's enormous economic importance and its importance to the stability of the region in the more general sense."
"At the same time, however, there are about 20 points which negate all of the helpful things that are said. The rapporteur deems them necessary as a means to promoting constructive cooperation between the European Union, in particular, and China."
"It is if China were a defeated country to which Mr McMillan-Scott is dictating terms."
"At Point 18 he gives full details of the type of constitution that today's China should devise."
"The Chines people are to have constitutional democracy."
"I do not know where he gets his authority from."
"From the Dalai Lama?"
"From God?"
"I have no idea."
"Secondly, he speaks about Tibet and the Dalai Lama."
"But Tibet has been an integral part of China since time immemorial."
"What happens in Tibet is China's own internal affair, just as what happened and is happening in the eastern part of Germany that united with western part was, and is, an internal affair."
"Thirdly, he speaks about Hong Kong."
"Hong Kong has changed sovereignty. Has Mr McMillan-Scott not got wind of that yet?"
"Two sovereign states came to an agreement and Hong Kong is now part of China..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"I would like to congratulate Mr McMillan-Scott on an extremely useful and balanced report on relations with China."
"I very much agree with Mr De Luca that it is important when developing our policy on China to be realistic and to be pragmatic."
"As it happens, I do not think there is a conflict of objectives, as some have suggested."
"Mr Gahrton seemed to think that we were preferring free trade to human rights."
"I do not see that conflict because we are talking about an extremely large and important country, as many speakers in the debate have said."
"We have to ask ourselves a practical question: what is our interest as far as China is concerned?"
"It is, of course, an economic one, but it is also that China should be a peaceful participant in the world and a major economic player, developing a free society and expanding the rule of law and human rights in China."
"That is our objective."
"Now how do we achieve it?"
"People talk about consistency."
"I do not think one can be entirely consistent because the way of achieving results in China will be very different from achieving results in other countries, which are smaller and perhaps at different stages of development."
"I have no doubt at all that the best way of achieving these common objectives is to develop the closest links with China economically and politically, to assist its development, particularly in the areas of special interest, but also to be forthright in our views on human rights."
"I do not think there is any contradiction in those objectives."
"In the long run the most likely prospect of improving the human rights situation is for China to develop economically and for us to encourage China in that development, not only internally, but towards the outside world through, for example, participation in the World Trade Organization; not a meaningless participation as if it were a club which we just wanted to give them the prize of entry to, but participation on the basis of acceptance of the rules of the WTO which, on the one hand require China to open up and become a more liberal economy, recognizing its difficulties and its stage of development, while on the other hand, giving China access to the rest of the world."
"If that happens you will automatically open up economic freedom in China."
"In the long term economic and political freedom cannot be divided."
"The growth of economic freedom in China is the most certain, long-term way to achieving political freedom as well."
"But it does not follow from that that you say: let us trade with China, let us negotiate China's participation in the WTO and hope that will lead in time to a freer society in China."
"That is not enough either."
"We have to work actively for that."
"We have to give the appropriate signs and signals."
"But we also have to give the appropriate help."
"I was glad to hear Mr McMillan-Scott say that the cooperation programme should be expanded."
"Parliament has an important role in enabling that to happen an it should be targeted in a way that helps the development of a civil society and encourages democracy."
"We have a programme which encourages, as has been said, support at village level for reform in the right direction."
"Reference was made by Mr VÃ¤yrynen to environmental issues."
"There too we have much to offer China and China is interested in taking what we have to offer in terms of environmental programmes, training key environmental planners, supporting pilot projects involving technology transfer and assisting environmental planning and management in China."
"In addition to trade and cooperation there is the question of human rights."
"That has been central also in the most direct sense, and not just in the indirect way that I have described, to our policy toward China which is comprehensive and coherent."
"The Commission has never hesitated to express our criticisms, both publicly and privately, of China's lapses on human rights."
"I have done so myself at the highest level, mentioning particular cases."
"I agree with those who have said, or implied, that the inability of the European Union to reach a common view to put that view forward in Geneva at the Commission on Human Rights, is a great failing and a great weakness."
"I very much hope that the Intergovernmental Conference, in reinforcing our capacity to create a foreign policy, will enable us in future on this issue, as in others, to present a rather more impressive picture to the outside world and advance our interests in a more effective way."
"We should not hesitate to do that."
"Hong Kong is important."
"We are witnessing a unique experiment, an experiment to create one country with the two systems of Hong Kong and China proper."
"The commitment of the Chinese Government to do that is unique and we should observe and watch it with care, with interest, and with concern that it meets the commitments that have been made."
"There is a common European interest, not only because of our economic interests in Hong Kong, but also because Hong Kong itself can set an example, not as a base for subversion, but as an example which can lead people elsewhere in China and in the whole region to believe the route of economic freedom and political freedom is the right route forward, not just in Western Europe or in countries with a common tradition, but also in other parts of the world which have different backgrounds but where human values ultimately must prevail."
"I commend the report and believe that the policy that we are pursuing towards China is comprehensive and pragmatic, recognizing the importance of trade and economic development both for its own sake and as a point of entry towards the creation of a more liberal society in China, but bolstering that up with cooperation programmes pointing in the same direction and a robust expression of our views when human rights are violated in China as elsewhere in the world."
"Thank you, Sir Leon."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Baltic initiative"
"The next item is the report (A4-0196/97) by Mr Burenstam Linder on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy on the Commission communication on the Baltic Sea Initiative (SEC(96)0608 - C40362/96)."
"Mr President, the Baltic Sea region had the fastest economic growth in Europe before the communist revolution."
"Now that the planned economy has been scrapped, the former communist countries, together with the other countries in the Baltic Sea region, can once again develop this region into an economically flourishing democracy."
"This will also help to strengthen political stability."
"This stability can be improved through the fine web of co-operation at all levels which has developed and which continues to develop, in the public and private sectors for example, in business, administration, organisations and between private individuals."
"At an inter-state level this co-operation also includes non-binding support on defence issues and common efforts in international peace keeping missions."
"The work which is handled in the Council of Baltic Sea States , in which the EU participates as a full member, is of particular importance for co-operation in all these areas."
"In this respect, the European Union has an important task."
"Further far reaching reforms are needed in the former communist countries which, in the short term, can prove difficult because change is often seen as arduous."
"The incentive to overcome short term thinking in politics has increased in those countries which have applied for membership of the EU."
"They know that further change is required for membership."
"The requirement for change gains increased acceptance in this way."
"It is therefore especially important that, before membership negotiations begin, the Commission adopts the principle that new members will be accepted by order of merit , in other words, that objective qualifications will be the deciding factor."
"If a particular group of countries consider themselves chosen from the start, the enthusiasm for reform felt by them is reduced."
"If other countries feel that, even if they put more effort in than others and are really successful, they will still be left out, the desire to introduce reforms will be weakened, even if they should continue with the changes for their own sakes."
"The political leaders who have been particularly involved in pursuing these changes will be compromised if successful reforms do not meet with an appropriate response during the membership negotiations."
"It is particularly worth reminding ourselves of this view with regard to the three Baltic countries, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania."
"They have applied for membership of both the EU and NATO."
"I do not think that they should be made members of the EU just because they may not be able to become members of NATO."
"They must fulfil the requirements laid down for membership of the EU, both with regard to the Union and to themselves."
"But a particular country, or countries which are successful must also find themselves among the first new members of the EU and not left out in favour of another preselected group."
"It is in the EU's own wider interests to promote stability in this region which is sometimes the subject of threatening speeches arising from Russian domestic policy."
"This is one reason why the Commission should make greater efforts to get the four EU states which have not ratified the European Agreement with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to do so now; after all it is two years since this agreement was signed."
"Furthermore, the Commission ought to actively assist in concluding and approving border agreements with Russia in all cases and in so doing eliminate this area of uncertainty."
"It must not appear appropriate for Russia to create uncertainty because of a lack of clarity on border issues."
"One particular problem concerns the position of the Russian minority in Estonia and Latvia and of the many Russians who emigrated there during the Soviet era."
"I think that we can take these criticisms which sometimes come from the Russian side very lightly."
"This can be a difficult area but, in fact, the Baltic countries have managed to establish a relationship between citizen and immigrant which, in many respects, is better than that in many EU countries, even despite the fact that the minority is so much bigger here than in any other country."
"Of course it is possible to make further improvements."
"Establishing domestic harmony is in the interest of the Latvians and the Estonians as well."
"Co-operation in the Baltic Sea region as a whole can yield important results in a number of particular areas."
"The environment in the Baltic region was badly damaged during the Soviet era."
"There is now a huge repair job to be carried out with our joint forces."
"The joint fight against organised crime can also be mentioned as an area where combined efforts have been made and there is a strong chance that these will be successful within the framework of international co-operation."
"Russia is included as an active and interested party in the regional co-operation in the Baltic Sea region and in the Council of the Baltic Sea States ."
"This gives the region and the co-operation there special significance and weight."
"Successful co-operation between equal partners, with the EU as the driving force will in all probability yield significant benefits."
"The introduction of democracy in Russia and economic reforms there would make the whole of the Baltic Sea region a new peaceful source of strength in Europe, and this is what we have set our sights on."
"Mr President, the accession of Finland and Sweden and the association of Poland and the Baltic States have meant that the Baltic has become almost a European Union lake."
"The European Union therefore has a direct responsibility to gear its policies more closely to the Baltic region as a whole, rather than to the individual states of the Baltic seaboard."
"In doing so, we should make every effort to encourage the developing regional structures such as the Council of Baltic Sea States - as Mr Burenstam Linder just said - HELCOM, in the sector of environment policy, and other initiatives of a regional character."
"The aid framework envisaged by the Commission should provide for 'help for self-help' , which is now a major issue in the Baltic region, and should also make an effective contribution to the development of the private sector - small- and medium-sized enterprises, in other words."
"The Committee on External Economic Affairs therefore emphatically supports the conclusions reached by Mr Burenstam Linder's excellent report, which adopts this approach."
"We are particularly glad that our suggestions have been incorporated in full."
"There are three points of special interest to us here."
"First, there is the cross-border expansion of the infrastructures - roads, railways and ports."
"Secondly, however, we do urge that this should be done in an environment-friendly and environmentally compatible manner."
"In case of doubt, the redevelopment of existing facilities and stretches of road or rail should take precedence over new building and new lines of communication."
"Thirdly, co-operation between governments in the Baltic region needs to be supplemented by a continuous parliamentary dialogue between the European Union and the parliaments of the Baltic States."
"We feel that the President of the European Parliament and the Presidents of the Baltic seaboard states should take the necessary steps to ensure this."
"Mr President, the initiative for the Baltic Sea region which was taken by the Commission before the Baltic Sea Council's summit meeting in Visby was an important one."
"We must work towards creating closer ties between the EU and the Central and Eastern European States in the Baltic Sea Region."
"The Region is currently a unique platform for political dialogue and for the co-ordination of measures to promote democracy in Europe."
"The region is also important from the point of view of political stability."
"The Baltic States, for historical and geographical reasons, because of the occupation by the Soviet Union and the border with Russia, form a region subject to potential conflict, which in its turn could have consequences for the rest of Europe."
"This risk must be eliminated."
"This is best achieved by placing the countries firmly within the sphere of international co-operation."
"The role of Russia is also important."
"Russia must be integrated closely in the co-operation on the Baltic Sea region."
"Currently existing co-operation instruments must be used to the optimum to strengthen democracy, political stability and economic development in this region."
"The EU is an important organisation in this co-operation."
"The forthcoming enlargement is of great importance to the whole of the Baltic Sea region, indeed for the whole of Europe."
"This unique opportunity to unite Europe socially, culturally and economically must not be ignored."
"All the applicant countries must have the same chance to qualify for membership."
"No one shall be excluded from the discussions at the start. Everyone must start on one and the same starting line."
"In this respect it is important to view the Baltic States as three separate States and to treat them as such."
"Finally: the enlargement of the EU into a peaceful, united Europe must be kept separate from the enlargement of NATO's military defence alliance."
"International co-operation must be built on a peaceful note and must not remain in the shadow of the cold war."
"Mr President, I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteur."
"The report approaches Baltic cooperation in a very broad sense."
"Economic and security cooperation in the Baltic must stress the varied nature of security in the area."
"The political, economic and social situation of the states in the region varies, for there are both EU Member States and future Member States there, and the region is also an EU border region."
"Stability and security can only be increased by cooperation networks, in which grass-roots influence is essential."
"The process of EU enlargement will only have a real democratic basis when ordinary people, and not just states, feel that they are in the same boat as other Europeans."
"Baltic cooperation considers not only the integration process, - common regional needs, - but also the northern dimension."
"A policy for the north ought also to be a part of the Baltic strategy, because there are in Baltic policy more multiplier effects and elements increasing cohesion than in what is generally termed, 'Nordic policy'."
"However, this presupposes that it is understood that the Baltic region comprises the states of the Baltic together with their varying spheres of operation, including a northern dimension."
"Mr VÃ¤yrynen's amendments focus on the right issue, but approach the question from the opposite direction."
"It is easy to endorse the principles of the Kalmar action programme, namely citizen participation, sustainable development and environmental cooperation in the region."
"More binding provisions are needed."
"In the Baltic States region there are opportunities and threats, including environmental protection and nuclear safety."
"It is important that the meeting of the Baltic Council this month will also make evaluations of the implementation of the programme."
"The areas own cooperation and priorities are of primary importance."
"The Union is only one protagonist in this cooperation."
"Among the EU Member States, ratification of the Europe Agreements is being held up by two 'snails', Belgium and France."
"In evaluating the applicant states, the Commission should realise that in the border dispute between Estonia and Russia the ball is in Russia's court."
"The Commission should also decide soon whether it will act on Parliament's demands to begin negotiations simultaneously with the applicant countries, for the clock is ticking inexorably on towards July."
"Mr President, just as membership of the European Union has meant increased security for Sweden and Finland, it will also mean increased security for our neighbours along the Baltic Sea, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland the day they become members of the European Union."
"Not only will their security be enhanced but also the security of Europe which makes it extremely important for us all that these countries become members as quickly as possible."
"This is why it is also important that we do not place further conditions on those who are applying for membership other than that they must fulfil the requirements, the conditions of membership."
"This alone must be the deciding factor."
"It is in the interests of the security of Europe that we open our arms to these countries."
"The European Agreement is an important part of this and an important step towards membership."
"This is why it is incomprehensible that a number of countries - out of pure laziness as far as I can understand - have still not ratified the European Agreement which exists with the Baltic States."
"Let me also point out that it must be an absolute requirement that those countries seeking membership - and that includes the countries surrounding the Baltic Sea which are currently applying - fulfil the requirements that we have stipulated on human rights."
"We will help them in this, but it is really important that we do lay down requirements which must, for example, include everything stipulated by the Commission and also the requirement that they abolish the death sentence."
"Finally, I would like to say thank you to Mr Burenstam Linder for an excellent report."
"It is a truly high quality report well in line with that which his predecessor from the Moderate Coalition Party, Margaretha af Ugglas gave to Parliament on the same subject."
"Mr President, it is important that the Union gives its full support to regional cooperation in the Baltic region, because it will create prosperity and stability for the whole continent."
"For example, trade between the EU countries and the 'transitional economies' is expected to quadruple in the next few years in the Baltic region."
"The Commission's role in Baltic cooperation is currently too modest."
"It must move from observation and coordination to fully-fledged participation."
"The Agenda 21 programme for sustainable development is currently under preparation in the Baltic region, as the report mentions."
"The Commission is also involved in the creation of programmes, but with a very small input."
"In my opinion, Parliament should insist that the Commission increase its input into the Agenda 21 programme."
"The traditional concept of military security has lost its meaning in the Baltic region as elsewhere."
"On the other hand, environmental questions, stable, democratic and socially just development in the 'transitional economy' countries, minority issues and the prevention of crime and terrorism are even more important."
"The development of cooperation in the Baltic region calls for cooperation to be built up with Russia, too."
"Mr President, Parliament should promote the conclusion of a border agreement between Russia and Estonia, because it is a precondition for the development of cooperation among the states of the Baltic region."
"Mr President, with the EU facing the challenge of making an effective contribution to the development and stability of the Baltic region and the final abolition of frontiers within Europe, the Commission's communication falls far short of the mark, and to call it an initiative is an embarrassing misnomer."
"In an area where regional and local relations have existed for centuries the objective, now that the Iron Curtain has fallen, must be to pull aside the silver curtain too by making greater efforts to close the gap in living standards and strengthen democratic reforms, rather than setting up new frontiers by means of the Schengen Accords."
"What is needed here is a second stability pact to follow on from the one adopted in 1993, with a programme adapted to the new situation which will develop the Baltic region as a model of stability, democracy and disarmament, and so provide an effective response to the security needs of the states of central and eastern Europe, especially such small countries as the Baltic States."
"Let us put the clocks back to December 1995."
"The European Council meets in Madrid and decides that an approach be adopted to the preparations for EU enlargement guaranteeing that the applicant countries will be treated on an equal footing."
"I strongly supported that line, and still do."
"It is very important from the point of view of stability in the applicant countries that we do not start making pronouncements on which ones are more eligible than others and are more deserving of EU membership."
"In his original draft for the report, the rapporteur did advocate a strategy on those lines, which is neither reasonable nor well thought out."
"Fortunately my Swedish colleague, Mrs Theorin, made sure that the report in its final form would make it clear that only when all the applicant countries were lined up at the same starting point and the negotiations had got underway would consideration be given to which countries best met the conditions for accession."
"Cooperation in the Baltic Sea region could be strengthened by a specific Baltic Sea Programme."
"The Council of the Baltic Sea States could be the focal point for such cooperation and could participate in the political process as a responsible partner."
"The many good initiatives for which budget lines already exist could be brought together in a proper Baltic Sea Programme."
"The common economic objectives awaiting political implementation are obvious."
"They relate to energy, transport and the environment."
"The development of a pattern of trade is something else, but equally important."
"Finally, I must stress how important I think it is that, if after the start of negotiations the conditions for accession are found to be met by one or more of the Baltic countries and they therefore qualify for membership, existing EU members must not put obstacles based on historical considerations or strategic self-interest in the way of their accession."
"Mr President, I too would like to offer my congratulations to Mr Burenstam Linder."
"He has succeeded in producing a synthesis of penetrating analyses and far-sighted visions. And those visions can become reality if opportunities are consistently taken and risks are minimized."
"Nor has the rapporteur disregarded the necessary next steps, and it is one of those necessary next steps on which I should like to focus."
"In paragraph 1, the rapporteur calls upon the institutions to promote the full ratification of the Europe Agreements with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania."
"When we vote on this report tomorrow, those agreements will be precisely two years old - they were signed back on 12 June 1995."
"So the rapporteur is more than justified in calling for ratification, and it is also in the interests of the European Parliament."
"Because, after ratification by all Member States and the Council, the existing delegations can be reconstituted as joint parliamentary committees, which is not just a formality but secures binding participation in a structured dialogue."
"It secures the participation of the European Parliament and of the respective national parliaments in the structuring of the treaties, in the defining of political focuses and priorities, and in control."
"We thus secure the right to influence the complex processes of adjustment that are going to be necessary both in those states that wish to join the Union and in the Union itself."
"Especially in the Baltic region, there is a need both for closer co-operation and for the rapid acceptance of new Member States."
"Because it is precisely here that we have the opportunity, in the future, to involve Russia, too, more closely in regional co-operation and so make an essential contribution to stability."
"Mr President, Mr Burenstam Linder has tabled a very good report on Baltic cooperation."
"I congratulate him on it."
"On behalf of the Liberal Group I have tabled two additional amendments referring to cooperation in the Barents Sea area."
"They are based on the report by Mr Tindemans adopted in May."
"As Mr Tindemans said in his report, the Baltic and Barents Sea cooperation areas partly overlap."
"In addition, all the Member States of the Barents Sea Council are also members of the Council of Baltic States and the Commission is involved in both on the same terms."
"According to the Tindemans report the Union should have a comprehensive policy for northern regions, in the context of which cooperation in the Barents Sea region should be developed."
"My amendments seek to obtain a definition by the Union of the position of Barents Sea region cooperation in the Union's policy on northern regions and its relationship to cooperation in the Baltic region."
"I hope my amendments will be adopted."
"Thank you, Sir Leon."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Equal pay for women and men"
"The next item is the report (A4-0143/97) by Mr GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the Commission communication - a code of practice on the implementation of equal pay for work of equal value for women and men (COM(96)0336 - C4-0460/96) Rapporteur for an opinion(): Colombo Svevo for the Committee on Womens' Rights ( Hughes procedure)."
"Mr President, I think that we should begin by thanking Mrs Colombo for her work, which complemented that done by us in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and expressing our thanks also to members of that committee - Waddington, Wolf and SchÃ¶rling - who tabled amendments."
"These amendments definitely enriched this report and simply seemed very important to me."
"One of them referred to the effect of public spending cuts on aspects such as health and education, where female employment rates are very high, and the fact that those cuts can harm women's job chances."
"Certain amendments provided for Code measures to be taken not only in favour of a group but all workers, i.e. all female workers, who often have so-called 'rubbish' contracts or work part-time. Susan Waddington's amendment is also important - it analyses the effect of the Code and looks at whether it might not be more effective to turn it into a legal instrument within three years."
"To sum up, the Code is addressed to the social partners, governments and associations."
"It also sets down guidelines for analysing pay structures and assessing jobs and, as a prior step, the compilation of adequate information on pay systems - which differ from country to country - and the study of collective bargaining procedures, to determine where action must be taken to avoid wage discrimination."
"Twenty years after the 1975 Directive was adopted, it can be noted - as Mrs Colombo does and the European Union's own statistics bear out - that there is still a 20-30 % wage differential between women and men doing work of the same value."
"According to other statistics, only 20 % of contracts deal with the problem of inequality between women and men."
"We still have a long way to go."
"I must say that I am slightly sceptical about voluntary agreements, because if we cannot apply compulsory legislation I do not see how we can be expected to comply with voluntary agreements, such as the Code of Conduct between employers and the various social partners."
"However, given that there are still salary differences and that legislation has been unable to reduce them, it seems that any measure that we can take might be of use."
"One formula that might be useful would be first of all to encourage training and information for women so that they can accede to collective bargaining."
"Secondly, to foster the presence of women in company committees. At present it is men who discuss women's problems and defend their rights but it is really up to women to defend their own rights."
"The current precariousness of employment - as is stated in one of the amendments - and public spending cuts do nothing to help the situation."
"We believe that the public sector would probably give a good example to private initiative if it adopted measures to continue to reduce pay differentials."
"We think that transparency is needed not only for assessing jobs but also for collective bargaining."
"We must raise awareness of social partners and inform them, and disseminate the Code, not only in large companies, not only among the social partners, not only among governments, but also among the SMEs which create more than 85 % of jobs in the European Union."
"I should also add that women's associations should be informed."
"We rapporteurs shall do our best to make sure that women's associations hear about the Code so that they can use it as an instrument to defend their rights."
"We should also consider extending Article 119 now that the IGC is coming to a close."
"If that article were to be extended, equal pay for work of equal value would then be enshrined in the new Treaty."
"Mr President, the Committee on Women's Rights has obviously taken an interest in this report and thanks the rapporteur for having accepted a large number of its proposed amendments."
"Our interest is clear because, as you know, this form of equality is to some extent the mother of all other forms of equality and it is on this form of equality that we have built all the others."
"So it is paradoxical that while it has served as the basis for greater equality in other fields and other rights, both social and political, equal pay for equal work is still not properly applied in our countries."
"Just recently, at a trade union conference, it was confirmed that women are earning 20 per cent less on average in Europe, and averages, as we know, very modestly conceal disparities which are even more serious in reality."
"Worse still, because of casual work, wage differentials are now increasing in countries where they were previously less significant."
"As these unequal conditions are persisting despite the existence of laws on formal equality, while the Committee on Women's Rights recognizes that the code is certainly a weak instrument, it nevertheless feels it may prove strong enough to reveal the mechanisms which conceal the disparities and thus help identify systems which could become more binding in the future."
"These hidden mechanisms are now going to be revealed: how a job is evaluated, how the evaluation systems come into being and how they are applied, how the payment system is constructed, and why this disparity even lurks in collective agreements."
"A second point is that the code will be part of the memorandum."
"It is one part of it, not the whole and it does not replace it, but although we think it can be improved, this code is not superficial, it is incisive because it leads to an analysis of the payment system ranging from collection of the relevant data to evaluation of that data."
"After analysis there is also corrective action against discrimination on pay, and, finally, it also provides an evaluation of the application of such action."
"The third point highlighted by the committee is that the code has its own internal logic and therefore operates in that logic. The committee believes this mechanism can only be effective and productive with one essential prerequisite: transparency."
"Without transparency nothing can be achieved. There must also be widespread diffusion of information through an awareness campaign, training of experts, and above all an exchange of good practice including following an evaluation to completion, which will also reassure those of us who are a little sceptical that this is a useful initiative even if it does not solve the problem - as long as no-one cheats, of course!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, the report we are considering relates to the Commission's proposal for a code of practice on the implementation of the principle of equal pay for work of equal value for women and men."
"It is a good report."
"I share the view of many other Honourable Members as to both the report and the code of practice."
"We have made no progress at all in recent years with legislation to ensure equal pay for men and women."
"The only reference to equality, in the European Union Treaty is Article 119, which in fact is specifically confined to questions of pay."
"Women are demonstrably underpaid in all Member States, and this article has brought them nothing more than a gleam of hope."
"Women are not asking for preferential treatment - they are simply asking to be paid the same as their male colleagues for doing work of equal value."
"Surely that cannot be too much to ask!"
"Editorials and soap box oratory have achieved nothing, nor have applications to the Court of Justice."
"So something must be done, something to provide clear guidance to employees of both sexes - not just empty wrapping, not more theoretical protestations, but a genuine guideline."
"Well, the code of practice can fulfil this need precisely and help bring about a genuine improvement in the pay principle."
"It will be a practical toolkit for the social partners, focusing on a form of job classification and evaluation that is nondiscriminatory and free of any misinterpretation regarding job content and performance."
"From the start, we have been very reliant on good co-operation from the social partners, without whose active participation the code of practice on equal pay is doomed to be yet another failure."
"A few points in the report make me uncomfortable, for that reason."
"If we start demanding the right to interfere in collective bargaining and the resulting agreements, and if we threaten sanctions if the necessary legislation is not complied with, I can only say that although we have to have control, we should ensure a form of communication based on mutual respect."
"There is another point I regard as largely nonsensical."
"Up-to-date comparisons of pay levels are needed, but they can only be possible within one sector."
"Inter-sectoral comparisons - which is what the report calls for - are totally unrealistic."
"You cannot compare a coal miner's job with that of a secretary or a care worker."
"It makes no difference whether the employer is the same or not."
"The critical point really is the job as such, and indeed the text states as much."
"You can only compare a female cook with a male cook, not throw everybody into the same comparison."
"I hope we shall find many allies to support this code of practice so that in this case women's hopes are fulfilled by genuine equality, even if only in matters of pay."
"Mr President, the policy of equality must be pursued at every political level in national parliaments and at a European level."
"One of the most important issues of equality is equal pay for equal work."
"This ought to be taken as read now that we are approaching the year 2000, but it isn't."
"The code of practice proposed by the Commission and the report drawn up by Mrs Gonzalez Alvarez are important steps towards realising the objective of equal pay."
"Unemployment affects women more than men."
"We must improve the opportunities for women to get and keep jobs."
"The labour market must be broadened for women."
"Here are a number of suggestions which I think would facilitate such a development: longer parental leave and equal opportunities for paid employment and parenting for both men and women."
"In Sweden and in other countries the public sector is very important in providing work, equality and equal pay for both women and men, but particularly for women."
"Cutbacks in this sector can have a negative impact on development which must not be allowed to happen."
"Mr President, support this excellent report!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the GonzÃ¡lez report and I must congratulate her but the Commission proposal on the Code seems insufficient to me."
"According to the Commission's annual report on equal opportunities, dating back to 1966, only countries that systematically and strictly applied systems to correct inequalities manage to eliminate those differences."
"That is the case of Sweden."
"However, the Code deals with equality in terms of women's and men's wages, but it is only voluntarily applied by governments, employers and workers' representatives."
"More radical action is needed in order to achieve wage equality and to eliminate labour segregation."
"Let me give one example: information supplied by the Staff DG and its equal opportunities unit, covering all European institutions."
"In its 1996 report, it says that in Group A, there are 18.91 % women and 81.09 % men. In group C the figures are 71.16 % women and 20.84 % men."
"I would ask you to pledge that, in accordance with paragraph 16 of the motion for a resolution, if in three years' time the Code has still failed to achieve the desired results, it will be transformed into a genuinely binding legal instrument."
"Mr President, I should also like to thank and congratulate Mrs GonzÃ¡lez Alvarez and Mrs Colombo on this magnificent report."
"I must say that I am not very optimistic that it will have the effect that most if not all of the European Parliament would like it to have."
"I am not optimistic because, if a Directive of over 20 months ago, which must be enforced, has not had the necessary effect, and would have ruled out the need for this report, a voluntary proposal is bound to have even less effect."
"This is a good report, even so; we must make the Council, which represents the governments, more aware of the need for this initiative as well as other authorities, at regional and local level, and through public and private companies, to put this instrument into practice, as its application is fully justified in my view."
"We should also raise the awareness of the social partners: trade unions, businessmen, women's associations and others, which are already very aware and fighting for equal rights on a day to day basis."
"I hope that the Commission will give this proposal support and follow it up."
"I would even go as far as to say that, if in three years' time the Code is ineffectual, we should introduce binding regulations."
"I have a little less confidence in the Council, as I said earlier."
"There are few things that affect the dignity of individuals and offend people as much as these. It is not right for women doing exactly the same work as men to be receiving 20, 25 or even 40 % less."
"It is for the European Parliament to demand equal opportunities and I think that this is an interesting subject for us to follow up."
"Mr President, at a time when the phenomenon of the new poverty, especially amongst women, is being discussed with growing concern, I can only agree on the need to inject a code of practice into the application of equal pay between the two sexes."
"I particularly agree if that code is not limited to general statements of principle, but succeeds in guaranteeing concrete application of national legislation on pay, and hence also provides real and appropriate processes and sanctions."
"I also believe it is important not to restrict the information and awareness campaign on this code to the social partners and large firms, but there should be maximum effort to publicize it amongst those women - and they represent the majority - who are employed in small and very small work places, women who are not in unions and are often forced into really casual work and precarious contractual conditions, which barely fall short of exploitation."
"The governments of the member countries of the union have the main responsibility for guaranteeing the success of this code, but too often they pretend not to know of the existence of such discrimination, or anyway fail to intervene positively to remove it."
"Those who govern cannot have a clear conscience just because they have changed laws, codes or regulations, if they then do not have the political will to monitor their effective application constantly."
"As Mrs Colombo Svevo has already said, and I compliment her, this code, like any other instrument or procedure, makes sense and can work only on condition that no-one cheats."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mrs GonzÃ¡lez and Mrs Colombo Svevo."
"I am also pleased that there are male colleagues speaking this evening on this issue."
"But allow me to convey to them a certain sense of bitterness which I cannot help but feel."
"Certainly, we can agree on the fact that there exists a considerable legal corpus in the European Union on the issue of equal opportunities and equal pay: article 119 of the treaty, which we all hope will be improved in the next treaty, article 6 of the social protocol, numerous directives and judgements of the Court of Justice."
"We also hope that the Council will quickly approve, on the basis of Parliament's recommendations, the directive on the burden of proof, which provides a precise definition of indirect discrimination for the first time."
"Finally, we have a series of relevant programmes financed from the Union budget, which the member countries as a whole have promoted and contributed to, making the application of the right to equal pay and equal opportunities a general given."
"But I have this sense of bitterness because, despite all this, the code of practice we are discussing tonight is important because the fact is, women's pay is still lower than men's in Europe by an average of about 30 per cent."
"In some sectors women receive a lower salary not just for work of equal value, but for the same work; there is occupational segregation, both horizontal and vertical, and discrimination, as others have mentioned, is on the increase because casual work with few guarantees is increasing, and this discrimination also exists in the pension schemes."
"So, if all this is true, this code of practice is welcome provided that it contains the features the two rapporteurs recommend in their reports and provided that, after three years, if the results are not good enough, it really becomes binding on everyone."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the principle of equal pay for work of equal value, as between men and women, exists only on paper."
"Reality is something very different."
"Even today, women earn on average 30 % less than men - even now, more than 20 years after a directive on equal remuneration was passed."
"Women are over-represented in the low-pay sector, and the recent recession widened the gap between women's and men's earnings."
"The fact that women are disadvantaged is also apparent in the training sector, in the fact that they are diverted into so-called typical women's jobs - often part-time jobs offering no social security - and the prevention of career advancement and access to management positions."
"But complaining in itself achieves nothing."
"If change and effective action are to be achieved, specific analyses are needed."
"The Commission has adopted the suggestions made by the European Parliament in producing a code of practice as a basis for eliminating sex discrimination from the working world."
"The intention is to examine what kinds of professional inequality exist, whether discrimination is being disguised by paying men additional bonuses, or whether job evaluations are quite simply one-sided."
"The progress achieved is to be documented, as are successful model projects."
"The action plan is to be produced by stages, in co-operation with the social partners."
"They are to receive training and information and their awareness is to be improved so as to ensure precise compliance with the principle of nondiscrimination in future pay agreements."
"Finally, women are to be much better represented than previously in collective bargaining, with full involvement to protect their own interests."
"The European Commission's initiative, Commissioner Flynn, if you take due account of the suggestions made by the Committee on Women's Rights and the Employment Committee, and this valuable report, is an important step towards a more just working world."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are happy to have this occasion to discuss this excellent report just before what we hope is going to be the conclusion of the final text of the new European Amsterdam Treaty."
"The code of conduct on equal pay for equal work will certainly gain importance thanks to the rewording of Article 119 which finally takes into account the Court of Justice's case-law and recognizes the right to equal pay for equal work."
"I fully agree with the rapporteur when he declares that women should be involved in working out employment evaluation systems and collective bargaining negotiations."
"As long as wage negotiations are conducted by men, wage discrimination will continue to exist."
"As my colleagues have just emphasized, we should consider adopting a legally binding instrument if the voluntary code of conduct does not lead to the hoped for results."
"In my country, the minister intends to impose employment assessment on labour regulations."
"I think it would be a good thing if all the other Member States followed suit."
"Mr President, I would like to thank both rapporteurs for a really first-class report and at the same time also thank the Commission for an excellent communication on a code of practice."
"Those of us who have spoken here can testify that the legislation in place has been inadequate."
"Legislation is important but, on its own, it is not sufficient."
"Much more is needed alongside it."
"Even in my homeland, Sweden, which often congratulates itself on having made more progress than other countries in improving the participation of women in working life and reducing wage differentials, even here there are differences between the situation for men and women."
"These differences have tended to increase during the recession which we have experienced in recent years."
"Many changes are needed."
"The labour market needs to change."
"Currently it is women who have the low paid jobs, who work within the public sector, who have part time jobs and atypical work patterns."
"We must ensure that this type of work also brings with it social security as other jobs do."
"We must ensure that those women who work part-time have the opportunity to change to full-time and we must allow positive discrimination so that men can take on women's jobs but also so that women can enter the male-dominated professions."
"Furthermore we must have gender-neutral job evaluation."
"I do not share Mrs Glase's opinion on this point."
"It is possible to evaluate work in different sectors."
"It must be possible to compare the work undertaken by a woman caring for the elderly with that of a builder."
"They are both equally hard and demanding jobs."
"Although legislation is important, this is really a matter for the partners in the labour market."
"We must get them to take these matters seriously."
"Only when we get the partners in the labour market to do this will we have any chance of success in this work."
"Mr President, the communication is good because it draws attention to the fact that women have qualifications to bring to the labour market."
"But efforts over the years to define the concrete value of these more invisible or informal qualifications have come to nothing."
"If it is now made absolutely clear that these qualifications are indispensable and worth paying for, perhaps we can move a step further and release women from rigid pay structures."
"The communication rightly stresses the role of the social partners."
"It is important that the trade unions should play a central role in the achievement of equal pay and it is therefore crucial, as the communication points out, that women should be involved in the negotiation of agreements."
"The worst enemy of equal pay is a decentralized, fragmented and individualized labour market."
"Experience in Denmark shows that, when there is a move from central to decentralized pay negotiations, the pay gap widens."
"In Denmark the pay differential is DKR 60 000 per year."
"Only a committed male chauvinist or a bad employer can accept that."
"The trade unions are in a unique position to lead the way in laying the foundations for a more modern way of assessing men's and women's work."
"We hope that the Commission communication may help to promote development in the right direction."
"In this matter we men must show solidarity with women."
"Anything else would be disreputable."
"Do you not think so, Commissioner Flynn?"
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"I can inform the House that eight women and six men took part in the debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"New information and communications technologies (ICT)"
"The next item is the report (A4-0153/97) by Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy on the development of new information and communications technologies (ICT) in the next decade."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, my report and the resolution before us this evening are the result of an own initiative of the Committee on Research and Technological Development."
"This committee attaches considerable importance to the development of the information and communication technology sector in Europe."
"Despite the large number of documents already conveyed by the European Commission to the European Parliament on the information society, my committee had no clear analysis of the information and communications technology sector."
"Given the importance of the ICTs for creating jobs in Europe, my report contains recommendations aimed at stimulating a climate likely to help new ICT products and services develop and, does so in keeping with the fifth framework programme due to run in this sector from 1999 to 2004."
"The economic sectors opening the most promising prospects for the coming years lie in the electronics industry, information technology and the services linked to these sectors."
"As far as job prospects are concerned, it is very important that growth in these sectors be monitored."
"Europe is rapidly losing ground in the world ICT market."
"In 1990, Europe's share was 35 % but this had gone down to 28 % by 1996."
"Europe is stuck in the middle , that is the conclusion of an assessment carried out under the Dutch Presidency on the European ICT industries' competitive capacities."
"The fall in the market share is remarkable because Europe could have an excellent scientific infrastructure."
"Numerous new technologies have been developed in Europe in recent years, but they have not been applied."
"We only have to think, for example, of high definition television."
"We could, for example, learn the following lesson: development does not only have to have a technical aspect."
"A great deal of technology fails to be introduced successfully onto the market."
"Marketing remains the key to market success."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot leave everything to the market."
"This may not sound very liberal but, to begin with, the authorities must become good users of electronic services and products."
"Both national and European authorities must act as catalysts and set good examples."
"In other words they must show the way."
"How can we convince European citizens to use ICT products unless the authorities do the same."
"By setting themselves up as leading consumers or launching consumers of numerical services and products, the authorities can have considerable influence on certain local, regional, national and European segments of the market such as health care, the policy on the elderly, transport, education and encouraging the application of the ICTs."
"What important role can Europe and the Member States play?"
"First of all we need a stronger legislative framework."
"At European and national levels."
"We must strengthen Europe's position on the world information and communications technology market. This means that we must find legal solutions to solve problems linked to the unlawful use of software."
"Standardization, legislation on patents and registered trade marks must also be better regulated."
"We must also inscribe into European legislation the fact that telecommunication technologies and information technologies are coming closer together."
"This development cannot be halted by legislative lacunae."
"In short, Member States must improve the harmonization of their ICT policy."
"Only once this condition has been met can a European market come into being."
"R&D programmes currently being implemented under the fourth framework programme are not enough to strengthen the European position in the ICT sector."
"In the perspective of the fifth framework programme, we must analyze the contribution of these programmes to the Europe's economic well-being."
"These analyses should make it possible to work out the best practices likely to contribute to the strengthening of the effectiveness of future programmes."
"Finally, I should like to come back to the importance of the ICT sector for the job market. The ICT policy should not only be aimed at large undertakings but also small and medium-sized firms."
"Greater attention should also be paid to the innovative capacity of SMEs."
"I therefore hope, and I shall take a personal interest in this, that SMEs will not be left out when programmes for the fifth framework programme are being selected."
"Mr President, congratulations to Mrs Plooij, who is a good speaker, but more importantly, a very good listener."
"She obviously listened during the debates in the committee on her report and has incorporated many of the ideas which came up."
"We have own-initiative reports because we wish to highlight issues often to do with forthcoming legislation."
"That is the case here, this is part of our committee's thinking process for the fifth framework programme."
"Should we continue the emphasis on information and communication technologies which has been present in the fourth framework programme?"
"Look at the title of the own-initiative report, it is both the development and the application of information and communication technologies in the next decade and it is important that we look not just at the technology itself, but at the application."
"This is a well-focused report with concrete suggestions."
"First of all competitiveness of the European Union."
"We are heartily sick of this syndrome invented in the EU, made in Japan, and we have to change that mentality."
"Mrs Plooij warns us very starkly that our competitiveness is falling."
"I have recently been warned by research scientists in my own constituency who have visited South-East Asia that we are kidding ourselves if we imagine that they are not about to overtake us."
"They send students to learn from what we are doing, go back and improve it."
"We are complacent and do not visit those countries to see what is happening."
"The United States, as a free market capitalist society, is very keen on intervention to help its industries. We should copy that too."
"Some of the factors involved in competitiveness include - as Mrs Plooij has identified - the single market and coordination and compatibility between Member States."
"But the single market on its own is not enough."
"We have to have regulation, to look at things like public service obligations, important in this field, our cohesion policies, support for smalland medium-sized enterprises."
"I am constantly visiting little workshops where people who used to work for big IT firms like Alcatel have gone off on their own and have decided to use their ideas - a huge growth area."
"We have to look at the societal implications of ICT, the environmental benefits that can come from it with things like less travelling to work."
"And the societal implications include misuse, pornography, etc., applications, health, education."
"What a big advantage we have with our linguistic variety, including two world languages, English and Spanish - and I must say French of course, with Mrs Cresson here."
"Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel is right to say it is not just quantitative, it is qualitative much more than growth."
"This is the lives of our citizens."
"Well done, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel."
"Mr President, let me begin by congratulating the rapporteur on her report."
"The whole field of information and communications technology is vital to our lifestyle and economy."
"I realized that in a very practical way this week: the television monitor in my office was not working when I arrived."
"Indeed, it did not work at the last Strasbourg part-session either, despite the efforts of the services here."
"Finally, yesterday evening, the picture and sound were restored."
"At last I could see where the meetings were that I was supposed to attend, and I could even see the news on BBC World, giving details of that most important election - the Conservative Party leadership."
"But while the equipment did not work, I felt severely handicapped."
"I reflected that the equipment was supplied by a nationalized company in a country which still has to address the imbalance of an economy where too much is in the public sector and protected from the pressures of competition."
"It is common ground that this sector - ICT - is one of the most dynamic growth industries in the world."
"Opening up the telecoms market to competition has contributed a great impetus to growth and innovation in the UK and will do the same for Europe as a whole from next year."
"In this report there are calls for Member States to coordinate their policies better, as well as calls for the Commission to develop a new ICT policy."
"Why?"
"I say: go with the forces of competition and innovation, do not try to second-guess the market or pick winners, because it does not work."
"It is better perhaps to focus public resources on identifiable challenges, such as planning for the enormous change and cost of introducing the single currency, or, even more important, finding a solution to the so-called millennium time-bomb of computers that will not recognize the year 2000 and then crash."
"On second thoughts, the markets could find solutions to the single currency issue, as we found in September 1992."
"I hear of enterprises in the UK already offering solutions to the date challenge."
"We live in interesting times."
"That is my speech."
"I now embark upon an exercise in Dutch-English cooperation."
"My colleague Mr van Velzen apologizes for not being here and I speak to his notes, so please make allowances for my Dutch-English."
"The EPP Group supports the main line of this report."
"We in the European Union can draw lessons from the United States."
"That does not mean that Mrs Cresson must write a book about ICT, but that the European Union should play an active role in developing ICT."
"The question is: what should this role be?"
"Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel gives some answers: better internal market rules, priority for ICT in the fifth framework, priority for ICT in the cohesion policy and better conditions, better priority, for investment in ICT."
"Yet, Mr van Velzen misses one thing in the Plooij-van Gorsel report: coordination."
"There is a risk of incoherent policies in Member States and the EU."
"This report covers nearly every aspect of policy."
"Mr van Velzen wants to make one suggestion, and that is on the division of competences within the Commission."
"Why not appoint one Commissioner responsible for ICT policy in general but, above all, for general coordination between the different directorates-general?"
"If we can organize our ICT policies well, this could give us an important competitive advantage because we will have integrated European information and communication technologies."
"Mr van Velzen awaits the Commissioner's response with interest."
"That concludes my second speech."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, the report by Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel returns to the theme of the information society, its applications and the development of the market."
"It is a balanced document, rich in ideas, which takes up virtually all the suggestions we made in the Committee on Research."
"I will dwell on just two points."
"My view, and I would also say my experience of the growth and spread of the information society, is that the most important limiting factors which need to be dealt with are essentially the cost of access to on-line information and the cultural factors."
"I will try to explain that better."
"On the cost side, I think the costs of equipment and services may come down thanks to the liberalization of telecommunications, but while it is true that computers are costing less all the time, I have yet to see significant effects on telephone bills."
"The gap to be made up by comparison with the United States in terms of the cost of services is really huge."
"As regards the cultural barrier, applications for direct purchasing of software, electronic commerce, are now appearing on the Internet, but these applications are essentially American."
"The gap is increasing because of the language problem, and it now seems difficult to surf the Internet without knowing English."
"Too little is still done in Europe about teaching so-called foreign languages in school, and not enough is being done to overcome the language barrier by using the technology of the information society."
"Too little is also done on use of and familiarization with the computer in schools."
"My son started school in the United States and when we returned to Europe he received letters from his 9 year-old American schoolfriends, all written on computers."
"Those little boys found it easier to use a keyboard than a pen."
"European schools are not giving our young people the best opportunities in this emerging world of telecommunications, and I fear this will prove an important strategic disadvantage."
"European governments must respond decisively and urgently."
"Mr President, as far as this excellent report by Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel is concerned I would just like to stress seven points very quickly in my short minute."
"First, IT must be used more in the peripheral regions of the EU."
"It is extremely important and it is also those living in these regions who will benefit most from it."
"Second, IT must also be used to support the elderly population."
"Young people have already mastered IT and communication technology very well."
"But it is elderly people who can also draw great benefit from the technology for example when they are unable to go out and shop and can instead order food via their computer at home."
"Third, we must concentrate on small companies."
"Large companies already have enough computers."
"Fourth, IT must be user-friendly so that the majority of the population can use it."
"Fifth, we must, as Mr Chichester has mentioned, find out what is going to happen in the year 2000?"
"What will happen then?"
"Sixth, bureaucracy in the EU programme must be reduced."
"Seventh and last, the European Parliament must set a good example."
"It is a disgrace that we do not make better use of IT communications in this House."
"Things cannot get any worse than they are currently, only better."
"I hope that things will be much better in the future."
"Mr President, this report deals with a deeply interesting and fascinating subject."
"It clearly shows how far the European ICT sector has fallen behind its non-European competitors, especially those in the USA."
"I hope this report will rouse the Commission to action, because it will be an important function of the EU to take specific steps in this precise area and make selective use of resources to ensure that Europe remains competitive."
"To single out a few important points: concentration on new products and vertical market segments, such as telemedicine, voice processing or distance learning, special consideration for SMEs, especially those in the tourist sector, for which additional market conditions and booking facilities are being opened up and in which jobs can be created with the aid of modern communications technology."
"The necessary positive motivation and favourable attitude can best be achieved by making greater use of information technology in the education and training sectors."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this European Parliament owninitiative report comes at a particularly timely moment for recalling the acceleration of the information and communication technologies, in particular concerning the economic and social dimension of their impact."
"The Commission is fully aware of that and I should like to quote some examples."
"First of all, recent communications on the information society and the action plan, now in its second version."
"Secondly, the activities that I have initiated in the field of education and which have been discussed by several Councils of education ministers, in particular the programme on learning in the information society, aimed at making available to schoolchildren the necessary multimedia resources, based on examples already existing in certain countries, especially in Scandinavia, initiatives that are now becoming more widespread."
"We insist very much on this point. Most of the Member States have now worked out school equipment programmes but the question of educational software is also posed."
"I have set up a task force on educational software programmes, bringing together producers, users, authorities and specialists."
"We have made a lot of progress on this over the last two years."
"The tools provided by the information and communication technologies, such as Multimedia and the Internet, are to play a vital role in daily life."
"In all our programmes, especially the local development ones, we are giving enormous help to local authorities using these arrangements in order, for example, to facilitate access to employment, and disseminating information needed by our fellow citizens."
"The fifth framework programme of research and technological development was transmitted at the end of April 1997."
"I am waiting for the European Parliament to issue its opinion very shortly, at first reading. A swift reply would show the Council on Research the importance that it attaches to research."
"For that, we must stick to the codecision timetable for the fifth framework programme and the 'Research Council' must reach its common position by its November meeting at the latest."
"Research plays a vital role in advanced technology and industrial competitiveness."
"This is especially true of information and communication industries."
"One of the three themes of the fifth programme is related to information and communication technologies, while the other two substantially refer to them."
"I should just like to mention the key actions that we have taken such as products, processes and organisations and key actions such as 'New prospects for aeronautics' or 'Tomorrow's cities' ."
"In all these sectors, we call on advanced communications technologies."
"Piloting programmes and actions, in accordance with their economic and social impact, are inscribed in the very structure of the proposal relating to the fifth framework programme."
"The European Parliament's message in its report is a clear one."
"The approach to ICTs must be comprehensive and it must be adequately effective."
"The Commission shares this view point."
"The development of an information society, far from creating a two-speed society, can provide the means for narrowing the gap between different social groups or between developed and less favoured regions."
"The first experiments under way have shown that the gap can easily be narrowed between urban and rural areas, in terms of education and even health, and that these are instruments that can enable less favoured categories and regions to gain access to certain services."
"The Commission goes along in particular with the final recommendation in the report, i.e. the need to see to sustainable, environment-friendly development and social well-being, alongside economic growth."
"Those are exactly our aims and you have taken the words out of our mouths."
"I should like to conclude by saying that the Commission welcomes all your recommendations, in particular those addressed to it, and will pay special attention to your report when carrying out those actions in this field for which it is responsible."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Research and sustainable development"
"The next item is the second report (A4-0170/97) by Mr Marset Campos on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy on the Community policy for research and sustainable development."
"Mr President, there are three starting-points to my report:"
"First, the decisive will expressed in the Treaty on European Union and the current proposals on revising the Treaty, in favour of sustainable development."
"In other words, the European Union is proclaiming its unequivocal support for the sustainable development model, including respect for the environment, and expressing inter-generational solidarity."
"Secondly, the fact that, despite all the declarations of good intentions, development in Europe and the world is that of growing consumption of energy resources and prime materials and growing pollution and a subsequent exhaustion of natural resources."
"Thirdly, the fact that market forces, left to free competition between supply and demand, do not guarantee by themselves the introduction of a model of sustainable development but require a conscious action by society which is decided voluntarily and democratically."
"It cannot be claimed that a miraculous technical discovery or a fiscal measure will solve the problem."
"The people's awareness needs to demand the set of values required by the sustainable development model."
"For those reasons, the report analyses the Commission's concerns at the consequences of the current model of economic growth and makes 13 practical proposals in three main blocs."
"First of all, in relation to the need to conceive the transition to the model of sustainable development from the current social and economic model of unsustainable growth, it is felt that that transition will only be possible thanks to a broad social consensus, which in its time brought about the creation of the welfare state."
"In that sense, research can contribute by analysing the interconnections between social and economic processes and new forms of using resources, energy sources, etc."
"Secondly, in relation to the revision of the Treaty on Union, incorporating the aims of sustainable development decisively into all significant areas: convergence criteria, functioning of European institutions, the relevant chapters and articles (VI, XV and XVI)."
"Thirdly, in the research and development policy - the fifth framework programme - through the following points:"
"First, proposals to promote research teams in the areas of production, distribution and eco-sufficient consumption, in various countries."
"Secondly, carrying out research into scientific and social areas of sustainable development such as lasting or biodegradable materials, climate change, sea and ocean deterioration, deforestation, social and economic analysis, ecotaxes, financial flows, etc."
"Thirdly, research into the function of the citizens, municipalities and local authorities in a proactive participation in the sustainable development model, energy saving, the efficient extraction of prime materials, use of renewable sources, optimal use of distribution systems, non-intensive farming, etc."
"Fourthly, research into the possibilities of global models for the use of energy."
"That is why it is necessary to pay more attention to energy sources distributed extensively and uniformly, permitting rational and responsible use by citizens in each location, together with democratic levies and new values."
"These are the main lines of the report which the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy is presenting to the Chamber so that, if it wishes to approve it, it can be converted into a more precise proposal for the Commission, the Council and ourselves to bring about a fairer society with greater solidarity, a society that is economically eco-sustainable and above all better for future generations of Europeans - our own children and grandchildren - who are the ultimate targets of all our concerns and intentions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the rapporteur, Mr Marset Campos, has done us a service with his own-initiative report by prompting a discussion on the concept of sustainable development. This discussion, of course, is in its very early stages and will take up a great deal of time yet."
"That, of course, is inherent in the philosophy contained within the concept of sustainable development, a philosophy which calls on us to view all our actions and political decisions in the particular context of their future complex effects and side effects."
"An unending process of consideration and reconsideration!"
"The rapporteur provides some of this service by rightly identifying the present economic model as detrimental to sustainable development."
"But from that point on our interpretations begin to drift apart, for example when we come to assess advanced technologies in the light of their consequential effects."
"Our debate will and must continue."
"One positive point, at least, is that sustainable development has emerged as a guiding principle of one of the thematic programmes in the fifth Research Framework Programme."
"We in this House will be alert and vigilant to see whether genuinely clean and intelligent products and processes are going to be promoted under this heading, whether intermodal transport and renewable energy sources really are given the opportunities they deserve, and whether the inner cities with their obvious problems become a focus of intense attention, together with the tragic deterioration of the state of marine resources and the much quoted greenhouse effect."
"At virtually every sitting in this House we have an opportunity to demonstrate, in the specific decisions we take, that this subject really is in the forefront of our thoughts."
"Furthermore, we politicians are responsible for the public debate on what we are supposed to want politically."
"I thank the rapporteur for facing up to this responsibility."
"Mr President, Commissioner, a development intended to provide sustainable security for social and ecological needs is to be welcomed."
"This report, of course, goes far beyond matters of R & D, representing an unworldly attempt to replace the Western social market economy with a green planned economy in which the European Parliament would have the necessary powers of implementation and control."
"But the kind of sustainable development we imagine should not be based on Utopian models but must take account of global reality."
"It can only be achieved, then, if the present situation is reformed."
"A revolutionary change in the economic model, which is what the report calls for, involves incalculable risks and is therefore irresponsible."
"The report postulates a dichotomy between technological progress and sustainable development."
"Yet one is impossible without the other."
"Sustainable development, then, is not synonymous with 'back to nature' ; that would simply be a romantic whimsy, divorced from reality."
"Moreover, the rapporteur must acknowledge that the change of model for which the report calls is already taking place, though through a process of reform rather than radical action."
"The report also fails to take account of the fact that environmental protection measures can only be financed by a functioning economy."
"Environmental protection demands great economic efforts."
"Another point that seems important to me: for the countries of the EU and other industrialized States, the concept of sustainable development encompasses economic and social aspects as well as ecological ones."
"The most urgent problem of the present time - high unemployment - therefore requires particularly careful attention."
"But jobs can be created only where a policy of sustainability can be pursued without sacrificing economy."
"The report underestimates the benefits research and development can bring to the employment market and the welfare state."
"Similarly, it is not realistic to hold science and technology responsible for wrong turnings in industry and society."
"This standpoint has long been recognized as outmoded and misguided."
"In actual fact, the position is that science and technology offer opportunities that can only be realized through political, social and economic decisions."
"There are many other points I could make."
"Overall, the report contains a wealth of errors and inaccuracies."
"Also, lengthy passages of it are couched in very general terms and confined to Utopian demands remote from political and social reality."
"Insufficient account is taken of the global character of science, technology, economics and environmental protection, and many of the proposals, if implemented, could actually be significantly disadvantageous to the EU without achieving that sustainable development at which we are all aiming."
"Consequently, our group cannot vote for the report in its present form."
"Mr President, Mr Marset Campos' report is a response to a real need, the need to include considerations of sustainable development in our basic thinking on research and on energy policy."
"This approach finds wide support amongst public opinion and in the European Parliament."
"Some passages in the report are balanced and we support them, but we oppose a certain number of passages, and only if these fall will we be able to vote for the report."
"I agree with the report on the interconnection between social factors and the environment, where it is difficult to act on one point without influencing another."
"If I may digress for a moment, that view from space of the earth as a ship always remains with me, a Noah's Ark on a voyage through the cosmos where all the onboard systems must remain in equilibrium, including those which produce oxygen and those which produce carbon dioxide."
"But, turning to the report, I think our role should not be to regard technology with suspicion, but if necessary to establish rules guaranteeing universal access to new opportunities, rejecting public monopolies and exclusive positions."
"So I do not support some of the rapporteur's ideological statements which sometimes tend to demonize science and technology as consumers of resources and producers of social dislocation and risk to the very survival of humankind, all the more so because, instead, technology continues to be the driving force in communication, development, and the production of material and non-material goods which improve the duration and quality of life."
"Mr President, the rapporteur rightly emphasizes the importance of a European sustainable research and development policy."
"Europe's R&D policy must not only be based on economic growth but must also be based on ecologically and socially desirable principles."
"The Liberal Group therefore applauds this own initiative report on this subject. However, the wording of the resolution presented to us is unacceptable for my group."
"It gives off an atmosphere of the traditional struggle between labour and capital and old class wars."
"The market economy is referred to as a model for smug individualism and Keynesian theories are rejected as incorrect."
"But, ladies and gentlemen, let us be clear, we owe our well-being in the European Union above all to the market economy."
"My Group therefore cannot support recitals A, D and F. If the amendments tabled by the Liberal Group on these paragraphs are not approved, we shall then be forced to vote against the whole report."
"Given the current relationship, if the Liberal Group votes against the report, it will not be adopted."
"My Group attaches considerable importance to the conclusion of this report."
"I took a constructive attitude to the committee of inquiry, and I hope therefore that we are going to be able to vote for it."
"Mr President, the Marset Campos report examines an extremely important subject."
"Now that we want sustainable development to be given a leading place in the new Treaty, there will be a legal base for the purpose of this report: research serving sustainability."
"It is therefore useful to anticipate it."
"I am positively against the intentions of this report."
"We support the practical recommendations."
"It is necessary to increase research in fields such as recycling, climatic change and ocean pollution."
"However, the report still presents me with a problem."
"The concept of 'sustainable development' means something different for everyone."
"The rapporteur offers a reasonable representation and it is quite clear."
"He wants to create a new model of society."
"But this is only one vision among many others."
"And it is a radical one."
"But the rapporteur is not very practical, at least it does not seem so in the Spanish footnotes which have not been translated in our version."
"There are still considerable divergencies of opinion on a number of major questions."
"Mine concern, in particular, the three following points."
"First of all, at what rate should changes be made?"
"Secondly, who will be in charge of that?"
"Thirdly, how can we make them compulsory?"
"I leave it up to the rapporteur to take responsibility for his own personal ideas expressed in the explanatory memorandum."
"But in my view, he is basing himself on an excessively positive image of mankind and society and expects too much of the authorities."
"I fear that the necessary changes to consumption patterns will come up against people's irresistible propensity to increase their possessions and pleasures."
"As far as the draft resolution is concerned, I would criticize in particular some of the considerations made and paragraphs 8 to 10 inclusive in particular."
"As far as I am concerned, the term 'social plan' and the European Parliament's role have been greatly exaggerated in these paragraphs."
"That is why I shall be voting against the report."
"I will be supporting the amendments tabled by Mrs Plooij."
"As far as I am concerned, I fully agree with some of the practical recommendations made in the report, but I do not share its optimistic views."
"Mr President, congratulations to Mr Marset Campos, not least for his patience and persistence with this report."
"Like the previous report, this is a very timely reminder to us as we consider the fifth framework programme of the rationale for doing research in the European Union."
"It is sometimes forgotten that although the main justification for research is to become more competitive at international level, even in the current Treaty we are told that we must promote all the research activities deemed necessary by the other chapters."
"Those include the chapter on social and economic cohesion and the chapter on the environment."
"Although the term 'sustainable development' is only now reaching treaty - and we are pleased about that - quite clearly there is an obligation on us, under the Treaty, to take into account those other matters."
"Mr Marset Campos does that."
"Those are not in as an afterthought."
"They were deliberately included."
"It would be very dangerous indeed to concentrate simply on growth and competitiveness."
"If you had a scenario where more science equals more growth, more consumption of natural resources, more unemployment for technological reasons and an increasing divergence between poor and rich people, poor and rich regions and poor and rich hemispheres of this world, it would be completely unacceptable and very dangerous."
"Mr Marset Campos' analysis is a very clear one and it contains many warnings."
"But it is not doom-laden."
"It is optimistic and it shows us the way in which we can make sure our work in research meets the requirements of sustainable development."
"He highlights many actions."
"A lot of them are present in the fourth framework programme already."
"A lot of the environmental work is done."
"Less work is done on the socio-economic aspects of sustainable development."
"That is perhaps a lesson for the fifth framework programme."
"The fifth framework programme looks promising."
"It looks as though the Commission, in its suggestions, is aware of the need to include the sustainable development dimension."
"Technical fixes are not enough."
"It is not enough to develop technology."
"You have to make societal changes as well."
"Jacques Delors was aware of this when he wrote in his White Paper that environmental technologies can create jobs and, in that way, bring about a much fairer society."
"The Socialist Group has some reservations about the wording of some paragraphs."
"We will, therefore, be voting accordingly."
"I must emphasize that we certainly support the tenor of this report and consider it to be extremely important in the opinion-forming necessary before the fifth framework programme."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by deciding last year to dedicate an own-initiative report to the issue of research and sustainable development, the Committee on Research sent an important message to the European institutions and the scientific community."
"The expression 'sustainable development' refers to one of the major challenges facing the European Union and the rest of the world at this moment in time."
"Mr Marset Campos has prepared a report and I would like to make three remarks on it."
"The first will be to emphasize the Commission's full support for the idea of the need to take the demands of sustainable development very much into consideration when defining the European Union's research policy."
"Research and technological development can and must play a decisive role."
"It gives us the means to devise and implement economic development that does not harm the quality of the environment or life, today and in the future."
"My second remark puts the first slightly into perspective."
"Placing the European Union's research policy under the same sign as sustainable development, as Mr Marset Campos is not far from doing in his report, and proposing that the idea should dominate our research programme as massively as he suggests, would be a mistake."
"The European Union must face many other challenges."
"It must meet the expectations of its citizens, especially in terms of employment, and we also have other objectives."
"In particular, we must resolutely put research to the service of the economy and business and help European industry to strengthen its competitiveness, a key factor of growth and employment."
"Far from being opposed, these two aims mutually strengthen each other."
"On tomorrow's markets, the most competitive products will not only be the cheapest and most efficient; they will also be the 'cleanest' and those whose use requires the least energy expenditure, with fewer negative effects on the environment, and those that can most easily be recycled."
"Europe must show that it is capable of producing and marketing such products."
"It must also carve itself a niche in the rapidly expanding market of environmental technologies."
"Thirdly and finally, Mr Marset Campos' report only takes very little account of the nonetheless decisive role played by the idea of sustainable development in the proposal for a fifth framework programme of research and technological development presented by the Commission."
"Yet that text quite clearly mentions it - in fact it is full of such references."
"Two of the proposal's themes, No 1 on discovering living resources and the ecosystem and the third theme on favouring competitive and sustainable growth are good examples."
"In the latter case, the requirements of sustainable growth are quite explicitly combined with the imperatives of growth and competitiveness."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you have been given a very clear opportunity to promote sustainable development in Europe."
"It consists in supporting the approach developed in the proposal for a fifth framework programme and to ensure that it can be quickly adopted during the first quarter of 1998 and implemented on time, i.e. by the end of 1998."
"Thank you in advance and I also thank Mr Marset Campos for his help. Thanks to his report we can bear in mind the fact that the research and technological development policy must first and foremost be of service to ordinary Europeans, those of today and tomorrow alike."
"Thank you too, Commissioner."
"Thank you for your excellent answer, and please excuse the lateness of the hour."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"International agreement on humane trapping standards"
"The next item is the report (A4-0187/97) by Mr Pimenta on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection on the signing and conclusion of an International Agreement between the European Community, Canada and the Russian Federation on humane trapping standards."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are dealing with yet another chapter in the long saga of leghold traps."
"I should like to concentrate on three aspects: the question of animal welfare, the institutional question of the decision within the European Community and relations with the World Trade Organization - WTO."
"Finally I shall refer to the question of the indigenous people and the line taken by Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan."
"As regards the cruelty to animals dossier, there is no doubt that these leghold traps are cruel and do cause inhuman suffering."
"That is why Parliament has repeatedly called for their abolition and that is why the European Union has had, since 1991, a regulation in force banning them."
"As long ago as last century Charles Darwin stated that the use of this type of trap and this type of killing were incompatible with civilized societies."
"That was a hundred and thirty years ago!"
"We now have to decide whether an agreement on humane trapping standards might be a good way of reducing cruelty to animals in the world."
"The answer would be yes provided we had a good agreement."
"Unfortunately, this text is a poor one and does not go far enough. That is certainly not the fault of the officials who negotiated it; they were rather, as we say in Portuguese 'bound hand and foot' because of what their boss, Sir Leon Brittan, wanted and they had to reach an agreement at any price."
"There is no shortage of examples in the text."
"In the point on fatal traps the European experts proposed on behalf of the Commission a time of 30 seconds to kill the animal."
"The agreement sets a time of 5 minutes."
"That is a long time - a very long time to die in agony - and it is a concession which increases the Commission's figure by a factor of 10."
"But the great problem with this agreement is that it is not selective enough in the classification of traps in relation to the standards laid down."
"I do not want now to go into the type of standards, which in some cases I regard as fairly low."
"To define a criterion for the approval of each type of trap - as this report does, as a function of the results, not for 80 % of all animals trapped, but merely for 80 % of the animals of the species targeted by the said trap - is an insult to the intelligence."
"These traps are by definition non-selective."
"They catch all types of animals which suffer equally, even though not targeted, but simply because they have been unfortunate enough to roam where they were not supposed to roam or to drink water where they were not supposed to."
"But the most glaring example of the Commission's bad faith is in the subtle amendment it made to Article 4 (2) in Annex I, where in the version agreed in January for the present agreement there is a marked difference."
"I shall in fact read the January version in the original English which said: conventional steel jaw leghold retaining traps to be prohibited within four years of the entering into force of this agreement."
"That, ladies and gentlemen, has disappeared from the version currently under discussion and has been replaced with unilateral statements by the countries wishing to accede to this agreement."
"That is a clear concession to the United States of America!"
"What powers has the European Union to control the unilateral statements of the countries who wish to accede to this agreement?"
"There is a lot more which could be said about the rest of the text, for example, Russia, in its unilateral statement, asks for money."
"The talk in the corridors is of ECU 30 million."
"We are going to buy the Russians for ECU 30 million."
"There is more that could be said, but instead I shall put a question."
"What about the United States?"
"If the United States had not signed this agreement and took Europe to the WTO, what would we do?"
"We should be in the same position as we are today."
"I should like now to mention the institutional pact."
"The Commission, at the instigation of Sir Leon Brittan, blocked the adoption in 1995 of the regulations implementing Regulation No 91."
"In January 1996, by means of a letter from two officials, it advised the Member States not to apply the legislation in force."
"So can one simple letter prevent the application of legislation approved by the Commissions and by the Council?"
"Where is the Rule of Law, Sir Leon Brittan?"
"In 1996 a new version was submitted which Parliament rejected on first reading."
"The Council never re-submitted it."
"In January 1997 an attempt was made at a Council meeting to pass a list of countries, including Canada and Russia, when there was no international agreement and these countries had not banned jaw leghold retaining traps, in clear violation of the European legislation."
"The Council quite rightly rejected this kind of approach."
"It is now time to mention the WTO. I should like to say, however, that the Commissioner stated during the ratification process, that no further European legislation was at stake with accession to the WTO, other than the legislation mentioned at the time - and I supported that."
"Now it is the jaw leghold retaining traps which are at stake, the hormones in beef and who knows, Mr Commissioner, what it might be tomorrow?"
"I should like now to mention the indigenous people."
"From the outset I did try to obtain a regime for the indigenous people; they are assured that this Parliament will endeavour to find a solution which reconciles our legitimate right to demand less cruelty in the world with satisfying the legitimate need of those communities to make a living."
"Unfortunately, I did not find any parties to instigate social dialogue either in Europe or in Canada."
"But I remain available for such talks."
"Thank you, Mr President, for bearing with me; I ask my colleagues to express their views by rejecting this bad agreement."
"Mr President, the saga of the leghold trap is a sad and sorry one."
"Quite honestly, Parliament feels outraged at the pathetic stage we have reached after all these years."
"Let me say first of all that I do not accept the validity of this so-called agreement which is being put before us because it has been negotiated by the Commission without a mandate."
"I draw the Commission's attention to the debate in this House on 21 February this year when a great deal of passion was expended on the issue."
"I suggest that Sir Leon Brittan reads that debate since everything we said on that night still holds true."
"My group fully supports the Mr Pimenta's excellent report once again which also won the support of the vast majority of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"This inadequate and inoperable stitch-up of an agreement is so full of holes that a pack of polar bears could rampage through it."
"It does not achieve an end to animal cruelty through the use of leghold traps, in fact it allows their use for at least another four years."
"It does not even reflect the position of the European Union's own scientific experts."
"We now have traps with some padding around them which are supposed to be humane."
"I suppose it does not hurt so much to chew off your own leg if you are caught in one of those."
"We have approval of traps which take five minutes to kill and of course these traps still catch at least 20 % of non-target species; but that is just too bad for these animals since they are not supposed to be caught in the first place."
"We have leghold traps which can be used under water and presumably these are no longer cruel."
"A lot has been said about the rights of indigenous people, especially by the Canadian Government, but this agreement is actually in itself pretty flimsy on including those people in negotiations."
"The deal with Russia is not even worth the paper it is written on."
"It will only be implemented if we dole out lots of money."
"The deadline seems to have fallen into a black hole and there are no enforcement measures and no sanctions for non-compliance."
"There is no agreement with the United States, as the rapporteur has said, because they have admitted they cannot deliver anything through their federal system so their hunters can keep right on using leghold traps."
"We could go on with detailed criticism of the agreement but it really is just too dispiriting."
"The only sensible thing to do is to reject it and go back to the legislation that we have already agreed in this Parliament which is perfectly defendable if Canada were to take us to a dispute in the WTO."
"For instance, no unfair domestic trade advantage to the European Union can be shown and, because the driving force behind the legislation is animal welfare, it can be perfectly well defended as protecting public morals."
"This agreement is hopelessly bad and we cannot accept it."
"I call upon the Commission to negotiate a tougher agreement and to ban the sale within the European Union of fur from animals caught in traps which do not meet standards of a new, far tougher international agreement."
"Mr President, Commissioner, yet again the European Parliament is being called upon to comment on the problems of leghold traps."
"We have before us the draft of an agreement which is supposed to prescribe humane trapping standards at international level."
"However, the draft has its shortcomings, even though we might be tempted to welcome the fact that after years of negotiation and deadlock a draft does actually exist."
"It is difficult, though, to vote in favour of this draft."
"If it proves necessary to reject the agreement and introduce a European ban on imports of skins, that will damage the European fur industry and, especially, the indigenous peoples in Canada who earn their living as traders in skins."
"Anyone who knows me will know that I have always taken these arguments particularly seriously."
"Animal welfare, in my view, is not incompatible with sustaining the way of life and livelihood of many indigenous peoples - indeed, I believe they are mutually complementary."
"Our common aim must be to strike a balance between the needs of animal welfare and the justified interests of indigenous peoples."
"In the past, I believe, there were two ways by which this objective might be achieved. One was the conclusion of an agreement on humane trapping methods worthy of their name - which the present version certainly is not; an agreement which lays down high animal welfare standards and at the same time takes due account of the justified concerns of indigenous peoples."
"Alternatively, if that is unworkable, an independent marketing system could be set up for the skins of animals trapped by indigenous trappers. I believe that a result could have been rapidly achieved here if the representatives of the indigenous peoples had been involved in the negotiations."
"Should the draft of the agreement be rejected, these points must be borne in mind during further negotiations. Following my contacts with representatives of indigenous peoples in Canada - and I did have such contacts, Mr Pimenta - I know that leghold traps must be abandoned; indeed, they are being abandoned in Canada."
"But, in the long term, indigenous trappers and animal welfare organizations must work closely together and be jointly involved in the search for new, humane trapping methods. Finding a substitute for leghold traps is the main task that will confront us in the coming years, even without a framework agreement."
"One way of solving the problem is to improve the selectivity of traps, in other words to develop traps that can only catch particular animals. This, of course, means providing trappers with better training."
"Finally, there is one more question I would like to put to the Commissioner: what is the status of the ban on leghold traps in the European Union?"
"According to my information such traps are being laid only a few miles from where we sit - I don't know why."
"Did this fact influence the basis for the Commission's negotiations with the countries concerned?"
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, first of all I want to explain that I am speaking on behalf of Mrs Baldi, who could not be here this evening and has given me her notes, because she has followed this dossier."
"Personally I just want to express my sympathy with Mr Pimenta, who is so enthusiastically committed to this cause."
"After a long series of obstacles and uncertainties, an international agreement on humane trapping standards was reached last December between the European Community, Canada and the Russian Federation."
"The agreement was the result of major efforts by Canada and Russia, but it did not satisfy the Council, which asked for a series of improvements."
"The Commission has therefore restarted the negotiations and has drawn up a new proposal for an agreement which will be presented to the Council of Environment Ministers of the European Union on 19 and 20 June."
"As Mr Pimenta did not consider the text satisfactory, we find ourselves faced with a report which is ahead of its time, which contests an agreement the Council has not really approved yet."
"It is true that the United States has not initialled the agreement, so it is a partial agreement, a compromise, but it is a compromise which, according to Mrs Baldi, signals progress."
"Our group therefore believes the agreement reached should not be rejected."
"Mr President, it seems as if the debate on leghold traps will never finish."
"I could easily repeat what I said a year ago and two years ago."
"But one thing is certain: commercial interests are more important as far as the Commission is concerned than the well-being of animals and democratic principles."
"Along with a large majority of the ELDR Group, I think that it is quite deplorable that the Commission should not have kept to its word and is now imposing an optional agreement on trapping methods."
"That is tantamount to emptying European democracy of all meaning since there was a Council regulation dating to 1991 and we wanted to stick to it."
"The Commission has decided to delay by one year the ban on imports of fur from countries using leghold traps and this is the second time that a one year delay has been decided upon. It is very annoying for Commissioner Bjerregaard that Commissioner Brittan should be here."
"You have won."
"Your commercial interests have won the day over Mrs Bjerregaard's animal welfare."
"I must congratulate you, but I profoundly regret it."
"I find unacceptable any agreement which does not ban leghold traps in the short-term, and I fully agree with Mr Pimenta who said that that disagreement is quite inadequate and ineffective and that is why it should be rejected and I think that we should ban imports at once."
"Mr President, I find this whole business quite incredible, for two reasons."
"First, because we have a regulation dating from 1991, which was supposed to apply from 1 January 1995."
"That date was put back by a year to 1 January 1996, and then again to 1 January 1997, and now, suddenly, we have nothing at all."
"This so-called agreement you have the nerve to present to us is just an insult."
"For a start, there is no such thing as a humane trap."
"Try catching your finger in a car door - whether it has a rubber lining or not, it will still hurt just as much. And if an animal has to endure its death in agony and die a dreadful death in a trap that we describe as humane, that makes no difference to the animal."
"In any case, an animal will be unable to read where it says that a trap is suitable for this or that particular animal, and if it is a protected species, it won't be able to read that either."
"But what I find most incredible of all is this sentence, which I quote verbatim from the Official Journal: ' The welfare of animals will temporarily be reduced to a very low level in killing traps.'"
"Do you believe in resurrection?"
"Who would have thought a killing trap might, temporarily, reduce welfare to a very low level!"
"Are you trying to make fools of us by publishing stuff like this in the Official Journal?"
"This is a total mockery of animal welfare as a whole."
"We are going to support Mr Pimenta's report, and we are not going to tolerate cynical performances of this kind."
"I regard it as an insult."
"First you overrule regulations and the wishes of Parliament, making a mockery of democracy, and then you have the effrontery to publish material like this."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group and as president of Parliament's Inter-Group for Animal Welfare and Conservation, I want to say that I strongly support Mr Pimenta's report and hope it will be adopted by Parliament."
"I can remember sitting here six, seven and eight years ago, talking about these issues."
"We thought we had got somewhere when we got the Council Regulation of 1991, disappointed though we were that it was going to be five years before it was implemented."
"Now, two years after that date, we are still waiting for something to happen."
"Today, in June 1997, the Commission is asking the Council to endorse a very inadequate and unsatisfactory agreement with Canada and Russia and nothing at all with the United States."
"The substantial derogations that have been accepted, the lack of convincing enforcement measures, the lack of sanctions for non-compliance all cast doubt on whether the small commitments made by Russia and Canada will in reality achieve anything."
"This means measures fail totally to tackle the whole question of animal suffering."
"We must reject them as they stand."
"It seems that the Commission fears a challenge on the GATT to freedom of trade and that there would be an adverse decision by the WTO on this issue."
"That need not be the case."
"After all, we were promised when the GATT agreement was supported by Parliament that there would be proper provision for the protection of the environment and animal welfare."
"Personally, I never put much faith in those promises, which is why I did not vote for the GATT Agreement."
"I did not think they were adequate, but we were told they were."
"If they are, let us challenge the WTO if they give an adverse decision."
"Let us challenge them strongly."
"If we cannot win that then we must look at reform of GATT to ensure that trade, important though it is, does not take precedence over every other consideration such as animal welfare, protection of the environment and the wellbeing of our peoples."
"Mr President, the debate on the prohibition of leghold traps is the unending story of animal suffering, animal misery, human cruelty and political incompetence."
"Once again, we have an EU regulation which has been in force since 1 January 1996 and it is simply not being implemented!"
"Now we are served up with an agreement which is no such thing."
"Leghold traps are to continue to be permitted for several years."
"Death need only occur within 300 seconds - 5 long minutes of mortal fear, death agony, appalling pain!"
"Nor does the agreement make any provision as to how trapped animals may or may not be killed."
"Many animals, Commissioner, are killed by being crushed, the trapper simply standing on the animal and treading on it until it dies."
"We Europeans want nothing to do with leghold traps, well and good."
"But apart from leghold traps all other traps are permitted in Europe, irrespective of what injuries they inflict or how slowly they kill."
"We have a great deal to do, not just in Canada but in Europe too."
"I hope that, tomorrow, Parliament will support Carlos Pimenta and reject the Commission's proposal."
"If the Council of Environment Ministers does the same on 19 and 20 June, then we shall have won."
"If it doesn't, that will not be the failure of this House, but the failure of the Environment Ministers."
"Mr President, we all understand the depth of feeling on this issue that has existed for many years."
"However, what we have to ask ourselves is whether the latest agreement represents an unprecedented advance in international trapping standards which, if adopted, will improve the welfare of animals and alleviate the threat to our relations with our Canadian and Russian partners."
"I have absolutely no doubt whatsoever in saying that the welfare of animals will be significantly advanced if this agreement is implemented and if it is not and if a ban is imposed of a kind that the Members who have spoken in favour of it want, then nothing will be done to advance the welfare of animals, because it would be a great mistake to believe that if that were to happen the countries concerned, faced with that prospect, would simply adapt their laws and change things in the way that the Members of Parliament want."
"That is wholly and totally unrealistic."
"It is for that reason that I agree with Mr Malerba that this agreement represents significant progress."
"I am pleased to hear that yesterday the Committee on External Economic Relations adopted an opinion which clearly recommends the approval of this agreement."
"Things have been said about the mandate and the objectives and the purposes."
"Let us be quite clear that the regulation on leghold traps provided for two distinct options for countries wanting to avoid restrictions on the import of fur: either they could forbid the use of leghold traps or they could use trapping methods which comply with internationally agreed humane trapping standards."
"It was never the intention that both alternatives should be applied."
"In the absence of any agreement on trapping standards, obviously, the implementation of the fur embargo was provided."
"However, the regulation itself made it quite clear that an option - and, I would suggest, a preferable option - was for there to be an agreement on trapping standards."
"The reason why that option was put in was because such an agreement would secure an improvement in animal welfare, whereas a ban would totally fail to do so."
"That is why we make no apology for the fact that we have negotiated with Canada, the Russian Federation and the United States. Reference has been made to the United States."
"We do not have an agreement with the United States and, therefore, what we are talking about now is the agreement with Canada and Russia."
"Negotiating directives were issued and the agreement obtained was consistent with those negotiating directives."
"Although that is not in any way reflected in the Pimenta report, which does not in any way give any credit to the fact that after the Council of Ministers asked us to do so we continued negotiating and obtained significant improvements in the agreement with Canada and the Russian Federation."
"The Commission reported the revised agreement to the General Affairs Council of 2 June, which welcomed the improvements achieved."
"The revised agreement has now been formally transmitted to the Council for its approval, along with a list of third countries eligible to export furs into the European Community, which includes Canada and the Russian Federation, but does not include the United States."
"The European Parliament will of course, as procedures provide, be formally consulted on this revised agreement before its final ratification."
"The improvements achieved in the last round of negotiations are significant and I am sorry that they have not been fully considered in the resolution proposed by Mr Pimenta."
"Parliament's report does not take into account or give credit to the substantive improvements which are being negotiated."
"The agreement will now apply to all mechanical restraining or killing traps used for the trapping of 19 species for any purpose."
"Traps that do not meet the standards contained will have to be phased out by the parties within a clearly defined timeframe."
"Thus it is far more comprehensive than the regulation which deals with only one type of trap and covers for its external aspects only 13 species."
"It will relieve animal suffering, both in the Union and in third countries to a much larger extent than would be the case if a ban was imposed."
"The standards have been set at a high level for the protection of animals, taking into account the scientific and empirical evidence that is currently available."
"To go beyond that could lead to a situation where most trapping methods, including those currently used in the European Union, would not meet the standards."
"Reference has been made to the killing time limit of 300 seconds."
"Of course, it would have been better if we could have achieved more than that."
"But nonetheless that represents a significant step to improve killing trapping methods, including those currently used in the Community."
"Moreover, the agreement foresees that this 300 second limit shall be reviewed within 3 years in order to be lowered to 180 seconds."
"Technical and safety considerations have to be taken into account."
"To kill an animal quickly a trap needs to be powerful and that can become dangerous for the trappers themselves or for any other person or pet that could set off the trap by mistake."
"The agreement envisages a phased implementation which progressively tightens its provisions."
"A first revision of the standards is scheduled three years after the entry into force of the agreement, which will take into account research carried out by the parties."
"It therefore represents a first and ambitious step to establish internationally scientifically-based performance standards which currently do not exist."
"The International Standardization Organization worked for almost ten years to define such standards without success."
"If it had achieved standards, they would have been voluntary."
"This agreement is binding under international law."
"The binding nature of the agreement has been reinforced in the revised text since it is now specified that the rulings of the Arbitration Tribunal are binding on the parties."
"Derogations for indigenous populations have also been clarified and their scope further limited."
"Last, but not least, one of the main achievements of the new round of negotiations was to reinforce substantially the commitments of Canada and Russia concerning an accelerated calendar for the phasing out of certain types of leghold traps."
"It is all very well to pour scorn on the fact that they are not being phased out instantly, but I have to tell you, in the absence of this agreement, even if there were a ban, there would be no phasing out at all."
"For Canada there would be a ban on the use of all jaw type, leghold restraining traps for 7 of the 12 relevant Canadian species as soon as the agreement enters into force."
"For the remaining 5 Canadian species, the use of conventional steel-jaw leghold restraining traps will be forbidden at the end of the third trapping season after conclusion of the agreement by the Community, in other words, by 31 March 2000, if the Council approves the agreement before 1 October 1997."
"Of course the other types of leghold traps, and indeed every other mechanical trap, will also be banned according to the schedule set out in the agreement if they are shown not to be in conformity with the standards."
"Whereas I understand the focus upon leghold traps, let us not forget that there are other traps and what this agreement provides is a method of testing those traps and banning them if they fall foul of the agreement."
"For the Russian Federation, conventional steel-jaw leghold restraining traps, which are the only type of leghold trap that is used in Russia, will be forbidden for Russian species by 31 December 1999 if adequate financial assistance is provided to replace existing traps."
"I hope that Parliament, concerned as it is about these matters, will use its influence to help us obtain the finance to do that."
"It is simply not true, as has been said during the debate, that if no financial assistance is provided the traps will not be replaced because there is a commitment in the agreement that if there is no financial assistance provided the traps will in any event be phased out, at the latest four years after the entry into force of the agreement."
"The key question when assessing this agreement should be: what is really the best option for improving the welfare of trapped animals in Canada and Russia?"
"For us there is no doubt that the approval of the agreement is the option that will substantially improve the welfare of animals and preserve the wider interests of the European Union."
"There is no conflict between trade and animal welfare."
"This agreement is one which advances animal welfare while, at the same time, protecting legitimate trade."
"For the first time ever an international agreement will establish binding rules to control trade on the grounds of animal welfare."
"I would appeal to anyone who is fair-minded and prepared to listen to the arguments that that is a remarkable step forward."
"The importance of such a precedent should not be underestimated."
"This is literally the first time that an international agreement will establish such binding rules on the grounds of animal welfare."
"An embargo on furs would achieve nothing, and certainly have negative economic, social and political consequences both within the third countries and in the European Union affecting indigenous communities, but not only indigenous communities."
"As I have said the situation with the United States is different."
"We do not yet have an agreement with them."
"There is no alternative to envisaging the full implementation of Regulation 3254/91 on furs from the United States."
"But I hope that a more satisfactory solution with the United States can still be found."
"I have no doubt that the best way of securing that, and therefore the welfare of animals in the United States, would be to obtain the approval of this agreement with Canada and Russia."
"It is reasonable to place this issue in the wider context of our policy on international trade, the environment and animal welfare."
"I do not believe that the multilateral trade system runs roughshod over the interests of the environment."
"That is quite mistaken and it overlooks the enormous efforts that the European Union has made, and indeed has taken a lead, in developing work on the environment within the WTO."
"I would have liked the WTO Committee on trade and the environment to have been able to go further but it was not because of the reluctance of the European Union, still less because of the reluctance of the Commission, to urge and to press in the direction of the environment that we failed to make that progress."
"It was because of the failure of the rest of the world to follow our lead."
"We have nothing to be ashamed of."
"In this light any attempt to use this issue to create controversy within the WTO overlooks our honourable efforts and jeopardizes the steady progress on international trade and the environment which we all hope for and which would almost certainly lead to self-inflicted defeat and loss of credibility of the EU within the multilateral disputes settlement procedures, if we follow another route."
"Those are the reasons why I strongly commend, as the Commission does - and efforts to divide the Commission will not succeed - that a positive attitude should be taken towards the agreement with Canada and the Russian Federation."
"I urge the European Parliament to take the latest text into account when expressing its view on this delicate and important issue."
"Mr President, I wish to address Sir Leon Brittan directly because it is the first time he has come to a debate on this subject in this House in at least the last two years."
"You read out your written speech."
"Unfortunately you did not answer me, Mrs Pollack, Mr Eisma, Mr Flemming, Mr Schnellhardt."
"We raised substantial issues on selectivity, on lack of sanctions, on what would happen if the US took us to WTO etc."
"It is too late to go into detailed articles."
"But when President Santer came to the House to ask for approval for his team and programme, he undertook as President of the Commission to give serious consideration, even outside the legalist codecision procedure, to the opinion expressed democratically by this House."
"When the House voted on this issue in February this year, the vote was 85 to 3."
"If we adopt this tomorrow by more than 75 % of those present, will you accept that we have the legitimate democratic right to disagree with your opinion?"
"And even if you believe every word you said, would you, if we - the representatives of 15 countries of Europe, from all political parties - reject your opinion by a huge majority, have the humility to accept that you are not the only soul on this earth and that you could be wrong?"
"Mr President, many thanks for giving me the opportunity to pass on a brief bit of information."
"I am the spokesman for the PPE Group in the Committee on External Economic Affairs."
"Yesterday evening, by a great majority, we actually approved the Commission's proposal on the grounds just put forward by Sir Leon Brittan, which are the same arguments that were put forward by Mr Malerba in this House on behalf of Mrs Baldi."
"We know that the debate on traps is always a difficult problem."
"But we believe that the Commission was right to decide in favour of a gradual progression towards more humane trapping methods."
"We voted in favour of the Commission's proposal by a large majority, including the votes of Mr Ilaskivi and members of other groups though not the vote of the draftsman of the opinion of the Environment Committee."
"I know that this position may be a minority one even within my own group, but I should like to point out that in giving our support to the Commission yesterday we acted with the best of intentions."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 00.25 a.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, concerning the voting list and the contentious paragraph 4c of the IGC debate, in our group I argued vigorously that we should be voting for this."
"However, when it came to the vote, it was one of those embarrassing moments when Mr Harrison, Mr Donnelly and myself voted against when should have voted for."
"To correct that we gave a statement in writing to the secretariat asking that it be corrected to show that we had voted for 4c."
"In the record it still shows that we voted against and I am asking if it could be corrected."
"I would refer you to page 14 of the English Minutes where it says Mr Wynn, Mr Donnelly, Mr Harrison and Mr Elchlepp had intended to vote in favour."
"Mr President, I refer to a mistake in the Spanish version of the joint motion on the free movement of goods in the European Union."
"My name and that of Mr Alonso Puerta and Mr JovÃ© should have been included as signatories to the motion on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, as in the other versions."
"We will have it checked out and get it corrected."
"On Tuesday I raised the matter of Norwegian salmon and the need for the Commission to make a statement to this House."
"As a delegation from the Norwegian Parliament is here today..."
"Mr McMahon, we are discussing Wednesday's Minutes."
"Tuesday's Minutes were approved, as is usual, the following day."
"Mr President, I would like a mistake in today's agenda to be corrected."
"In the joint motion on the disruption of the internal market (B4-0488/97), my name is missing."
"By some error, the list of signatories to that joint motion omits my name. Please could it be added."
"We will make sure that is corrected."
"Mr President, you have drawn our attention to page 14 of the Minutes."
"I notice that 40 Members had to correct their votes yesterday."
"Is this a failure of the Members or the system we use for voting?"
"It seems absurd to have 40 corrections of vote from one voting session."
"I would suggest to you that it is both a failure on the part of Members and a slight hiccup in the voting system."
"I seem to recall that particular vote was out of the normal sequence and that was why some Members were thrown."
"(Parliament approved the Minutes)"
"Mr President, on Tuesday when I raised the matter of the need for a statement on Norwegian salmon from the Commission - the European Parliament being the only body Sir Leon Brittan has not consulted - the President said he would pass the matter on to the Commission."
"I would like to know if Sir Leon Brittan is prepared to come out of his cloister in the Commission and communicate with Parliament the terms of the agreement he has signed with the Norwegian Government."
"Under the rules of the Treaty the Commission is duty bound to consult with Parliament on the aspects of this Treaty."
"Today a parliamentary delegation from Norway is visiting Parliament and wishes to discuss the matter with us."
"Mr McMahon, you have made your point and it is one that has been made every morning this week."
"I understand the seriousness of the issue but, as I said on Tuesday when I was in the Chair, the Conference of Presidents has the right to request the Commission to come to this House and make a statement on any matter."
"If you so wish you should raise this matter with your group leader and other Members with theirs so that it can be raised in the Conference of Presidents."
"Mr President, during the last part-session here in Strasbourg, I asked a question at the beginning of the Monday sitting about a call for tenders for the supply of canteen furniture for the new Parliament building and the rules to be applied."
"I put the question orally, but the President, Mr Gil-Robles, said I should put it in writing, which I did the very same day."
"So far, however, I have not received an answer to my question."
"I should therefore like to ask if and when I can expect a reply."
"I do not know when you will get a reply but I will pass your remarks on to the services and ask them to respond to your question."
"I call Mr Macartney but if it is on salmon I warn you I shall cut you off right away."
"We have dealt with the issue."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"Under Rules 37 and 95, the European Commission can propose at any time that it wishes to come and make a statement to this House."
"The President in the Chair can propose a change to the agenda at any time."
"I am now going to mention the word 'salmon' and if you want to cut me off, do so, but the point is that this House has Rules and the Commission has Rules."
"I totally support what Mr McMahon said."
"We are entitled to hear from the Commissioner."
"Sir Leon Brittan was here last night."
"He is avoiding the issue and it is high time he came and spoke to us."
"I am well aware of the sensitivities of the issue and the strength of feeling in the House but the Commission has not requested permission to make a statement. That is the position we find ourselves in."
"European voluntary service action programme"
"The next item is the report (A4-0182/97) by Mrs Fontaine, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision establishing the Community action programme 'European voluntary service for young people' (COM(96)0610 - C4-0681/96-96/0318(COD))"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the action proposed today by the Commission under the title of 'European voluntary service' and for which I have the honour of being rapporteur, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, is not an isolated initiative."
"It is part of a more global context, that of implementing a genuine youth policy, something that the European Parliament has always called for with insistence."
"More than ever, young people are our best allies for constructing tomorrow's Europe."
"But for that, Europe must be a living reality for them."
"They must be able to circulate, study and work in European Union countries without coming up against, as is still often the case, sadly, obstacles of all kinds; we must step up cross-frontier cooperation between schools and universities so that they can benefit from fruitful exchanges; they must be helped to complete their vocational training, with the added bonus of a European dimension, and in the end facilitate integration into working life at a time when unemployment is, alas, for a good many of our young people, an inevitable drama and a seed of despair."
"Those are stepping stones towards the acquisition of an active European citizenship, which cannot be decreed but which is fashioned day by day and by a series of actions."
"In the proposal for which you have taken such a timely initiative, Madam Commissioner, to offer young people aged 18-25 years the opportunity to gain experience in another country by means of an action of practical solidarity, we find the best of these ingredients and I should like to congratulate you and your colleagues - but yourself in particular, Madam Commissioner - because I know that you have invested your talent and your heart in this project."
"Our committee has appreciated this initiative."
"It strongly encourages it and the amendments that I am submitting to the European Parliament on its behalf - make no mistake - are aimed solely at ensuring that this European voluntary service will be as efficient as possible."
"With you, we are concerned that the European voluntary service should be accessible to all young people without exception."
"That means better tailored information."
"That means that solidarity associations should be closely linked to the processes that determine which young people will be involved."
"Like you, we want to optimize the chances of success of the European voluntary service which means paying special attention to the quality of that service."
"That quality will depend on the degree of motivation, both of the young people and the reception structures."
"Similarly, linguistic and cultural preparation of the young people and monitoring measures will be decisive factors."
"The Commission has specified very clearly that the European voluntary service does not replace the national military or civilian services."
"We agree entirely."
"Nevertheless, we think that the activities of the European voluntary service could easily and appropriately be made compatible with national civilian services so that those Member States so wishing could integrate these activities into the framework of their national services."
"The conclusion of agreements between the European voluntary service and national civilian services could turn that prospect into a reality, and that is what we wanted to cover in our amendments."
"We also insisted on an aspect that seems essential to us and which is dear to our hearts, that of a European status of young volunteers."
"It is still too vague."
"That status must guarantee young people conditions of social protection, tax exemption and equivalent legal coverage in all countries of the European Union, or else the project would risk remaining a dead letter."
"Our committee took a long and hard look at the aspect of opening up to young people from non-Community countries."
"From that viewpoint, it has taken on board the excellent conclusions drawn in the report for opinion of the Committee on Development, presented by our colleague, Mr Dimitrakopoulos."
"Our committee also examined the budgetary prospects for the project as presented by the Commission."
"We have fully adopted the opinion issued by Mrs Ghilardotti, but it seemed to us that the resources earmarked so far are not up to the expectations and the need to reach a threshold of critical mass in order to create dynamism, impetus and a rubbing-off effect on young people."
"Our proposal to raise the whole budgetary amount to 80 million ECU is based on that concern, a concern that would only guarantee that this excellent initiative would be as widely publicized as possible."
"Mr President, allow me first of all to pay tribute to the Vice-President of the European parliament, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, for her splendid work on the subject of voluntary work."
"I should also like to commend the Commission as well."
"Its proposal is important because it endeavours to bring order and system to the voluntary work sector which plays a substantial role within the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is natural that in the Committee on Development we should have looked not so much, or rather not only, at voluntary work within the European Union itself, although we support that wholeheartedly, of course."
"We have endeavoured to look at voluntary work in the light of the Commission's proposal and with due regard to Mrs Fontaine's observations concerning the Union's relations with third countries, relations which are presented as coordinates in the wake of the new policies."
"Hence the proposals that the Committee on Development has discussed and is presenting refer to all of the area encompassed by the LomÃ© Treaty and to the area encompassed by the new Mediterranean policy, to mention just two examples."
"We are hopeful that these proposals can provide a perspective for voluntary work in the future, regardless of the fact that at this early stage, as a new policy on voluntary work is being commenced, they may encounter certain practical difficulties that will require study."
"And we think that the provision of a specific framework within which voluntary work will operate in the future is of great significance, both for the young people who will be the first to volunteer, and who always are the first, and for those who will be the recipients of the voluntary work."
"Of course, as we have said many times, voluntary work cannot be a replacement or a substitute."
"It is complementary, and for that reason - and, Mr President, this is our very firm view - the Commission's proposal establishes an important beginning in that it presents the way in which this complementary endeavour is to be framed."
"Lastly, given that we focused, as I have said, on the external aspect of voluntary work, I consider it very important that the delegations of the European Union in other countries should also take account of this very good proposal that we have before us."
"Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mrs Fontaine on her excellent report. I am also grateful to the Commission, and in particular Mrs Cresson and her staff, for their communication and for presenting this programme."
"I would point out that the idea of a European voluntary service originated partly from a European Parliament initiative which, by introducing a line into the 1996 budget, enabled the pilot phase to be launched with a sum of ECU 15 million earmarked for 1996 and ECU 10 m for 1997."
"The basic aim of the EVS, as Mrs Fontaine has reminded us, is to give young people some experience of voluntary work by setting up projects in various sectors which are at the very heart of the EU's priorities: environmental protection, the social services, cultural activities, heritage conservation and combating drugs."
"I believe, however, that above all else the EVS is a significant means of enabling young Europeans to develop a European identity, a sense of belonging and an awareness of their European citizenship, of which there is now so much discussion."
"In 18 months, the current pilot phase, which involves 2500 young people, has shown the merits of the decision taken by Parliament and the Commission: it has proved that this project is a viable one and really can help to foster a sense of European identity in young people, as well as equipping them better educationally for their future life."
"The Committee on Budgets says as much in its opinion and considers that, in order to improve the implementation of the programme, it should be managed with maximum transparency and be as broadly based as possible within the Member States. We call on the Commission to ensure that this is the case."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we are all painfully aware that Euroscepticism is very prevalent among our population at the present time, and we must take effective action to combat it."
"Young people can be our allies in this mission, because they have a great capacity for learning, they are enthusiastic and are hungry for the new experiences that can be theirs when they spend some time in other countries."
"Young people are the future of our society, which is why I firmly believe that we should involve them as much as possible in the construction of a united Europe."
"The European voluntary service can be a means to that end."
"I therefore welcome the idea, but I agree with Mrs Fontaine that the Commission proposal has several defects."
"The most important issue, to my mind, is that of the legal framework."
"The mobility of young people is impaired by major legal obstacles, which must be eliminated by all Member States cooperating to define a common status for voluntary workers."
"Every Member State must take the necessary measures to enable young people to take part in the programme without let or hindrance."
"The main measures are the granting of a right of sojourn for the duration of the voluntary service, maintenance of social security entitlements and the exemption from taxation of expenditure allowances."
"Clear rules will have to be formulated on these points; those in the proposal are far too generalized."
"Moreover, the Member States must be called upon to coordinate the activities of the European voluntary service with those of the civilian service organizations that exist in individual countries."
"The decision as to whether these national organizations can be incorporated into the structure of the European voluntary service on the basis of agreements between the two will remain a matter for the national legislatures."
"Despite these defects, I am delighted that the voluntary service initiative is finally taking shape."
"I believe that this service can make a substantial contribution to increasing the mobility of young Europeans, which is still rather too restricted."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to begin by complimenting the rapporteur, one of Parliament's Vice-Presidents, on her excellent work."
"The Florence European Council of 21 and 22 June 1996 put forward the idea of European voluntary service with a view to involving students and young people, in particular graduates and the unemployed, in practical projects which could bring these youngsters closer to the building of Europe, through social initiatives to help people in need, combat drug dependence and enhance our cultural, artistic and sporting heritage."
"This plan to integrate young people within Europe, on the basis of humanist values, requires them to be mobile, and that is why the initiative needs economic support in the form - so I hope - of increased funding."
"The EVS cannot take the place of either compulsory military service or national forms of civil service, and the Member States have to bear that in mind."
"However, it is important to allow these young European volunteers access to national infrastructures, and to help integrate and combine transnational activities with national voluntary work by examining the possibility of establishing a permanent Community instrument, endowed with legal and financial resources."
"The Member States have already expressed interest in the EVS, and several of them are beginning to devise national initiatives."
"The Commission therefore needs to show how this programme can make an additional contribution in terms of citizenship, through a balanced set of costs and benefits to the Community budget."
"The Union's aim is to support high-quality, transnational projects in the long term - six months or a year - or the short term - three weeks to three months - thereby enabling young people under 29 who are resident in a Member State to participate in a variety of social, cultural and environmental activities, some of them in third countries."
"Such work is of tremendous value, since it will broaden the youngsters' horizons and, very importantly, bring them into contact with other young people both in Europe and in third countries."
"Mr President, I am delighted to be able to speak on behalf of the Liberal Group in support of Mrs Cresson's initiative and Mrs Fontaine's well- prepared and lucid report."
"The Community action programme 'European Voluntary Service for Young People' has excellent objectives."
"It should give young people mainly, aged between 18 and 25, the opportunity to obtain valuable work experience in various areas of public service in another Member State."
"The aim is to help particularly disadvantaged young people to obtain international experience and language skills as well as to learn civic responsibility through work."
"When one thinks how difficult it is for millions of young Europeans to find work on leaving school and to find their place in the world, it is clear that there is a need for activities of the kind covered by the term 'voluntary service'."
"Of course, it may be wondered whether the objective of this programme is too ambitious in relation to its resources, since many people will have to be disappointed."
"The relationship of this new voluntary service programme to the important Youth for Europe programme, and its influence on that programme, is as yet unclear."
"The Commission should give an overall account of the Union's youth policy and should consider the need to create a comprehensive youth framework programme."
"Within this framework it would be possible to coordinate efficiently the allocation of funds from the different programmes in such a way that they complement each other and take a variety of different groups into account."
"At the same time it is possible to simplify administration, reduce bureaucracy and ensure that the resources earmarked are really used to benefit the participation of young people."
"One thing which also hinders participation is the lack of a definition of the legal position of young volunteers."
"Matters relating to social security, the employer-employee relationship, taxation and accommodation should be dealt with in a uniform way so that the conditions for freedom of movement can really be secured."
"The recipient organizations also have a heavy responsibility to create an effective framework for voluntary work."
"The tasks to be done must be meaningful and challenging, and a European certificate must be awarded immediately after participation, describing the skills obtained by the participant through voluntary work."
"I would hope that the age limits could also be flexible."
"The Commission should pay particular attention to evacuations, which must contain quantitative indicators as well as those for content and quality."
"Mr President, I agree with the Fontaine report and think that a few good ideas should be picked out from it."
"This proposal could help young people to take part in European construction, so that they can feel that they are the subjects and protagonists of that construction."
"Today most young people do not take part in European construction."
"It could also help them to have a vision of tolerance and cooperation by taking part in voluntary work in the European Union, through linguistic and cultural preparation that most young people do not have."
"The rapporteur points out in her report that this should not be directed at a few elite youngsters who already have all that information and all those possibilities, but at a wide group."
"There must be a sufficient number of young people taking part in a project with these features, working on public utility actions but not charity work or amounting to social dumping."
"These are the most interesting ideas set out in the Fontaine report."
"The conscientious objection services in Member States must complement these European services."
"Both the report and the Cresson proposal make it quite clear that this proposal should not replace compulsory military service or conscientious objection."
"However why could it not be possible at a given moment for countries like mine, where there are hundreds of young conscientious objectors without any prospects, for them to do this European voluntary service and thereby fulfil their national service requirements?"
"That is a possible suggestion. In my country there are some young people - whether or not you agree with them - who are in prison for avoiding their military service because they refuse to be labelled conscientious objectors."
"I am quite convinced that their choice should at least be respected."
"It is far easier to be a conscientious objector than spend 28 months in prison."
"In the future - not yet - a public cooperation service outside one's home country, working for peace, might replace military service so that young people could opt for that instead of going to prison."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Green Group I must, like the other speakers, commend Mrs Fontaine for this excellent work."
"The report is good because it is about young people; there are not that many issues in this Parliament which concern young people and voluntary service."
"So it is good that the emphasis is being placed on projects both within the EU and outside, for example in Eastern Europe and the third world."
"Voluntary service creates the kind of understanding and knowledge which cannot be gained at a school desk."
"The report is particularly interesting because it is about the environment and social areas which we know are areas close to young peoples' hearts and which are very interesting to work with."
"But I do have one problem here which could be the result of translation."
"Amendment No. 12 says that young people with the greatest problems should be given the opportunity to participate in the programme."
"At the same time in amendment proposal No. 25 it says that it is necessary to have good or adequate knowledge of languages to be able to participate."
"I think that these amendment proposals are somewhat contradictory, but I will check with the English language version to see if there is a mistake in the Swedish."
"Then I would say to the Commission that as it is to give a lot of money to space research and buildings for the Commission, it can surely afford 20 million ECUs for the young people of the EU to fund this excellent project."
"Mr President, first of all, we must welcome the creation of this European voluntary service programme and thank Mrs Cresson for taking this initiative. We must thank the Commissioner and Mrs Fontaine for the quality of their work."
"This transnational programme will enable young people aged 18-25 years to go on training courses in another Member State or in non-Community countries, in a spirit of solidarity."
"This should help us to find new creative forms of work."
"If this project is to succeed, it seems nevertheless worthwhile recalling the need to insert into the Treaty on Union a new article on youth, integrating this service, while maintaining the voluntary nature of the service based on a specific legal and financial status."
"This voluntary service cannot replace the compulsory or other military services, while the various activities would have to be made compatible and complementary."
"That also means close cooperation between the various organisations concerned in the European Union."
"It is vital to earmark an individualized, specific budget."
"This collective activity, by means of the diversity of learning courses and social or even vocational insertion that it might propose, should be likely to develop a better awareness of European citizenship among the young people concerned."
"At present, the programme consists of a pilot action affecting barely 2500 young people but there is already the problem of the financial envelope and the validation of the courses involved."
"It would be interesting to deliver a certificate that could become a sort of European label certifying the trainee's knowledge, including linguistic skills."
"It is obvious that at a later stage the legal framework should be specified and we shall need a proactive and concerted strategy for a European youth policy."
"Finally, I should like to remind you of something that is perhaps quite obvious but which I think should always be borne in mind by the young people who are flocking to us, showing their interest in this project - something that they do not always bear in mind."
"All young people should be concerned, including the less favoured young."
"On the other hand, this programme targets young boys and girls."
"That goes without saying but I have noticed that there are far more boys asking us for information than girls."
"These young trainees need quality training."
"This should lead to a real openness."
"The voluntary service meets genuine expectations and it would be a shame to disappoint all these young people who are now applying to take part."
"Mr President, much as I admire the rapporteur as a person and as a Vice-President of Parliament, I am unable to endorse this report."
"I do not believe that we need voluntary service organized at European level, unless it is meant to be yet another small step, using the famous technique known in French as la tactique du voleur chinois , towards a more centralized and federalist Europe."
"For example, the fact that the report claims that the Union is entitled to deal with youth policy because Article 126 makes some very low-key references to education is a typical example of this."
"I think that we, as Members, must bear in mind that the money we allocate for all these pro-European propaganda activities - in this particular case ECU 80 million, the equivalent of about BFR 3200 million - is not simply conjured out of thin air, but has to be paid for by the taxpayer, who is already the victim of fiscal terrorism."
"To be quite blunt, if we had to find the money for these things from our own pockets, we might be slightly less inclined to play Santa Claus."
"I am only sorry that I do not have more time to describe the 20 or so other objections I have to this initiative."
"As the French say, et c'est pourquoi votre fille est muette ."
"Mr President, firstly, may I refer to the remarks that Mrs Gonzalez Alvarez has just made about military service."
"Whilst I accept her comments and would fully support opposition to military service in any country, the right to be a conscientious objector and, of course, the aims of peace, it is terribly dangerous to link the voluntary service with military service and we have opposed this all the way through the negotiations."
"It is a diversion and not what the programme is about."
"This is an exciting programme - and I congratulate everyone involved - but it has a much broader dimension: Europe is about more than the movement of money, capital and goods or a single currency or the Economic Union, it is about people."
"It is about giving young people opportunities to experience life and work in other countries, to study and to travel."
"That is why we must make absolutely certain that there is no link to compulsory military service and using this as an alternative, laudable though it might be."
"Europe must be for the people; it must be about the real issues that concern people."
"That is why my Group has been pushing the questions and arguments about fighting unemployment across Europe."
"These have been highlighted in the recent elections, not just in the United Kingdom but in France."
"Young people across Europe are open-minded and are looking for opportunities that this programme provides."
"We can use this programme properly to help counter the very powerful forces that are there underneath the surface but will, if unchecked, lead to racism, fascism and nationalism."
"By travelling to other countries in this project, young people can learn about the partner countries and different ways of life."
"That is why I fully support it and I hope that it gets a good vote later on today."
"Mr President, for my generation the outstanding politician in the post-war years has to be the American President Kennedy."
"He is still a household name across the world."
"The European founding fathers, whilst rightly revered in this House and whose achievements are undoubtedly as great if not greater than Kennedy's, are less well known."
"What is Kennedy remembered for?"
"His support for Berlin during the Cold War, his inaugural address: ' ask not what your country can do for you' , but also for the Kennedy Peace Corps."
"In that idea he lent his name to a scheme that has channelled the idealism, the energy and the desire to be of use that thousands of young Americans have shown across the world for 30 years."
"Young Europeans today have that same idealism, energy, enthusiasm and desire to help."
"It is only a minority who are vandals and hooligans, although they seem to capture most of the headlines."
"That is why I strongly support the European voluntary service."
"It would help young Europeans channel their efforts on a broader level than just national."
"Mrs Fontaine's excellent report makes a number of important points - apart from the obvious that good projects always require more money."
"There must be follow-up after the experience gained: the programmes must be properly evaluated."
"We must exempt volunteers from taxes on their expenses."
"There is no idea that is so good that it is not capable of being wrecked by the taxman, so we must order them to get their hands off it right away."
"To return to the Kennedy Peace Corps, we need to give the European voluntary service a popular name and, as a British Conservative, I propose that given the connections of Mrs Cresson and Mrs Fontaine we link this support to one of the greatest Europeans of this age, FranÃ§ois Mitterrand."
"Give it a name and give it a guiding spirit!"
"This is a very good report by Nicole Fontaine, as we have come to expect."
"We are another step closer to a people's Europe, a Europe of young people, young European volunteers working together for other people instead of just for themselves."
"The Liberal Group would prefer to apply a number of conditions, however."
"Firstly, voluntary work must not be seen as a substitute for regular paid work, in other words there must be no European equivalent of 'Melkert jobs' , as we call them in Dutch."
"Secondly, there must be an even spread of participants, not just an Ã©lite and not just those who have few opportunities."
"Thirdly, there should be equal numbers of male and female participants."
"Fourthly, the ECU 60 million earmarked under the Interinstitutional Agreement is quite sufficient, as far as the Liberal Group is concerned."
"Fifth, there should be cooperation with other programmes and, sixth, there should be follow-up and annual evaluations."
"I visited the pilot project in the Molenbeek district of Brussels, and found that to be an excellent example."
"Young people there were able to see further than the ends of their national noses, as it were, and were working together to meet one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century: that of living in harmony and understanding with each other and with the many cultures from outside the European Union."
"It is a good programme: let us set the ball rolling."
"Mr President, I too commend both the Commissioner, Mrs Cresson, and our rapporteur, Mrs Fontaine, on their excellent work."
"I believe that the Commission's text, combined with the work of the Committee on Culture, the Committee on Development and Cooperation and the Committee on Women's Rights, brings together all the elements needed for this major proposal to take shape and be carried through."
"I also think it is vital for the right link to be established between European civil service and national forms of civil service, especially in order to solve the problems regarding the service performed by conscientious objectors."
"It has not been possible to tackle these problems until now because of the situation in Greece, where no civil alternative to military service existed; as from this week, however, that problem too has been resolved - albeit in a somewhat questionable way - with the adoption of a new law."
"I believe that it is important to update the information which is available in the various countries and from NGOs, and to remove all obstacles to the participation of young people of either sex."
"This will help to foster among young people and the European citizens of the future that sense of European citizenship which we are so eager to cultivate."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not against the rapporteur personally but I am going to be very critical."
"This report is overflowing with good intentions but demagoguery too; we could well ask whether there is not a hidden political agenda behind this since it has been clearly said that these young people must be the 'allies' of a certain type of European construction."
"It is a gimmick, in terms of resources, which is not very serious because, if we were really to apply the principle of subsidiarity, we would hardly see the use of this European initiative."
"The budget is very small, of course, and will only benefit a minority of privileged young people; the mass of young people will obviously be excluded."
"I am afraid that the real aim of this project is to make us forget mass unemployment provoked by a European deflationary policy and the unbridled opening up of our borders."
"We are offering voluntary work, financed from taxation, whereas the demand for company jobs is insufficient."
"The money to go into this luxury project will be taken out of the genuine fight against unemployment."
"That is an insult to unemployed people and those on low incomes and they will realize that."
"Mr President, the European voluntary service for young people is an important step towards a Europe for the people."
"There are many decisions taken in this House but few are important for the individual citizen of the Union."
"But when we talk about voluntary service, I am anxious to underline its importance."
"It gives personal development, experience and new skills to the most important resource society has, our young people."
"So I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Fontaine for her excellent work."
"She has openly listened to and accepted various proposals from those of us in the committee for culture."
"I would also like to thank my party colleague Mr Vecchi."
"We all know how important he has been as an instigator of voluntary service."
"There are many positive points in this programme."
"But I would personally like to underline the mutual exchange with third countries."
"The development of the EU is not only governed by those of us who live in the Union, but is also influenced by those who live outside."
"So it is important that young people from third countries have the opportunity to come to us and experience the culture in different parts of Europe."
"This will be particularly important if we do expand Eastwards."
"Young people are the future of Europe."
"They must be given the opportunity to meet because when people meet diplomacy is created."
"This is one way of combating the 'fortress Europe' mentality."
"Mr President, I do not wish to repeat what the other speakers have said, but I would agree with many of them that the rapporteur, Mrs Fontaine, is to be congratulated on the substance of her report and on the speed with which she has produced it."
"I should also like to congratulate the Commissioner, Mrs Cresson, on showing such dynamism in putting forward this proposal, although she is probably going to face tremendous problems in obtaining funding for it."
"As many speakers have said, this programme is clearly of vital importance for our young people, who in turn are clearly of vital importance for the further construction of Europe."
"This means that what we are dealing with here is an absolutely crucial element in Europe's overall policy of integration."
"It also means that we have no right to talk about this programme as if it were some kind of hobby-horse of Mrs Fontaine or Mrs Cresson, or of the Committee on Culture."
"This is a vital component in Europe's policy of integration."
"Why do I say this?"
"Because I very much fear that we are going to have to fight for a budget for it, and that many of our colleagues, wearing their budgetary authority hats, will say that there are so many programmes already and that the Committee on Culture has to show a little restraint, or else the Council will say that Parliament needs to show restraint."
"We have recently had some very bad experiences with the Council over important cultural programmes, and this is why I would urge that we should not launch this programme until we have an adequate budget, so as to ensure that all the young people for whom it is intended are given the chance to take part, rather than just the small group who know how to gain access to it."
"We cannot dangle a carrot in front of young people's noses and then snatch it away as soon as they try to bite."
"It would do nothing but harm to European integration, and we would simply be spreading disappointment instead of hope."
"Mr President, we can only welcome the proposal for a Community action programme 'European voluntary service for young people' , which originated in an idea from the European Parliament, I would point out, and was launched during Italy's last presidency."
"This initiative is in fact a means of enabling the leaders of tomorrow to grow up in a context which is no longer national but, at long last, European."
"We agree with the substance of the programme and with the proposals from the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, and are grateful to the rapporteur, who is proposing an increase in the funding and an extension of the age range for participants from 18 to 29, rather than 25."
"The internationalization of the market will in fact bring both risks and opportunities to those currently going through school or university and who will be entering the world of work in the near future: they must therefore be in a position to understand the new working environment and the opportunities it presents."
"We should simply like to ask the Commission to draw up a strategy document which keeps the other programme, ' Youth for Europe' , on the front burner and carries forward these two complementary initiatives in step with one another."
"Finally, we would emphasize that the most appropriate sectors for this new voluntary work scheme are environmental, sporting and cultural activities: these social values above all will help young people get to know each other and grow together."
"Mr President, I wish to compliment Mrs Cresson and the author of this important report."
"It must be possible to achieve the goal of citizenship in a responsible way, and this proposal to establish a European voluntary service will, in our view, involve young Europeans in community life, providing them with an opportunity to gain useful work experience."
"Funding is of course an important issue, and we feel that an effort should be made to increase the resources that are available. Likewise, it is important to provide the young volunteers with full information as regards their rights and duties, and to ensure that the EVS is compatible with national service and fits in with governments' plans to combat the crisis of unemployment."
"We should also like there to be guarantees of the young volunteers' rights in terms of social security cover, and to see them exempted from paying tax on their earnings throughout their period of service."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Fontaine for her excellent work on questions relating to the action programme 'European Voluntary Service for Young People'."
"This is a substantial and important youth policy programme which, if it succeeds, will have a significant multiplier effect on the mobility and employability of young people all over Europe."
"However, the implementation of the programme is being held up in a number of Member States."
"Particularly serious problems have arisen in connection with social security and taxation."
"The case of my own country, Finland, illustrates the seriousness of the problems with the implementation of the programme."
"The concept of voluntary work is foreign to Finnish employment legislation."
"In practice, this means that a young volunteer pays in Finland more tax in respect of voluntary work than he or she receives in allowance."
"This problem, which relates to national decision-making, makes it impossible to apply the principle of reciprocity between Member States."
"We Finnish MEPs, at least regardless of party allegiance, should actively work in national forums to eliminate these problems."
"Intervention is needed immediately because before these undesirable situations will lead to arbitrary discrimination in the treatment of voluntary workers in different Member States, thus endangering the future of the project."
"Finally, I should like once again to express my support for the committee's view that the Commission should submit before the end of next year to Parliament and the Council a report commenting on the main priorities of the Union's youth policy in the next millennium."
"The Commission should include without fail in its report its opinion on the future of the Youth for Europe and 'European Voluntary Service for Young People' programmes, and on the possibility of a Children's Europe programme in future, as proposed by organizations for the under-15s."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to congratulate Mrs Fontaine and the Commissioner."
"Ladies and gentlemen, voluntary action has now been turned into one of the basic instruments of action in social areas in civilian society."
"A European voluntary service could undoubtedly help to overcome the cultural and social divisions that exist, especially fostering the promotion of tolerance, peace and international solidarity."
"Our main aim is to switch from isolated experiments, without any coordination, to a broader programme, that would enable a larger number of young people to exercise an activity of general interest in a multinational framework."
"That is why I firmly support the amendments tabled by the rapporteur to the Commission proposal on a budgetary increase for the programme and the need to recognise a legal status for European voluntary service."
"It is right that this service should offer social protection, recognition and remuneration."
"Given the complex rules in the Member States, very often many young people who carry out voluntary services receive no payment at all when they get back home."
"If this service is to make any progress, as has been said, the volunteers need to have their condition recognized, so that all the young citizens of the Member States can enjoy the same payments."
"I am especially concerned that the voluntary service should not be used incorrectly or exploited in order to solve unemployment problems."
"The framework of a European programme must consider the desired guarantees in terms of free movement, residence rights and social security."
"Acquired experience should also be consolidated and that can only be achieved if we have a clear and practical legal framework and status."
"In Europe we must put a stake in our future and our young people, especially when they are willing to take part generously in our society."
"I think that it is our obligation to help and support them whenever it is possible for us to do so."
"Mr President, Commissioner Cresson has just made a most interesting statement."
"She promised Parliament a new publication from the Commission to accompany the Community action programme for European voluntary service and intended in principle for all young people in the European Union."
"She said that it was to be published in three languages: French, English and German."
"Are we therefore to conclude that the Commission has no respect for the demand expressed by the House and enshrined in the Treaties that all the official languages of the Union deserve and must be given equal treatment?"
"I should be grateful for an answer on this point."
"These documents are not addressed to all young people; they are, as I said, targeted at members of parliament and national bodies."
"If I understood you right, Mr Vanhecke, you want us to save public funds."
"We are therefore trying to do things quickly."
"I think I understood that you, like your colleagues in the same Group here in the European Parliament, are opposed to this idea and the development of a European voluntary service."
"We do not have all that much money to begin with."
"We have to be attentive."
"Of course, everything that is found on the Internet tends to be in a very few languages."
"This brochure is being distributed to the Member States and national bodies which can, of course, make local translations and distribute them locally."
"We shall do all we can to help them."
"You cannot say, on one hand, that it is too expensive and then tell us off for trying to save as much money as possible."
"This is just the beginning."
"Perhaps one day we shall be able to publish this handbook in all languages."
"For the time being we have decided to make a start and this is something that is not secondary - and I do not say that it is not important for everyone to have the handbook in their own language - but this is just the beginning and we do not have much money as you yourself said."
"We shall do our best to ensure that the handbook is available locally in as many languages as possible."
"Mrs Cresson, how quickly do you believe it will be possible for the domestic legislation on tax exemption for expenses and the necessary insurance provisions to be put in place?"
"This, of course, will also have a bearing on any prediction as to when applications relating to this programme can realistically be submitted."
"I do not think that the fact that we find ourselves today in a still highly unsatisfactory situation has held up development, since the number of demands easily outstrips the possibilities for receiving young people at present."
"The problem you refer to is a major one."
"It does not only concern young volunteers but also researchers, whose grants are absurdly taxed in certain Member States and, for example, apprentice exchanges."
"You know that we have set up revolving apprenticeships, another very interesting system of education and training: you do your apprenticeship in another Union Member State and you are paid a small amount and, of course, you have to pay tax in the country where you are doing your apprenticeship."
"We have also published a Green paper to be debated by Council."
"I should like the subject of obstacles to youth exchanges to be dealt with as a whole, and that would mean dealing with young volunteers, young apprentices and young researchers finishing a doctorate for example."
"Mr Monti, the Commissioner in charge of the single market and with whom I cooperate on this subject, is dealing actively with this idea."
"We hope that we can persuade the Member States as quickly as possible."
"To that end - and here too I am not only tackling the enormous obstacles to mobility found in the voluntary service but also those found among all young people concerned - I would like you to take appropriate steps in your Member States; the amount to be paid by the Member States is derisory since the payments in question are minimal."
"It is usually the interior ministries that control the young people entering the country."
"We have not only made Europe for capital and goods."
"We have also made it for the movement of people, especially the young, and I would therefore be very grateful if you could help us with this operation of convincing the Member States of the utility of this programme."
"Once again, it is a question of subsidiarity, which concerns several ministers within each Member State: finance, interior, social affairs for social welfare issues."
"That is the problem: four or five times fifteen ministers to deal with."
"The horizontal side is far harder than the vertical side."
"That is why we need the European Parliament's help in this matter."
"SOCRATES' action programme"
"The next item is the report (A4-0188/97) by Mrs Pack, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision amending Decision 819/95/EC establishing the Community action programme 'SOCRATES' ."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking today about the Socrates programme."
"We are not undertaking an evaluation of the programme today; it was simply agreed during the conciliation process back in 1995 that we should meet at this time to establish whether or not the funds we assigned to the programme for a five-year period in 1995 would prove sufficient."
"Nevertheless, let me say a few words on the programme and its extraordinary importance."
"This programme was not created to hamper the work of Member States but to demonstrate everywhere the added value that European education can bring and to promote the European dimension within education, thereby bringing the European Union closer to its citizens."
"The achievements of the programme in boosting European cooperation have come to encompass quite new sectors of education."
"As you will be aware, in the part of the programme known as Comenius we have been dealing with school twinning, and for the first time we have also addressed adult education, a subject that was especially prominent last year, the European Year of Lifelong Learning, and have begun to consider open and distance learning. You will also be aware that another part of the Socrates programme, namely Erasmus - another of the fruits of this Parliament - has been one of the European Union's great success stories, enabling students to undertake courses of study abroad that will be recognized in their own countries."
"Lingua, which promotes the acquisition of foreign-language skills, is also part of the programme."
"So I believe it is a programme that appeals to infinite numbers of people, from six-year-old children to pensioners attending adult-education centres in order to find out more about Europe and to see Europe in a new light."
"In this programme we have also created the opportunity in the 15 Member States to add an extra European dimension to the curriculum, especially within initial and in-service teacher training."
"After all, how can we expect our children to develop into European citizens if their teachers are Euro-ostriches?"
"Teachers too must be moulded into real Europeans in their initial and in-service training, so that they can pass this on to children, adolescents and students."
"This is an extremely good programme, and it accurately reflects the spirit of Article 126 of the Treaty."
"It helps to ensure a high quality of education throughout the entire Community."
"To all those who object to it I have to say that it is not a matter of our undermining subsidiarity."
"We are only doing what the Member States are not willing and sometimes not able to do."
"Let us get on at last with what we can do well!"
"This programme has one serious problem, namely a shortage of money."
"I do not wish to go into any further detail on its content."
"All I want to say is that the programme was set up in 1995 for twelve States."
"Then along came three more Member States and all the EEA countries."
"And now we have taken a political decision, which Parliament supported, that the associated countries are to take part."
"We want young Poles, young Hungarians, young Czechs, young Slovaks, young Romanians, Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians."
"We want to include them all in the programme, because this is a way in which we can spread the European ideal more widely in those countries."
"But now we are left with no money."
"We only have the funds that were allocated to us in 1995."
"That, of course, is insufficient to meet even the target we originally set ourselves."
"At that time we told the Council that our consent to the result of the conciliation process was wholly dependent on our coming together again after two and a half years to consider whether the money would suffice."
"It will not suffice!"
"We should need at least ECU 165 million for two years to come anywhere near meeting our own target."
"However, we are moderate in our demands and are only seeking ECU 100m, since we can more or less get by on that."
"But if we go along with the Commission and the 50m I proposed - the Commission could not ask for more than that, because of the other constraints upon it - we shall actually have less in real terms than we had planned on the basis of twelve Member States."
"That is why I believe we shall be doing ourselves no favours by economizing on this programme."
"We shall be doing ourselves no favours, and we shall be denying our own principles."
"If we listen to politicians, they are always saying that Europe is a people's Europe."
"And it is those people of Europe, in all walks of life and at all ages, who benefit from this very programme."
"We, however, shall have to turn round and tell them we have no money to give."
"Please back the European Parliament in its struggle with the Council, so that a better result can be obtained in the conciliation committee."
"To that end I need a convincing vote from this Parliament."
"Mr President, this is of course, as everyone is aware, a very important programme and I remember vividly the lengthy negotiations we had in 1995 over the conciliation process which is obviously part and parcel of where we are today, looking at the funding."
"Mrs Pack has already spoken eloquently about the value and importance of this programme and Mrs Cresson also spoke earlier."
"This programme is important because Europe must be, and is, more than just big business and capital, moving money about Europe and people getting richer and richer."
"It is about people, it is about young people."
"It is about involving schools and educational establishments across Europe, and giving them the opportunities to interlink with one another."
"Socrates has been a great success."
"People are talking about the programme and they often write to me to find out more about it."
"It is already four times over-subscribed."
"We could find plenty of students for every place."
"Students who have been on those programmes or schools that have been involved in exchanges have tremendous experiences that they will remember for the rest of their lives and they build the foundations for the Europe that we want to see."
"This is only a small budget increase we are looking for."
"I wish it were much more than that because this is a really useful investment."
"The European Parliament and European Union provide subsidies for tobacco farming, breeding bulls for bull-fighting and, if we are to believe the press reports this week, breeding beetles in Italy for alcoholic drinks colouring, and yet we seem to be balking at or objecting to a small increase in the project."
"I wish it were a larger increase but we have to argue for this for the young people of today and tomorrow."
"Mr President, the young people of Europe can be proud that they are represented by individuals such as Mrs Pack, who has moved heaven and earth to promote this programme and to obtain the extra budget for it."
"It is quite scandalous that such tremendous efforts should be necessary, because as Mrs Pack said, it was agreed that we would eventually review the budget, and the programme has been so successful - indeed, it risks becoming the victim of its own success - that there is every reason to extend it to many more countries."
"As chairman of the Committee on Culture, I have been bombarded with requests from various countries claiming that we promised that they could participate in the programmes and that they have projects ready, but are never given a chance."
"Here again, as I said about the other programme, we are spreading disappointment instead of promoting the idea that young people are the future, and that Europe needs young people for its future too."
"This is a very dangerous thing to do."
"If we look at the Union's information policy - and it is something we need to talk about, it is such a disaster - there is little point in allocating more money for improving information in general if, in disseminating information about this programme, we just end up bringing disappointment to so many young people."
"It would be counter-productive, and it simply means that both we in the House and the Council have no choice but to accept that this programme is successful, that it serves to promote European integration and that it should be extended to all the countries involved in European integration."
"So if the programme is to be made accessible to all, the budget for it also needs to be increased."
"This is what I would call compulsory expenditure, although I know that the term is given a different meaning, because we simply must not cheat people."
"If we give rights to people - young people - then they must also be allowed to exercise them."
"So there should really be no question of debating whether we need to increase the budget."
"We have offered people something, and neither we nor the Council of Ministers can now afford to tell them that it is only available for the few, and the rest get nothing."
"I would end by urgently calling on the Commission to join Parliament in campaigning for a decent budget increase for this programme, now and in the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by adding my own congratulations to Mrs Pack to those offered by other speakers."
"I wish to remind everyone of the great success which the SOCRATES programme is enjoying within the Union, especially in promoting higher education through ERASMUS and language learning through LINGUA."
"SOCRATES has given a tremendous boost to the mobility and exchanges of students, teachers and assistants, as well as the creation of cooperation networks."
"The number of inter-university cooperation programmes has so far reached 2673."
"The success of SOCRATES has led to a rise in applications to participate in the various actions covered by the programme, in particular since 1995, from students and teachers alike."
"Across the European Union there are in fact some 60 million school pupils and 11 million students."
"The Commission has proposed increasing by ECU 50 million the funding already set at ECU 850 m by the Council for the period 1995-99."
"This sum, which is much less than the ECU 1005 m initially proposed for 12 Member States, is now woefully inadequate for the present 15 Member States, plus the EFTA countries, the CCEEs and Cyprus, which have been included in the programme."
"The fact is that in 1998-99, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and Cyprus will be participating fully in the programme; with the help of the PHARE programme, the CCEEs will be contributing some ECU 70 m, but if this participation is to be meaningful, that effort will have to be reciprocated by the Member States to the tune of some ECU 70 m."
"The demand is therefore far outstripping the financial scope of the programme."
"So it is clear that if we really wish to give a boost to European education through information and communication campaigns for our citizens, carried out by the EU, the necessary funding must be found."
"Otherwise, we shall lose credibility in the eyes of the citizens who wish to build the Europe of tomorrow - those young people who are expecting not just words or promises, but practical action from the Union - especially in times like the present, when ideals are under threat and culture has to play its rightful role."
"Mr President, my warmest congratulations to Mrs Pack on her fine report and her energetic work in defence of the Socrates Programme."
"The Socrates Programme is really a European success story which is coming to a sad and untimely end just as it was gaining speed, at least as regards its objectives."
"This will at any rate be true if the programme does not immediately obtain the ECU 100 m it needs in additional funding to meet the increased needs."
"And even this increase will not be enough to meet the growing needs and expectations of the present Member States, since this amount of additional funding will be needed just to launch this programme properly in the CEECs."
"The ECU 50 m which the Commission has proposed is therefore not enough and the Committee on Culture has been quite unanimous in stating that at least ECU 100 m are needed. It is not necessary to increase the whole budget by this amount: the resources could be taken from somewhere else, for example the EU's appropriations for information."
"Activities of the type of the Socrates Programme amount to much better and more positive information work than hastily completed information campaigns."
"The varied educational cooperation to be carried out in the framework of the Socrates Programme is also the best preparation for closer EU cooperation and membership."
"For this reason, the gates of Socrates should really be opened to the associated countries."
"In the same way it would be irresponsible to state coolly to the young people of the current Member States that Socrates is an elite programme for a chosen few, in which the number and level of grants does not even begin to meet requirements."
"However, a great deal of positive and promising developments have been achieved under the Socrates Programme in terms of in terms of improving the quality of education in the whole of Europe."
"In my opinion, it is particularly important to continue work on the further education of teachers and on developing and broadening language teaching, for these are the real prerequisites if we are to achieve that vital 'European added value'."
"In the EU, there is justified concern that citizens do not feel the EU's activity relates to or is meaningful for them."
"With that in mind, we cannot afford to weaken the credibility of this programme which is so important to our citizens and works so well."
"Mr President, we Greens believe that in order not to compromise SOCRATES, which was originally designed to meet the needs of only 12 Member States, it is now essential to increase the funds allocated for its implementation."
"The growing number of applications under the programme and, above all, the involvement of 11 new countries as from 1998, require an increase in the budget in order to ensure reciprocal mobility between the European Union and the associated countries."
"The Commission's proposed budget increase of 5.9 % is utterly inadequate and takes no account either of real demand or of the extension of the programme to cover the associated countries."
"We would not wish the success of SOCRATES to be jeopardized; nor would we wish it to benefit only those who can afford to foot the bill for their stay in the host country."
"For this reason, the Greens strongly support the request by Mrs Pack: we are calling for a substantial increase in funding, so as to send a positive signal to the educational community and to public opinion."
"Mr President, really, the resources that the European Union puts into its youth policy are at the heart of this morning's debates."
"That is the problem of the Socrates programme: everyone recognizes its positive qualities and the need to enhance its activities."
"But that desire will be useless unless the budget is considerably increased."
"That is why we must support the aim of 100 million ECU as proposed by our rapporteur, Mrs Pack, whose work I must congratulate."
"Let us not forget that, during conciliation, the European Parliament only accepted the 850 million ECU, far below the initial proposal, on the condition that those aims should be revised after two years."
"The association of certain central and eastern European countries in these programmes, to take place very shortly, even if cofunded by the Phare programme, will make certain adjustments necessary."
"This is just one example, but it shows that if we want the Socrates programmes to meet its legitimate expectations, it will have to be given a larger budget."
"Mr President, although the EU was originally founded as an economic union, it is increasingly developing into an educational union."
"In view of the fraught situation in the labour market and competition from cheap but poorly trained workforces, Europe's best chance lies in a high level of education and training."
"That is why we regard the development of Community action programmes in the educational domain as a wisely chosen and effective means, albeit in the medium term, of combating unemployment in Europe and why we consider the Socrates programme to be an important investment in the future of our continent."
"Although the replenishment of the programme budget certainly merits our support in principle, the extra funds must be found by means of internal reallocations so as to avoid additional strains on the Community purse and to prevent any increases in national membership contributions."
"In addition, we consider it indispensable that strict controls and complete transparency be required of the executive bodies for each of the supported projects to prevent the disbursement of any unwarranted aid."
"With regard to the inclusion in the Socrates programme of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which we also very much welcome, we would insist that substantiated needs assessments be drawn up with a view to identifying the actual financial requirements."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is high time that the question of replenishing Socrates was put into a far broader political context."
"It is, as we know, an excellent means of promoting the construction of Europe, because it creates, through encounter and exchange, an enduring basis for international understanding and helps to promote both the mobility and the qualification of young people in the education process and in their working lives."
"But since an ever smaller number of applications for assistance can be approved and since the grants are sometimes embarrassingly paltry, which tends to make the programme socially exclusive, the case for replenishment is actually irrefutable."
"I congratulate Mrs Pack on her report and her comments, including those on the funding target, and I should like to say that it is highly desirable that the States of Central and Eastern Europe should be fully involved in this programme at last."
"If, however, the funding is not replenished, the exchange programmes in the countries of Western Europe will inevitably be curtailed."
"Another reason why we need more resources - and I must emphasize this - is to alleviate the social shortcomings of the programme."
"For example, more young people from small and medium-sized businesses ought to be given exchange opportunities."
"To that end we shall have to devise a new structure for the awarding of grants."
"Scarcely any of these young people will take part in exchange programmes on their own initiative and at their own expense."
"The youngsters undergoing vocational training also need to encounter the cultures of their European neighbours as a practical exercise in tolerance and openness."
"That is important if we really want to strike at the roots of the intolerance and xenophobia that are once more rearing their heads in Europe."
"We must have scope, for example, to organize a greater number of exchange programmes within the framework of town-twinning arrangements."
"Foreign languages are important in an increasingly internationalized world."
"At the same time, the fact that just below one per cent of all students on vocational courses have taken part in such exchanges is unsatisfactory."
"An increasingly global economy demands the globalization, in other words the internationalization, of the education process."
"Our training standards are in competition today with those of other parts of the world."
"This is where we Europeans shall have to win our spurs."
"Education, mobility and job prospects are becoming ever more closely linked in a chain of cause and effect."
"In that respect Socrates is also a contribution to employment policy in Europe."
"Mr President, let me begin by expressing my sincere congratulations and thanks to Doris Pack for her sterling effort."
"We all know from our own countries how well the Socrates programme is working and how popular it is."
"I am sure that each one of us knows at least one student who has studied in another European country on an Erasmus scholarship or a school class that has organized an exchange through Comenius."
"And despite this positive feedback we want to cut the funding of Socrates."
"No, that is unthinkable!"
"Socrates is one of the bestknown Community programmes; its activities are right in line with the needs of our people and directly touch their lives."
"The programme has numerous achievements to its name, including an increase in mobility within the European Union and progress towards mutual recognition of degrees."
"We cannot keep on talking about closeness to citizens and then fail to guarantee the future of such a successful programme."
"Moreover, I believe that greater importance should attach to the aspect of adult education within the Socrates programme."
"Only by topping up the programme with at least another ECU 100m can we make sure that the loudly proclaimed motto of lifelong learning is effectively put into practice."
"Socrates can and must make a contribution to this and other innovation processes if the European Union wants to remain true to its educational aims and to demonstrate that it is at one with its citizens."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the first few years of its application, the SOCRATES programme, which is aimed at promoting the European dimension in education and in particular at bringing the Union closer to its citizens, succeeded beyond all expectations."
"It has enabled young people and adults to learn far more than they could in the past about the reality of Europe, its languages and its culture, and this, we believe, is crucial to greater and more effective unity on our continent."
"Once in a while, we are unanimous in expressing our approval of an initiative and a wish for it to be supported and continued in the future."
"There is, however, a problem of funding."
"Initially, as we know, the Commission proposed an overall sum of ECU 1005 million for 12 Member States."
"The final decision, adopted two years ago, allocated only ECU 850 m to the programme for a total of 39 countries - in the meantime, the Member States had grown to 15, and then there are the 13 EFTA countries, the ten CCEEs, and Cyprus."
"So, while entirely understanding the Commission's financial reasons for proposing an increase of only ECU 50 m for this programme, I share the view of the rapporteur - whom I would compliment - that this project must receive additional funding of at least ECU 100 m."
"I am also a member of the Committee on Budgets, and I know that it would not be impossible to transfer these resources from other headings."
"To give just one example, I think that a Parliament and other EU institutions which are faced every day with the excessive costs of the premises in which they operate must be able to find a way of funding this major cultural initiative."
"The rapporteur spoke about the importance of Socrates as an instrument of education policy."
"But I should like to reemphasize this political aspect that has already been touched upon."
"We lament, do we not, the ubiquitous reawakening of nationalist tendencies, especially among young people."
"Then the European Union creates an excellent means of combating these inclinations by making the idea of Europe come alive for hundreds of thousands of students, whereupon we start trying to curtail this programme right, left and centre, thereby rendering it ineffectual."
"There are two things that must not happen."
"First of all, these financial restrictions must not mean that only students from wealthy backgrounds can afford to engage in such programmes."
"Even now it is difficult for students to survive on these grants in a foreign university city."
"Secondly, it would be an act of political folly to extend this programme to Eastern Europe and then be unable to fund it."
"That would be absolute political madness."
"For that reason, I support the bid for replenishment and, incidentally, consider it essential that the whole issue of EU assistance be thoroughly reviewed."
"We can see in the present case that the Union is getting its priorities wrong."
"Education is a very important aim, and I hope it is an aim that we shall achieve."
"Mr President, the second most important decision in a person's life is the decision to pursue a particular career."
"The most important decision is the choice of a marriage partner."
"I believe that both of these decisions have to be well thought out and carefully examined, and it is important that more information about future career opportunities should be provided in school, so that pupils' education can be structured accordingly."
"The Socrates programme addresses this very point with its research activities and its initial and in-service teacher training measures."
"I believe that Socrates assures us that future educational requirements can be met, that the education system will not disregard market needs and that parents, teachers and pupils will be well aware of the educational qualifications which will be demanded in the future."
"We have politicians who believe that an additional article or law can create jobs."
"I believe that jobs can only be created if people are taught how to produce the goods or provide the services that consumers want."
"This means that in vocational training and in businesses we must teach people how to manufacture products, how to supply products and services that consumers will buy."
"The Socrates programme, with its very sharp focus on in-service training, has a huge amount to offer here, as does the Leonardo programme."
"They can quite simply teach people what they need in order to be able to meet the demands of the future."
"Forthcoming projects such as the introduction of the euro and our eastward enlargement are also important steps for which we must educate our teachers, our pupils and our adult citizens. That is why lifelong learning, and hence Leonardo, is of vital importance to our future and must therefore be given absolute priority."
"Mr President, with new socialist governments coming in across Europe, the emphasis on a people's Europe is very important."
"No programme demonstrates a people's Europe more than SOCRATES - except perhaps the voluntary service which we have just been discussing."
"Thousands of students and pupils across the European Union have the possibility of participating in exchange programmes and getting to know their fellow citizens."
"That is why, two and half years ago, we were not happy with the amount of money proposed by the Council and, during the conciliation process, we negotiated a return at this point to look again at the finances."
"The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media feels very strongly that in order to do justice to the programme, a substantial increase in funding is necesssary."
"Since 1994, not only have we seen an increase in the number of EU Member States and their right to apply for funding, but only now will the full impact of the information campaigns conducted in 1995 and 1996 be felt."
"Only now will certain areas within the programme become fully available for the first time."
"In addition, there is increased demand under the various projects because of partnerships developed as a result of the European Year of Lifelong Learning, which was very successful across the European Union."
"Nor should we forget the recommendations of the final report of the taskforce on educational software and multimedia."
"All that money has to be found now out of the SOCRATES programme."
"What happens if we do not find the funding?"
"Theoretically, there is available a maximum grant of ECU 5, 000 per year per student, but if all the eligible students received the money they applied for, this would in reality amount to no more than ECU 75 per student per month."
"That is unacceptable."
"There will certainly be no problem spending the money."
"The programme is oversubscribed four times and is constrained in the budget guidelines where it is a priority."
"It will certainly remain at the top of our agenda."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Europe will not have any future unless it treats its younger generation very carefully."
"The single currency, freedom of movement and common security will be as nought without people who want to and who know how to build upon that foundation a world of peace and a better life."
"SOCRATES is a programme which, supported by the indisputable success of the ERASMUS university exchange visits, is enabling an increasing number of students and lecturers to exchange experience and to compare knowledge, thus creating a European Community of the spirit and of the heart."
"We know that it is neither healthy nor sustainable to have a single world superpower."
"Europe must accept the challenge and take its proper role for the benefit of the equilibrium of this new globalized society."
"The Union cannot continue another day as an economic giant and a social, political and cultural dwarf."
"We therefore need not only to retain but to step up exponentially, year by year, the SOCRATES programme and the new European voluntary service which is its natural counterpart."
"Those are the only means by which we can change people's mentality and attitude."
"Those are the only ways to reverse the dangerous trend towards isolationism, individualism and consumerism, which are destroying us and discrediting us."
"SOCRATES, Mr President, is a success story."
"What blindness has led to a proposal for a zero growth rate in the budget for 1998 which had to be forcibly extracted by our courageous rapporteur, Mrs Doris Pack?"
"I feel tempted, Mr President, to make a proposal for a special SOCRATES programme for political decision makers."
"Perhaps thereafter we would see more clearly the priorities of this Europe which we say we love, but which we do not know how to build."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to thank the European Parliament for dealing with this proposal so quickly - it was only adopted less than three months ago."
"That shows just how committed you are to this programme."
"When it was adopted, just over two years ago, the programme benefitted from the European Parliament's firm support."
"I should like to thank Mrs Pack, in particular, for her excellent report, and Mrs DÃ¼hrkop DÃ¼hrkop for supporting the issue at the Committee on Budgets."
"The Socrates programme is essential for the construction of the so-called 'union of knowledge' that we fully support."
"Of course, it would be better to speak in a quieter chamber, where everyone is seated."
"Please be quiet, ladies and gentlemen, so that we can hear Mrs Cresson's explanations."
"As you yourselves have recalled, Socrates enables us to approach the Union of all citizens, and I am thinking in particular of the 70 million or so young people in the Community, 4 million teachers, 11 million students and all adults in training at present."
"On the eve of the Amsterdam European Council, which we are trying to involve all European citizens in, Socrates will be an exemplary demonstration of European construction at the service of individuals."
"It also plays a decisive role for developing human resources, a key to the recovery of lost jobs, economic competitiveness and growth."
"It is also a major element for the process of enlarging the Community, since it opens up to Cyprus and the countries of central and eastern Europe associated in the programmes, preparing their citizens and their institutions for accession."
"It should also be emphasized that these results are obtained at extremely low cost."
"Even with the increase in the budgetary amount earmarked by the Commission, Socrates accounts for only 0.2 % of the Community's 1998 budget."
"That is why, given its importance, the Commission and the European Parliament, as it happens, can only regret the financial amount voted on two years ago and, as you recall, it was a 150 million ECU reduction over our initial proposal."
"The experience of two years demonstrates that the Commission's initial proposal was not only realistic but was the bare minimum."
"The programme has received a particularly enthusiastic reception in educational circles throughout the Member States."
"It is one of the most popular programmes and there is not a Member State where the teachers, young people, students and schools have not heard of the European Union's education programmes."
"In proposing an increase in the budget, after these two years of developing the programme, the Community intends to meet the high expectations shown by ordinary people."
"Examining the amendments tabled by the European Parliament..."
"Excuse, but I have the feeling that you are being greatly disturbed by the background noise."
"Please, ladies and gentlemen, be quiet."
"It is very unpleasant to speak when there is noise."
"You all know that as you have all experienced it."
"Thank you."
"Examining the amendments tabled to our draft decision by the European Parliament, it seems clear that they mostly strengthen the Commission's arguments in favour of increasing the budget, something that we have unerringly defended at the Council."
"I can only welcome that support."
"It is the case of the first amendment which draws attention to the White Paper and the Green Paper and the budgetary priority that the European Parliament gives to the education programme."
"Of course, we can accept that amendment."
"We also take on board the second amendment, strengthening the Commission's arguments concerning the consequences of maintaining the financial status quo or too small an increase that would steadily reduce the amount of support granted."
"This amendment will therefore be accepted, with a slight change in order to balance the analysis of the impact that a rejection of the increase would have had."
"The same is true of the third amendment."
"In its explanatory memorandum, the Commission drew attention to the budgetary impact for Member States' establishments if Socrates is opened up to the associate countries of central and eastern Europe and Cyprus."
"The amendment will therefore be accepted with a slight alteration in the wording."
"I would also add that the countries of central and eastern Europe can already benefit from the Phare programmes."
"If the costs directly linked to the participation of these new countries are also met by their own contributions, cooperation with those countries might lead to further major costs for the institutions of the Member States."
"The amendment will be slightly altered in order to take into account the fact that the opening up of the programme has not yet come into effect, something scheduled for the second half of 1997."
"As for the fourth amendment, the Commission feels that the arguments set out in it are already sufficiently taken into account in amendments 2 and 3 and it will therefore not be taken on board."
"The fifth amendment introduces a pertinent reference to the budgetary context enabling the funding of the increase proposed in the draft decision submitted by the Commission."
"It will therefore be accepted with a slight alteration to the wording."
"On the other hand, while noting that it strengthens the arguments in favour of a budget increase, the Commission cannot at this stage accept the sixth amendment on an increase in the additional amount."
"It feels that, given the current budgetary situation, it would be difficult to propose such a large amount."
"In 1998, the Commission has proposed an 11 % increase for Socrates over 1997 and that 11 % should be set alongside the increase in internal policies of only 0.5 %."
"In other words an 11 % increase for Socrates compared with only 0.5 % for the internal polices, also compared with a mere 6 % increase for education, youth and training policies as a whole."
"It is not perfect but the figures show that we want to make progress with Socrates."
"Of course, I am aware of the disappointment that this might raise among members of the European Parliament who have fought, along with us, for this programme to have a budget more in line with its future prospects and the expectations of our fellow citizens."
"I can, however, assure you that the Commission will pay considerable attention to the outcome of your debates."
"Your support for the Community programme in the education fields will have considerable impact on the Socrates programme in its current form and will continue to have effects as we develop our activities beyond 2000."
"This is the time for beginning to devise the next generation of Community programmes and those responsible for that work will largely take your suggestions into account."
"I should like to stress how crucial this moment is, since this work is taking place at the same time as the preparation of new financial perspectives."
"Your commitment to strengthening the resources of the Socrates programme is a very clear commitment and political message as to your priorities for European action in the future."
"I take this message as a very strong sign of encouragement and thank you for that."
"Our applause demonstrates how attentively we all listened to you, Commissioner."
"Thank you."
"The debate is closed."
"We now proceed to the vote."
"VOTES"
"Ladies and gentlemen, we now proceed to the votes."
"As you can see, the situation is quite difficult."
"We have a lot of votes to get through."
"The votes contain thirty or so pages of text."
"Either we vote until 1.30 p.m. or postpone the Fontaine report until this evening, an idea not opposed by the rapporteur even though it contains a legislative proposal."
"Report (A4-0173/97) by Mr Sturdy, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural development, on the proposals for 16 Council regulations on the prices for agricultural products and related measures 1997-1998 (COM(97)0089 - C4-0114/97 to C4-0129/97-97-0087(CNS) to 97/0089(CNS), 97/0091(CNS) to 97/0094(CNS) - 97/0096(CNS) to 97/0102(CNS), 97/0905(CNS) and 07/0906(CNS))"
"Madam President, perhaps I can ease the pressure somewhat with the PPE Group's motion on the Sturdy report."
"On behalf of my group I should like to move a postponement of the vote on this report."
"Let me explain the motion in three sentences."
"In its vote on the Sturdy report the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted a balanced package on agricultural prices."
"The package, however, entails additional costs of around ECU 170m in total."
"This, of course, is a problem, not least because of the present budgetary constraints upon the entire Union, ourselves included."
"Parallel to these votes we have the ad hoc procedure for the 1998 financial year, and there are signs that this procedure could yield a compensatory amount which would far outweigh the ECU 170m."
"To spell out the fiscal neutrality of this measure, we had tabled amendments 31 to 46 - one for each legislative resolution - but these were declared inadmissible for formal reasons."
"In view of these circumstances, we should like to propose that the vote on the Sturdy report take place with the report on the ad hoc procedure. This would also ensure that the budgetary integrity of the House is upheld."
"I request your consent."
"Mr BÃ¶ge, if I understand you right, you want Rule 131 to be applied."
"Does anyone oppose that?"
"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your massive vote in favour of my report."
"The day before yesterday, Madam President, Commissioner Fischler declared that he was refusing to take into account 20 of our 22 amendments to his very watered-down proposal."
"The two amendments he accepted are purely formal ones."
"My initial reaction to this attitude, royally ignoring the proposals we adopted here two and a half years ago in favour of direct aids to save European bee-keeping, was to ask for referral back to the Commission."
"But as you have just massively adopted my report, and in order not to waste more time with pointless discussions with the Commission, in the light of its attitude, I turn to the Council of Ministers and hope that it will not ignore our proposals, proposals that the European Parliament has thought long and hard about for 12 years, and will follow them up."
"Madam President, it is in this spirit that I ask you to adopt the legislative proposal."
"(Applause)"
"Very well, Mrs Lulling, I will put the legislative resolution to the vote but first would turn to Mrs Cresson to find out whether, by any chance, Commissioner Fischler has done any thinking over night."
"Unfortunately, I have not had the opportunity to meet Mr Fischler this morning to find out whether he has done any thinking over night, but if I have any new information, I shall inform you."
"No doubt you will pass on to him the displeasure of the European Parliament."
"I also, of course, regret the Council's absence."
"I now put the legislative resolution to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"I have no amendments on this motion but I do have a request for a correction, moved by Mr Jarzembowski, and an oral amendment to paragraph 4, to be moved by Mr Cornelissen."
"Madam President, we have agreed to do these two things jointly in order to save time."
"The correction I request is the deletion in recital D of the reference to the meeting of the Tourism Council, since it never took place."
"So that is a technical matter."
"If nobody in the House objects, we ask that in point 4 the words 'to take into account' be replaced by 'to adopt without further delay' ."
"That is our oral amendment."
"Are there any objections to Mr Jarzembowski's proposals?"
"No."
"Then I put the motion for a resolution thus corrected to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Madam President, I am just taking the floor briefly to point out that the Green Group and many other Members tabled amendments once again this year to mark the fact that, through its farm price support for the beef sector, the European Union is continuing to fund bullfighting."
"Since we feel that this is totally at odds with the spirit of the Treaty, and with the sensibilities of most members of European society, we feel that we cannot go on subsidizing such a cruel form of spectacle, which has a coarsening effect on those who go to watch it and is cruel to the animals involved."
"For these reasons, the House spoke out against this activity last year, at least in the form of a recital, leaving it to the Commission and the Council to take appropriate action."
"Nothing was done."
"That is why similar amendments have once again been tabled, and on behalf of the Green Group, I express my support for these, even though the House has unfortunately not seen fit to follow our approach."
"We are abstaining from voting on this report because we think that the Common Agricultural Policy must undergo fundamental reforms."
"The current tightly regulated agricultural policy is bureaucratic, ineffective and unjustifiably politically divisive."
"We hope that agricultural policy will be drastically reformed in 1999 and will do all that we can to see that this happens."
"With regard to amendment proposal No. 9 concerning fully grown cattle, it was with great disappointment that I noticed that the European Parliament did not approve the amendment proposal on bull fighting."
"I cannot understand how the European Parliament can approve the use of EU agricultural aid for animals which are used in bull fighting."
"This mad, barbaric manner of treating animals should not, in my opinion, be given any economic support."
"I personally supported the amendment proposals on this without hesitation."
"The European Parliament has to consider sixteen regulations setting 1998 agricultural prices."
"The background for this annual - but today especially gloomy - agricultural mass can be summed up in three dates:"
"1999 the single currency and the 'year III package' on five-year budgetary programming; 2000 the opening of negotiations at the WTO; 2002 the beginning of enlargement to the East."
"These three dates, three violent upheavals, give the Commission grist to its mill in its accountant's view of a policy of austerity and rationing."
"That explains why 1998 farm prices have been frozen, with a reduction in compensatory aids and a lowering of cereal and oil-seed prices, together with a reduction in set-aside premiums - the 1998 setaside rate was already around 10 %, with a threat of a basic rate of 17.65 %."
"This rationing is justified given the levels of overproduction and excessive stocks."
"Brussels is showing one of those early 1990s disaster movies, threatening us with stocks of 58 million tonnes of cereals in 2005, on the pretext of a good harvest of 202 million tonnes in 1996-1997, 60 million in France alone."
"Yet the Commission obviously omits to state that world stocks are at all time lows, only 40 consumption days of stocks."
"So much so that, in order to maintain stocks on the European market, a 15 ECU per tonne surcharge is being levied on exports."
"It seems that we have gone back to the Ancien RÃ©gime, when cereal shortages were arranged to benefit a few people."
"In other words the real solution would be to abolish both ordinary and extraordinary set-asides."
"The 'prices package' stems from the draft EAGGF-Guarantee budget."
"Whereas the guidelines provided for an expenditure ceiling of 43, 267 million ECU, the provisional budget for the next year is only 41, 009 million ECU, a 0.5 % increase over the current agriculture budget."
"Most of the Member States are imposing very strict spending limits in order to meet the convergence criteria provided for by the Treaty on European Union and conditioning participation in economic and monetary union."
"Farmers are therefore contributing 2.258 million ECU to the achievement of EMU, taking into account only the EAGGF-Guarantee Budget."
"The Commission is therefore proposing a prices package that could be summed up by a prices freeze and a reduction in aids (reduction in monthly premia for intervention prices in cereals, rice and sugar stock recovery)."
"In its proposal the European Commission specifies that the measure proposed in the prices package are to be taken along with its previous proposal to change the payment of aids for arable crops, providing for a 7 % reduction, and a reduction in set-aside payments in terms of land that is not set aside."
"The aim is to save 1400 million ECU out of the 1998 agriculture budget."
"Instead of this tight financial approach to farming, the European Commission should take a social approach to the countryside for which farming is the backbone."
"In terms of social issues, 1996 was disastrous for the farming world: 600 000 farms disappeared, 230 000 full-time jobs were slashed."
"In addition to these alarming figures is the fact that farming-related rural jobs were also lost, in the trade, crafts and public services sectors."
"Our Group supports the amendments tables and voted in committee."
"Mr Tillich, the budget rapporteur general, has said that he intends to reject amendments that would 'cost' 140 million ECU out of a total budget of 41, 009 million ECU, the EAGGF-Guarantee budget, for the sake of budgetary rigour and for introducing the single currency."
"We hope that the Council will take on board the Commission proposals in order to enable a maximum number of farmers and farm workers to preserve their working tools and their jobs in a Europe where unemployment is increasing at an alarming rate (now more than 12 million unemployed)."
"Funk report (A4-0176/97)"
"We have chosen to vote in accordance with the European Social Democratic Group line and go along with the Commission's proposal to reduce compensation payments for agricultural crops."
"We think that this is the most that can be achieved at the moment."
"But our basic opinion is that agricultural subsidies must be reduced much more than is implied in the Commission proposal."
"We shall vote for the Funk report since it rejects the bases of the Commission proposal on a system of production aids for certain arable crops."
"In fact the Commission was planning to release funds intended to finance the BSE emergency plans by postponing advances for oilseeds and reducing aid for cereals and set-aside - measures which will become permanent and irreversible into the bargain."
"The BSE hearing concluded that the financing of the various consequences should be covered by the budget and/or charged to the Member State principally responsible for the spread of the disease."
"The Commission hoped to obtain this financing from the savings made from cuts in agricultural aid."
"The Funk report earned our vote by rejecting that Commission proposal."
"It is right to stress, however, that neither this present Commission proposal nor this report form a suitable backdrop for analysing any possible changes for the future re-shaping of the Common Agricultural Policy, such as the (welcome as far as we are concerned) changes to aid for these crops intended, by means of increasing aid to small-scale producers, to boost the lowest incomes, or incomes where there is no alternative to farming or where farmers are working in less-favoured regions."
"The BSE crisis led to a drop in beef consumption and a huge drop in beef prices."
"Given the responsibility of the European Commission, as highlighted by the report of the ad hoc committee of inquiry, it is normal that the European Union should compensate farmers."
"Out of solidarity with farmers, the Commission made an initial proposal and contemplated 3 proposals."
"The first presented measures to help the beef sector. The second funded aids by means of markedly reducing aids to large farms and the third measure was structural."
"Against the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, the European Parliament has decided only to adopt the measures to help the beef sector and to reject the other proposals."
"The Funk report on which we have to give our opinion has therefore had two proposals for regulations cut from it as they were rejected on 17 September 1996."
"Our Group is in favour of the amendments presented and voted on in the Committee on Agriculture, because they deleted or modified certain recitals and articles contrary to French and European farmers' interests."
"The budgetary savings proposed mean it would no longer be possible to compensate aids to beef farmers, but would make it possible to save 2.4 billion ECU from the farming budget (cf."
"Sturdy report on prices package)."
"The I-EDN Group rejects this exclusively budgetary approach which is aimed solely at enabling certain Member States to meet the constraints linked to the introduction of the single currency."
"We deplore the fact that the debates have been organized in such a way that the Sturdy and Funk reports were debated together and thereby linked by budgetary considerations."
"Aids to farmers have been financed thanks to an under-estimate of prices and aids, of over 1 billion ECU, and we cannot accept the 12.2 % reduction in the level of beef aids as provided for in the preliminary draft budget for 1998."
"Many farms are now in a difficult situation and we need an agricultural policy that can help the countryside recover rather than a budgetary restriction budget."
"Farmers are expected not to benefit from the introduction of the single currency if ever it happens. That would be especially unfair since they are funding its introduction."
"Baldarelli report (A4-0189/97)"
"We are abstaining in the vote on this report because we think that the Common Agricultural Policy must undergo fundamental reforms."
"The current tightly regulated agricultural policy is bureaucratic, ineffective and unjustifiably politically divisive."
"We hope that agricultural policy will be drastically reformed in 1999 and will do all that we can to see that this happens."
"The Commission was hoping, by means of a proposed amendment to Regulation 1765/92, to introduce maximum guaranteed areas (MGAs) for the production of durum wheat which, in the case of Portugal, was only 35 000 ha."
"The Baldarelli report proposes that the MGA should be increased in Portugal to 90 000 ha, which is more than the traditional production area of approximately 70 000 ha, whilst still below the potential production area (100 000 ha)."
"The amendment is much more positive than the Commission's proposal."
"In addition the Baldarelli report allows for a 5 % margin for excess in relation to the MGAs intended as an incentive to bring young people into farming."
"That is why we support it."
"Before outlining the I-EDN Group's position, it should be recalled that the production of durum wheat was badly handled by the 1992 CAP."
"European durum wheat production areas dropped by 12 % between 1991 and 1992 (two year average) and in 1995-96 because of set-aside and the lack of support in non-traditional durum wheat areas."
"Production plummeted by 35 % over the same period because yield drops were added to surface area reductions."
"Climatic conditions, lower production in non-traditional areas with higher yields and 'extensification' linked to a high level of direct aid in the product/ha of traditional areas are the main reasons for the drop in European cropping."
"The European Union went from being a net exporter of 2 million tonnes of semolina and pasta to having a net deficit."
"Our amendments adopted in committee should make it easier to make the machinery for managing individual references in traditional areas more flexible, which should increase the area effectively in production and should also increase ceilings of areas benefiting from reduced aid in non-traditional areas. That should ensure supply safety for the European processing industries, especially in northern France."
"The inter-regional approach that we have proposed should satisfy French producers in traditional areas and non-traditional areas, while limiting European imports of durum wheat from non-Community countries."
"In order for aids to be put to good use in the traditional areas of southern Europe and to bring about a good qualitative adaptation of durum wheat to the needs of user companies, it is vital to demand quality seed."
"On that specific point, we have also proposed an amendment that was also adopted in committee and which would make it possible to ensure the direct production of certified seed by producer associations."
"Old traditional varieties must be preserved - they have always been used regionally - in particular to preserve biodiversity."
"Generally speaking, the use of quality seed should favour the development of the durum wheat seed industry."
"Resolution on set-asides"
"For obvious reasons, so that farmers can decide how to prepare their soil for sowing, they must know by 30 June each year the set-aside rate for the following year."
"They have to organize their soil plans and order the various products - seed, fertilizers, pesticides, etc."
"That is why our Group supports the oral question put by the Committee on Agriculture, and has co-signed the joint motion for a resolution."
"Our Group has also tabled two major amendments aimed at limiting the compulsory set-aside rate to 5 % and to abolish the extraordinary set-aside rate in the case of excess area use during a given year."
"I am very happy to see that the European Parliament has followed our Group's initiative and adopted by a clear majority the limit on setasides to 5 % as we proposed."
"Worldwide, a rapid analysis of the year to be decided by 30 June shows that forecasts of production and prices are weakened by the facts."
"On 25 July 1996, the International Cereals Council forecast a world harvest of 560 million tonnes and it turned out to be 580 million tonnes."
"The European Union had to revise its forecast upwards by 7 million tonnes."
"All the experts had predicted a steady drop in world cereal production from this Spring onwards."
"In fact, world prices have increased considerably and the Commission was obliged to set an export tax, to guarantee internal supplies in the European Union as of 14 May."
"This export tax, set by the Commission, is 15 ECU per tonne on wheat, durum wheat flour and semolina, 20 ECU per tonne on wheat flour and semolina and 10 ECU per tonne on durum wheat."
"It is highly regrettable that the Commission should not only impose this export tax but also add further obstacles to cereal exports."
"Like exporters we regret the fact that every time we approach zero repayment and head towards the tax, Brussels blocks exports and submits exporters to special certificates, which is not dissuasive."
"In this specific case, exporters do not know in advance whether Brussels will make a repayment or impose a tax."
"It is certain that when repayments apply they will not receive any money whereas when taxes are imposed they are definitely levied."
"In early May the ICC - International Cereals Council - reduced from 583 to 578 million tonnes its forecast for the world wheat harvest in 1997."
"The drought is going to limit European Union production while the frosts in Kansas cut winter wheat production there by 3 million tonnes and floods in Dakota delayed spring sowings."
"It is therefore likely that world stocks will be further reduced and prices will go up again."
"Against this general background of higher world demand for cereals and the prospects of a poorer harvest in the northern hemisphere in 1997, we must have the lowest possible set-aside rate and limit the ceiling to 5 % and no more this coming year."
"It is vital for farmers, whose prime function is to produce farm products, not to have to bear a higher rate than 5 % against a world context of greater demand and smaller stocks."
"Pack report (A4-0188/97)"
". (DA) One of the aims of the SOCRATES Programme is to promote the 'European dimension' in education, while at the same time it represents a 'clear contribution to achieving the objective set out in Article 126 of the Treaty' , as the report puts it."
"The so-called European dimension is an attempt to 'EU-ify' training courses, heedless of the fact that there is a world outside the EU to which pupils or students might have a particular interest in devoting their efforts."
"The concern is to introduce education in EU history and EU culture, instead of education in European history and European culture or, for that matter, world history and cultures in other parts of the world."
"We feel that this narrowing of the perspective is dangerous and mistaken. We have therefore chosen to vote against the Pack report on the SOCRATES Programme."
"Stockmann report (A4-0130/97)"
"For several years, the European Community has been looking into the promotion of the combined transport of goods, the only alternative to jammed roads and the only environmentfriendly solution."
"In 1992, the PACT programme on pilot actions for combined transport, came into effect for 5 years."
"It had a fairly modest budget and funded feasibility studies and direct measures."
"This programme has now been promoted to regulation rank and I welcome that."
"A more operational approach has now been taken on project eligibility."
"The Member States will play a filtering role for presenting financial competitions."
"That means that a given region will have its own logic for major projects."
"On the same lines, it would have been desirable to introduce complementarity into the financial contribution, which might also have drawn funds from other sources, such as the ERDF or the R&D framework programme."
"Recognizing the work of my colleague, the rapporteur, I should like to go along with his thoughts on the budgetary amount earmarked for this future regulation - 35 million ECU over 6 years - and wonder about the real political motivation behind the promotion of this type of transport."
"The development of intermodal transport must be one of the priorities of a European transport policy."
"Intermodality offers an interesting solution based on replacing the road-only approach, enhancing the use of other types of transport whose infrastructures and capacities are sometimes underused."
"It is now urgent to revitalize railways in Europe and all forms of navigation, especially short sea routes or rivers."
"The expansion of combined transport lies at the heart of the redeployment process and the new development of transport."
"In order to strike this new balance, the Member States need a strong incentive from the European Union since equal competition conditions are needed for each type of transport."
"For that, the Member States need aid to improve the economic competitiveness of sea, river and rail transport."
"That is why I came out in favour of the Stockmann report on the granting of Community financial support to actions on combined goods transport."
"The development of the PACT programme heads in that direction and I welcome, in particular, in the proposal for a Council regulation, the implementation of arrangements for:"
"improving the competitiveness of combined transport in terms of prices and service quality vis-Ã -vis road transport; -promoting high technology in the combined transport sector; -improving access for combined transport companies, regardless of their size.These arrangements prefer innovative and practical measures to the launch of prior studies."
"Another very important element are the PACT pilot actions launched since 1992. They are being extended and expanded as part of a genuine five-year programme as of 1997."
"This programming is accompanied by an increase in the resources in the PACT budget to 35 million ECU over six years."
"In the coming years, these resources must be further increased."
"I shall pay particular attention to this myself in the course of the work of the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"Lulling report (A4-0191/97)"
"Apiculture is an important business."
"It takes place on a decentralised basis throughout Europe."
"It is of particular importance to the local economy."
"The EU's agricultural policy must be reformed."
"The many types of aid must be reduced together with the regulations and subsidies associated with them."
"From this perspective it is wrong to introduce new subsidy and regulatory systems for another type of agriculture."
"Instead, we should increase co-operation in research, on the environment, on technical aid and on pests."
"This should take place primarily via existing branch organisations."
"The crumbs left over from the budget proposed by the Council regulation for honey marketing and technical aid to health action of quality improvement bring the matter before a European Parliament which, on 20 January 1995, already drew attention to the difficult situation facing the European bee-keeping industry."
"European bee-keepers are disappearing - there are only 3000 full time bee-keepers left in France - yet 126 000 tonnes are imported at around 7 francw per kilo when it costs our bee-keepers 14 francs just to produce it."
"That is unfair and I am not even speaking of the fraud of producing honey by feeding bees with maize or rice syrups."
"Failure to respect Community preference, profiting Chinese honey that now accounts for 30 % of world production or Mexican or Argentine honeys, requires compensation in the form of a premium to make up for that situation."
"Bill Clinton's United States have not thought twice: they have imposed a 151 % tax to protect their honey."
"We are the world's leading importer of honey."
"The European Parliament also asked for a pollination premium justified by the work done by bees, especially in pollinating fruit-trees. One bee can work on 2700 hectares, a radius of 5 km."
"Instead of these two premia, which are justified in a fifteen member European Union where 50 % of the honey marketed in the world is imported, 80 000 tonnes imported into Germany and 10 000 tonnes imported into France, the European Commission is only granting a budgetary credit of 15 million ECU, 11.6 million for combating varroa."
"For a country like France, that means 14 million francs in aid, 10 francs per hive (there are 1 434 000)."
"That is not enough to balance the books of the 100 000 part-time and full-time bee-keepers in the country who produce 30 000 tonnes, 25 % of all Community production, 3 % of worldwide production."
"No!"
"The European Commission really does not like bees, or at least European bees."
"The European Parliament approved unanimously, in its resolution of 20 January 1995 on the Commission's communication to the Council and the European Parliament on the situation of European bee-keeping, the setting up of certain direct support measures for honey production (pollination premium, the payment of a compensatory premium for loss of income due to the lack of Community preference)."
"Despite these important, necessary proposals for the survival of European and French bee-keeping, the Commission is now only proposing a few one-off measures, to pacify its conscience."
"It plans to offer technical assistance to bee-keepers to improve the quality of honey production, to fight to Varroa and linked diseases, to improve transhumance and to set up honey analysis laboratories."
"None of the measures proposed by the Commission meets the economic difficulties facing bee-keepers."
"Production costs are regularly rising, the number of hive constantly dropping and imports from non-Community countries rocketing."
"Our Group is in favour of the 22 amendments adopted in committee and we very much regret the statements by Commissioner Fischler refusing nearly all those amendments, apart form too harmless ones."
"For example, in order to mobilize all financial provisions in favour of positive actions for the bee-keeping industry, we demand that the investment needed to fight zoonoses, such as varroa, should be made part of the European Union's veterinary policy."
"The Commission must propose a promotion policy, but above all a policy for introducing common marketing standards for Community and imported honey."
"Give the systematically obstructive attitude show by the Commission, our Group turns to the Council for its wisdom and asks it quite firmly to take the initiative and introduce effective measures to help a trade that is now threatened by ageing and a product that plays a vital ecological role."
"If there were no more bees, most plants would no longer be pollinated."
"That would lead to a real ecological disaster, which would cost far more than the Lulling report and its proposals."
"Joint resolution on tourism (B4-0458/97)"
"Those of us who have for years, since the beginning of this legislature, been insisting against hell and high water on the need to include tourism in a chapter of its own in the revised Treaty are once again asking for that to be done, as Mr Papoutsis also did when he fist appeared before the European Parliament, before his investiture."
"A joint amendment tabled by myself and MÃ©ndez de Vigo introduced that request to the Bourlanges-Martin report on the IGC, whereas many of those who have expressed astonishment today at the absence of tourism from the revised Treaty then voted against it..."
"Fortunately, only wise men correct their mistakes and we hope that the new Treaty will now do justice to one of Europe's major industries, namely tourism."
"I am of the firm opinion that there is no need for EU regulation of the tourist sector in the EU Treaty."
"In line with the principle of subsidiarity, it is up to each country to make decisions for this sector."
"Of course, tourism is of great significance for employment but I think that it is important that these issues are determined at a local or regional level."
"So I have voted against this resolution."
". (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on tourism or the motion for a resolution on tourism by Mr Simpson on behalf of the PSE Group."
"The motions contain a number of positive elements."
"There is a need for a policy on tourism in the EU."
"A tourism policy geared to quality and competitiveness can contribute to growth and employment in the EU."
"Tourism policy calls for a high degree of coordination in the Commission, and the focus should be on a decision-making process with maximum transparency, but tourism policy should not have its own legal basis in the Treaty."
"Tourism policy is such a broad area that giving it its own legal basis would open up the possibility of bringing in much too wide a range of concerns under this legal basis."
"Tourism covers such a diversity of fields that an individual legal basis would not be practicable."
"Spencer report (A4-0193/97)"
"For the most part this is a good report."
"But we do not think that the EU and the WEU should be integrated."
"Nor do we think that majority voting should be used generally for issues of common security and foreign policy."
"Allowances must always be made for a Member State to veto an issue which is considered a vital security matter for the State concerned."
"So we have voted against the text in points 15 and 19."
"Federalist thought in terms of European external policy can be summed by a few simple phrases, repeated ad nauseam for years now, in every tone and every form: ' If Europe had not been powerless, Yugoslavia could have been avoided."
"Therefore, in the future, Europe must be able to speak with one voice abroad, determining its positions by majority voting' ."
"Yet we have never been told what more Europe could have done, in practical terms, in the case of Yugoslavia, if it had been united."
"For good reasons: the policy conducted by the Member States was in the end a fairly wise one."
"I am not even sure, as it happens, whether the European Union, by wishing to determine a single European position at all costs, might not have transported the conflict within its midst, which would of course have delayed our rescue operation as we would first of all had to resolve the differences between us!"
"Let us hope that they would not have worsened too much because then we would have had two conflicts to deal with instead of one, not that far fetched when you consider the history of our continent this century."
"So, in the end, it is just as well - felix culpa - that we avoided that because of our powerlessness!"
"It is all the more curious that nobody calls into question the federalist dogma that we have before us, every day, the results of that system in a particular area, that of our external economic relations."
"The European Union speaks with one voice, the Commission's, and the Council decides, by majority voting, i.e. the exact arrangement sought by the federalists."
"Yet that system does not work."
"Worse still, by reducing our policies to the lowest common denominator, weakening the Council vis-Ã -vis the free trade initiatives of the Commission, it is the main culprit behind our successive back-offs in international trade negotiations and contributes to the devastating unemployment now destroying Europe."
"Given the results of that system, should that system really be extended to the rest of our external relations?"
"I conclude, for my part, by saying that it is quite necessary, for the very good of Europe, that States maintain their national foreign policies."
"If our interest and aims coincide on a given point - and I hope that that will often happen - then of course we can work together."
"Nothing is more legitimate than that."
"I would only recall the example of the French-speaking countries: how can you believe for one moment that if we had a single European foreign policy that the interests of the French-speaking community in the world would be defended?"
"How can you believe for one moment that, with a foreign policy determined by majority voting, that the special relationship between France and Quebec would have any weight compared with so-called 'global' European interests?"
"Anyone with any doubts about that should refer to the Euro-Canadian declaration signed last year."
"As a consequence, we demand with insistence that the Heads of State and Government firmly stick to a European foreign policy that expresses an alliance of sovereign states."
"That means in particular that: 1. we must maintain decisions by unanimity on all questions of principle, with the possibility of specifying, if we want, that abstentions cannot prevent decisions from being taken; 2. if we agree to take decisions by majority on secondary points, we must reassert, at the same time, the Luxembourg compromise as clearly and simply as possible, without any procedural complexity; 3. we must refuse inclusion in the Community budget of any operational spending on a common foreign policy, or we shall be committing ourselves to federalism."
"The cost of these actions must be shared by those States taking part, according to a yet to be determined coefficient, such as GDP; 4. we should refuse to grant the European Union legal personality as that would be used to support the idea that there can be a European foreign policy different to that of the States."
"It would also be used by the Commission to propel itself on to the international arena, and it would explain that it should represent the European Union for the purpose of reaching legal agreements; 5. we must reform the procedure of international trade negotiations by restoring the Council's authority over the Commission's; in particular we must not accept the inclusion of negotiations on services and intellectual property in Community processes as that would mean that national parliaments would no longer have anything to say, anything to ratify, especially when it comes to international trade."
"That prospect seems quite repellant to us and we wonder how it can even be included in the preparatory documents for the Amsterdam European Council."
". (DA) We cannot support this report for several reasons."
"We do not share the rapporteur's burning desire to create a common foreign and security policy and hence also his criticism of its lack of effectiveness."
"The implementation of a common foreign and security policy will require an EU capable of acting, with a common foreign minister, common defence and a common attitude to third countries."
"We do not want this."
"The consensus in the Nordic countries specifically is not in favour of the creation of a new military superpower in Europe, on the contrary."
"And the lack of action compared with Council declarations, which the rapporteur deplores, is another sign that neither the Member State representatives on the Council nor the populations of those countries are prepared to endorse a common political profile on foreign policy and security matters."
"This is yet another example of the eagerness of this Parliament to move more rapidly towards a United States of Europe than the populations of the EU Member States wish."
"We voted against the Spencer report because, instead of being the expected clarification exercise, it merely took the same old ideological approach as its predecessors."
"It would, however, have been vital to state that the European Union's external action is now, first and foremost, the projection and defence of its own policies: a common trade policy; a common agricultural policy; a common fisheries policy, etc."
"On the contrary, we should bring these two inseparable aspects together under the Council's authority, which should very strictly determine all trade negotiations to which the Union is party."
"External economic defence is a prerequisite for any CFSP."
"If the European Union is incapable of defending its members' common trading interests energetically vis-Ã -vis their external partners, it is useless going any further and speaking of a common external policy."
"It would also have been vital to specify, secondly, that a foreign policy is appreciated in terms of its effective influence on the ground."
"A common policy whose only object is to seek identical positions systematically on all subjects, without any concern for their operational character, would not deserve the name of CFSP."
"It would lead to minimalist consensuses making the European positions thus expressed quite insignificant."
"We can see the derisory and pernicious nature of all the resolutions blithely adopted by the European Parliament on every subject of foreign policy under the sun where the absence of professionalism vies with the lack of political sense."
"We should head in the opposite direction, relying on the great diplomatic traditions of the Member States which offers a precious capital for the Union as a whole."
"We should not try and build a CFSP that demobilizes, demotivates or amputates national diplomacy: they are now the special channel of expression for European interests in the international arena."
"We must also remain strictly attached to the principle of unanimity in terms of foreign and defence policy."
"The aim sought by the Member States is that of a common external policy, not a majority external policy."
"It is unthinkable that a State can be forced into a minority in areas as sensitive as foreign and defence policies."
"We really must include the spirit of the Luxembourg compromise in the treaties."
"To apply the classic communitarization approach to the vital area of foreign and defence policies would shut Europe into a particularly dangerous cul-de-sac."
"Neyts-Uyttebroeck report (A4-0179/97)"
"The report gives a good analysis of the problem of democratic control over EU institutions."
"For the most part the report is good but there are two points which I cannot agree with."
"First, it can be said that political debate in the EU Member States is concerned with the activities of the respective national governments."
"It is the respective National Parliaments which have the greatest legitimacy dependent, in some respects, on the turn out in elections."
"There are no specific 'European issues' which may be separated from the National debate and raised up to a 'European level' ."
"The growth of political debate at a European level is further complicated by the fact that there is no common media and because language, tradition, culture and political concepts differ so much between the Member States."
"An enlargement Eastwards will also bring with it serious problems with regard to the democratic representation of the European Parliament."
"How is it possible for a European Parliament with 700 Members to properly represent approximately 500 million citizens, with all the different political groupings, different social groups and linguistic minorities. How, for example, can they achieve a reasonable age-spread which corresponds with the citizens of the EU."
"It is our conclusion that it is the opinions and controls of national parliaments which must be strengthened within EU co-operation, not the European Parliament."
"The second point concerns points 10 and 11 in the report proposal where it is proposed that the European Parliament's co-decision procedures in the budget sector should be broadened by removing the difference between obligatory and non-obligatory tasks."
"It is our view that the EU budget for agriculture and regional policies for example, should be determined by means of negotiation between the EU Member States, represented by their respective governments."
"EU co-operation must be built on co-operation between independent states not through supranational government by a federal Parliament."
"We are abstaining in the final vote on this report for the above mentioned reasons despite the fact that the report does contain a number of good proposals."
"The role of the national parliaments is a fundamental criterion of the type of Europe that we want."
"In a Europe of nations, the national parliament is the higher assembly which may delegate certain precise powers to the European Parliament, each time that it ratifies a modification of the Treaty."
"In a federal Europe, on the contrary the European Parliament would be the higher assembly, and national parliaments would only retain local and subordinate powers."
"Today, we are still in theory in the former system, but the quantity of powers delegated to the European level has become so great that we would only need a slight push to topple over into the second."
"That shows the extent of the tactical skills, subtlety and even seduction that the European federalists are obliged to deploy if they are to succeed in making national parliaments give up critical powers of their own accord."
"The Neyts-Uyttebroeck report that we are examining today will not disappoint them since it manoeuvres with finesse, in an endeavour to disarm preventive actions by stating, for example, that the national parliaments and European Parliament should no longer quarrel or compete with each other, but on the contrary should complement each other in the greatest harmony."
"It is a little more up front, however, when it says what that complementarity should actually consist of: the European Parliament should control the Community institutions, and the national parliaments should only control their respective governments."
"The main defect of this presentation is obviously deliberate and it leaves out the essential point: the two orders are not just complementary but there is also a hierarchy."
"The national parliaments do control the national level, but their duty, in ratifying the Treaty, is also to determine the rules of the European game and general relations between the two levels."
"The European Parliament, albeit elected by universal suffrage, never enjoys any powers other than those delegated to it by the different nations and their parliaments."
"These questions are not theoretical."
"If Europe is now a victim of disillusionment and is suffering from the so-called democratic deficit, it is because too much ground has been given to the federalist conception of it, depriving the ordinary people of their natural framework of expression, their national institutions without that being replaced by a living participation in a European democracy."
"That leads to the total opposition between our proposals and those of the federalists; they want to subordinate the national parliaments and we want to revitalize them; they want Brussels to control the nations; we want the nations to control Brussels."
"It is not surprising in those conditions that the IGC, where there is a majority of governments in favour of the federalist approach, has only been willing to throw some crumbs to the national parliaments; the 'right' to be informed in good time of the Commission's legislative proposals; the 'right' to the six-monthly conference bringing together their representatives (COSAC), to submit to the attention of the Union institutions suggestions, modestly entitled 'contributions' , in particular in the areas of the third pillar or subsidiarity."
"And that is all."
"The NeytsUyttebroeck report, for its part, says hardly any more."
"These microscopic proposals reflect very well the federalist spirit according to which the national parliaments should possess barely more than the right to information or make the odd suggestion when it comes to European matters."
"That is not our opinion."
"The Europe of Nations Group wishes to restore the national parliaments' prime role, in a framework of a Europe founded on national democracies."
"In such an association of nations, Brussels would have no intrinsic superiority."
"On the contrary, the national parliaments, when voting every year for their Community contribution, would verify whether the Brussels instrument is rendering them a good service and would reform it if not."
"Furthermore, the national parliaments, representing the peoples, should be the ultimate judges of the proper employment of the delegated powers; they should retain a right of veto over questions of subsidiarity and a right to ratify the judgments of the European Court of Justice, according to a procedure to be determined when these decisions lead to an extension of the delegated powers."
"In those areas where European cooperation should be strengthened, without communitarization being desirable, however, the national parliaments should be able to organize a network to take faster decisions than according to the classic intergovernmental procedures."
"For example, it might be possible to imagine 'European days' for national parliaments, when those assemblies, meeting in their respective capitals, would debate the same subjects at the same time."
"This type of revitalization of national parliamentary controls appears to us, at this stage, to be vital for the survival of a genuinely democratic Europe."
"There are parts of the report which we agree with."
"We particularly refer to the analysis section where it states, for example, that the transfer of decision making competence to the EU has not been accompanied by a corresponding increase in the powers of national parliaments."
"We also refer to the emphasis on openness in the legislative work of the Council, public access to documents, better minimum time limits for EU legislative documents and so on."
"The report is partially an acknowledgement of the importance of national parliaments."
"Despite difficulties and shortcomings in the national parliamentary system it is here that democratic legitimacy develops."
"It is only at a national level that citizens with the help of the ballot paper can demand accountability from their elected representatives and can elect new members who, in their turn, can institute new laws."
"The European Parliament will continue to be lacking in such legitimacy for the foreseeable future."
"In Sweden, for example, only half the number of citizens participated in the election to the European Parliament compared to the national election."
"The lack of a common language and common media in the Union restricts the opportunities for political and democratic dialogue before a decision is taken."
"The gulf between elector and elected will increase further as the EU expands."
"Broad swathes of the population will be completely unrepresented but still subject to the legislative powers of the Union."
"This can lead to high levels of tension."
"But, faced with these problems, the report does not come up with an answer."
"Instead it repeats the traditional proposals from the Parliamentary majority of increased power for their own institutions, despite the obvious lack of popular and democratic legitimacy."
"But there are alternative solutions."
"Such a contribution containing 23 points was presented by critics of the Scandinavian Union in the David Group when the report by Martin-Bourlange was accepted on 23 May 1995."
"It was based on giving national parliaments real power, for example, and the right to take the initiative in drawing up laws, and on increasing the influence of groups and popular movements rather than bureaucrats and lobbyists."
"Despite the serious criticism above, we think that there are sections in the report which could start the thought process required to find a solution to the Union's fundamental democratic dilemma."
"So we have decided to abstain in the final vote."
"The report contains a good analysis of the 'democratic deficiency' in the EU."
"It also contains a number of good concrete proposals for strengthening the role of the National Parliaments."
"But the fundamental problem concerning the lack of legitimacy for the EU and the European Parliament ought to have been developed further."
"The report should have been formally sent to national parliaments with a request for comments within a defined period of time before being discussed by the European Parliament."
"The report is a move in the right direction, so I have voted for it."
"McMillan-Scott report (A4-0198/97)"
"China, the world's biggest demographic power, for a long time totally inwardlooking, is now being called upon to play a leading role in the international arena."
"Relations between the European Union and China cover areas as varied as cultural exchanges, the development of trade relations and the questions of security and political stability in south-east Asia."
"The Europe of Nations Group welcomes, in particular, the fact that China has now signed up to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty."
"The McMillan-Scott report rightly emphasizes the need to deepen interparliamentary relations between Europe and China in order to achieve greater mutual understanding."
"Our Group can only welcome the desire to pursue and extend European human resource development programmes in China, including one action in the field of legal cooperation."
"This desire for cooperation could also be expressed in areas where European standards are a universal reference: the respect of environmental standards, information technology, law, insurance and banking."
"Quite rightly, the report notes that economic relations should go hand-in-hand with a desire to remedy environmental deterioration, the result of booming industry in the country."
"Trading issues are closely linked to the question of the respect of human dignity."
"That respect must be guaranteed even if it is not for us to import into China our model of political and social organisation."
"The return of Hong Kong and Macau to China must take place in the respect of the political, social and economic freedoms that characterize the status of those territories and the political traditions to be found there."
"Despite the demand for an inquiry made by the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs to the Commission, the report says nothing about the unfair competition imposed on European companies by Chinese companies using millions of badly paid or even unpaid workers to produce at very low costs."
"The question of dumping practices is extremely important here: the existence of these practices can be deduced from a comparison between the normal value of products and their export prices towards the European Union, which are far lower; that is prejudicial for European producers, as shown by an increase in imports from China, the increase in the country's European market share and their low prices which have seriously affected the financial situation facing Community industry."
"The dumping margin reached 110 % on persulphates for the textile and chemical industries in 1995 which, at the time, obliged the Commission to set a provisional anti-dumping levy of 83.3 %."
"The same problem arose with shoes with textile uppers, video tapes, handbags, bicycles, ring-binders, etc. These measures have still not put a stop to dumping."
"European efforts should also be directed towards improving the way in which the Chinese services market is opening up, in particular concerning financial and banking services, insurance, press and information agencies, etc."
"In this area China should be made to apply the same transparency and constraints as those imposed on WTO member states."
"Proper thought can only be given to China's joining the WTO once these urgent problems have been settled."
"The rapporteur, Mr McMillan-Scott, is to be congratulated on the way in which he has drawn together the prevailing views in the European Parliament to produce a most interesting blueprint for a European policy towards China."
"The report reflects Parliament's criticisms regarding China's human rights record, as well as its development towards a free market and its measures to protect the environment."
"It expresses in the clearest possible terms Parliament's demands that the freedom and rights of Hong Kong and Macau should be respected."
"Parliament continues to feel concern at the occupation of Tibet, and at the strained relations with Taiwan."
"To repeat, the rapporteur has set out some useful guidelines for the Union's future policy in this field."
"Burenstam Linder report (A4-0196/97)"
"This is a good report."
"We would just like to clarify Amendment No. 5."
"We think it is obvious that the European Union should be open to every European country, and that includes Russia as well."
"But we do not think this report is the place for such comment and have, therefore, voted against the proposal, although we essentially agree with this view."
"Another issue which we do not think belongs in this report is the question of the Baltic States' potential membership of NATO."
"This report concerns the relationship between the European Union and the Baltic Sea region and not the position that this region has with regard to the expansion of the NATO military alliance."
". (DA) The Commission's Baltic Sea Initiative, put forward at the Baltic Sea States Summit in Visby, does not contain sufficient new initiatives for the Baltic Sea Region, which possesses considerable potential for political and economic development."
"We therefore welcome the report of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy on the Commission communication, in which the committee insists on the need for the implementation of policies on reforms, growth, integration and stability in the region."
"The three Baltic States have finally recovered their sovereignty and freedoms after fifty years of Soviet occupation."
"Today, nobody denies these three countries' natural vocation to enter the European Union."
"The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations can only approve the initiative described by Mr Burenstam Linder, to step up cooperation links with the Baltic States and the rest of the Baltic world."
"The challenges of this cooperation are many since they concern cultural exchanges, research, the economic development of countries weakened by fifty years of imposed communism, the fight against organised crime and the consolidation of the political stability of this region of Europe."
"We are particularly sensitive to the Commission's concern and those of this report to repair the damage to the environment by fighting mass pollution and managing the difficult problem of nuclear power stations."
"We go along with the demand for an inventory of nuclear waste and other sources of radiation in the region."
"We wish to highlight the need for practical and effective cooperation respecting freedom - so dearly bought - in those countries."
"This cooperation, freed of the pressures of supra-nationality, must conserve its effectiveness throughout the process of accession about to be embarked upon."
"Encouraging the Baltic States to carry out the reforms needed for their integration into the European Union is laudable but nevertheless insufficient."
"It is vital for the European Union to respond to the high hopes of the peoples of eastern Europe with a language that is far more encouraging than convergence criteria and simple incitations."
"This is the vital challenge facing the IGC and history will judge us by our success or failure."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following six motions for resolutions:"
"(B4-0472/97) by Mr GasÃ³liba i BÃ¶hm and Mr VallvÃ©, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the threats to the free movement of agricultural products in the Union; -(B4-0488/97) by Mr Galeote Quecedo and others, on behalf of the PPE Group, on the restriction of the internal market caused by acts of vandalism in France against food products from Spain; -(B4-0500/97) by Mr Novo Belenguer and Mr GonzÃ¡lez TriviÃ±o, on behalf of the ARE Group, on the restriction by French farmers of the free movement of Spanish goods in the European Union; -(B4-0507/97) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the V Group, on attacks on Spanish fruit lorries in France; -(B4-0544/97) by Mr JovÃ© Peres and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the free movement of goods in the European Union; -(B4-0558/97) by Mr Colino Salamanca and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the free movement of fruit and vegetable products in the European Union."
"Madam President, the repeated attacks by groups of French farmers persistently blocking the free movement of goods, a basic principle of the Union, has reached a situation calling for energetic action, as it has not only threatened lorry drivers physically but has actually threatened their lives."
"Neither the persistence of these attacks nor the laisser-faire attitude of the French authorities is comprehensible."
"Nor can we understand how, after years of transgressions, the Commission and the Council have failed to find an appropriate means of dealing with this situation."
"Images of the attacks are the best school for converting those who believe in the European Union into sceptics."
"While we are working to deepen the Union, others are savagely boycotting it."
"That is why I am demanding firm and energetic action by the French authorities - and let us see if there is a change - to prevent any further attacks."
"Both the Commission and the Council must act promptly, urgently and efficiently to have the principle of the free movement of goods respected and avoid any further transgression, which is intolerable in any civilized society, and we think that the European Union is and should be a civilized society."
"Madam President, this week Commissioner Monti has had the opportunity to discuss on repeated occasions the internal market action plan that he plans to present at the European Council in Amsterdam, but the day before yesterday there was a hearing at the Court of Justice on a case presented by the Commission against France, on actions that took place in 1995 and that country's failure to take appropriate measures to avoid violent acts on its territory against fruit and vegetables from other Member States, thereby infringing the provisions regulating farming COMs and Article 30 of the Treaty."
"This is a continuous infraction that has been going on for more than 10 years."
"The incidents concerned are the subject of this request, but similar events have taken place in 1996 and this year, since the violent protestors want to break up the single market."
"It is clear that we cannot speak of completing or achieving the single market if one of its main planks, the free movement of goods, is not being carried out."
"It is vital to introduce into the reformed Treaty the possibility for the Commission to impose immediate financial penalties on Member States, institutions or sector representatives who break the rule on the freedom of circulation."
"We cannot make progress if we have the feeling that these people are getting away with it and our public opinion will not accept that."
"Madam President, what use is it for each of the members concerned to speak out for one or two minutes on the subject of these attacks on the free movement of goods?"
"What use is it for the European Parliament to manifest its revulsion, as does the Committee of the Regions, as do the regional parliaments, as do the national parliaments of the Member States, and even town halls across the continent?"
"I think that we must make an effort to overcome the testimonial value of that revulsion and send a message in two directions."
"On one hand, to the Governments, letting them know that this cannot be tolerated or be repeated and, on the other, to the ordinary people, so that they can see how seriously the European authorities and institutions are taking this as they are unwilling to allow these attacks to go on, as they have done now for fifteen years, against farmers, transporters, property and people in general."
"It is a problem that needs to be dealt with very seriously because there are now threats to block other borders and take revenge elsewhere."
"I am still sincerely confident that the European Parliament's opinions are not just paying lip-service to our revulsion and that the Commission and the Council as a result will act fairly, energetically and rapidly, to put an end to these attacks which are repeated, year after year, in spite of the lamentable passivity of the Commission, the Council and above all every French Government."
"Madam President, if free trade and the internal market mean that anyone can dump his surpluses, his overproduction, the fruits of his rationalization, cheap labour and chemical fertilizers, on other countries, this selfsame problem will keep coming back to haunt us."
"Overturning lorries will not help. Nor will sanctions achieve very much."
"We must rather embark upon a development in which local produce is marketed regionally, with producers catering for their own population, on the basis of the slogans we created: ' Our internal market is our local weekly market' or, if you prefer, ' A region needs many internal markets' ."
"If we can achieve a stable relationship here between producers and consumers, we can then produce class instead of mass; we can then supply strawberries that people will enjoy."
"I, at any rate, need have no fear that the strawberries we grow at home will be supplanted by any Spanish or French strawberries, because these strawberries are bought by my consumers and are bought at a fair and reasonable price, and I can tell you, Madam President, that they taste good - I shall bring you one sometime."
"Madam President, one of the regions suffering most from these unjustifiable attacks on Spanish lorries carrying fruit and vegetables is Murcia, for three reasons: the number of its lorries and drivers, the size of its fruit and vegetables production and because exports and marketing are a major activity in the region."
"This is therefore having negative effects on our region."
"That is why we must defend at all costs the wealth of a large part of Spain, all of Spain, all of Europe, so that they can produce, and therefore two issues seem vital to us:"
"The first is to guarantee, in the European Parliament and the Commission, that appropriate compensation is paid for the direct and indirect consequences - loss of goods - for what has happened in France and should never happen again."
"The second question - and I think this is dealing with the problem in depth rather than tickling the surface - is to tackle the cause of all these events."
"We have to acknowledge that something is wrong with the CAP when this type of event takes place and we should get to the heart of the matter, as I said earlier, and try to reform the CAP properly and also overhaul the fruit and vegetable COM so that all Europeans - French, Spanish and Italians - see Europe as our common homeland, something in which we are all involved, including the GUE/NGL Group, and so that the European Union serves all Europeans, workers and farmers alike, so that Europe is a place of solidarity and not the opposite."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is like a vicious circle. Just one year on and the European Parliament is again denouncing attacks on Spanish lorries and goods in France, attacks on people, because those lorries do not drive themselves but are driven by Community citizens, attacked directly by other Community citizens, just as we are about to share the same currency, no less."
"One more year and we are attacking this serious attack on a basic principle of European construction, the free movement of people and goods."
"Someone just said that the basic problem has to be discussed here and it is simply a matter of whether or not we accept the free movement of people and goods in the European Union."
"Something as simple as to accept or reject the fact that there is a single market."
"Who is going to pay for the damage and the loss of markets, and how is it, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, representative of the Commission, that once again we are witnessing manifest passivity by those who should be stopping these criminal acts - since they are criminal acts, they are not purely administrative acts."
"A year ago, more or less to the day, I said that I wanted to know one name of someone who had been found guilty in France and condemned for these crimes."
"A year later and, perhaps I have not found out about it, but to my knowledge, nobody has been condemned for attacking people and goods from other European countries that have to go through France."
"If ordinary people, European parliamentarians or civil servants, attacked a lorry outside here in the street, what would happen?"
"I think they would at least be taken into detention."
"They would be tried and would be sentenced to some kind of punishment."
"How come then that those who attack goods, lorries and people in France escape any kind of punishment?"
"It is important that at last we stop condemning these acts with words alone."
"I know that the Commission's powers over this are limited but I have the impression that people think that the Community authorities are not doing enough."
"Local markets must be defended - as another member said - but we cannot deny the need to win over local markets by the exports of products produced in any Member State."
"Let us hope that next year there will be no need for an emergency resolution on attacks against lorries, goods or people from one European state in another European country."
"Madam President, I am convinced that all members of the European Parliament will agree, once again, on repeating our condemnation of the attacks by uncontrolled groups of French farmers, on lorries transporting farm produce from Spain and the people transporting those products."
"I am equally convinced that we shall agree to demand, as we are asking in the resolution, the payment of compensation promised by the French Government and that that payment, as we demand, covers all types of damage caused."
"But the European Parliament, faced with a flagrant attack on the free movement of goods and one of the pillars of European construction, must demand that the Council and Commission, once and for all, take measures to stop these regrettable events taking place year after year."
"Although the Commission admittedly lacks powers on this, these violent acts cannot go on unpunished and a way has to be found so that European citizens - and our farmers, in particular - no longer have to go on facing a problem affecting and seriously harming them and which, above all, increasingly separates them from the project of European construction."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this afternoon we are debating recent acts of vandalism by French producers against Spanish fruit and vegetables."
"Of course, we can only denounce these acts of violence and vandalism."
"I shall therefore refer to the form rather than the basis."
"For example, in respect of tomatoes - the subject of the most recent clashes - on St Charles market, in Perpignan, in April supplies of Spanish tomatoes hovered around 800 tonnes per day, compared with 100 tonnes for French produce."
"Suddenly, on 9-12 May, Spanish imports doubled and reached 1700 tonnes per day, which led to a price collapse - from 600 to 114 francs per tonne, just about covering transport costs."
"This type of dumping is inadmissible."
"These figures show that we can understand the anger of French producers but certainly not their acts of violence."
"Similarly the calls to boycott our products from Spanish farmers across the Pyrenees to respond to the attacks by French farmers are no more excusable."
"This conflict is not just a Franco-Spanish one."
"There are far more deep seated reasons."
"This shows that certain fruit and vegetable COMs are just not working."
"The Commission should re-open this thorny issue."
"It must ensure the regulation of production and prices and avoid any unfair competition between Member States, preventing products from being put on the market at prices lower than their production costs and more seriously controlling mass imports from non-Community countries."
"Our duty in the Commission, European Parliament and Council is to reconcile all of our productions so that European producers can live in harmony."
"I am convinced that we shall succeed."
"Madam President, we can only condemn the acts of violence perpetrated against Spanish lorry drivers."
"But it would be dangerously reductive to discuss the matter only in terms of the free movement of goods."
"It is an agricultural problem and it has to be recognized that, in a way, this violence reveals the depth of the discontent among fruit and vegetable producers faced with a loss of markets, a disastrous drop in prices and dumping practices."
"We must avoid at any cost being sucked into a spiral of clashes between producers."
"The interests of French and Spanish producers are not opposed: they are the victims of the same ultra-liberal policy, making a priority of competition at the greatest profit for major distribution companies and international commerce."
"That is why we propose the immediate opening of consultations between the French and Spanish Governments and between producers' organisations, to avoid confrontations, lessen tensions, open dialogue and find solutions to allow producers on either side of the Pyrenees to do their work properly."
"Given the deterioration of the fruit and vegetables sector, we must improve the market machinery and bear in mind agreements with non-Community Mediterranean countries, especially when it comes to productions and improved revenue."
"In order to avoid this excessive competition, which may be made still worse by enlargement of the European Union to the east, we must accelerate the harmonization process in an upwards direction in terms of the wages and social protection of farmers and farm employees."
"Madam President, once again we are dealing with a problem that we face every year at around this time of year."
"I think that this is an important subject for all Union citizens as, although today it is Spanish products that are affected, on another occasion it could be others."
"It is not just a problem of the CAP or one of the fruit and vegetables COM, as we have just been told, nor is it one of lower or higher prices, or dumping."
"It is a problem related to Article 35 of the Treaty on Union which guarantees the free movement of goods and all Member States are obliged to guarantee that right."
"We are now in the thick of the IGC and I should like to ask the Commission to make sure not only that something comes of these denunciations but also to urge the Government concerned to make sure that these acts do not go unpunished. The Commission must ensure that sanctions are imposed and that those responsible are brought to justice as quickly as possible because, as we know, delayed justice is no justice at all."
"Madam President, this piece of fruit lacks, in practice, the right to free movement of goods as enshrined theoretically in the Treaty on European Union."
"The Commission, as guardian of the treaties, should also ensure that this piece of fruit can move freely within the European Union."
"This occurs every year because certain producers want to dominate certain markets and oppose the free movement of fruit and vegetables."
"Since the Commission has machinery within its powers to sanction economically, the next European Council in Amsterdam should amend the Treaty so that it can apply those sanctions to anyone who impedes the free movement of goods and consolidation of the single market."
"Only in that way, next week in Amsterdam, can the Council make sure that this piece of fruit has the same right as persons, capital and other goods to move freely within the single market of the European Union."
"Madam President, this week Case No 265/95, the Commission versus the French Republic, came before the Court of Justice of the European Union, for failure to adopt measures to avoid violent acts against Spanish fruit and vegetables."
"The Commission agent asserted that this case related to continuous action over more than 10 years and that the incidents referred to had continued into 1996 and 1997."
"Commissioner, this is a deliberate policy to apply violence on a continuous basis, tolerated by a government, on the grounds of particular changes to the strawberry market and directed against the whole Spanish fruit and vegetable sector."
"The succession of systematic acts of vandalism shows that this is a perfectly planned act aimed at keeping Spanish produce out of the Community market."
"The rule of law is not working in France with respect to fruit and vegetables."
"The Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, is not offering sufficient compensation and it must intervene robustly or else the perpetrators will continue to get off scot-free."
"Rural Coordination, the National Federation of Farm Businesses and the Movement for the Defence of Family Farms, the armed wings of the economic organisation, AFCOFEL, even before the campaign, issued demands for self-regulation of Spanish production accompanied by veiled threats."
"The Commission can and must freeze aids to the French fruit and vegetable sector to put an end to this violence."
"It would be absurd to contribute out of the Community budget to support a national productive sector that uses violence and violates the Treaty to prevent the free movement of goods, leading to market losses of over 25000 million pesetas a year."
"Commissioner, you must also offer urgent specific Community aids to those affected and restore, by means of Community action in this sector, the conditions of free competition."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of a certain inability on the part of the French authorities to control the unrest caused by a group of farmers against agricultural products from other Member States, especially Spain, the Commission would point out that, within its jurisdiction as guardian of the treaties, it was able to use the infringement procedure in order to oblige France to fulfil its obligations pursuant to Articles 5 and 30 of the Treaty."
"That case is before the Court of Justice; the hearing was held on 10 June and the Advocate-General is to present his opinion on 8 July, so it is appropriate to await the Judgment of the Court of Justice."
"This is, however, no passive waiting, since the Commission, as soon as it heard of the first incident on 24 April, immediately contacted the French authorities to persuade them to use their powers in the field of public order by adopting the measures needed to prevent and suppress violence, thus preserving the right to freedom of movement for goods, which is guaranteed by the Treaty."
"On the other hand, the Commission, by means of a letter from Mr Commissioner Franz Fischler dated 4 June 1997, again urged France to take with the utmost urgency the measures needed to guarantee freedom of movement of goods in France."
"In view of the above, the Commission is thinking of taking all possible measures to ensure that the French authorities comply fully with their obligations."
"As regards the Common Organization of the Market, the Commission would point out that, within the scope of the reform of the COM for fruit and vegetables adopted by the Council on 21 November of last year, provision was made for the setting up of operational funds intended for producer organizations which would make it possible to have a panoply of measures in order to improve conditions for the production and marketing of these products."
"The decentralized operation of these funds makes it possible, therefore, for the producer organizations to target their actions more appropriately on those sectors in greatest need."
"On the other hand, both in the reform of the mechanisms for withdrawing products from the market and in measures for finding an outlet for the products withdrawn there is even provision also for free distribution."
"It is also necessary to point out that, at the end of the transitional period of the reform, it is planned to draw up a report on the operation of the COM in fruit and vegetables which will cover all products, including the strawberry sector."
"Finally, the Commission is at the moment making a global analysis of the situation with regard to the Mediterranean Agreements concerning the sector in question."
"I should in conclusion like to add, Mr President, that it is obviously an area of great concern to the Commission, which will under no circumstances shirk its responsibilities."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following seven motions for resolutions:"
"(B4-0470/97) by Mr Fassa and others, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the coup d'Ã©tat in Sierra Leone; -(B4-0508/97) by Mr TelkÃ¤mper and Mrs Aelvoet, on behalf of the V Group, on Sierra Leone; -(B4-0529/97) by Mr Pasty and others, on behalf of the UPE Group, on the coup d'Ã©tat in Sierra Leone; -(B4-0534/97) by Mr Hory and Mr Pradier, on behalf of the ARE Group, on the coup in Sierra Leone; -(B4-0546/97) by Mr Pettinari and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Sierra Leone; -(B4-0554/97) by Mr Robles-Piquer and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the PPE Group, on the coup in Sierra Leone; -(B4-0561/97) by Mr Swoboda and Mr Vecchi, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in Sierra Leone."
"Madam President, we are naturally shocked at the coup d'Ã©tat in Sierra Leone, a country which is one of the poorest in Africa and which has undergone one civil war and three other coups d'Ã©tat in the last six years."
"We at long last saw modest progress last year with the peace agreement in November and the introduction of democracy in March, but now it is back to square one."
"The military has seized power and all the early progress has been reversed."
"I support any diplomatic initiatives that might be taken to restore democracy and isolate the junta, and the Council must also encourage the Organization of African Unity to undertake its own initiatives."
"We must prevent individual countries from abusing the work of the ECOMOG, and any military intervention must be properly orchestrated to ensure that the Union's credibility is not undermined."
"The Liberals call on the Council and the Commission to use every means available to restore Sierra Leone's fledgeling democracy. Breaking off cooperation under LomÃ© should also be an option here."
"We must ensure that this small and poverty-stricken country can resume its progress towards reconstruction and development as quickly as possible."
"Madam President, my feelings are akin to those of Mr Bertens."
"In terms of mineral resources, Sierra Leone is one of the richest countries in the world, but it is one of the poorest in terms of the living standards of its population, and we must take action here to reinstate the democratic Government."
"I do not believe we can tolerate the continuation in power of the military junta."
"At the same time I wish to condemn the intervention by Nigeria."
"General Abacha also came to power there by means of a military coup."
"His most likely reason for intervening was to extend his sphere of influence and not to establish democracy."
"It would be a fine thing if we had democratic structures in Nigeria, but we are talking now about Sierra Leone."
"I take the view that our cooperation in the LomÃ© framework, coupled with diplomacy, can help to ensure not only that the coup is condemned but also that we are able to take practical measures for the restoration of democracy."
"May I ask Commissioner Pinheiro to take the necessary steps in this direction, and I hope that Nigeria will then keep out of the conflict."
"Madam President, Commissioner, back in March we friends of Africa were jubilant when a general, then governing as the result of a military coup, handed over power in Sierra Leone - a former British colony with less than five million inhabitants - to a 64-year old lawyer, a Muslim, like most of his fellowcitizens, with international experience but dressed in traditional robes."
"This civilian president has now been deposed by other military chiefs who snatched power along with the gold and diamonds that are the country's principal riches."
"Thousands have died. The GDP per head is only 200 dollars, there is 70 % illiteracy, the average life expectancy is only fifty years and a fierce dictatorship, that of Nigeria, is now trying to imposed democracy, paradoxically, in Sierra Leone."
"What has Europe done?"
"What we always do: we have given some humanitarian aid - which is good - and cooperated in the country's development, and the British sent a plane to rescue their compatriots, and that is all."
"Humanitarian aid and cooperation in development are extremely necessary but they do not solve the real problems."
"Nor would a military intervention work and it would be difficult to send our own troops as they would risk death."
"But this once again shows that Europe, not just Britain or France, has no policy to deal with Africa's problems."
"Let us hope that the Council and the Commission, with the help of the European Parliament, might one day propose such a policy."
"Madam President, the process of democratisation begun in 1996 by the holding of presidential and legislative elections collapsed on 25 May when the coup took place."
"The military junta would like to give power to the leader of the United Revolutionary Front, Mr Foday Sankoh, with all the risks of destabilization of the region that that implies."
"After all, hundreds of defenceless civilians were killed by the rebels, tortured, hacked with machetes and executed in atrocious conditions."
"This civil war lasted five years and led to more than 10 000 deaths."
"Vigorously condemning this coup, we call on the OAU to take the necessary initiatives to restore the democratically elected regime, that came to power in March 1996."
"Until those conditions are met, we call on the Commission and the Council to suspend implementation of the LomÃ© Convention and all aid to the Sierra Leone Government."
"It goes without saying that humanitarian aid should continue to be given as long as it is targeted at the most vulnerable."
"Madam President, obviously the Commission condemns the coup d'Ã©tat in Sierra Leone by Major Koroma."
"The Commission finds it totally unacceptable that the legitimate, democratically elected government of President Kabbah which came to power just over one year ago has been overthrown so abruptly by a small group of soldiers supported by the RUF rebels."
"A statement by the presidency on behalf of the European Union issued on 28 May deplored the overthrow of the elected government and urged the restoration of the democratic civilian government."
"Concern was also expressed at the level of violence against locals and expatriates."
"This statement reflects similar sentiments expressed by organizations and countries throughout the world: the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity, the Commonwealth, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Japan and the countries of the region."
"The crisis in Sierra Leone has resulted in de facto suspension of all aid programmes in the country."
"All project personnel and Commission staff have been evacuated."
"As regards the formalization of the suspension, discussions with Member States will be held in the appropriate fora of the Council in the light of the evolution of the situation."
"However, the Commission believes it is important to send a strong message to the perpetrators of the coup that such action is unacceptable and will not result in any financial or other aid being provided from the donor community."
"The European Union supports all efforts currently being undertaken to achieve a negotiated peaceful settlement to the conflict which would enable the return of the democratically elected civilian government of President Kabbah."
"We are fully aware of the paradoxes and difficulties that may come from the intervention of ECOMOG and of the important role being played by Nigeria, as Mr Hory mentioned."
"Having said that, I must say that the contacts I had personally with the Prime Minister of Guinea Conakry in this regard leaves no doubt that the countries of the region are fully engaged - not just Nigeria - in trying to prevent this coup d'Ã©tat from being a success."
"Regarding humanitarian aid, for the moment all ECHO-funded humanitarian aid operations have been put on hold due to the insecurity in the country and the evacuation of most humanitarian aid agency personnel."
"Security permitting, needs assessment missions will be undertaken by humanitarian aid agencies as soon as possible."
"If necessary ECHO is ready to intervene in providing assistance to populations which are being displaced as a result of the present crisis."
"Finally, I would like to emphasize that it is important that the OAU takes the leading role in defining a strategy to counteract the coup perpetrators and the rebel forces of RUF which are supporting them in Sierra Leone."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will not take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following 25 motions for resolutions:"
"(B4-0468/97) by Mr Cars and others, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the abolition of the death penalty; -(B4-0487/97) by Mr Soulier and others, on behalf of the PPE Group, on the abolition of the death penalty; -(B4-0497/97) by Mr Dupuis and others, on behalf of the ARE Group, on the abolition of the death penalty; -(B4-0513/97) by Mrs Aglietta and others, on behalf of the V Group, on the abolition of the death penalty; -(B4-0542/97) by Mr Alavanos and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the abolition of the death penalty; -(B4-0511/97) by Mr Kreissl-DÃ¶rfler and Mrs Aelvoet, on behalf of the V Group, on human rights in Colombia; -(B4-0538/97) by Mr Puerta and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on human rights in Colombia; -(B4-0552/97) by Mrs Lenz and others, on behalf of the PPE Group, on the situation in Colombia; -(B4-0560/97) by Mr Howitt, on behalf of the PSE Group, on human rights in Colombia; -(B4-0485/97) by Mrs Maij-Weggen and others, on behalf of the PPE Group, on the political situation and continuing human-rights abuses in Burma; -(B4-0547/97) by Mr Vinci and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on human rights in Burma and Burma's accession to ASEAN; -(B4-0551/97) by Mr TelkÃ¤mper and Mrs Hautala, on behalf of the V Group, on the situation in Burma; -(B4-0467/97) by Mr De Vries and others, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the return of refugees and displaced persons in Croatia; -(B4-0510/97) by Mrs Aelvoet and others, on behalf of the V Group, on the situation in Croatia and the implementation of the Dayton Accords; -(B4-0517/97) by Mr Hory and others, on behalf of the ARE Group, on the implementation of the Dayton Agreements in former Yugoslavia; -(B4-0531/97) by Mr Pasty and others, on behalf of the UPE Group, on the implementation of the Dayton Agreements in Croatia and Bosnia; -(B4-0548/97) by Mr Alavanos and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the implementation of the Dayton Agreements in Croatia; -(B4-0553/97) by Mr Oostlander and others, on behalf of the PPE Group, on the conditions for economic recovery and the return of refugees to their homes in the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina; -(B4-0559/97) by Mr Wiersma and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the development of the peace process in the former Yugoslavia; -(B4-0486/97) by Mr Castagnetti and others, on behalf of the PPE Group, on the 'Island of Hope' in Moscow; -(B4-0515/97) by Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the V Group, on the fate of street children in Moscow; -(B4-0503/97) by Mrs AndrÃ©-LÃ©onard and Mr Bertens, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on elections in Indonesia; -(B4-0357/97) by Mr Ribeiro and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Timor and the Indonesian elections; -(B4-0550/97) by Mrs McKenna and Mrs Hautala, on behalf of the V Group, on the situation in Indonesia and East Timor; -(B4-0514/97) by Mrs Schroedter and others, on behalf of the V Group, on obstruction of non-governmental humanitarian relief organizations in Belarus."
"Abolition of the death penalty"
"Madam President, there is wide agreement on the inhumanity of the death penalty here in Europe's Parliament."
"The matter is high on our agenda and we have firmly maintained that no country which retains the death penalty is welcome in our Union."
"We can also rejoice that more and more States on our continent and in other parts of the world now refrain from executing their citizens."
"Our Union, in co-operation with the European Council, has a central responsibility to speak on behalf of humanity in its contacts with the world outside."
"So, Madam President, Parliament now issues a real challenge to the Council and the Commission and to our fifteen Member States. Demand a moratorium on all executions at the UN General Assembly in the Autumn as a step towards the complete abolition of the death penalty throughout the world from the first day of the next millennium."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight for the abolition of the death penalty is in keeping with progress towards a humanity that is responsible for itself."
"As a lawyer I have observed not only the horror but also the shame that comes over anyone who is forced to take part in what is a human tragedy."
"But today Europe faces a different type of responsibility."
"Along with a few colleagues I attended a few weeks ago the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva and for the first time a resolution was voted by majority voting."
"Of course, both the United States and China voted against abolition but the vote was supported by many countries, including the Member States of the European Union."
"It is for Europe not only to be a commercial power but also to bear universal values and spread them around the world."
"The debate is the same be it about the death penalty, the social clause or proper conduct in business."
"It is an attitude towards human beings, towards mankind as a whole."
"Europe should therefore set an example and send a strong signal for the rest of the world to follow sooner or later."
"Madam President, I should first of all like to thank the chairman of the Sub-Committee on Human Rights for his decisive support for this motion and I should like to emphasize its possible importance for the development of the European Union."
"Contrary to what it did in Geneva, not over the death penalty on which, as Mr Soulier has reminded us, it took a very decisive position, a major stance, and obtained a successful outcome, but over the question of human rights in China, over which it took a far more unfortunate position, if the Union had promoted, in the General Assembly of the United Nations, the proposal for a moratorium on executions, I am sure that it would have found a majority of Member States so that, a hundred years after the universal abolition of slavery, we could have brought about abolition of the death penalty and at least take a decisive step in that direction."
"I should like to take advantage of the presence of Commissioner Pinheiro to remind him that the last two joint assemblies of the ACP-EU approved resolutions in favour of abolishing the death penalty and that it is therefore very important to reiterate, on every occasion, whenever meetings are held or contracts signed, and in discussions with the ACP countries, which are many, the importance that the European Union attaches to abolition of the death penalty."
"There are other occasions, such as Amsterdam, for speaking about the issue of the death penalty."
"Italy has demanded the introduction into the Treaty of an article on abolition of the death penalty."
"It may seem marginal to many people but it is important as it would enable us to begin to introduce the chapter on fundamental rights."
"I think that that would be a third element on which to focus the action of the European Union."
"There is a lot to be done but first of all I should like to ask Commissioner Pinheiro to ask his colleagues to make sure that the Commission, which also has an office in New York, has this important question put on the agenda of the next General Assembly of the United Nations."
"Madam President, of the countries of Eastern Europe, it is the new members of the Council of Europe - Russia and Ukraine - which, in spite of their promises, have taken the fewest initial steps towards creating a humane system of criminal law."
"This not only stems from technical difficulties in introducing democratic legislation, in establishing courts or in providing judges with the training they require if they are to become an independent judiciary but also and above all reflects a lack of political will."
"Ukraine, after all, has not complied with the moratorium and has continued to carry out death sentences."
"So what about the promises given by the Commission to the European Parliament when we were discussing ratification of the partnership and cooperation agreement and when the Commission was pressing so hard for Russia and Ukraine to become members of the Council of Europe at an excessively early date?"
"Where, on the one hand, is there real financial support, and to what extent, on the other hand, are we resorting to the preamble of the PCA in order to ensure that measures are taken in those two countries to abolish the death penalty in law and in practice?"
"Madam President, the death penalty was always held up as the ultimate instrument for eradicating crime but it has been clearly demonstrated in countries where it has been applied that it has never led to the eradication of crime and that, on the contrary, it has had perverse effects and led to the development of crime without witnesses."
"Big criminal organisations have never been intimidated by the death penalty and all that has happened is that they have made sure that no witnesses survive any crimes they commit."
"The death penalty also raises another problem: that of judicial error."
"How can judicial errors be rectified once the death penalty has been carried out?"
"Questions like this one, the fact that errors cannot be put right and the fact that crime can actually be made worse, should make us think about the need to eradicate the death penalty in every country in the world."
"I think that Europe has a culture of defending life and has therefore seen the biggest movement in favour of abolition of the death penalty."
"We should set an example and bear this in mind when negotiating association agreements and ask for a moratorium on executions to be included."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, point 6 of the joint resolution proposes that countries wishing to accede to the Council of Europe should undertake to sign and ratify the second optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as a condition of membership."
"I consider that to be one of the central messages of this resolution, for - as Mr Soulier has already pointed out - we did achieve progress at the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva."
"But it cannot be regarded as progress when, for all the debates we have held here in Parliament, some of the seats in this chamber, where the Council of Europe also meets, are taken by representatives of countries who proclaim in fine words all the rights their governments intend to grant and then, when they return home from here, do not raise a finger to turn these declarations into reality."
"That is one of the scandals we have to denounce here, and I must say - though it may sound somewhat provocative - that, while I have always considered the Council of Europe to be one of Europe's great political assets, when it comes to the death penalty and the honouring of binding obligations by the new member countries of the Council of Europe, I believe that the offhand way in which this precious asset is being treated may well undermine the ideal of human rights in the European Union."
"What is being put at risk is the precept that the community of States must honour the solemn, binding commitments it makes."
"If these commitments amount to no more than declarations of intent, the rights to which they relate will be eroded."
"In the struggle against the death penalty, that is a very dangerous development."
"Let me nevertheless conclude by expressing my pride in the fact that, as the joint resolution shows, in this assembly, in this European Parliament, apart from a very few personally and politically insignificant exceptions, the overwhelming majority have continued to take a resolute stance against the death penalty. For all that may divide us, I believe that we should make a point of emphasizing something on which we are united."
"Madam President, ' let the murderers begin' ."
"I think that this phrase is attributed to Alphonse Karr, from the last century, in the debate on the death penalty."
"Those were times when you could be humorous on the subject."
"Abolition of the death penalty has become one of the central elements of what might be called European humanism and the joint resolution expresses that very well."
"It is, in any case, the philosophy underlying this resolution."
"In order to be integrated into the Europe that we are building, abolition of the death penalty is not a sufficient condition for respect of human rights but it is a necessary one."
"We know that in criminal terms, there are other penalties, including life imprisonment, which would be nothing were it not for forced labour - as a character in a famous film says: ' There are many, many other forms of punishment' ."
"I am pleased that there is a consensus in this Assembly and that nobody has tried to alter the resolution that we are going to adopt later on."
"Colombia"
"Madam President, on the morning of 19 May, armed men entered a block of flats in the centre of BogotÃ¡ and wiped out an entire family."
"A baby survived, but only because it had been hidden in a cupboard just as the men entered the flat."
"The men had told the caretaker - and this is a significant point - that they were from the office of the public prosecutor."
"They were typical paramilitary operators."
"They escaped unrecognized, as always happens in Colombia."
"The murdered couple were employees of the renowned Jesuit institute CINEP."
"Mario CalderÃ³n dealt with ecology there, while his wife Elsa worked on human-rights projects."
"The utter brutality of this act of violence has horrified not only the people of Colombia but the international public too."
"Once more people have been killed in Colombia because they had devoted themselves to the cause of human rights, and once more, sadly, we must expect these murders to go unpunished."
"For years in the reports by the Commission on Human Rights the Colombian Government has regularly been urged to protect and respect human rights and the people who promote them."
"For years the Colombian Government's stock response has been an apologetic shrug of the shoulders."
"Allow me to close with a few words in Portuguese to our Commissioner:"
"I should like to tell the Commissioner that, unless we work together for human rights in Colombia, unless we fight together against the injustice which exists in Colombia, we shall resolve nothing."
"I know also, as does the Commissioner, that the Colombian government must work for human rights."
"We are also well aware that the Colombian government is not worthy of all the confidence which we, together with the Spanish PSOE and PP are placing in it."
"The Colombian people deserve our aid, not the government."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we wish to express our solidarity with the victims' relatives and our condemnation and concern."
"This is not the first time that the European Parliament has expressed itself on this subject."
"In February we included Columbia among the ten countries in the world with the most serious human rights and violence problems."
"We trusted in the Columbian Government when the European Union and that government signed preferential trade agreements."
"That confidence should also be linked with unquestionable signs of defending human rights and democracy given by the Columbian Government."
"We must find those responsible and even if they are paramilitaries, this is the responsibility of the Columbian Government. If it does not try to track them down, it loses its credibility."
"In the defence of democracy and its values it can count the European Union among its collaborators but if it does not defend those values it will be deceiving us and the consequences for the Government and, above all, for the country will be extremely harmful."
"Madam President, a number of disquieting reports have been reaching our ears about serious human rights violations in Colombia, particularly in recent months."
"It has been difficult to verify some of these allegations, partly, perhaps, because they are said to have occurred in very remote parts of Colombia."
"However, as we have heard from the previous two speakers, there can be no doubt about the tragic situation which has arisen in regard to the family named in the resolution, and not only that family."
"We look to the Colombian Government in the first place to make a thorough investigation and, in the absence of any other authority, we have to look again to the European Commission to ask what action it feels it can take."
"We are concerned, for instance, about another person, Neftali Vanegas, whose life is said to have been in danger in recent weeks and whose organization is at least partly financed by the European Commission."
"Maybe the Commissioner would be kind enough to comment with regard to that particular case."
"Madam President, for nearly half a century Colombia has been afflicted by violence and vicious killings on an horrific scale."
"The recent murder of three members of the CalderÃ³n family and the serious wounding of another exemplify the uncivilized savagery which has become a familiar feature of life in Colombia today."
"Mario CalderÃ³n and Elsa Constanza Alvarado were killed as members of the human rights organization CINEP, which is committed to defending human beings against violence and terror and working for peace."
"Their deaths and the violence inflicted on their close relatives by a squad of heavily-armed killers demonstrate the ruthless inhumanity of those responsible for organizing terrorism in Colombia today."
"In the last six months it is estimated that 650 people have been the victims of violence in Colombia, including poor peasants and many others."
"In fact, it is estimated that nearly one million people have fled from their homes to escape the violence which is having such a devastating effect on all aspects of life in the country."
"We must deplore these killings, and call on the Colombian Government to hunt these murderers down and see that they are punished."
"We welcome the setting-up of the Permanent UN High Commission for Human Rights and the contribution of ECHO in assisting displaced people."
"Further than this, however, we should reflect on the fact that the European Union played a key role in helping to restore peace in Central America and is cooperating with Latin America as a whole in a bid to achieve both closer relations and development."
"In denouncing the violence perpetrated in Colombia, we should be making a careful examination of the situation to see if there is any way, difficult though it is, in which we could contribute to the ending of the violence and the restoration of full peace."
"That is the only way in the long run that we can really feel satisfied we are making a real contribution to end this appalling horror."
"Madam President, the murder of Mr and Mrs CalderÃ³n is typical of the kind of spiralling violence which goes unpunished in Colombia."
"The Colombian Government recently confirmed that the NGOs have a legitimate role to play, but it has done little to put this policy into practice."
"It must at least take steps to do so."
"The opening of the office of the UN High Commission for Human Rights is a positive development, and we welcome the aid provided under the ECHO programme for those in Colombia who have fled the violence and are now homeless."
"What is even more important, of course, is that the violence should be stopped, and this is why we need to bring pressure to bear on the government to crack down on the paramilitary groups, to protect human rights and to strengthen the power of the judiciary."
"That is where the solution lies."
"But this is not the first time we have spoken about Colombia here in the House, and I fear that it will by no means be the last."
"Mr President, yesterday in his address the President of the Council referred to the fact that the ASEAN conference had discussed Burma for two and a half hours, which he interpreted as an encouraging sign."
"If, on the other hand, so little is heard in public of the opposition leader Aung San Sun Kyi, despite her Nobel Prize and her Sakharov Prize, it may well be that even a two-and-a-half-hour debate, which is only right and proper, has to be regarded as something of a success."
"But little though the voice of the opposition spokeswoman is heard, even less is heard of the thousands of children who die as a result of forced labour and other measures."
"That, in fact, is quite rarely mentioned."
"So what are we to expect of the heads of government of the ASEAN countries when only one of them has voiced opposition to Burmese accession?"
"On the other hand, the Malaysian Head of State even welcomed the fact that the accession of Burma meant the addition of another centrally, albeit not entirely democratically, governed State."
"I should like to ask the Commission whether they see any means of enforcing the measures referred to in point 4 of the resolution and whether they are hopeful of success in such an endeavour."
"Mr President, we have spoken very frequently about Burma over the past two years, and all we can really do each time is to repeat our expressions of regret and the charges against the Burmese Government."
"It is still the case that elementary rights are not respected, that hundreds of supporters of the democratic opposition, the National League for Democracy (NLD), are in prison."
"Only recently a prominent member of the NLD, 67-year-old Tin Shwe, died in prison."
"He had been held in custody for seven years."
"He had a heart condition, and it was in this way, as a prisoner, that he had to end his days."
"The official reason given for his imprisonment was subversive propaganda."
"In this case subversive propaganda means communicating information from within the country about the dreadful conditions that prevail there."
"Hundreds of people are still in prison, and I believe that economic measures, the pressure that would be exerted if no money from the European Union were invested there, if Europe did not support the regime in any way, could secure these people's release from prison."
"We also demand, as we have been demanding for quite some time, that Mrs Aung San Sun Kyi, the holder of the Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, be allowed to move about freely."
"It is always difficult to pass judgement on other States, but we can scarcely welcome the fact that the countries of ASEAN have admitted Burma into their organization under these circumstances."
"I believe we should roundly condemn that and we should ensure that it remains on the agenda for our diplomatic and political discussions and economic negotiations with the ASEAN States."
"This makes it all the more incomprehensible to me when I see attempts being made in the European Union to develop relations with Burma - I have to endorse Mrs GÃ¼nther's views on that subject."
"The Munich Messegesellschaft - the Trade Fair Society - would like to hold a meeting at the next fair in Rangoon."
"Mrs GÃ¼nther, I take your appeal very seriously."
"Bavaria is governed by the Christian Social Union."
"I hope that its Trade Fair Company will not go to Burma."
"Mayor Monatzeder, a fellow Green, has protested against the trip and has called for its cancellation, and I hope we are united behind this protest and that we can persuade the Messegesellschaft in Munich not to support the Burmese regime in this way."
"Mr President, notwithstanding worldwide protests, ASEAN has finally decided to allow Burma to become a member, despite its continuing human rights violations and despite the continuing imprisonment of the elected prime minister, Aung San Suu Kyi, by the military dictatorship."
"I may be being cynical, but I have to say that ASEAN seems determined to establish a reputation as a group of countries with lofty economic ambitions but little interest in democracy or human rights."
"Money and goods are evidently more important than fundamental values and standards, whilst in Burma, democracy continues to be undermined and human rights violated."
"In May, Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi's house arrest was tightened so that her party, which six years ago won 80 % of the votes in the elections, was unable to hold its annual congress, and it is even being made increasingly difficult for foreign journalists to visit her."
"On the human rights front, the SLORC is carrying on with slave labour, child labour, intimidation, disappearances, murders and the permanent persecution of minorities."
"The European Union has ended the system of preferences for Burma, which is a positive move. But is it not time to follow the United States' lead and ban investment?"
"There is a risk that the gap left by the reduction in investment from the US will be filled by European companies, which would be extremely regrettable."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner whether he will put this proposal to the European Council."
"I know that there is to be a meeting on this subject shortly, so I very much hope that you will do as we request."
"Mr President, Members of the European Parliament have been hammering on the door of the generals in Rangoon for more than two years now, and European businesses have mostly moved out of the country, so I cannot agree with Mrs Maij-Weggen: the new investors are from another region which has much less social conscience than we do."
"But it seems that the stand we have made has not achieved results."
"On the contrary, the Asiatic region is closing ranks and has welcomed Burma into ASEAN."
"Is this not a sign that we should review what is obviously a counter-productive approach?"
"There is no point in sounding off here in the House every month for the benefit of our own supporters: the Asian tigers simply laugh at the roars they hear from our cage."
"In my opinion, it is no longer feasible for the European Parliament to keep up this unilateral protest."
"Can we not appoint a special envoy as we did for the Middle East and the Great Lakes, to act as a mediator for us in ASEAN and the surrounding region?"
"I should like to hear what the Commissioner thinks about this."
"I am afraid that a special envoy would be laughed down just as much as the European tigers. In any event, two months ago the NLD attempted to celebrate its overwhelming victory in the elections seven years before, and the military junta reacted with its usual restraint by immediately putting 300 activists behind bars."
"ASEAN's decision to allow Burma membership is a slap in the face for the international community and for the so-called universality of human rights."
"Just when President Clinton announces sanctions against Burma, ASEAN does the complete opposite."
"And I have to agree with Mrs van Bladel that the new investors are mostly not European firms but Asian tigers."
"The Union is already taking action, and I must admit that it is quite good as far as it goes. But we need to persuade ASEAN to change its policy towards Burma."
"How we can most effectively bring pressure to bear on the SLORC regime remains to be seen, but I hope that what we say here, whether we are laughed at or not, sometimes gets through at least to Aung San Suu Kyi, so that she knows that we are still determined to show solidarity with her."
"Mr President, much as I respect Mrs van Bladel, I really doubt whether we should change our approach radically."
"There are such things as honour and a deep concern about human rights situations."
"It goes beyond tactics and on to strategy."
"I therefore welcome very much the action of the American President who has imposed economic sanctions on Burma, thereby prohibiting US persons from making new investment in Burma."
"That is certainly having an effect."
"I myself am not against taking economic sanctions, though I realize that this is a policy which is very difficult to sell within the European Union."
"I am in favour of bringing pressure to bear on European firms to disinvest or not to invest."
"That is very important."
"There are a number of companies which have taken the appropriate action: Heineken , in the Netherlands, is one case;"
"Carlsberg is another."
"I would very much like to see Club MÃ©diterranÃ© , among others, follow suit."
"Implementation of Dayton Accords in Croatia"
"Mr President, none of the States of the former Yugoslavia seem to have understood the necessity of keeping to agreements, including the Dayton Agreement, and respecting human rights."
"Croatia is no worse then the other States of the former Yugoslavia, but makes greater claims for being accepted as a cooperation partner of the European Union."
"This they cannot be, and will never be as long as the Croatian government protects suspected war criminals and continues to allow ethnic Serbs to be persecuted and harmed and refused the right to return to their homes."
"Mr President, this behaviour must stop along with similar excesses in Serbia and Bosnia."
"The European Union has a duty to demand respect for human rights and for agreements concluded."
"Insist on these demands, and do so with all your might!"
"Mr President, it is clear to everyone, I think, that the Dayton Agreement will not be implemented unless all the countries concerned comply with its provisions."
"We are only too aware of the limitations of this agreement, but if the terms to which all the signatories put their names are not respected, it is quite clear that the situation could become inflamed once again."
"For this reason we must draw attention, for example, to the fact that in Krajina, where 200 000 Serbs once lived, almost all these people have since been displaced, and that a temporary law adopted by the Croatian Government and Parliament has allowed Croats from other parts of the country to occupy Serbian property if the legitimate owner is absent."
"According to the OSCE, at least 90 % of the Serbs returning to the region in recent months have been unable to reoccupy their homes."
"The return of refugees and displaced persons is a prerequisite for peace, according to the Dayton Agreement."
"We must ensure that the actions of the European Union, and hence the Commission, are geared to urging the governments of both Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina to abide by this principle, perhaps even resorting to economic means of persuasion if necessary."
"Mr President, I should like to say that today's debate is a strange and frankly paradoxical one."
"The initial idea of the political groups was to condemn the Croatian Government, firmly, over its violations of human rights in Krajina and Slavonia."
"Curiously, because of the way in which the European Parliament is influenced - several of whose members have been leading a real crusade against Yugoslavia and its political authorities - the common resolution has led to a priority condemnation of the Serbian Government, which is not at all concerned by the question of returning refugees to the republics previously struck by the war."
"I should just like to remind you of the truth: the confiscation of Serbian property by the Croatian authorities is a crime and likely to heighten tensions once again in the region."
"Since this debate is leaving the Croatian framework, I wish to denounce the irresponsibility of those, led by the United States, who are running the risk of massively arming the Muslim authorities in Sarajevo and setting fire again to the powder-kegs of Herzegovina and northern Bosnia."
"Mr President, it has been said in this Chamber on many occasions that the European Union showed itself incapable of playing a role of any great importance in the crisis in the former Yugoslavia."
"The first attempt at a peaceful approach to a conflict which has left so many open wounds came after the American intervention and with the Dayton Agreement."
"The European Parliament has passed a whole series of resolutions and made its positions clear."
"That is what we are endeavouring to do on this occasion on the basis of Mr Hory's forceful observations, without any certainty that this present resolution, which has been drawn up more or less unanimously, will achieve anything either."
"In a region which has experienced the first full-scale conflict in Europe since the Second World War, and in which the dead are still being counted and the tensions still exist, nothing has really changed."
"The European Union will be able to intervene with credibility only when it acknowledges that it bears a major portion of the blame, firstly because of its great haste in promoting and extolling the break-up of the former Yugoslavia and, secondly, because of its delay in acting after the conflagration had started."
"We are now asking for something which is self-evidently right and in accord with our understanding of justice."
"The return of the Krajina Serb refugees, whose sufferings are well known and have already been described, to their homes."
"The freedom of movement of people etc., etc., and the removal of ethnic divisions."
"We are realists."
"At Point B we state that insufficient progress has been made until now with the implementation of the Dayton Agreement, and elsewhere we insist, quite rightly, on its strict implementation."
"Mr President, despite all of the observations that are made and the historical reservations that have been expressed, our group supports the joint resolution and will vote for it."
"We believe that it is the right of everyone to return to their home and that all war criminals must be punished; all of them, however, without exceptions."
"The gulf between saying these things and any sense of optimism that the conflicts and divisions that were underscored very, very starkly in the Bosnian election results will actually be overcome and removed is very great indeed; so great that we must redouble our efforts now and in the future."
"Because, as I have said, we ourselves are by no means innocent with regard to the things that have happened in the former Yugoslavia."
"Mr President, I am pleased to see that this resolution once again comes down hard on Serbia or the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia because, contrary to what Mr Hory said, the Serbian Government is posing a threat to international security and to the safe return of the refugees through its refusal to cooperate in arresting war criminals to stand trial at The Hague."
"This may be because Mr Milosevic is still active behind the scenes and is next in line for investigation."
"We must never forget the victims of the neo-racist inspired war in former Yugoslavia, and we must stress, as this resolution does, that ethnic politics and ethnic divisions are totally incompatible with the establishment of the rule of law in the region."
"The rule of law is not some kind of luxury or idealistic goal, but the very basis on which society and the economy are to be reconstructed."
"Until there is an end to the ethnic divisions, ethnic thinking and ethnic barriers which are preventing refugees from returning home, there can be no hope of any economic progress in many of the states concerned, especially the Republika Srpska, where ethnic thinking is at its height and there are still people in power who are solely bent on bleeding their country dry without any concern for their own people, and who are determined to pursue their own ethnic ideologies."
"This is why it is essential that SFOR should remain."
"I am pleased to see that the resolution also calls for UNTAES to remain too, although that is a little different in that it is a confidence-building measure, but with SFOR it really is a matter of life and death for the people who live there."
"Everyone in these three countries is a victim: of deception by their ethnic leaders, and of the frustrations of people from other ethnic backgrounds."
"Sometimes they themselves bear no guilt, as we have seen in Croatia, where enormous frustration was felt by those Croats who were driven out of Krajina."
"Many Serbs were guilty there, others not, and it is a great pity that the innocent too should suffer from the frustration which has been generated."
"However, things are much worse in parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina, where people's lives are actually in danger because of the rabble who are in power."
"I have met people there who are supposed to be acting mayors but who do nothing to deserve the title."
"The PPE Group would like to propose the setting-up of a central office in Bosnia with powers to deal with the refugees, since it is such a complex issue and so closely tied up with the return of refugees to Croatia and Slavonia that some kind of joint clearing-house is needed to organize the whole thing, otherwise there will be chaos."
"While it continues to be organized separately, and on an entity basis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, there is no chance of a return taking place successfully."
"People are now waiting in temporary accommodation because they might be going back or because they are living in someone else's house."
"Nothing is happening, and things are at a complete standstill."
"This is why we would urgently call on the Commission to introduce an effective aid policy based on conditionality, to be implemented decentrally so that those with good intentions can still be distinguished from those with bad."
"Mr President, of everything that has been said on this subject, the words of Mr Oostlander have been the clearest, most sensible and most balanced so far."
"This is simply due to the fact that he has been in the country, that he has concerned himself with that country time and again from the very outset and therefore knows how things are."
"He refrains from the sort of ideological utterances, based on Serbophilia or other motives, that totally distort the picture."
"There is one thing we must not forget, namely that Serbia was the initial aggressor."
"Not a single house in Serbia has been destroyed, whereas in Croatia - and the Krajina belongs to Croatia - many houses have been destroyed."
"I am naturally in favour of everyone, including the Serbs, being able to return home, and I am in favour of our welcoming the Serbs to our Community one day, but first of all we must get things clear here, which certainly involves emphasizing that there is no place for that country as long as it is governed by extremists and mass murderers."
"Before all else, that has to change!"
"Mr President, yet again the House is addressing itself to human rights violations in Croatia: last time following blatant curbs on the freedom of the press and information; this time because of the failure to comply with the Dayton Agreement, which - it is worth reminding the Croatian authorities - is an essential precondition not only for the maintenance of peace throughout the former Yugoslavia, but also for the continuation of the cooperation and aid agreements with the European Union."
"And yet the right of free movement is being violated, as is the right of the displaced persons and refugees to return to their homes."
"The Croatian Government is impeding their return by authorizing the confiscation of Serbian property through a temporary housing law and by embarking on a programme to settle Bosnian Croats in seized homes."
"This is a clear case of ethnic cleansing, which harks back to the worst traditions of these peoples."
"Indeed, I would recall the persecution, the looting and the enforced exodus, after the end of the Second World War, of hundreds of thousands of Italians who had been living in that region for centuries."
"Street children in Moscow"
"Mr President, this resolution concerns the plight of abandoned children, most of them homeless, in the city of Moscow."
"The problem is assuming truly alarming proportions, to the extent that we could soon be faced, in Moscow as elsewhere, with the phenomenon of street children."
"Because of the serious budgetary constraints of which we are aware, and for fear that children from other Russian cities could be encouraged to migrate to Moscow, the municipal authorities are in fact withholding any support on the grounds that these children do not have formal documents, even though their Russian nationality is beyond question."
"Given the seriousness of this phenomenon, several initiatives have been taken by private individuals, purely on humanitarian grounds."
"The most significant, efficient and best organized of these initiatives on the part of civil society is the one called 'Island of Hope' , which - for reasons it is impossible to understand - is being subjected almost daily to intolerable harassment. On 15 May 1997, it even suffered physical attacks by elements from within the police force, undoubtedly with the aim of intimidation as well as repression."
"Despite having some understanding for the financial difficulties confronting the municipal authorities in Moscow, the European Parliament is bound to censure any act of violence directed at people who are acting purely out of generosity, and must likewise censure the total abandonment of this small population of street children in Moscow."
"I therefore hope that this resolution will be adopted."
"Mr President, Moscow is becoming an increasingly attractive city in terms of its outward appearance, and every time I go there I see that the faÃ§ades of some more buildings have been renovated."
"But that is the only new development."
"What has remained is the old Soviet system of the propiska ."
"Only those who possess such a document are entitled to obtain housing in Moscow."
"This means that many families who were simply not among the beneficiaries of the transformation process - single mothers were among the main losers - are being driven to destitution."
"These mothers and their children have to resort to begging in the streets of Moscow."
"But the Mayor of Moscow is very thorough when it comes to cleaning up faÃ§ades, for the Island of Hope will also fall victim to the cleanup campaign."
"The Island of Hope is the largest autonomous initiative for street children in Moscow."
"It gives them a warm place to stay, feeds them and even tries to provide them with schooling."
"Amidst the chaos accompanying the breakdown of law and order, this island would give the children the opportunity to join the mainstream of society and enjoy normal lives."
"The closure of this facility, however, will mean the return of these children to the street gangs, the makeshift tents and the sewers."
"This will create a breeding ground for crime."
"The city of Moscow has no alternative to the Island of Hope."
"That is why we ask that this organization be left alone to continue its work."
"Mr President, the topical and urgent debate on the street children of Moscow really highlights two different problems that have accompanied the massive political and economic upheavals in Russia."
"The first is the dreadful social situation of many children in Russia."
"The 25 % of the population who live below the poverty line inevitably include a great many children, and the problems that occur under these circumstances have long been familiar to us here in the European Parliament from other parts of the world."
"They are not typically Russian problems."
"What is typically Russian, however, and further complicates the situation is that there are rules governing the transfer of a person's residence to Moscow."
"It is a relic of the old Soviet Union, a rule that is basically inconsistent with a liberalized system, but its effect is that many children have no legal right at all to reside in Moscow."
"The second point is that the NGOs are still far less able to work in Russia than in other European countries or in other parts of the world."
"Non-governmental organizations in Russia are still subject to high-handed acts of officialdom, while the public presence and public acceptance of such organizations is limited."
"That is why I welcome our discussing this as a topical and urgent issue, but I would also urge that, in future motions of this kind, Parliament should examine whether there is really only one organization affected or whether there are others."
"I should not like decisions of the European Parliament to cause difficulties for other, unnamed organizations, thereby necessitating another topical and urgent debate on the same subject."
"Indonesia and East Timor"
"Mr President, as we expected, the elections in Indonesia went very badly."
"The electoral campaign was marked by violence and numerous irregularities on polling day."
"The massive victory of the Golkar Government will enable President Suharto to seek a seventh consecutive presidential term in next year's presidential elections."
"Obviously the most hard done by are young people and opponents to the regime."
"We condemn the arbitrary practices of the Indonesian authorities, turning the elections into a complete farce."
"The system really needs a breath of oxygen because, even if the country is doing well economically, in the future those who are not doing quite so well will have to be satisfied."
"Half the population of Jakarta has no access to drinking water or basic medical facilities and the situation is only getting worse."
"This is intolerable!"
"As for the situation in East Timor, we are also very worried about that."
"A European Parliament delegation must be allowed to visit the territory at once and report back to us. Then we shall know the situation there and take the necessary measures to deal with it."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, once again this Parliament is dealing with East Timor since there is still military occupation, since there is no let up in oppression and human rights are daily trodden underfoot in that territory which is still not decolonized."
"That is not all."
"It takes less effort merely to go through the motions of a routine or ritual, but it must now, at this sitting, be pointed out that the so-called elections in Indonesia were not a step on the road to democratization of the regime, but rather confirmation of its dictatorial nature."
"There is also a new factor which has arisen since our previous sittings - the emergence of internal resistance, although it was denied and it was claimed that the armed conflict in the interior would end and that only the diplomatic and political front could rightly claim to represent the desire for self-determination and independence, which was born of that very resistance and which would triumph over occupation, repression and genocide."
"Thus, as the recent awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize has proved, it is possible to buy arms is one country of the European Union to perpetuate the military occupation of a territory and to subjugate a people."
"We welcome the fact that it was possible to reach a joint compromise motion for a resolution which is to be put to the vote."
"Therefore in supporting, underwriting and voting for this motion for a resolution, fruit of our initiative, we wish to stress that in our view it fails to point out the fact that resistance has not ended in East Timor and that, although there is less repression nowadays than there was, it is meted out with great violence against those suspected by the occupying force of perpetrating this resistance."
"There is no statement in the motion for a resolution setting out the views of this Parliament as regards the immediate suspension of any aid, military assistance and the sale of arms to Indonesia, and we think it was essential to have one."
"Mr President, in connection with these unfortunate elections it has become clear that violence is again on the increase in East Timor."
"We are very worried to hear that civilians have been killed there and civilians are, as we know, in particularly great danger of being tortured."
"When Mr Ramos Horta, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, was visiting this parliament in April, he showed us East Timor activists a documentary film which showed how the police and the army crucifying people in prison."
"We must do everything we can to put an end to this."
"The European Parliament has repeatedly called for a parliamentary delegation to be sent to East Timor."
"The East Timor intergroup has recently been refounded, and this group has now set itself the main objective of ensuring that Parliament really does send a delegation."
"The situation is really becoming more intolerable day by day."
"Unfortunately, the elections too have increased the general repression."
"Amnesty International, for example, is still alarmed at this situation, even after the elections."
"Ladies and gentlemen, a month ago, when we voted for a resolution on the elections or the elections planned for the end of May in Indonesia, we had the opportunity to express our critical view on the conditions under which those elections were to be held, reaffirming our solidarity with the pro-democracy movement and condemning the fact that the Indonesian government had refused to have an independent monitoring committee and had detained a large number of students who had dared to protest against a highly controlled electoral campaign."
"The events of that electoral farce unfortunately proved us right."
"Despite the repression and torture, the international media were able to some extent to lift the veil on that electoral fraud."
"With a resolution passed a month ago the European Parliament became the forerunner in a great series of statements by the international community horrified at the manipulation of the elections in Indonesia and condemning the repeated violations of human rights, in particular in the occupied territory of East Timor, the last of them passed by the United States House of Representatives roundly condemning violations of human rights against the people of East Timor."
"The current resolution therefore forms part of a coherent framework of the European Parliament's political views, so there is no need to make circuitous and unwarranted interpretations."
"As regards the sale of arms to Indonesia, the position of this Parliament is clear, well known and was reiterated only a month ago."
"The European Parliament repeated that it was necessary for the Member States of the European Union to refrain from giving any military assistance or selling arms to Indonesia."
"That is this Parliament's view and the authors of the motion for a resolution under discussion did not deem it necessary to repeat that and have not asked for it to be included again in this joint motion for a resolution on which we are to vote."
"Finally, I urge the President - and I should like to take this opportunity to urge our own President of the European Parliament - to try once more to send a parliamentary delegation to East Timor and to ask the Commission to pay special attention to the point requesting it to submit a report on the situation in East Timor and on violations of human rights in Indonesia."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution under consideration on the elections in Indonesia and the consequences in East Timor bears witness to the fact once again that the Indonesian authorities are systematically denying freedom, failing to respect human rights and perpetrating moral and physical violence."
"When the Maubere people of Timor, assisted by the Secretariat-General of the UN, presented proposals for a peaceful solution to the conflict, the military dictatorship in Indonesia, ignoring the United Nations resolutions and showing flagrant disrespect for human rights, responded with violence and killing."
"For these objective reasons, we ask the Parliament to approve the preambles and motions for resolutions tabled."
"Mr President, Indonesia is actually an archipelago of 13 000 islands, a beautiful but very complex country with 280 languages and peoples, covering an area the equivalent of that from Ireland to the Russian-Siberian border."
"It is a country which is enjoying economic success and is regarded with some jealousy in the region, a country with a growing middle class and a growing financial Ã©lite which, in contrast to Latin America and Africa, invests its money in its own country."
"Do not think, however, that I am blind to everything that is wrong about Indonesia."
"A year ago, I visited a number of journalists in prison and the trade union leader Mr Pakpahan, and I have protested to the authorities about their captivity on a number of occasions."
"But what is the point of adopting resolutions here every month when the Western European Union is still the biggest investor in Indonesia?"
"We have a choice: either we should allow no further investment and pull out completely, or else we should improve our communication with Indonesia through parliamentary delegations and the human rights organization there."
"We should also send a delegation to Timor, with whom our relations are rather different. We might then be able to do something about the East Timor problem, provided that all our Portuguese colleagues from across the political spectrum are 100 per cent committed to achieving this."
"Mr President, the elections in Indonesia attracted a great deal of attention, not just because of the hundreds of people killed during the run-up to them, but also because of the highly organized way in which the government disabled the opposition, prevented the media from doing their job and manipulated the international media."
"But Mrs van Bladel is right, of course: none of this comes as any surprise in Indonesia."
"I also have to admit that the European Union has no room to talk when it says that this must not happen again in the future, since it is European investors who are making the biggest profit out of Indonesia, which was moulded by 350 years of Dutch colonial administration."
"Nevertheless, one thing the Council can do is to insist on an agreement for ASEAN to have a democracy clause, as we discussed in relation to Burma."
"Europe must adopt a united stance against undemocratic practices, but I really think - and here Mrs van Bladel is right again - that we need to go and talk to the Indonesians, because one thing they have learnt from the Dutch is to listen and to talk."
"However, whether they will actually do what we want is another matter altogether."
"Belarus"
"Mr President, let me begin by thanking my fellow Members for their help in putting this item on today's agenda, for it is indeed a burning issue. Twenty per cent of the territory of Belarus is contaminated."
"Since 1996, in line with the prevailing rationale in that country, measures have been taken, pursuant to a political decision, to ignore radioactive contamination and to revitalize the contaminated areas by replanting the fields and encouraging people to resettle the land."
"There will therefore be no reduction in the number of children suffering the after-effects of long-term radiation with the passage of time."
"The various international initiatives and the very many private initiatives have been subject since the beginning of this year to discriminatory decrees and have been prevented from distributing aid."
"Organizations in the country which maintain international contacts are being criminalized, and some of their members have already been granted asylum in Germany."
"It is virtually impossible for them to continue their work."
"In other words, not only has the process of democratic reform in that country been halted but so too have the charitable aid measures on which the country's survival depends, because the Government has no money and is even curtailing its own measures of assistance."
"That is why we must call for humanitarian aid to be continued in accordance with international standards for the sake of public health and welfare in Belarus."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to express my sincere thanks to Mrs Schroedter for her commitment to Belarus and to human rights in general."
"She grew up under a Communist regime and knows exactly what she is talking about when she refers to basic values and fundamental liberties."
"That is why I wish to express my very sincere thanks to her."
"In Belarus today we have a regime on European soil, led by President Lukashenko, which on the one hand is a Russian puppet and on the other hand is certainly not based on a free democratic order or anything of the sort."
"Government policy in Belarus is laid down by presidential decree."
"And since the politicians there govern by force alone, we must not mince our words to them."
"Straight talking is all they will understand!"
"That is why I support the demands made in the motion before us."
"It is simply high time our European Union drew up a clear catalogue of fundamental freedoms and human rights, spelling out the consequences for any of our partner countries that violate them."
"The same conditions must apply to all countries we deal with, be they in Europe, Africa, Asia or anywhere else."
"Our future credibility depends on it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall try to be as brief as possible in my speech."
"As regards the motions for resolutions on the abolition of the death penalty, I must confirm that the Commission, having been greatly impressed by the questions presented, regards it as essential to respect the guarantees embodied in the International Charter on Civil and Political Rights and on Optional Protocol No 2 seeking to abolish the death penalty and Protocol No 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights."
"The Commission still thinks that the question of the abolition of the death penalty is implicitly covered by the clause which has systematically been included since 1995 in the agreements with third countries and which enshrines respect for democratic principles and human rights as an essential element."
"But we must bear in mind - as, moreover, has been mentioned by some Members - that hypocrisy does exist on the international scene and that some of our main commercial and political partners in the world do still retain the death penalty."
"As regards Colombia, I shall simply say, bearing in mind the worsening situation regarding human rights in that country, that this question is regarded as the priority for the allocation of resources under the budgetary heading of 'Democracy and Human Rights in Latin America' ."
"The Commission was deeply distressed to learn of the recent killings of various human rights activists and, of course, we roundly condemn these acts and urge the Colombian government to make every effort to identify those responsible for these crimes."
"It is in that spirit also that the Commission continues to support the local non-government organizations, which have as their objective the defence of human rights and democracy, and the Commission is currently paying for five observers to be present under the auspices of the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights in order to gain first hand detailed knowledge of the situation and to obtain specific proposals going beyond the scope of Colombia and applicable at international level."
"I should also like to point out, in the same spirit, that we are still continuing to support a strengthening of the Colombian judicial institutions."
"Finally, Mr President, I should like to mention that in the field of the homeless, which is a highly worrying field, Commission, through the ECO, has managed to allocate approximately ECU 5 million to make a start on tackling this problem with our collaboration."
"Evidently the Commission also shares the European Parliament's concern about the constant and generalized violations of human rights and repeated threats to the democratic movement by the Myanmar government."
"We are continuing to follow the internal situation of that country closely and we would say, unfortunately, that with the exception of the freeing of Aung San Suu Kyi last July, no significant improvements have been noted to date."
"The Commission fully endorses the European Union's call for a State Law and Order Council in order to establish a productive dialogue with the other political forces with a view to reconciliation and the introduction of multi-party democracy."
"I should also like to stress that, over the past decade, in Myanmar, with the exception of humanitarian actions, the Commission has had practically no financial resources for aid projects for the development of that country which could involve the government."
"The Commission hopes, finally, that the accession of Myanmar as a full member of the ASEAN will help to make human rights and democratic principles more constant and more continuous."
"I should also like to mention that, as regards the sanctions imposed by the United States, we cannot have a dual standard."
"We cannot condemn the Helms-Burton law because it is unilateral and extra-territorial whilst at the same time supporting the same measures implemented in Myanmar."
"Having said that, I should like however to stress that the Commission will not omit in its proposals for collaboration between the European Union and ASEAN to stress this as an essential point."
"That is not, however, sufficient, since items for meetings have to be approved by both parties before they are entered on the agenda."
"Experience has shown for example that the question of human rights in Indonesia or the question of East Timor have never been placed on the agenda for the talks between the European Union and the countries of ASEAN, since they were opposed by Indonesia."
"So, ladies and gentlemen, there is no guarantee that this question of human rights and the situation of democracy in Myanmar will be included in the talks between the European Union and ASEAN."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as regards the peace process in the former Yugoslavia, at the Coordination Council meeting within the scope of the Peace Implementation Council held in Sintra on 30 May, it was stated that no parts of former Yugoslavia were fully respecting their obligations as regards the possibility for refugees, particularly those from minority groups, to return to their place of origin - with Bosnia-Herzegovina presenting special difficulties."
"There is also a serious lack of cooperation with the International Court."
"The Commission therefore fully supports the application of a stricter conditionality clause to all parts."
"As regards Croatia, it is particularly important for Serb refugees from Croatia wanting to return no longer to be exposed to serious situations where there is insecurity and persecution on legal or other grounds."
"The future relations of the European Union with Croatia will depend to a large extent on the way Croatia respects the return of these minorities."
"Considerable progress has been noted as regards the peaceful integration of Eastern Slovenia into Croatia."
"The municipal elections on 13 April were a success and the Croatian government's manifesto was a suitable basis for a constructive relationship with the Croatian Serbs."
"Mention should also be made of an agreement concluded recently between the Croatian government, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and the United Nations Transitional Committee for Eastern Slovenia which lays down the rules for the return of Croatian Serbs now in Slovenia and Crajina."
"Unfortunately these positive intentions, expressed at the highest levels, sometimes do not get through to the local authorities, so there are still incidents at local level."
"We hope that with time and perseverance these too will be eliminated."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is aware of the extremely disturbing and difficult situation of children in Russia, as well as of the difficulties currently facing the various centres taking in children."
"Various examples of very constructive initiatives taken by the Russian authorities could be mentioned; however those centres are faced with an extremely difficult budgetary situation."
"Consequently, the Commission has allocated part of the funds available under the TACIS LIEN instrument to help these children."
"The Commission is of course still following the situation through its delegation in Moscow and is naturally at Parliament's disposal for any more detailed work in this matter in conjunction with a visit due to be made by a parliamentary delegation to Russia very shortly."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is almost a recurring theme to discuss the lack of democracy in Indonesia and the question of East Timor and we all fear that familiarity might breed contempt."
"However, the recent events in the elections in Indonesia and the violations of human rights in Timor remind us once again that this is perhaps one of the key elements in the coherency of the European institutions."
"I shall not go again into the views of the Council and the Commission, which are known, but shall merely stress once again the impact, the decisive importance and the courage of this Parliament in defending the people of Timor."
"Well done!"
"Finally, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as regards cooperation with Belorus I shall simply mention that the Commission suspended last November the normal cooperation framework, that is the TACIS programme for Belorus."
"However the Commission supports the Council proposal to grant aid to Belorus limited to those areas where there is constitutional reform, protection of human rights and freedom of the press."
"Consequently the Commission is prepared to draw up within 1997 a considerably reduced ad hoc TACIS programme in favour of Belorus for an amount of ECU 5 million in order to help with the rehabilitation of the civilian population in accordance with the conclusions of the Council and with the views of this European Parliament."
"However, I would request the political groups to put a little more thought into these matters. I very much dislike having to cut speakers off when there is not enough time for them to say what they want to say, when other Members who have been listed as speakers do not turn up."
"The debate is closed."
"Voting will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following two motions for resolutions:"
"(B4-0504/97) by Mr Bertens and Mr Fassa, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the situation in Congo/Brazzaville; -(B4-0536/97) by Mr Hory and Mr Pradier, on behalf of the ARE Group, on the critical situation in Congo/Brazzaville."
"Mr President, just a few weeks ago, before Mr Kabila was sworn in, Brazzaville was a haven of peace."
"The arrival of ragged refugees and all kinds of traffickers and former soldiers on the run led to instability."
"In the last few days the city has seen horrors."
"Heavy arms have been used in conflicts that have already claimed thousands of victims."
"The situation facing Europeans there is especially alarming and it is very difficult to repatriate them."
"European women have been raped and aid workers' houses set on fire."
"On the eve of the presidential elections, everything must be done to stop these clashes turning into ethnic cleansing."
"Only the regular holding of elections can guarantee the legitimacy needed by the next head of State and enable the country to recover stbility."
"The spectre of 1993 is hovering."
"Remember what happened."
"Similar violence led to some 2000 deaths."
"Let us hope that the international mediation offered by President Bongo of Gabon will succeed in bringing an end to the hostilities."
"A boomerang effect towards Kinshasa cannot be ruled out."
"We must stop a Balkanization into mini-regions and mini-tribes from igniting the whole country and even spreading across the whole of central Africa."
"Mr President, I obviously support the compromise motion put before the European Parliament by the radicals and liberals on the Congo crisis."
"I should, however, like to draw your attention to an amendment that I have tabled, asking European countries to abstain from any military intervention in Brazzaville until they receive a mandate to do so from the European Union or the United Nations, except strictly for the purpose of ensuring the safety of their nationals."
"Once again, France is to blame today in Congo, as it was in the case of Rwanda, Zaire, Central Africa, Niger and, unfortunately, as it probably will be in other African countries in the future."
"The discredit in which France has placed itself by its imperial neo-colonial policy is such that even its best intentions are now suspect."
"In this case, it seems that a French oil company armed the Congolese militia during the first clashes in Brazzaville just after the parliamentary elections."
"The same company would appear to be playing a role now among the various heads of factions."
"France has nothing better to offer the Congolese authorities than to apply the so-called 'limited sovereignty' doctrine."
"According to French expatriates, the French embassy is more concerned with political influences in this crisis than the safety of its own nationals living in Brazzaville."
"This must stop."
"It is time for France to work out a new policy instead of this disastrous one, which has been disastrous even for its own interests."
"I think that the wisest thing for my country to do would be to give up most of its bilateral cooperation and put its human, technical and financial development aid resources at the disposal of the European Union."
"As for military intervention in Africa, it should only take place as part of mandates delivered by the United Nations to the European Union with the agreement of the OAU."
"That is the meaning of my amendment."
"Mr President, a very brief statement to stress that the Socialist group supports this motion for a resolution and the wording of the joint resolution and would draw attention to the point asking the parties to respect the implementation of the cease-fire, stressing the efforts by the President of Gabon and his proposal; on the other hand we for our part shall not be voting for the proposal just put to us by the previous speaker, because we believe that any military intervention in this framework should be in conjunction with a United Nations mandate and we shall therefore not be voting for this amendment."
"But as spokesman in this case for the Socialist group, I should like to express our overall support for the joint motion for a resolution."
"Mr President, once again we have tens of thousands of deaths to lament in Congo/Brazzaville, and here we are discussing the conflict."
"What I wonder is whether we could not conduct the sort of active policy that would prevent these hostilities and these deaths."
"During the past six days all hell has been let loose in a country we once regarded as exemplary because its President, who himself initiated the democratization process in 1989, was peacefully voted out of office in 1992."
"And now, ahead of the presidential elections scheduled for 27 July, new conflicts are erupting."
"Would it not have made sense, given that a conflict had been brewing since 1992 and that we were aware of the existence of private armies, to have used our trade relations to exert political pressure during the intervening period so that such horrific occurrences could not have taken place?"
"Once hostilities have broken out, the dispatching of troops to bring out French people and other Europeans may be important to those people but it does nothing to resolve the conflict and always happens too late."
"Let us pursue peace by means of preventive nonmilitary action and provide adequate funding for that purpose instead of constantly cutting our development budget."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are some lessons to be learned from the dramatic situation in Congo at this moment."
"If we refer to the work of a world-renowned expert, Professor Bernard Lugan, we can see just how wrong we were to neglect a vital reality, i.e. that our political regime, parliamentary democracy, may have considerable merits but it is a very serious error to try and impose it artificially on African situations and, generally speaking, on to peoples who are different in terms of culture or civilisation."
"These African realities are essentially ethnic in Congo."
"There are 54 main tribes, divided into three groups: the Mbochis in the north, 13 % of the population, whose current leader is the former President, Denis Sassou N'Guesso; the TekÃ©s in the centre, the Kongos and Bakongos in the south, 52 % of the population, represented in their sub-groups by President Pascal Lissouba."
"The latter are divided among three States: Congo, Zaire and Angola."
"Each group or sub-group has a stake in the capital and their representatives will only risk going there if they are accompanied and protected by their own militia."
"That is what led to the current situation."
"In passing we should remember - and this is the third lesson - that the racism that we are always hearing about in the European Parliament is a reality found throughout the world."
"My proof is the number of rapes, mostly affecting people involved in mixed marriages: Europeans who married Africans and Africans who married European women."
"The fourth point is that independence in the framework of colonial era borders - borders seen as inviolable - the major legal and political principle that presided over decolonization - is directly in contradiction with the right of people's self-determination."
"Western countries have never accepted that contradiction and we are now seeing its dramatic effects."
"How can we not mention the strange influence of the United States in this part of the world - aimed without doubt at getting rid of French influence?"
"We have seen the effects in Zaire where a genuine genocide has taken place while the United Nations stood idly by - applying what is now called good universal conscience."
"We also note the influence of multinationals that finance the militia."
"There will be no solution or lasting peace unless we separate the fighters, which is possible in Congo."
"I also hope that the arbitration of Gabon's President Omar Bongo, one of Africa's wise men, will bring an end to the conflict between Mr Pascal Lissouba and his adversaries."
"Mr President, the tragic situation in Congo-Brazzaville is reminiscent of that in the neighbouring Congo, formerly Zaire, where the hopes for peace that were vested in Laurent Kabila by the European Community now seem to be evaporating, in view of the atrocities being perpetrated against defenceless, innocent people."
"The same events will probably unfold in Brazzaville: there too, huge economic interests are at stake, which the local population is unable to exploit and which will no doubt be bought up by foreign countries."
"Clearly, Africa is falling apart, because its artificial division into states and statelets, the legacy of the colonial and post-colonial period, has become untenable."
"Ancient tribal identities are resurfacing, and in particular the African ruling classes are taking power to satisfy their personal ambitions, rather than for the good of the populations they are supposedly governing."
"Therefore, if Europe wishes to be credible, it must seriously rethink its entire policy towards the African continent."
"Mr President, the Commission shares the serious concerns expressed in the motion on the tragic events in Brazzaville and their consequences on political stability and the economic and social situation of Congo and the whole region."
"It considers that only a negotiated settlement can gradually restore civil peace and enable the presidential elections to be held, so that the institutions can function normally again."
"That is why we are fully supporting the mediation undertaken by the Gabonese Presdient, and the talks under the aegis of the mayor of Brazzaville, Mr Kolelas."
"The head of the delegation is still in the city."
"He is in permanent contact with the Union's ambassadors in the country and I think that we are helping to ease the mediation referred to in the motion for a resolution."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"(B4-0473/97) by Mr Eisma and others, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the conservation of the tiger and the role of the parties to CITES; -(B4-0478/97) by Mrs van Putten, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the resolution on CITES - implementation in the European Union; -(B4-0479/97)by Mrs Pollack, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the conservation of the tiger and the role of the parties to CITES; -(B4-0506/97) by Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, on behalf of the V Group, on international trade in endangered species; -(B4-0516/97) by Mr Weber, on behalf of the ARE Group, on the international trade in wild species of flora and fauna; -(B4-0532/97) by Mrs van Bladel and others, on behalf of the UPE Group, on the trade in ivory; -(B4-0545/97) by Mrs GonzÃ¡lez Alvarez and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the international trade in wild species of fauna and flora; -(B4-0557/97) by Mr Pimenta and others, on behalf of the PPE Group, on the conservation of the tiger and the role of the parties to CITES."
"Mr President, the absence of some Members shows how extremely difficult it is for Parliament to function in Strasbourg."
"The Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species has already begun its deliberations, and so it is rather late in the day for us to seek to lay down some of Parliament's views, but I trust that the services will ensure that our views are forwarded very speedily to the negotiating team in Harare, since they are actually working on it at the moment."
"Some speakers will no doubt raise many important issues, some of which are referred to in the compromise text."
"Many, such as the position of elephants and the trade in ivory, are extremely complex, and there are divided points of view amongst not only affected countries but also the NGOs and other expert groups."
"Because of widespread corruption and the continuation of the illegal ivory trade, we feel it is still best to maintain the status quo for the elephant."
"I wish to concentrate on tigers, because these magnificent animals are on the brink of extinction and a good number of those which remain are in India, a country with which I am connected as chairperson of the Delegation for relations with the countries of South Asia."
"I know that NGOs, such as WWF, work closely with the Indian Government to help with tiger conservation work."
"But, clearly, the most dramatic short-term threat to the survival of the species is the illegal hunting of tigers for trade in body parts, largely for the Asian medicine market, and the low level of grassroots support for wildlife conservation in India, despite very laudable efforts by the government in its project 'Tiger' ."
"It is the responsibility of all the Parties to CITES to work together to stop the illegal trade in tigers and their parts and, for that matter, parts of other endangered species as well."
"First, we need the CITES parties (and I wonder why Ireland is not a party to this) to adopt legislation to protect parts, products, derivatives and subspecies of tigers."
"Second, we need very importantly to support public information campaigns in each and every one of the CITES partner countries."
"Third, we need to ensure effective implementation of legislation - and this is really the crunch about CITES."
"There are some very laudable things to be done there but if we do not have implementation - much as with the rest of European Union legislation - and if there is no effective legislation, nothing happens and species and habitats continue to decline worldwide."
"This is really the most crucial, basic issue in attempting to stamp out the illegal trade in parts and products of endangered species and therefore in discouraging the poaching which is so valuable to very many impoverished people in some of the countries involved."
"Training of customs agents and exchanges of information so as to help them recognize illegal products is essential, and the European Union countries can all help with the technical assistance needed in less-developed countries."
"Time is short, endangered species are exactly that - endangered species - and time is running out for them."
"Time is running out for habitats and for the biodiversity of this planet."
"Everyone must pull together in CITES, and I hope Parliament will support the compromise text."
"Mr President, ever since its entry into force in 1975, the Washington Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species has proved to be a valuable instrument, indeed the only one based on ecological rather than commercial criteria to have had a positive effect."
"Nevertheless, it has to be said that there are limits to the implementation of CITES: illegal trade is still very widespread and is valued at USD 3 to 5 billion annually; not even Europe, unfortunately, has always been beyond reproach in its implementation of the Convention."
"The danger now is that the measures protecting certain endangered species will be relaxed: at the current tenth Conference of the Parties in Harare, various proposals are under discussion with a view to downlisting certain populations of disputed species."
"Such a move could lead to a revival of international trade and an increase in the poaching of these species."
"I would draw particular attention to the problem of the elephant population in Africa and the risk of a return to the illegal trade in ivory, as well as the problem of the white rhino and the type of trade connected with it, above all for the production of medicines in Asia. This issue ties in partly with that of tiger hunting, to which the previous speaker referred."
"Other species are at risk too: the vicuÃ±a in Peru, Argentina and Bolivia; the whale, following a proposal from Norway and Japan; and the Caretta turtle, in view of a request from Cuba."
"In general terms, therefore, there is a very real danger that the situation of some endangered species will be called into question."
"It is true that in some cases, thanks to CITES, there has been an increase in the population of certain species, but it is also true that if downlisting under the Convention were to be accepted, this would inevitably give a boost to illegal trade and the situation could become untenable."
"That is why the approach being proposed by France - to use confiscated specimens to safeguard the artistic or cultural heritage - must be rejected, as must Namibia's call for a relaxation of the criteria."
"All the European countries and the Union must speak with one voice at this tenth Conference."
"Mr President, the subject we are discussing is so completely self-evident that there is really no need for me to speak at length about it."
"Human progress is a threat to the glory of creation, and despite all the agreements on saving what is under threat, magnificent animals such as elephants and tigers are still in terrible jeopardy."
"That is why I welcome the fact that, just as the Zimbabwe conference on protecting these endangered species is taking place, the European Parliament should also make it clear that we, the representatives of the nations of Europe, are determined to save the world's fauna for our children."
"My group therefore warmly supports this resolution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the PPE Group supports the joint resolution."
"I believe it is balanced and addresses the important issues."
"I only have two comments to make."
"Point 4 refers to the situation of the African elephant and proposes that acceptable action be taken to avoid an excessive degree of conflict between the interests of man and those of elephants."
"I believe this certainly merits consideration, because the African States, as we know, are calling for downlisting of the African elephant, which they regard as a threat to themselves."
"But we must also ensure that animals are properly protected."
"That is perhaps a task for the European Union in the context of the development cooperation in which it engages with a view to providing a basis for human subsistence."
"I should just like to mention very briefly that the European Parliament is saying once again that products from endangered species must not be used under any circumstances in dubious medicines of whatever description. We also did that in the Lannoye report, and it is a message we should reaffirm."
"I would request Members to get here in time so that they do not lose their place, because I cannot always be sure that I will be able to give them the floor out of turn."
"I realize that Members have many things to do, but the programme of the House cannot be changed to accommodate Members' personal timetables."
"Mr President, the tiger is threatened with extinction. Three of the eight species have been eradicated over the last 50 years, while those remaining have declined alarmingly over the last five years, especially in India, where two thirds of the tigers in existence are to be found."
"This very dramatic development has resulted not just from the destruction of the natural environment, but also from the illegal trade in tiger products, which is actually increasing at an alarming rate."
"China in particular is the largest producer and consumer of the traditional medicines in which tiger products are used."
"Almost every day, one more tiger is lost, processed into supposedly curative powders and pills."
"However, this is also a highly lucrative trade and one which we need to combat."
"As Mrs Pollack said, the CITES conference is being held this week in Harare, which is why this is the perfect time to raise the issue of the survival of the tiger."
"I should like to take this opportunity to urge the European delegation most strongly to fight for the tiger's survival, and I would also call on the other CITES countries to ban all trade in tiger products and to take extra measures to save the tiger from extinction in this unparalleled way."
"Mr President, the entry into force on 1 June of Council Regulation No 338/97, which goes beyond the scope of CITES, is a clear illustration of the Community's efforts to that effect."
"The Conference of Parties to CITES, currently being held in Harare, is attended by all Member States that are party to the Convention and the Commission is actively involved in the establishment of common positions in the spirit of the new regulation, on both precautionary and sustainable use principles."
"These will be reflected in the positions on proposals with regard to the African elephant, the white rhino, tigers and whales, and many other important issues before the Conference of the Parties."
"However, since the discussions in Harare have just started, the Commission is not yet in a position to provide definitive answers on the final outcome of the proposals under discussion."
"We support the resolution."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"As a lover of music like myself you would have been very pleased with the entertainment which was provided this afternoon in the foyer of the Palais."
"Further entertainment in the Festival of Music will be held in Orangerie Concert Hall tonight starting at 8.30 p.m."
"I hope and trust that all Members and all members of staff will make every effort to attend."
"Mr President, I just wanted to point out that this morning my voting card was not in my place and my neighbour's was there instead."
"I asked for a replacement card but I am not sure whether I voted with my card or my neighbour's."
"I wanted to make that public but of course the necessary checks should be made when the voting lists are available."
"You were right to make it clear publicly."
"These errors can happen."
"We will make sure that the services check that the votes are being recorded properly."
"VOTES (continuation)"
"The Commission proposal to set up a voluntary service to involve young people in collective interest activities in the Union or a non-Community country possibly reflects a good intention but seems to be founded on no legal basis in the Treaty."
"Article 126, the only article mentioned in the recitals of the proposal for a decision, only concerns questions linked to education and the education system."
"We have been told that this poses no problem since all the Member States support the project."
"We find this practice alarming - it is a current practice in Brussels, according to which the Treaty is put in the cupboard as soon as the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament agree not to apply it."
"The Treaty is the European Union's law."
"It has been ratified by its peoples."
"If we do not want to apply it, we should ask them to amend it."
"But in any case it is intolerable to proceed in this way."
"By the way, this situation shows just how much we in Europe lack genuine controls over the respect of subsidiarity that are sufficiently strong and independent to put an end to such deviations."
"Unfortunately the IGC has not made any convincing proposals on this score."
"It is anecdotal that the European Parliament, at the proposal of the rapporteur, Mrs Fontaine, has not hesitated to deal with this apparently marginal question and to try and have several of its hobby horses adopted."
"It has voted for amendments asking for a European status of young voluntary workers, with a uniform social system; the possibility of joining the European voluntary service in national services and to give it a 'transnational dimension' ; to open this European service up to young people from non-Community countries and, of course, to increase the budgetary credits earmarked for the project."
". (DA) There is a long and sound tradition in Denmark of voluntary work among people of all age groups, not just young people, although the level of activity is significantly higher in this section of the population."
"Denmark is often called the 'land of organizations' . Indeed, in a cross-section of the Danish population, every single individual is a member of one or other organization, be it a political party, a youth organization, the scouting movement or a residents' association."
"All these people work to improve the conditions of their members and others sympathetic to their cause."
"But only a minority seek to promote an awareness of 'European identity' or real 'European citizenship' , which are referred to repeatedly in the Fontaine report."
"We question whether there is such a thing as a 'European identity' or 'European citizenship' ."
"We take exception to this form of EU propaganda among young people or the population as a whole."
"We also do not think that there is a need for a certificate with a 'European quality seal' or a 'European statute' for young volunteers."
"The area of youth policy is not mentioned in the Maastricht Treaty, and that is how it should remain."
"We do not think it would serve any purpose to try to create a 'European youth policy' such as is advocated in the report."
"We also think that it would be irresponsible to send young people to third countries, as is being proposed."
"There are often very difficult circumstances in third countries, and we do not think young people are really up to handling such assignments."
"The above considerations are the reasons why we vote against the Fontaine report on a European voluntary service for young people."
"The idea of sending thousands of young Europeans into a Member State, for a sufficiently long period for it to be effective, in order to carry out a given task, to be there and be useful, turns this programme, far more than traditional youth exchanges, into a genuine tool of citizenship."
"It opens up new prospects for our youth and is the proof that European construction is all the result of youth mobility, young people's desire to be citizens, their attachment to knowledge of other people."
"I pay tribute to edith Cresson who has defended this project with resolve, as she rightly thinks that it is vital for the Union and for European citizenship!"
"I also wish to thank Nicole Fontaine, who has become our spokesperson on this subject and has always been a leading defender of European youth, banking on young people to speed up the construction process."
"No vote should be missing when we come to vote on a European voluntary service!"
"We are banking on youth."
"Such great hopes have arisen or will arise from our young people."
"Let us not disappoint them!"
"Let us be bold for those who will live in and improve the Europe that we are building for them today!"
"Finally, I wish to take this opportunity to lend my support to all requests to increase spending on the Socrates programme."
"Before telling you how highly I think of Mrs Fontaine's excellent report, I should like to remind you of the role that the European Parliament has always played in promoting all that concerns youth policies."
"It has always done all it could to involve young people in Union life and increase their opportunities on offer at European level."
"It is therefore quite logical that it should have supported the Cresson initiative to relaunch the idea of a European voluntary service of young people by creating, in 1996, a new budgetary line B3-1011 designed to fund this action."
"That being so, I wish to congratulate Mrs Fontaine who has produced work of high quality."
"This report establishes the bases of a new participation by young people in European citizenship."
"Thanks to the voluntary service, all young people aged 18-25 years - and sometimes as old as 29 - will be able to take part in public utility actions across the Union."
"It is a major programme, 1998-2002, and has aroused great enthusiasm among our young people - they should not be disappointed."
"It is also a new type of programme in that it enables young people not only to be received in host countries but also to be active there and be of use."
"The presence of 'personalized tutors' in the host countries will ensure that the young person feels useful and responsible for his or her actions."
"There are still many problems to be worked out (taxation, social welfare, etc) but the Commission and the Member States are trying to find solutions."
"The structure of the programme is highly decentralized, rightly so if we are to encourage the necessary flexibility on the ground."
"That is why I am asking you, like me, to vote for this report with the amendments tabled by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, especially the amendment on the credits granted for the programme."
"We are asking for 80 million ECU for the period 1998-99."
"This is in keeping with the financial perspectives and it is very low in terms of the benefit for young people involved."
"Let us not be stingy over an action that mobilizes young people and gives them a strong feeling of European citizenship."
"The European Voluntary Service may be a valuable instrument for consolidating a more human and more competitive Europe - two dimensions which, provided they go together, will define a new Europe."
"More human because of the bonds it creates between young people of different cultures and more competitive because it brings more training which means that we more active, better informed, involved and active citizens."
"But it will constitute such an instrument only if it is not deflected from its objectives."
"Such deflection might arise because of a poor selection process, mismatching of young people and projects, failure to follow up the voluntary experience in order to channel that experience plus the benefit it has brought to the young people and - last but not least - because of a misunderstanding on the part of national governments of the role of Voluntary Service."
"I think that the Voluntary Service should be targeted on long-term projects so that the experience is sufficiently impressive and lasting."
"I hope that the Member States will accept the commitment to increase this programme exponentially by a minimum of 10 % per annum in order to guarantee that in a few years' time all young people between 18 and 25 shall have access to the Voluntary Service which will naturally turn them into European citizens."
"I must congratulate Mrs Nicole Fontaine on her report on the Commission's proposal for a European voluntary service for young people, a Community action programme."
"Of course, it should be noted that this Community initiative has already enabled several hundred young Europeans to enjoy this experience, a practical act of European citizenship."
"In this context, the Commission's proposal aimed at making the programme more ambitious is an interesting one."
"It was nevertheless vital, as our rapporteur rightly emphasized, to strengthen and broaden participation in the programme."
"That is why I fully approve of the proposals aimed at increasing spending on the first two years of implementation of the programme and lifting obstacles to the widest possible participation by young people."
"The Member States should take the necessary measures to make their national civilian service programmes compatible with this voluntary scheme."
"This programme should make it possible for as many young people as possible to have an experience of general interest in another Member State or outside the European Union, undoubtedly contributing to making Europe more practical for the younger generations."
"Plooij-Van Gorsel report (A4-0153/97)"
"The European ICT industry offers great potential for employment and for the improvement of democracy."
"We therefore welcome the initiative report produced by the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, in which both the European Union and the Member States are called upon to take the necessary legislative measures to strengthen free market forces as soon as possible."
"The development of information and communications technology must not be held back by a lack of legal security."
"Marset Campos report (A4-0170/97)"
". (DA) It is important to bring about a sustainable development model in the European Union - both in order to increase employment and to create attractive job opportunities."
"So it is all the more regrettable that we could not get a report which realistically balances the need for a solution to the Union's internal social and environmental problems, on the one hand, with the increased demands of competition in the light of industrial globalization on the other hand."
"In his report the rapporteur focuses on an excessively one-sided model and, in view of that, I am obliged to vote against the report."
"Pimenta report (A4-0187/97)"
"Mr President, on several occasions we have debated a 1991 regulation on banning the imports of furs of animals hunted using leg-traps - 13 animal species."
"Since 1 January 1996, this ban should have been in force as it is in 80 countries."
"Sixteen months have now gone by and those furs are still being imported."
"An international agreement was signed with Canada and Russia - the United States refused - to set acceptable standards for trapping, i.e. organized torture."
"In other words ripped tendons, ligaments and tissues are all acceptable."
"This agreement even sets acceptable periods for animals to fall into a coma, 30 seconds on average, but as long as 120 seconds for martens and sable or 45 seconds for ermine, i.e. instead of banning torture, we are regulating it, as long as we trap animals in enclosures with a chronometer to measure these times."
"That is all without sanctions since the agreements signed with Russia and Canada provides for no sanctions for years and leg-traps will only be banned as of 2005."
"Mr President, I end here: this unspeakable standardized barbarity is allowed in the name of the Inuits, or Indians."
"But it seems that these Inuits live in sumptuous houses on the west coast or the east coast, or in Amsterdam, or in Paris, or in Tel Aviv. One of the miracles of leg-traps is that the whole planet is inhabited by Inuits."
". (DA) We have voted to call on the Commission and the Council to reject the proposed agreement and implement the import ban."
"The leghold trap is a cruel method of trapping and should be abolished."
"However, we are not as sceptical as the rapporteur with regard to the exemptions included in the agreement to safeguard the cultural heritage of indigenous peoples."
"We have been worried throughout that a very general ban would hit imports of pelts from animals not caught with leghold traps, and that such a ban would deprive indigenous populations of their livelihood and leave them dependent on social security."
"It is important to warn against hypocrisy in this affair, and unfortunately the report does not give any weight to this."
"The EU is itself the area of the world in which most leghold traps are used."
"Here we only trap rats and water voles, rather than wild animals with attractive pelts."
"It is as though we are only against this method of trapping for animals whose furs we would like to wrap ourselves in, whereas we are indifferent to the suffering of animals if they are classed as vermin."
". (DA) Mr Carlos Pimenta is asking us to reject the international agreement on standards for humane trapping."
"However, the analysis in Mr Pimenta's report contains several factual errors which are misleading."
"How can we draft regulations in Parliament based on reports that contain errors?"
"I will detail some of the factual errors and general problems arising in the Pimenta report."
"A quite fundamental aspect is that the rapporteur's analysis lacks an understanding of animal protection."
"1) The first problem is that the report does not refer to existing trapping standards in the EU or other countries."
"A comparison with the international agreement would otherwise show that existing standards are considerably less restrictive than those in the proposed agreement."
"2) A second problem is that the report neither undertakes an analysis of current trapping standards nor considers how many animals are trapped in the EU or in some of the other countries which are considering signing the agreement."
"Such an analysis would show that few animals are caught in leghold traps and that most are caught in killing traps."
"It would also show that, here in the Union, we trap between four and five million animals in traps for which there are no EU standards at all."
"It would indeed be an improvement if standards were introduced for these traps."
"3) And now the factual errors."
"Mr Carlos Pimenta completely overlooks the introduction of the following rules in the international agreement: Training and authorization of trappers."
"Requirements for daily trap inspections."
"The question of including selectivity."
"These measures already go further than the existing EU measures."
"The international agreement does not give greater consideration to trade than to animal welfare."
"On the contrary, it seeks to make trade subject to standards for animal welfare."
"Finally, we are asked to reject the international agreement because it is 'totally inadequate and ineffective' ."
"The rapporteur asks us in these terms to accept the current EU rules, even though they are much weaker than those in the international agreement."
"Similarly, he asks us to reject an agreement that will not be renegotiated!"
"We call that 'totally inadequate and ineffective' ."
"A European Parliament resolution to reject the international agreement will certainly not bring about any improvement in animal welfare."
"I have supported the rapporteur's call to reject this agreement between the EU, Canada and Russia on animal traps."
"Like many of my constituents, I am opposed to the cruel use of leghold traps."
"The fact that this agreement as it stands would allow for their use for at least another four years is therefore unacceptable."
"Equally, it would be wrong in my view to classify some types of leghold trap as 'humane' ."
"There is no requirement to inspect traps regularly, when opposition to their use centres around the cruelty of leaving animals trapped and in pain for long periods."
"Crucially, the USA has not agreed to endorse any such agreement, so any minimal standards would not even apply to the many animals trapped there."
"Finally, I support the report's call for an import ban to be imposed on pelts from 13 species caught in countries which do not use internationally agreed standards of trapping."
"Civilized countries should be judged by how they treat weaker species as well as by how they treat their human populations."
"EU role in sport"
"The next item is the report (A4-0197/97) by Mrs Pack, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, on the role of the European Union in the field of sport"
"Mr President, as you know, we had to postpone the debate until this evening, and so I hope that those people who gave their apologies for not being able to attend the sport debate this morning will be here now."
"We are talking today about sport in Europe, and the main reason why this subject has arisen is that a judgment delivered last year by the European Court of Justice, namely the Bosman ruling, caused a furore within the European Union, and so we thought we should put this subject on our agenda, since sport is simply regarded as an economic activity in Europe, whereas we really believe it to be very much more than that."
"There are grounds for suspecting that the European Union, while seeking through its information policy to portray itself as a Union of the people, might actually be highlighting issues that are of little interest to our citizens and disregarding the fact that sport is one of the topics which ought to be highlighted."
"Sport, after all, was drawing nations together before we founded the European Union, and so we should at least recognize the great significance of sport in Community life."
"We must bear in mind that sport in the European Union, besides undoubtedly being an economic activity, also plays a wider and very important role."
"Hundreds of millions of Europeans take part in sport through sports clubs or as individuals."
"There are tens of thousands of sports clubs, numerous associations and federations; there are sports movements, and the entire sporting community is essentially one of the great popular movements within the European Union."
"That is why sport, besides being economically significant, which we do not deny, is a major cultural and social factor too."
"Sport contributes 1.5 % to the gross domestic product, which naturally makes it an economic factor, so that in the context of the economic activity of the European Union it is classed as part of the service sector and must be treated as such."
"But in my opinion the very fact that a huge number of people are interested in sport must make us talk more about sport in the European Union too and accord it higher priority."
"Do not get me wrong here; the European Commission does practise this, but it is more inclined to use sport as a means to a specific end - in a campaign to promote tolerance or in the fight against drug abuse."
"It also uses sport to promote public health, and I believe we should take that aspect into consideration by rectifying a long-standing omission and giving sport a legal basis in the Treaty, which is under negotiation again at the present time."
"Every year the Commission comes to this Parliament with its budget, and we always find an empty line there."
"Nothing is allocated to sport, because, as the Commission invariably has to tell us, there is no legal basis for it."
"We should therefore like to create a legal basis, so that we no longer have to keep trying every year to bring forward new arguments for the inclusion in the budget of resources for sport."
"It is, of course, a very small percentage of the budget that is ultimately spent on sport, but it is spent to good effect in the Eurathlon programme and in the programme to develop sport for the disabled under the same budget entry."
"I believe the Council in Amsterdam should recognize that."
"That is why sport is on today's agenda, so that Parliament can express its wish to have sport included somewhere in the Amsterdam Treaty, the successor treaty to Maastricht, perhaps in a paragraph which could most appropriately be added to Article 128 on culture."
"If that were not possible, I should be content to see it appended as a protocol."
"That too would be enough to give it a legal basis."
"But we also had another reason for producing this report."
"We wanted to ensure that major sporting events are not televised exclusively by pay TV channels in future."
"I am glad to say that this wish has been anticipated in the Directive on television without frontiers."
"However, we hope and expect that the national lists of important sporting events which the Directive requires will be drawn up in collaboration with the sports governing bodies, for they are the best advisers in that domain."
"We also expect the Commission to get down at last to forming a task force in which the 18 or 20 directorates-general with responsibilities in the realm of sport can pool their efforts, since this would undoubtedly be a more efficient way of operating."
"When all is said and done, we do not seek to supplant the sports governing bodies or the national governments in their specific fields of activity."
"We only wish to introduce an additional European dimension in areas where we can provide the sort of support that cannot be provided nationally."
"I believe we are faithfully following the path of subsidiarity here, and I hope that we shall all do our best to ensure that this report carries the weight of a powerful parliamentary endorsement, not least so that our wish to have sport included in the Treaty is heard in Amsterdam."
"It would send a signal to the people of our countries that the idea of 'citizens first' is not just a slogan connected in some way to the introduction of the euro but is a general principle that can be seen in operation in the sporting domain too."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although sport plays an important part in the lives of European citizens, the EU has paid it scant attention in the past."
"That makes the present discussion by the European Parliament on the role of the EU in sport all the more important, and I congratulate my honourable colleague Doris Pack on her excellent report."
"Since the Bosman ruling by the European Court of Justice in December 1995, sport has been a major topic of public debate."
"In today's report, which I fully endorse and to which I have also tabled a few amendments as the shadow rapporteur, the place of sport as a responsibility of society in its entirety receives particular emphasis, for sport is a significant social phenomenon."
"With its educational, democratic, cultural, social, integrative and health-promoting aspects, it has an enormous beneficial impact on our daily lives."
"Sporting events and the men and women who take part in them captivate millions in stadia and on television screens and motivate people to copy their idols and engage in sport."
"In my small country alone, for example, two million people - one-quarter of the entire population - are members of sports clubs, which number 14, 000."
"It is therefore insufficient to consider the economic aspect alone without looking at sport in its totality; such a restricted view also creates undesirable side-effects, such as a lack of incentive to nurture young players because of the abolition of transfer fees, which was an unfortunate consequence of the Bosman ruling."
"I fully support Doris Pack's three main demands: firstly, the call to the current Intergovernmental Conference to include an explicit reference to sport in Article 128 of the EU Treaty; secondly, the appeal to the Commission to set up a task force on sport, so that the responsibilities for sport, which are currently divided among 18 directorsgeneral, I believe, can be concentrated in one body; and thirdly, the request for the production of a Green Paper, after consultation with all the main sports organizations, with a view to the formulation of an EU action plan on sport."
"I also attach importance to the universal right of citizens to receive information, which means that major sporting events must not be restricted to pay TV but should be receivable in unencrypted form by all viewers; it is also important that the sports governing bodies should help to draw up the list of such events."
"Another important feature of the report is its special emphasis on school sport, youth sport and women's sport, reflecting the fact that everyone, and particularly those from poorer and disadvantaged sections of the population, should have the right to engage actively in sport."
"One of the conditions for this is a good training system for PE teachers and sports coaches."
"Finally, the organization of a European Year of Sport would underline the importance of sport to the people of Europe."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Pack for her important report."
"It is hard to carry out pioneering work which patently seeks to remedy omissions in a particular area of EU legislation."
"Mrs Pack has in my opinion drawn up a balanced report which I have been able to be actively involved in preparing."
"The lack of an official status for sport in Union legislation is an intolerable omission."
"Is it feared that sport will take away EU resources, for example from other cultural activities?"
"I am disappointed that the Intergovernmental Conference which is now drawing to a close will not be making any changes to the status of sport in Union legislation."
"I am surprised at the civil servants' and ministers' attitude."
"Sport has a really significant multiplier effect - an effect on health as well as social, cultural and the economic effect."
"A great deal of anti-drug work is also carried on through sport."
"The economic significance of sport, for example on the single market or indeed in health care, is impossible even to estimate."
"Community standards influence sporting activities in innumerable ways, but the sports world is not able to influence decisions."
"This is an absurd situation, because sport's legislative status contrasts crassly with its position in society."
"All the Union's decision-making and legislation affects sports."
"It over-arches sports legislation."
"However, sports organizations and sports clubs are not consulted in the preparatory stages about legislation which affects them."
"Sport has to adapt to laws and guidelines drawn up by people who do not understand sport."
"I do not understand this way of going about things."
"Young people who practise sports are also unable to take part in any EU programme, because sport has no status."
"Sport is like a dirty word for the Union."
"Of course young people who practice sports are just as valuable as those who draw or play music, for example, or do they have to pretend to be students or recorder players in order to get on to national programmes promoting freedom of movement?"
"Amateur sports clubs do a lot of good voluntary youth work which has a wide range of positive effects on society."
"It is, however, impossible to get any significant Union support for this youth work."
"Conversely, other youth organizations, which are not sports organizations but do exactly the same type of work, do receive support."
"The annual budget of ECU 3 m for Eurathlon is ridiculously small."
"Without the active promotion of Parliament it would have been even smaller, for which we have to thank the Budget Committee and the Culture Committee."
"Sport must be given the status it deserves in the Union, in a limited way, but so that sporting organizations and clubs are involved at the preparatory stage of legislation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, Giampiero Boniperti, who is unable to be present in the House today."
"As we all know, sport plays a key role in the lives of our citizens."
"Sport should be thought of not merely as an opportunity for healthy competition; it also contributes towards social integration and personal development in young people, preventing them from being at a social disadvantage."
"Those who have practised sport have developed a fighting spirit and a capacity for sacrifice, as well as self-respect and respect for others: all qualities which build a person's character and help him to progress through life."
"When I say that it is a good thing for a youngster to learn to kick a ball, so as then to be able to kick drugs, what I mean is this: school and sport should go hand in hand, since both are essential to a young person's growth."
"Responsible adults, administrators and politicians are duty-bound to find ways of pursuing this social aim, which is essential to our way of life."
"There is also a need to train specialist educators who can help young people from primary school onwards to realize their potential and ambitions."
"Employment, jobs, the single currency, racism, community life and other difficult issues are doubtless of the greatest importance."
"Sport, however, must not be placed last on the school curriculum."
"Countries like the United States, the United Kingdom and others have taught us what a formative effect sport can have on young people."
"A youngster's identity can be forged in national sports federations, based on the common denominator of a European treaty on sport."
"Football is now taught as a school subject in the UK."
"An amendment was tabled and adopted a short while ago calling for sport to be incorporated into the Maastricht Treaty, with particular reference to general education, vocational training and employment."
"The national federations must therefore draw up a blueprint for a sports movement at EU level, since only by overcoming national boundaries will it be possible to achieve a single, unifying agreement."
"There are various national languages in Europe, but as Mr Samaranch, President of the International Olympic Committee, puts it, only one language is truly international: that of sport."
"I read in an Italian newspaper the statement made by Mrs Bouffet, the new Minister for Youth and Sport in the Jospin government."
"As the mother of two children, she has taken an interest for many years in the problems of young people, especially those in troubled inner-city areas."
"She recently said: ' If our young people are sick, perhaps sport, as a source of healthy competition, can help bring them out of the labyrinth of despair' ."
"We each have our own political views, but as far as sport is concerned, all those views have a single common denominator."
"Mr Florio, excuse me if I sound pedantic but, according to the Rules, you are not allowed to deliver anyone else's speech in the House."
"So, the opening of your speech will say that your colleague would have said something along these lines."
"The record cannot show that this is a speech he would have made."
"Mr President, as Parliament's longest-standing rapporteur on sport, I am very pleased with the Pack report."
"On three occasions in the past, I have drafted resolutions on behalf of the Committee on Culture in which Parliament has called for a structural approach in the form of a European action programme on sport, and Mrs Pack has now repeated this urgent call in her excellent report."
"Commissioner Pinheiro, what on earth is the Commission doing?"
"Has it gone to sleep?"
"I know that the sport section of DG X has a few very good officials who have been working on documents for a long time now."
"So is there some kind of political problem?"
"Why is it that Parliament's calls over many years for a structural approach appear to have gone unanswered?"
"Mrs Pack, you have put sport back on the agenda, which is important."
"And who knows, there may yet be a lastminute Kohl-Kok alliance at the IGC to have sport included in the Amsterdam Treaty, which is what Parliament has long wished to see."
"Mrs Pack says 'I hope so' , and so do I. I sincerely hope that we are given a text that will serve as a legal basis for setting up European programmes, rather than as an escape clause so that top-class sport can avoid European rules."
"The Liberal Group agrees with the rapporteur's proposals, but there is one thing to which I would urge you to give special attention, since I feel that it tends to be overlooked."
"We need a structural approach to a chronic problem that causes great distress: the extremely poor relations between the world of sport and the Commission."
"Sport does not recognize the European Union, and the European Union does not recognize sport."
"That is the nub of the problem, and we cannot hope to make any progress with the sporting world until it is resolved."
"We can declare a European year of sport, we can set up a youth fund, we can organize an annual European sports forum - all very laudable gestures, but far too superficial to bridge the gap between sport and the European Union."
"Incomprehension and suspicion still prevail, and there are clashes between sports regulations and European legislation on a daily basis."
"That is why we need to give constructive dialogue top priority, and Bosman must surely have taught us all a lesson."
"This is where we see the effect of having no structural sports policy or approach, and the Commission's ad hoc tinkering will certainly not solve the problem."
"It is essential for the sporting world to be consulted about the impact of single market legislation on sports regulations."
"It must be made crystal clear how to deal with selection procedures, sponsorship agreements, championship competitions, drugs testing procedures, sanctions and so on."
"Sport and the EU must not be allowed to drift any further apart, and good agreements will always make both sides the winners."
"So, Commissioner, use this Green Paper as an opportunity to consult the sporting world in detail, and let us develop a structural approach and closer cooperation in this field."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank Mrs Pack for her tireless and valuable contributions to our parliamentary work on this and many other urgent and difficult subjects."
"Sport has always exercised a strong cohesive influence over young people and encouraged the development of positive values such as determination, courage, tolerance, loyalty and friendship."
"Until now, the European Union has taken an interest in sport solely as an economic activity, often overlooking its cultural and social dimension."
"However, it is essential to acknowledge the special and independent nature of the sports movement, and a start could be made by including an explicit reference to sport in Article 128 of the EU Treaty."
"A second very important point is the rapporteur's request that the Commission should set up a task force to look into the different aspects of sport, and draw up a green paper launching a comprehensive action plan."
"We fully endorse this request."
"We Greens also seek the support of Parliament for our amendment calling for the national and international federations to agree to comply with Directive 337/85 and its subsequent amendments concerning environmental impact assessments for major sporting events."
"Mr President, in the European Union sport has more than 100 million practitioners in thousands of clubs, and yet the European institutions still neglect it."
"It was therefore useful that the European Parliament should take the initiative to make proposals aimed at including sport in the new Treaty and I should like to thank Mrs Pack for her excellent report, rich in proposals which, I hope, will be taken on board by the Commission."
"Sport, by means of the fulfilment and balance that it can offer individuals, is an extremely important element."
"It accounts for 1.5 % of the GDP of the European Union and is a large source of jobs."
"The moral values that it vehicles are a very effective means of fighting violence, racism, delinquency; it is a school of tolerance, courage and civic awareness, and can help to integrate less favoured young people or those who have lost their way."
"But we cannot mention sport without a word on the Bosman judgment, especially on the broadcasting of sports events on the TV."
"We know that the 'Television without frontiers' directive made it possible to make considerable progress in terms of universal access to major sporting events."
"Through these questions, it is the often fragile border-line between professional and amateur sport that is at stake."
"We should therefore help the small clubs and less media-oriented sports."
"In that respect, it would be desirable to safeguard equal opportunities - which in sports competitions is called uncertainty of results - and to safeguard the financial independence of clubs - company sponsorship also has its limits."
"In these conditions, sport will no longer be the big unknown quantity in the European institutions."
"If we do not include a specific article in the Treaty, we might consider a clear mention of Article 128 on culture."
"That would give this field a minimal legal base, a specific budget, enough to coordinate and rationalise the various one-off initiatives that we have at present."
"Until then, the drafting of a Green Paper or even the setting up of a task force would also be welcome."
"Mr President, over 100 million Europeans currently take part in sporting activities, organized by tens of thousands of sports clubs belonging to associations and federations."
"The sports movement is one of the main forces bringing people together in the EU."
"We cannot ignore the fact that sport has become such a significant recreational activity that its implications transcend the social and cultural sectors and have a truly substantial impact on the economy."
"In our view, sport and culture, which have close links with each other, are two sides of the same coin and will be more highly valued if, as a result of pressure from us, an explicit and realistic reference to sport can be included in the text of the new EU Treaty."
"We feel that the appropriate place would be Article 128, relating to culture."
"The sporting world in general, and more specifically that of football, suffered a severe shock over the Bosman ruling, which caused such an uproar and upheaval that there are now serious difficulties affecting relations between clubs and above all the training of young players, as well as the very survival of thousands of amateur sports clubs."
"Sport, and in particular participatory sport, can be made accessible to our citizens and enabled to contribute to their well-being through an overall initiative covering all the measures to be carried out, with a single body being identified which groups together all the organizations currently devoted to sport: this would overcome the present fragmentation at European level."
"We are in favour of Mrs Pack's proposals and compliment her on her excellent work. We fully support her report."
"Mr President, Mrs Pack has produced a very good report, but as you know I always like to cause trouble here in the House, and I would draw your attention to two amendments I have tabled, one of which, I am at least honest enough to admit, does not have the support of my group."
"I have tabled these amendments because they are on a very topical issue."
"Everyone is calling for an article on sport to be included in the Treaty, which is of course an excellent idea."
"But I find it difficult to accept the reasons given by some people, who say that the Bosman ruling is making it impossible for sports clubs in Europe to promote youth sport."
"Let us be quite clear about this."
"Representatives of the Commission have produced research which shows that of the handsome profits made from transfer fees, from this noble form of human trade, not even 5 % goes to youth sport - not even 5 %!"
"Now, the logical consequence of the Bosman ruling should be to declare that state aid to professional clubs must be seen as a violation of Article 92 of the Treaty, particularly state aid to economic entities, because it cannot be justified and is simply a distortion of competition."
"I have tabled two other amendments which are supported by my group and a number of other people, calling for greater attention to be given to the way in which the Bosman ruling seems to be getting out of hand, and in particular the role of clubs which are taken over by private dealers and players."
"The Bosman ruling is generally bandied about and contracts are broken mid-season supposedly on the basis of it."
"It used to be the major sports clubs that bought and sold people, now it is the agents."
"Let us get together with the sports associations to work out rules to govern this which do not contravene Community law."
"I would urge you to think again about these amendments."
"I know that you are not in favour of them, Mrs Pack, but they are the logical consequence of Articles 2, 48 and 92 of the Treaty."
"Mr President, Mrs Pack not only organized an excellent hearing on the subject of sport, but she has also produced an excellent report for us to discuss today."
"If the Council of Ministers and the Members of the Commission are really serious about creating the people's Europe that they are always talking about, then they should act on the recommendations contained in Mrs Pack's report as soon as possible."
"The fact is that sport affects every aspect of people's lives: culture, health, recreation, nutrition, integration, minorities and education."
"In education, however, sport has generally fallen victim to the need for cutbacks in recent times and has disappeared from the curriculum."
"What do we want?"
"We actually want two things."
"Firstly, legitimacy, in other words a legal basis produced by including sport in the Treaty."
"And, secondly, an adequate budget for funding the most important aspects of Europe's approach to sport."
"Finally, we need to show that Parliament too takes sport seriously."
"I was glad to hear that all my colleagues are in favour of Mrs Pack's proposal, and I therefore hope that the Bureau will accede to the request it is shortly to receive for the name of the committee of which I am chairman to be changed to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport."
"Mr President, let me first of all offer my sincere congratulations to Mrs Pack on a truly excellent report."
"Allow me, as a scholar of sport and a former Austrian national coach, to make my observations on European sport from a quite specific perspective."
"The importance of sport has hitherto been totally underestimated in the EU; on the rare occasions it is ever mentioned, it is considered as a purely economic factor."
"Sport has no legal basis at all in the EU; there are no explicit references to sport in any article of the Treaties."
"And yet sport has many very important functions to perform in today's society."
"There is scarcely any other domain of activity that is so capable of motivating young people to make good use of their leisure time and of reintegrating marginalized groups into society through meaningful activity."
"It encourages elderly people to keep themselves physically fit."
"So the importance of sport lies both in its enormous impact as an instrument of preventive medicine and above all in its great sociocultural potential."
"We in the Freedom Party of Austria are therefore entirely in agreement with the rapporteur that sport should be incorporated into Article 128 without delay as tangible evidence of its significance."
"Lastly, sport is also extremely important as a means of international understanding when it takes the form of fair and sporting contests with other countries, when people take pride in representing and supporting their own nations without letting that pride spill over into senseless and excessive nationalism."
"Sport is an international language."
"Sport binds people together!"
"Sport is a celebration of what we have in common, not of our differences."
"Sport can therefore do more to foster mutual understanding than many an artificially conceived European project."
"We should not therefore regard sport as a primarily economic activity but as an essential social and cultural contribution to international understanding, and we should do all we can to promote it within the strict bounds of the subsidiarity principle."
"Mr President, I have always regarded it as one of the privileges of being a Member of this Parliament to work alongside Mrs Pack."
"In English we would say she is a human dynamo."
"To make an awful English pun, I would say that this report is 'packed' full with her energy and commitment."
"I totally back the call to include a reference to sport in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Maastricht recognizes the significance of culture in clause 128 but for millions of Europeans sport is more important."
"Next month in Portsmouth, my constituency, I am attending the opening of the Special Olympics organized for young people from across Europe with severe learning difficulties."
"They will never get to university and be able to use Socrates."
"They will not be able to join the European voluntary service."
"But they can participate in sport."
"I am delighted they are going to get a grant but I am rather ashamed that it is so small."
"As Budget Rapporteur for Culture, I know that the money allocated for sport - ECU 3m - is derisory."
"But even that sum faces the annual battle that there is no legal base and the Council regularly attempts to cut it out altogether."
"As a Parliament in Europe we believe in promoting good health, helping social integration and recognizing the needs of the disabled."
"Is there any better way of doing that than in sport?"
"This morning I asked for the youth volunteer service to be called the Mitterand Volunteers."
"I will be, perhaps, slightly less francophile this afternoon when I remind Members that in England we have a saying: the Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton."
"Let us build Europe on the playing fields of Europe."
"Mr President, I must begin by congratulating Mrs Pack on her work - she is a very active member of the European Parliament."
"Mrs Pack, like Mrs Larive and other members of the European Parliament, has always worked for the development of a European Union sports policy."
"But you yourself mentioned the difficulties that we have encountered in the past and that we still encounter in this business."
"That said, since in Amsterdam we are going to be debating important questions for the future of the European Union, I hope that this report can be considered by our Heads of State and Government as a useful contribution to a major debate on the European Union's competences."
"The question of sport broadly departs from the framework of sport proper."
"We should take a further look at three aspects for an overall approach to sports policy in the European Union."
"First of all, the sport model."
"Do we think of sport as a public service?"
"What do we think of the relationship between professional and amateur sport?"
"What is the role of the public institutions compared with NGOs?"
"How are we to conceive the organisation of European sport?"
"Secondly, the relationship between TV and sport."
"Their mutual independence is now enormous, virtually a question of survival in many cases."
"Thirdly, as has been mentioned, the social role of sport."
"Sport is an excellent instrument for creating jobs; sport as an instrument for combating social exclusion, poverty in less favoured communities; sport as a vehicle of integration par excellence; sport as a means of forging links between people from different parts of the world or different walks of life."
"Those are just some aspects which, in my opinion, the Commission should take seriously when looking at sport in the future."
"I think that the idea of a Green Paper is an excellent one and even that of a task-force."
"It should be strengthened by improved cooperation between the Commission services: education, culture, research and even external relations and DG X. I must thank you, Mrs Pack, for your report and I hope that it will be followed up."
"Mr President, I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he can assure me of the truth of what Mr Papas, the Director-General, more or less hinted at to the sports bodies, namely that the Commission is ready to set up this task force and that they will not wait until the next term but will take this action - as I urge them to do - before the end of the present term."
"We are all waiting for this, and, as Mrs Larive said, we have been waiting for a long time; at some stage we shall become impatient."
"I am also speaking on behalf of Mrs Larive now when I ask whether we may expect anything more than fine words on this task force and whether specific action has been initiated."
"Inasfar as I can speak on behalf of some of my colleagues, I have to say that it is the Commission's intention to present a communication after Amsterdam."
"Of course, for that we need to create the necessary conditions for presenting that communication."

"Excise duty on certain mineral oils"
"The next item is the report (A4-0206/97) by Mr Cox, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the proposal for a Council Decision authorizing Member States to continue to apply to certain mineral oils, when used for specific purposes, existing reduced rates of excise duty or exemptions from excise duty, in accordance with the procedure provided in Article 8(4) of Directive 92/81/EEC (COM(96)0549 - C4-0071/97-96/0263(CNS))"
"Mr President, the unusual length of my speech tonight - and I may not use all the time - reflects the hour of the evening and the length of the actual piece of work we are dealing with, that you have just read out, which would probably require seven minutes to explain it."
"The report deals with exemptions from excise duty applied to certain mineral oils."
"The reason why we are dealing with it now is that it arises from a review of those exemptions which needed to be undertaken and that review was provided for in the basic legislation on excise duty agreed in 1992."
"This directive, along with the directive on VAT, was one of the principal foundations of the tax side of completing the single market."
"About 80 exemptions are treated, covering all 15 Member States, and they are the ones dealt with in this report."
"While the 1992 excise Directive set out a procedure for granting exemptions, in effect three procedures can be identified over the years."
"A large number of exemptions were agreed back in 1992 at precisely the same time that the excise Directive was adopted."
"As such, although they may conform with the exemption requirements provided for in the law, the list was agreed without direct reference to the legislation since the list of exemptions and the Directive were adopted on the same day."
"A kind of political package deal was done to get the excise duty Directive over the line, as it were."
"So the Council feels that on that list, agreed on that day, it got a once and for all exemption."
"This is something that in principle Parliament does not accept."
"There is a second package in the list of exemptions, which has been adopted over time and which more or less follows the rules set out in Article 84 of the 1992 Directive which deals with these very exemptions."
"Finally, there are some more exemptions, making about 80 in total, that have got through the system by tacit agreement: a Member State indicated that it wanted an exemption, no one cried 'stop' so the exemption came to pass."
"So that is the way the exemptions have ended up for review at this stage."
"In reviewing this long and complex list, Parliament has set out in Amendment No 4 to recital 8 of the Commission's proposal its essential view in principle of what should happen, which is that no review procedure should be adopted by the Council which has as its object or effect the indefinite open-ended extension of exemptions."
"This principle, of course, does not rule out extending exemptions, it simply says that we must keep them under regular and constant review and that they cannot exist indefinitely."
"Furthermore, we in Parliament insist on the desirability of regular and periodical review with the possibility of renewal, subject to three conditions: that the exemptions be renewed respecting fair competition, the proper functioning of the internal market and Community policy on environmental protection."
"By placing these principles in a recital, we are signalling a strong intent on Parliament's part but nonetheless it should not create any operational difficulty for the Council in the next few weeks to sort out this exemptions question."
"However, in Amendment No 5 we draw attention to the fact that all exemptions shall and must be subject to fundamental review as part of the proposal for a Council directive on a Community framework for the taxation of energy products."
"This is a major review that looks at the ill-fated CO2 tax, all the exemptions, all the excise duties on mineral oils, and the energy and environmental policies."
"We want that review as a matter of fundamental principle to be open-ended to such a degree that no exemption we are treating today can be presumed to be inviolate or free from review as part of this framework proposal that we shall consider in due course."
"In agreeing to place these principles in the recitals and not in the articles of the proposal for decision, we are stopping just short of a showdown with Council right now."
"We are stopping just short, provided the Commissioner tonight can confirm that the Commission accepts the principles we have laid down and that they will back those principles and represent those those principles at Council, specifically in relation to the framework directive on energy taxation which, as I said, we will come back to."
"On the question of timing, we have a number of amendments."
"This has been a slow procedure and the result is that some of the timing dates mentioned in the proposal are now out of date."
"So a lot of the amendments are simply updating the document as required because of the passage of time."
"The Green Group has recommended two elements on timing."
"They say that the review procedure on exemptions in the future should be tied into the framework document."
"I agree with that in principle."
"But I have one fear and therefore as rapporteur I am not recommending the acceptance of the Green Group amendments."
"We know just how difficult it is under Article 99 to get the Council of Ministers to agree anything on taxation and my fear is that if we adopt the Green Group amendments, we may not get to review the exemptions for years because - I hope it will not happen, but it could - the Council will delay the adoption of the framework document for a prolonged period of time."
"I want to see dates left in and, if it is replaced by the framework document, what the Greens want to see - which I agree with in principle - will then come to pass."
"But for that practical reason, I am suggesting that we stick with my original amendments and not with those of the Green Group."
"Finally, I repeat that I want to hear on the record of this House tonight an engagement from the Commission to support Parliament's principles in this exercise fully."
"They are: no to indefinite open-ended excise exemptions; yes to regular review with the possibility of renewal; yes to fundamentally reviewing all existing mineral oil exemptions as an integral part of the proposed framework for taxation of energy problems."
"Mr President, after Mr Cox there is not much else to say."
"But can I start off by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Cox, in piloting this report through the committee, and hopefully through the Parliament, in a largely uncontroversial way."
"There are a number of alterations to the original documents but the vast majority of them, as Mr Cox pointed out, are to do with deadlines."
"The extensions which have been tabled are sensible on the whole and therefore acceptable to the Socialist Group."
"The two he highlighted, the two amendments from the Greens, Nos 1 and 3, the Socialist Group will be backing because we do believe they give a greater flexibility and we do think that maybe the Council of Ministers will come forward with a decision on them and we will be able to review the exemptions in the future."
"We will also be supporting the amendment to the effect that in any future review procedure will not be on the basis of an indefinite open-ended extension of the exemptions."
"The whole question of excise duty, whether it be on mineral oil, tobacco or alcohol is one which this Parliament must face up to."
"For too long we have shut ourselves off from reality, we have not faced up to the problems."
"The completion of the Single European Market is a goal of this Parliament, but too often protection of sacred cows, which many groups in this Parliament defend, have put obstacles in the road towards the completion of the single market."
"I would be the last person to defend or to abdicate complete harmonization of indirect taxes, but where the differentials are so great that it is leading to distortions in the market and fraudulent trading then it is high time this Parliament acted."
"For not to do so would be for us to condone the worst practices currently existing within the single market."
"That is true for mineral oils, it is true for tobacco and it is also true for alcohol."
"For the Parliament to overcome this, we must break out of our parochial views from our regional or national areas and consider the wider implications."
"The reports on tobacco and alcohol will be discussed later this year."
"Unfortunately I do not see the same progress being made in these areas as has been made in the area of mineral oil but one can always hope."
"Looking about, this is the year of change."
"For the first time in eighteen years we now have a Labour government in Britain."
"I was thinking as I was listening to the previous debate that for the first time in 68 years Kilmarnock has won the Scottish Cup, so I really have to think this is the year for change."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Cox has put his finger on the salient point."
"It concerns the relationship of this report to Commissioner Monti's initiative, which was designed to create a legal framework for the taxation of energy products."
"Just as he, for the reasons he explained, does not wish to accept our amendments, we cannot approve his report without our amendments, for we consider it crucially important to make Mr Cox clearly aware that the Monti initiative must succeed, and then I would extend it again."
"We have still more changes of government ahead of us, and once we have changed governments in Germany there will be no governments left that want to sabotage systematically the harmonization and coordination of taxes."
"Then at least nobody will be able to make the excuse that some governments are seeking unfair advantages for historical or purely national reasons."
"And then the Monti proposal and the Commission initiative will surely butter our parsnips."
"Since that will happen in the foreseeable future, Mr Cox, our proposal on the coordination of time limits is certainly not about postponement until never-never day but an attempt to take political action in this situation, to maintain the pressure and to tackle the necessary restructuring of the entire system of indirect taxes, so that the unfair, ecologically harmful and antisocial distortions that are rooted in today's markets for historical or national reasons can finally be weeded out."
"That is an urgent task."
"It is part and parcel of the completion of the single market, and we must not ease the pressure."
"For these reasons we shall take the line I have described."
"Mr President, we support the Commission's proposal to abolish a considerable number of the exemptions from excise duty on fuels."
"The use of mineral oils is accompanied by external effects which are often not passed on in the market price, and levying excise duty can do something to offset this."
"Naturally, it must be applied as consistently as possible."
"There is one incomprehensible exception which clearly flouts this rule, and that is the kerosene exemption for commercial aviation."
"The Commission rightly feels that this exemption cannot form part of a sustainable policy and intends to urge the International Civil Aviation Organization to carry out a feasibility study."
"However, I do not think that its approach is firm enough, and things could drag on for some years yet."
"The proposed decision which is before the House abolishes all the exemptions for internal leisure aviation, and rightly so."
"The next logical step is to impose a kerosene levy on all commercial aviation within the European Union, particularly where there is good alternative transport for short-distance flights."
"A second step would be for the Member States of the Union, if possible with the United States and Japan, to revoke the international agreement on this matter and jointly to introduce a levy on kerosene."
"How far is the Commission prepared to go along with these proposals, and what timescale would it follow?"
"I think everyone agrees that we need to work towards a transport policy which is as sustainable as possible."
"Exemptions for inland waterway transport are compatible with such a policy, since this mode produces far fewer external effects than road transport."
"The expected increase in transport should therefore be absorbed by inland waterway transport as far as possible, not least because of the overcapacity which exists in this sector."
"We need to ensure that this form of transport is made as safe as possible, and we need to combat surface water pollution."
"An exemption for local public transport is a good move for improving the environment in Europe's cities, and if it can be limited to the lighter fuels such as LPG in future, things will be all the cleaner."
"I agree with the Commission that it must be possible for Member States to introduce different rules in future."
"The main objective must always be to protect the environment, and exemptions must not be granted indefinitely."
"The Commission welcomes the Cox report containing the opinion of Parliament as it reflects and supports the Commission's view that there should be no open-ended derogations."
"All the proposed amendments which alter the effective dates in the draft Council decision can be accepted without reservation."
"The amendment to Recital 8 can also be accepted in principle, subject to detailed examination of the drafting."
"On the other hand, whilst the new Recital 8a precisely describes the Commission's intention to introduce a new procedure in its proposal for the restructuring of the system for the taxation of energy products, we cannot accept it as a new recital as it does not refer to any provisions in the body of the text and is not, therefore, legally justifiable."
"In this context I should like to point out to Parliament that during discussions in the Council on the Commission proposals for the restructuring of the system for the taxation of energy products, the Commission will take the opportunity to come back again on the whole issue of the treatment of derogations and seek, through the introduction of a new procedure, a situation whereby no derogations exist for an indefinite period."
"Mr President, in the principle of the matter there is no disagreement between Parliament and the Commission."
"With regard to Amendment 5, that is, Recital 8a (new), which the Commissioner says cannot be accepted because it does not find a legal basis in the decision, the amendment refers to exemptions in the Council decision."
"In my opinion and that of the committee it is firmly rooted in the current proposal for a decision and builds exclusively on that, but adds in the important political reference that all these exemptions should be subject to fundamental review in the framework document."
"I do not dispute in any way that we are in full agreement as regards the substance of the issue."
"Others will have to look at the legal aspects because I am not an expert on that."
"But on the substance, we are in full agreement."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 7.05 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The minutes of the last sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, looking at the record of voting for yesterday, for some unknown reason - and I am usually pretty diligent about these matters - there are three votes where I am not recorded as having voted."
"I did vote on every vote yesterday."
"We have made a note of that and we shall check it."
"Madam President, I refer to page 8 of the Minutes for yesterday where it says: ' The President closed the debate' ."
"What it does not say is that Members were summoned to vote at noon but that the debate was still continuing."
"Indeed, Commissioner Cresson was obliged to reply to the debate while Members were still coming into vote."
"The President had to call upon Members to stop talking and take their seats to allow the Commissioner to finish her response."
"It seems to me that we are not ordering our affairs as efficiently as we should."
"Members come to Parliament to talk and if they arrive in the Chamber expecting to vote and find that a debate is still in progress, it is not unnatural that they should speak to each other."
"I submit that we should organize our affairs better and either allow a certain amount of time in the morning session for those colleagues who will run over - as I am doing - or start the voting later."
"That was not about the minutes, but we have made a note of it."
"(Parliament approved the Minutes)"
"Madam President, on Tuesday morning, despite grave reservations, we agreed on the urgency of sending financial assistance to Macedonia and Bulgaria, even though we had not had any opportunity to discuss the matter in committee."
"Because of the urgency of the situation there, however, we agreed, and in committee we were told that on Friday we would have the opportunity to hold a brief discussion on this subject."
"Now I see that no such debate is planned, and I wish to protest about that, because it has never been discussed, and because it is not in line with our procedure to date."
"Mr Posselt, I can only say that the committee decided on a procedure without report, and so there was no reason to hold a discussion at the part-session."
"Madam President, what Mr Posselt says is correct."
"We raised this point ourselves, and we asked that the issue should not be dealt with in this way since we knew that it would not be discussed in committee or in the plenary."
"That was perfectly clear."
"So you are right to say that not having a debate is not the proper way to go about things, but that was part of the package you voted for, and that is where the problem lies."
"Thank you Mrs Aelvoet ."
"Votes"
"The recommendation is deemed adopted, since no written objections have been submitted by one tenth of the Members of Parliament."
"I wish to protest most strongly against the way in which the Council has pressurized us over the financial assistance for Bulgaria and Macedonia."
"There is no urgent need for this financial assistance, since it is not emergency aid for a starving population."
"These are not countries where a disaster happened the day before yesterday, and where it is absolutely essential for blankets to be sent today."
"In spite of this, the Council has approached Parliament at a time when it is unable, either in the appropriate committees or in the plenary session, to verify the circumstances, to discuss the issue, to draw up a report and to vote on it in full knowledge of the facts."
"The Council's disregard for Parliament once again shows up the European institutions in a very bad light, and makes it urgently necessary to have a fundamental revision."
"I have a further criticism about the financial assistance itself."
"In the present case, it consists in issuing non-transparent loans in order to balance the budgets of the countries concerned."
"Basically, these credits are just being used to secure other credits issued by private banks in Europe."
"In other words, once again public resources are being used to ensure that the banks' private profits do not shrink Public money is being used to oil the wheels of private banks."
"That is not a responsible way to use tax-payers' money."
"In addition, it keeps these 'assisted' countries in debt."
"What we have here, in fact, is nothing more or less than a lightning attack designed to perpetuate the system of dependency on the banks."
"These credits are part of an overall strategy which is coordinated by the IMF."
"In this way it is able, quite shamelessly, to interfere in the domestic policy of the countries concerned."
"In Bulgaria, this issue has even caused a government to fall from power."
"This carrot-and-stick policy is extremely problematical."
"The EU can always turn off the money supply if the governments in question do not toe the line and follow precisely the sort of financial and economic policy that Washington and Brussels approve of."
"In no way, however, is our group fundamentally opposed to financial assistance for Bulgaria and Macedonia."
"This assistance, however, should not be used to secure bank profits. It should go to the countries and the people affected, and should be used, transparently, to help those branches of the economy that are in difficulties to get back on their feet again."
"This urgent matter has gone through Parliament without a debate - either in the relevant committee or in the plenary session."
"We are talking here about macro-financial assistance, which is stand-by assistance that is to be used to settle debts which these countries have entered into in order to meet the criteria set by the IMF."
"The people in these countries will not derive any benefit from this money: it simply flows from bank to bank."
"The Commission document shows that this money will only be paid out when the countries concerned have to a large extent paid off their debts."
"Basically, this public money is being used to feed the private banking system, and to draw the countries concerned into a position of long-term indebtedness."
"The Greens are demanding credible support measures which include structural aid for sustainable development projects."
"The needs of democratic development in these changing countries will not be served if a large part of their national economic success is due to Western banks."
"When are we finally going to be prepared to have a system of international financial relations that shows some respect for human dignity?"
"I did not leave the part-session until after the vote on this point, and thus I did not take part in the subsequent procedural debate."
"However, I do not believe that participation in this procedural debate is absolutely essential in order to justify my submitting a written explanation of vote, because, as I have already mentioned, I did take part in the vote, and the procedural debate did not take place until after we were called to vote on the report by Mrs Magda Aelvoet."
"Cox report (A4-206/97)"
". (DA) The Danish Social Democrats voted for the Cox report today."
"The proposal for a decision relates to authorizations for Member States to apply a number excise duty reductions and exemptions until 31 December 1998 and to the abolition of a number of other excise duty reductions and exemptions with effect from 31 December 1996."
"The Danish Social Democrats would welcome an amendment of Directive 92/81/EEC, which is the legal basis for this proposal, as soon as possible so that the Member States may be authorized to impose excise duties on mineral oils supplied for use as a motor fuel in especially polluting commercial vessels sailing in EU waters."
"The provision in Article 8(1c) of Council Directive 92/81/EEC should be deleted, so that Member States are free to impose duties on fuel for use, for example, on catamaran ferries."
"Catamaran ferries are the cause of serious environmental pollution, noise nuisance and disturbance to wildlife; they endanger other sea-going vessels and are a nuisance to beach visitors."
"The Danish Social Democrats would also like to see the transport of goods and passengers switched from catamaran ferries and other fast-moving craft to more environmentally friendly vessels."
"The PPE Group agrees with the rapporteur that we should not approve any kind of review procedure which leads to exemptions being extended indefinitely."
"All exemptions must be reviewed at regular intervals, and the PPE Group feels that it is vital to make this clear when all the current excise duty reductions or exemptions expire."
"If Member States wish to extend exemptions or reductions in the rate of duty, they must be able to provide good reasons for doing so, and these must not conflict with the principles of the single market, fair competition and a sustainable policy on the environment."
"If too many exceptions are made which do not meet these three conditions, it will be impossible for the single market to operate."
"This is why my group feels it is clear that the fixing of rates cannot be left entirely to the Member States' discretion."
"The Commission's report discusses a number of relatively minor points in detail, but says nothing about the main issues, such as the special position regarding excise duty on fuel for commercial aviation and for shipping."
"I understand that the Commission is to put forward a new proposal on the excise duty on mineral oils, so I wonder whether this document before us now really counts for anything."
"Perhaps the Commissioner could clarify this point."
"There is another point I should like to mention."
"Given that at least 70 exemptions or exceptions have been granted over the years for various policy objectives, and not always the most convincing ones at that, I am amazed that the Commission is causing so many problems about granting a low VAT rate for labourintensive services, which could promote employment in sensitive sectors."
"In view of the many exemptions granted on excise duty, perhaps the Commission could finally give this proposal serious consideration."
"Coming back to the excise exemptions, the forthcoming ECOFIN Council is going to have to reach a unanimous decision on a new package of derogation applications, and it appears that they have all been approved apart from the two from the Netherlands."
"The Netherlands wishes to increase the excise duty on fuel from 1 July 1997, except for heavy goods vehicles, i.e. diesel."
"What is more, the rate for petrol in the border regions is to be increased less than in the rest of the country, the so-called 'Zalm zone' , and I can well imagine that there is still disagreement on this."
"This Zalm zone will mean that there is not simply a difference in rates within the single market, but several at the same time within one country."
"If the government is unable to put forward a more convincing argument for this application, which is what Parliament is calling for in its resolution, then I hope that the application relating to the Zalm zone will not be approved."
"It would simply create yet another trade barrier, and we have enough of those already."
"Pack report (A4-197/97)"
"We share the opinion that sport plays an important role in the development of young people and also in public health."
"But that does not mean that we share the opinion that the EU should concern itself with a specific sports policy, for top class sport or for sport for young people."
"The sporting activities of our citizens need very little regulation within the political sphere."
"The sporting movement should bear the primary responsibility for sport, both now and in the future."
"It, alone, has built up an extensive international co-operation with global and regional co-operation organisations based on local and national structures."
"The sporting movement has shown itself capable, without supranational political interference, of arranging impressive international events such as the European championships, the World championships and the Olympic Games."
"Such a force should be left in peace."
"It is also important to underline that sport for young people is primarily a matter for parents and families, who are at the very bottom of the subsidiarity chain."
"European sporting projects fall outside the framework of matters to which the Union should be devoting its energies."
"Sport is one of the most widely practised of human activities."
"Be it for money or pleasure, regularly or occasionally, millions of people take part in the various sporting activities on offer in the Union."
"Yet, despite the Commission's enthusiasm for sport, the humble MEP that I am fears that it is just a smokescreen to hide the lack of legal and financial resources, the scattering that confirms the lack of an overview and the weakness of the Treaties where sport is not mentioned."
"It is therefore with fervour and recognition that I welcome the excellent report by our colleague Mrs Pack."
"This is a very timely moment since we can hope to put pressure on our governments and on the Commission for the IGC to agree to acknowledge sport as such and not only through the budgetary chapter on 'information and communication' ."
"Sport, as the 1995 Bosman judgment involuntarily revealed, is not just an economic activity to be dealt with in accordance with competition rules."
"It is also and above all a field enabling the rapprochement of cultures and nationalities, helping towards the social integration of the disabled and in which spectators and players alike are equal."
"Sport brings together many people in organisations and clubs, where they are committed to cultural networks and practise democratic responsibility."
"It is therefore time to provide our ambitions with the necessary means."
"That is why I support and applaud the Pack report."
"I hope that our Assembly will do the same."
"There can be no doubt about the importance of sport and the interest which the majority of the people of the EU have in it."
"But I do not agree with the rapporteur that an Article in the EU Treaty is needed to cover sport."
"This is an area which, I think, should be covered at national level."
"I cannot support Amendment No. 3 from the Socialist group, because the amendment proposal means that giving public aid to professional sporting associations would be forbidden."
"We do not distinguish between professional and non-professional sporting associations in Sweden, in fact they are often linked."
"If this became an EU regulation this would remove the foundation stone of Swedish sporting activity."
"On the contrary, I think it is a good thing for the public sector to give support as this gives the associations independent status."
"Sport is so very important, particularly for young people, that its activities should not be dependent on whether a sponsor can be found."
"Unfortunately sport has so far been forgotten in our treaties."
"This formidable tool of social cohesion, education, crime prevention and job creation must now mobilize all our energy."
"In the Union, sport is practised by more than 100 million Europeans, through tens of thousands of sports clubs, and there has been no overview for action to be taken at Community level."
"Mrs Pack's excellent report has the merit of making a remarkable summary of a subject covering many, many areas."
"Sport is too often regarded as a playful activity and not a vital social, medical, cultural or economic factor."
"A good sports policy, with an integrating, educational component, can limit social spending."
"Sport is a means of individual and collective education, that also makes it possible to develop the opening up of Europe."
"Sport is the first way in which a young person can find out about himself and respect his body, and will enable him later on to respect adversaries and the rules of life in society, develop his energy in a team, regardless of origin, education or language, and to forge links within the European Union."
"Without going back on the principle of subsidiarity, we must support the initiatives proposed by Mrs Pack, complementing the pilot activities already under way."
"Each European Member State has its special features, and often the British model is referred too."
"France as a sporting nation has its advantages but also its weaknesses and, according to our friends in the Union, France is often bad at sport because so many schoolchildren do not attend sport at school, as many as 15 %, even though it is compulsory."
"I hope that changes take place in the Community not only for observing experiences but also for inspiring - but not imposing - certain measures."
"To conclude, i should like to see special attention paid to sporting practice in the countryside, where sports are of harder access."
"In many parts of the countryside, facilities are often too remote for young people and focus on a single sport."
"In villages, entertainment is rare and sport can be an excellent means of forging friendly links between people, and help them to find a job and stop them from abandoning our important rural fabric."
"In increasingly deserted regions, sport is still a way of keeping people and expressing a community's identity."
"Yes, from our village to the whole of Europe, sport is a powerful vehicle of union and cohesion that we must resolutely encourage."
"Over a hundred million European citizens are involved in sport themselves, and thinking of spectator sport in its wider sense we may say that sport in all its dimensions is a real popular movement."
"Sport is also a significant economic factor and employer."
"It is therefore curious that sport is not mentioned in any way in the EU's founding treaty."
"This has in turn led to a situation where the EU has no overall view of activities in the sports field."
"Decision-making in many other sectors can influence the position of sport very considerably."
"We may cite as examples the Bosman judgment on transfer fees as an obstacle to free movement and the TV Directive which has just been adopted on restricting the right to televise important events in the interest of citizens' rights."
"Sport is naturally above all a national matter and the main responsibility facilities with the sporting sector and the national authorities."
"However, it must be possible to promote this sector, which is of such great interest to the citizens, at EU level."
"By cooperation it is possible to enhance the positive effects of sport and reduce the problems associated with it."
"In my opinion, sport does not require a separate article, but it would be natural to mention it separately in the article on culture."
"In this way, the EU's activity would naturally complement, not guide, national policy."
"The Commission should draw up a green paper on the sports sector and set up a special group to define the outlines of comprehensive development in this area."
"In the hearing on sport, held by the EP's Committee on Culture, particular concern was expressed at the reduction in sporting activity among young people in the various Member States and at the harmful effect this will have on children's and young people's health."
"This trend must be reversed."
"Many recent studies reinforce the view that sport and physical activity have an irreplaceable importance for the healthy physical and mental development of children and young people."
"Sports clubs and schools must undertake better and closer cooperation in the interests of young people."
"Hitherto, interest at Union level has been restricted to professional sports, mainly as an economic activity."
"However, in the EU's activities, sports should be seen above all as a cultural, educational and social activity which must be supported and strengthened by budgetary funds as well as by other means."
"Madam President, I have just one question."
"Is it actually permitted for explanations of votes to be given by people who have not even taken part in the vote?"
"At least two thirds of the people you have mentioned did not take part in the vote."
"I mean, it does not really matter to me, but I think it is improper, all the same."
"Thank you very much."
"We shall look into it."
"In the light of Mrs Pack's statement, I agree that it is strange to give explanations of voting if you are not even here."
"But as explanations of voting must be submitted before the report is fully discussed in the House, it is often the case that a written explanation of voting is submitted, if it is known, for example, that the vote is to take place at Thursday lunchtime."
"This means that if the vote is then postponed for several sessions, explanations of voting from colleagues who, for some reason, are no longer here may remain."
"This is not due to the Members who are no longer here but to the rules which are a little strange."
"Thank you very much."
"We shall look into it."
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"You are going to look into it but I am not sure how if you do not actually know who is here so that you can compare them with who has made an explanation of vote."
"May I suggest that you have a roll-call vote and then you have a record so you can make a check."
"Madam President, I do not want to prolong the discussion, but an explanation of vote means, I am explaining why I voted in such and such a way."
"If I have not voted, then I cannot give an explanation - full stop!"
"Well, we are already running five minutes late, but I could still hold a roll-call, as Mr Tomlinson has requested."
"Do you agree?"
"Madam President, everyone here in the Chamber has seen people leaving who were here for the vote, so it is too late to do as you suggest."
"I am sorry, but it really would not give a fair picture."
"Madam President, I am somewhat astonished at this proposal."
"I would like to know what Rule you are applying to carrying out this 'policing' vote, to check on members present."
"Nominal votes are intended to ensure that members vote for or against."
"I did not know that the chair's role was to carry unnecessary policing, as if we were at school."
"We have had a request for a roll-call vote, to check who is present."
"I am now asking you: do you want this roll-call vote?"
"Of course, the roll-call will only tell us who is present at the moment."
"(Parliament agreed, and the President held the roll-call vote.) The number of those present will be recorded in the Minutes."
"However, we cannot necessarily draw any conclusions from this regarding the number of people who were present ten minutes ago."
"Madam President, I just want to make it clear that although I was present I did not take part in the vote, because it seems to me that this is the first time we have voted on nothing in this Parliament!"
"It does not seem right to me to vote on nothing."
"What were we voting on?"
"It is impossible to take a vote on nothing."
"Thank you very much."
"I have already explained this before."
"We were just checking to see who was present in the Chamber at a specific time."
"That was what Members wanted."
"Madam President, I should like to suggest, to be on the safe side, that none of those who have submitted an explanation of vote is entitled to do so, because it has been proved that none of them was present here in the Chamber, and this was not checked at the time."
"Explanations of vote cannot, therefore, be given, because under Rule 122 of our Rules of Procedure - as Mrs Pack has quite correctly pointed out - this point is crucial, and it was not checked at the time, and of course it has not been established by the so-called roll-call vote."
"This vote must therefore be accepted without any personal explanations."
"Thank you, Mr Nassauer."
"I should just like to confirm once more that the vote that we have just held in no way affects what has gone before."
"Madam President, I cannot see that there is any infringement of the Rules of Procedure."
"Rule 118 says: ' The result of the vote shall be recorded' , but it does not say how."
"So if you ask for an electronic vote, as is your right, you can record the vote as you wish, with or without names."
"We cannot debate this point for hours on end."
"I shall invite four more Members to speak, and then we shall start voting on Mrs Alvoet's report."
"I should like to contradict what Mr Cars has said."
"It is our bounden duty to be here on a Friday, just like any other day of the week."
"That is what we are employed for, to work here and not to be absent."
"Mr Cars, I wish you bon voyage, but you are not a Member of Parliament any more."
"(Applause)"
"Article 366a of LomÃ© IV"
"The next item is the Interim Report (A4-0175/97) by Mrs Magda Aelvoet, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a Council Decision on a framework procedure for implementing Article 366a of the Fourth LomÃ© Convention (COM(96)0069 - C4-0045/97-96/0050(AVC))."
"Madam President, the Council has asked us to approve a proposal for a decision on a procedure for implementing Article 366a of the Fourth LomÃ© Convention."
"On 15 April this year, the Committee on Development and Cooperation approved my proposal to submit an interim report pursuant to Rule 80(3) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The first time that a human rights clause was included in the actual body of the LomÃ© Convention was under LomÃ© IV in 1989, and it now fits in very well with the new geopolitical order, in that since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the inclusion and implementation of human rights clauses in international treaties has become systematic."
"Two years later, in 1991, the Council adopted a detailed resolution on a human rights clause, democratic principles and development."
"A further year later, during the negotiations on and adoption of the Maastricht Treaty, the political will to include a human rights clause was confirmed in Article 130u. At that time, the clause was seen as part of the general development cooperation objectives and the common foreign and security policy."
"Since 1992, respect for human rights and democratic principles has been regarded as an essential element of foreign policy, and we can see how it has progressed from initial recognition, through inclusion in the Treaty, to finally being seen as an essential policy component."
"In 1995, the Commission published a communication - COM(95)216 - which for the first time made it possible for the EU to immediately suspend an international agreement without even opening the procedures for settling disputes, where the issues involved are particularly important or urgent."
"On the actual substance of the decision before us today, the Committee on Development and Cooperation has put forward a number of amendments, in other words a number of Parliament recommendations, which differ from the Council's own proposals."
"First of all, we refer in the recitals to a series of international agreements, so that the whole concept can be applied in the widest possible sense."
"Secondly, when it comes to triggering the procedure, Parliament would like to see not just the Commission or a Member State able to take the initiative, but also Parliament itself."
"A further important amendment here is that the Committee on Development and Cooperation feels that the Council should decide by a qualified majority rather than unanimously, and that Parliament should also have to give its assent."
"So we are calling for Parliament's assent and a qualified majority decision."
"Finally, we think that the resumption of cooperation should be discussed following an assessment report by the Commission, with the Council again deciding by a qualified majority after the European Parliament has given its assent."
"These are the main points of the position of the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"Madam President, as the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, I am very pleased with the substance of this report, as Mrs Aelvoet herself, modest though she is, has already said."
"It is a report of far-reaching significance for the future, in that it finally makes human rights and democracy a precondition for certain forms of cooperation."
"The various committees involved have worked together to produce a report which is the first step towards a negotiating process with the Council."
"By choosing the procedure under Rule 80(3), Parliament is now able to propose amendments to a request for its assent, whereas normally it would only be able to say yes or no, and there would be no scope for amendments."
"And amendments are certainly needed, although the Commission's proposal does represent a step forward in principle."
"What we are dealing with here is a proposed procedure for determining what to do if an ACP country fails to observe the essential elements of the LomÃ© Convention, namely democracy, human rights and the state based on the rule of law."
"Any decision to suspend cooperation must be firmly based on clear criteria, and the procedures must be transparent and agreed fairly with the ACP countries."
"In principle, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy welcomes the Commission's proposal to have a fixed procedure for applying the democracy clause."
"Clarity and transparency are essential elements in any successful human rights and external policy."
"Our partners - in this context, as I have already said, the ACP countries - are entitled to know what the situation is."
"Consultation prior to taking any sanctions is one of the principles of partnership, as well as often being a more effective instrument."
"Transparency means that the criteria for suspending cooperation also need to be clear, but the Commission proposal says nothing about this, so it is up to Parliament to fill the gap."
"The need to respect human rights, democratic principles and the state based on the rule of law is something that deserves our full support, and I wonder whether, in the negotiations with the Council, I should not also add respect for the territorial inviolability of third countries as a criterion."
"On the decision-making procedure itself, the Committee on Foreign Affairs welcomes the Commission's proposal to use a qualified majority vote in the Council."
"We already have far too much experience in the Union of one country or a small number of countries forcing the rest to give economic interests priority over political considerations of human rights."
"The need for unanimity ties Europe's hands, as we have seen all too often."
"However, majority voting alone is not enough."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs is calling for Parliament to have a right of assent as regards the suspension of cooperation under LomÃ©."
"We find it completely unacceptable that a cooperation agreement that was entered into with Parliament's assent should be able to be suspended without it."
"The committee demands assent for the suspension of cooperation under LomÃ©, alongside that for its initiation."
"Another gap in the Commission's proposal is in the procedure for ending suspension, which is not dealt with at all."
"Rules for this procedure are urgently needed, since we shall not wish to make every temporary suspension permanent."
"The temporary suspension should lead to corrective measures being taken, and following the same logic which I described earlier regarding the right of assent, the Committee on Foreign Affairs considers that a decision to end the suspension should be taken by a qualified majority in the Council, on a proposal from the Commission and with Parliament's assent."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs hopes that the House will support the amendments it has tabled, which are designed to flesh out the Commission's proposal and provide greater clarity for those concerned."
"We need to abandon the current practice of allowing the Council to take ad hoc decisions without consulting the parties involved."
"With a few exceptions, the Union has a good reputation when it comes to human rights, and it at least sets out with the intention of pursuing a sound policy."
"It is constantly trying to find ways - not least through the many initiatives proposed by Parliament - to make its policy more efficient and transparent."
"The human rights clause was a step forward, but one of the main problems with this was that it was never applied consistently, either in terms of procedure or substance."
"The current proposal is the first step towards achieving the necessary clarity, and I hope that the Council will support our proposals."
"Finally, I think it is very important to point out here, which is why I have kept it till last, that we feel that this suspension procedure should not just apply to the ACP countries, but should serve as a model for all agreements with all other third countries."
"Every agreement should have a suspension procedure of this kind, and the longer we wait, the more we are guilty of discrimination, which is precisely what we must avoid in the application of universal human rights."
"Madam President, the rapporteur described very adequately the background to this interim report, and I do not propose to go into that sort of detail - she has done an excellent job there."
"I would like to speak about the ideas that were at the forefront of our minds and the recommendations we decided upon when we discussed this in the Committee on External Economic Relations."
"First of all, we want the Commission to insert into the proposed procedure the various steps which should apply when considering withdrawal of LomÃ© trade preferences, in line with withdrawal of the trade benefits under, for example, the Scheme for Generalized Preferences."
"That is very much in line with what Mr Bertens called for: that we need some degree of continuity and a measure of adherence to some general rules in order not to be accused of discriminatory treatment."
"We also called specifically for the inclusion of articles dealing, in the case of withdrawal of LomÃ© trade preferences, with the circumstances under which LomÃ© trade provisions can be withdrawn: the consultation process involved, the duration and scope of the investigation by the Commission, the modalities for the final proposal by the Commission to the Council and Parliament on the suspension of LomÃ© trade provision for the country concerned."
"We also fully support the Commission's proposal that Council decisions on suspension under Article 366a should be decided by qualified majority, and we insist that if Council fails to agree on the principle of qualified majority under the proposed procedure, then Parliament should be reconsulted as a matter of urgency."
"We also ask the Council and the Commission to ensure that the necessary transparency and consistency apply in suspension measures vis-Ã -vis individual ACP countries and that there is equal treatment of the ACP in comparison with the European Union's other cooperation partners."
"We call on the Commission and the Council to ensure an early involvement of the European Parliament in all cases of suspension under Article 366a."
"We consider that the presence of the European Parliament during the consultation period has been crucial."
"I would just like to reiterate two important points that emerged from our discussion: one was that these decisions should be taken only by qualified majority voting in the Council and, if that is not agreed, then Parliament should be reconsulted immediately; secondly, Parliament should be involved in all cases of suspension at the earliest possible opportunity."
"I would be grateful for confirmation from the Commission that would be the case."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen. The group of the European People's Party supports this report."
"We believe that the human rights clause is a very important clause in the minds of the people in the countries concerned, because it is a question of punishing not people, but governments who violate the human rights of their citizens."
"Nor is it an act against the countries concerned, but rather against the governments which abuse human rights, if we suspend the LomÃ© Convention in this area."
"It is true that the European Union is still using double standards here, and is not being quite consistent."
"However, I do not share the views of those who say that the ACP countries are fundamentally worse in this respect than the others, but it is true that, unfortunately, geopolitical and economic considerations frequently play a part."
"It is not a question of whether a country is an ACP country or not, but of whether a Member States has specific interests."
"We really must overcome this problem."
"We must pursue a consistent policy on human rights, and we must not have double standards."
"Madam President, as far as I can see, Mrs Aelvoet's report aims to promote two things: human rights in the ACP countries, and Parliament's control and authority in that field."
"Following the events of the last two years in Africa, everyone knows that suspending development aid is in many cases an extremely necessary, often unavoidable and sadly not always effective measure."
"Generally speaking, however, it is true that countries which take respect for human rights seriously also tend to respect the right to development in the broader sense."
"To be fair, it has to be said that the human rights clause has formed an important part of the LomÃ© Convention for some time now, and just because it did not find its way into agreements with other third countries until later should not mean that the ACP countries are judged more strictly."
"The procedural amendments proposed by Mrs Aelvoet must be based on clear criteria, since this is what the countries concerned are entitled to expect."
"It has to be better for decisions to be taken by a qualified majority in the Council, with Parliament's assent."
"This interim report by Mrs Aelvoet, a respected colleague and a determined defender of human rights, fits in very well with the current tone of the negotiations at the IGC."
"Finally, I entirely agree with Mr Bertens that the approach proposed by Mrs Aelvoet should also apply to all other agreements with third countries."
"My group wholeheartedly supports her proposals."
"This report, Mrs Aelvoet's, comes at just the right time for us to match our actions with our words."
"Since the beginning, cooperation between the European Union and the ACP countries has in theory been based on the respect of human rights and freedoms."
"But that foundation, as every day reality shows, is unfortunately only theoretical."
"Many years after that cooperation began, we are being proposed measures to set conditions on aid or rather, when we already have a tradition of giving aid, to suspend our help if human rights and individual freedoms are being violated seriously in aid beneficiary countries."
"I would add that what is being proposed is not excessively binding because a consultation procedure is provided for so that we can dialogue with the countries against which sanctions are being planned."
"I only see advantages in the proposed arrangements, especially since they have been further improved by Mrs Aelvoet's work and that of the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"We are fully behind the spirit of the amendments which Mrs Aelvoet has proposed for this proposal."
"I am thinking in particular of the amendments aimed at sharing the suspension procedure initiative with the European Parliament and applying qualified majority voting for Council decisions since, if unanimity were required, I know of cases where a single country, sometimes mine as it happens, would block the whole arrangement that we want to set up."
"We did not go along with Mrs Aelvoet, however, when she proposed an exhaustive list of the human rights whose violation would lead to aid suspension, since we think that the different situations of the beneficiary countries should be taken into account."
"I should also like to draw your attention to an amendment tabled by our former colleague, Bernard Kouchner, who asked us to show circumspection when resorting to embargoes or blockades, since it is the ordinary people who suffer in those cases instead of the authorities we want to sanction."
"I think that the Council should listen hard to the proposals for amendments to the text, and I think that if we had applied it in the past, we might have avoided many tragedies in Africa."
"I think that our examination will be complete once we have proposed applying this conditionality arrangement to bilateral cooperation by Member States of the European Union."
"Madam President, I should like at this late stage to draw attention to two points."
"We can see in practice that the Union's position with regard to ACP and non-ACP countries does indeed suggest discrimination."
"We are much easier on the ACP countries than non-ACP countries, with one exception: Burma."
"Secondly, we tend to treat wealthy ACP countries very differently from the others, so that we are quick to take action against the Gambia and Niger, but we wait a very long time before taking action against Nigeria."
"Finally, and this is my last comment, I have withdrawn those of my amendments that were not approved by the committee - although they now seem to have appeared again - so my only proposal now is the one that was agreed in the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"The fact is that even among human rights experts, the possibility of having different sanctions for violations of political and civil rights and social and economic rights is still a controversial issue."
"I think it is much better to leave any political statements on this until the situation has become clearer."
"I therefore withdrew my amendments before the part-session, although this has apparently not actually been carried out."
"Member of the Commission. (SV) Madam President, the Commission has studied with great interest the interim report by Mrs Aelvoet on Article 366a of the LomÃ© Convention along with the opinion of the REX committee and the committee for external affairs."
"The Commission shares the view that we need continuity and co-ordination in our approach to human rights, democratic principles and law and order."
"So we will shortly be submitting a communication to the Council and to Parliament in which we clarify the concepts which will apply and propose a more structured suspension procedure."
"The Commission's proposal is concerned only with the decision making procedure in European institutions."
"It is important to underline that this does not alter, nor can it alter the procedure which is enshrined in Article 366a of the LomÃ© Convention."
"A number of the amendments proposed by the committee on external affairs would make the wording of Article 366a meaningless."
"This applies to the proposal on the need for consent from each country as part of the procedure, particularly before the State involved has been asked for consultation and before action is taken or suspended."
"The Article proposes that appropriate action is taken immediately in urgent situations, or in the case where a country refuses consultation."
"It also says that such action shall, and I quote, ' be suspended as soon as the reason for its introduction no longer exists' ."
"It would be impossible to apply such regulations using such a long and complicated procedure such as that proposed by the committee."
"It would also be in breach of the normal procedures envisaged by the Treaty."
"On the other hand, it is of course appropriate to review more closely the potential for an increased role for Parliament in the implementation of the sanction clause, otherwise referred to in the text as the non-executive clause ."
"The Commission is quite prepared to investigate how this could be accomplished."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Gradin."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution.)"
"Madam President, a few seconds to say that of course I voted for the position proposed by Mrs Aelvoet, but I would like to tell everyone that it is impossible to distinguish between a human rights policy vis-Ã -vis the ACP and the European Union's foreign and security policy."
"I think that the human rights issue is linked to our very political conception of these countries."
"I would suggest to colleagues who voted for the Aelvoet proposal that qualified majority should be applied in the Council, and not unanimity, for foreign and security policy."
"There have often been contradictory votes."
"Yesterday, some colleagues refused to accept our position on qualified majority voting for foreign and security policy."
"Yet it is necessary if we are to be coherent when defending human rights!"
"Marine biotoxins"
"The next item is the report (A4-0177/97) by Mr Macartney, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council Decision amending Council Decision 93/383/EEC of 14 June 1993 on reference laboratories for the monitoring of marine biotoxins (COM(96)0464 - C-0547/96-96/0234(CNS))"
"Madam President, I would like to pay tribute to the work which was done by a very fine reference laboratory in Torry in Aberdeen in Scotland."
"Ironically and strangely, this was the responsibility not of the Scottish arm of the British Government but of the English ministry."
"The record of that laboratory was a very fine one, it was recognized right across Europe."
"In fact within that ministry the reference laboratory in Torry had the best record in attracting joint funding from the European Commission."
"It was a laboratory of European significance."
"The reward for this was to be closed down."
"The reason was purely on cost grounds because the ministry under the previous government decided to concentrate activity south of the border and to close the Torry food research institute."
"Naturally those involved were appalled."
"There was concern expressed also by the European Commission and I am grateful for its support."
"This laboratory was in the forefront of research on, for instance, salmonella, E-coli 0157 and botulism and with the concern about public health which is very real at the moment this is exactly the sort of laboratory that should have been encouraged instead of being closed down."
"Those of us in the area - and I represent that constituency in Scotland - were appalled at the treatment which was meted out to it."
"At the time when I tried to raise this I was told it had nothing to do with the European Parliament and I was criticized for doing so."
"What is quite fascinating for connoisseurs of parliamentary procedure is that suddenly the legal base has been changed and a year later, when the laboratory has already been closed and it is too late to affect the result, we are told 'Oh yes, the Parliament should have been involved' ."
"Last month I was told that there would be a change in the legal base and so it came to the Fisheries Committee on Monday of this week."
"At the very last minute we were told 'Oh yes, you were quite entitled to be consulted, it is a joint responsibility for the Parliament' ."
"That makes the whole issue of more relevance than perhaps the fate of one single laboratory in one part of Europe."
"The laboratory has been scattered to the four winds."
"Some of the researchers there have been moved down to York and some to Norwich."
"They have either been exiled to England or, in some cases, lost their jobs completely."
"I am glad to say that some of the work has been retained in the area after a very sustained campaign and there are five different units in the Aberdeen area which have taken over some of the laboratory's work."
"I would like to think that the spirit of Torry lives on although this is an example of how subsidiarity can be abused by Member States which simply say 'It is our decision, keep your nose out of this one' ."
"I do think that this is the sort of decision which in the future Parliament should have an involvement in."
"However that is now past history and I would like to finish by paying tribute to all the laboratory's work."
"The need for such work will continue in the future, not only in Scotland but right across Europe on a cooperative basis."
"Madam President, this is a very technical but important report since we are dealing with the question of food safety and hygiene."
"Only within the last couple of months scientists in Germany have discovered a strange strain in salmon."
"There was an article in a Netherlands newspaper last month that said: not the mad cow, now the mad salmon."
"They have allegedly found a strain in the brain of the salmon that is similar to that which caused the tragedy with BSE."
"It is important, therefore, that we keep institutes such as the Torry Institute and that we ensure that food hygiene in fish is of the highest possible standard."
"The Torry Institute is a very good one."
"As Mr Macartney said, it was a victim of savage Tory cuts."
"It was also a victim of privatization."
"They formed a private company which looked after the fishing research aspects."
"There was a tremendous hullabaloo in Scotland about this closure among parliamentarians of all political groups."
"The community in the northeast of Scotland was incensed by it."
"I am very glad that the Commission is now changing the legal base so that in future, the Committee on Fisheries will be involved in discussions of this nature. Particularly when we are dealing with Member States, the Fisheries Committee will be asked for its views and opinion."
"There is a problem of transparency as well."
"We can only achieve more transparency by being involved."
"The Socialist Group is very grateful that the legal base has been changed."
"We hope to have a profitable future collaboration with the Fisheries Commissioner on issues like this."
"I support this report on behalf of the Socialist Group."
"Mr President, so the shadow of the BSE crisis has now fallen on the fisheries industry, albeit in a positive sense."
"In February this year, Jacques Santer, the President of the Commission, assured the European Parliament, in a reaction to the BSE crisis, which had just been mentioned, that in future all veterinary-law decisions would be taken within the framework of the codecision procedure."
"The Commission thus gave an undertaking to Parliament that any proposals that affect public health will be dealt with using the co-decision procedure set out in Article 101a of the Maastricht Treaty."
"This procedure is now being applied, actually for the first time, in the case of the directive that covers hygiene and health provisions in the fisheries sector, and in this case, in particular, the control of marine biotoxins in the production and marketing of live mussels and fishery products."
"Perhaps we are dealing with a precedent here, as a result of which the co-decision procedure will become the main decisionmaking process in the fisheries sector."
"That, in any case, is our request to the Inter-Governmental Conference on the further development of the Maastricht Treaty."
"In Amsterdam the 15 EU governments will certainly not be able to ignore it any longer."
"As for the content of this report, the proposal contains two decisions."
"In the first place, there is the implementation of the hygiene provisions for the production and marketing of the above-mentioned live mussels and fishery products."
"For this purpose, every Member State has to designate a national reference laboratory which is responsible, in particular, for the control of marine biotoxins."
"Great Britain has now, finally, complied with this requirement."
"Secondly, the Commission is proposing to simplify the procedure for dealing with such matters."
"In future, it will only inform Parliament when a Member State wants to change the address of the national reference laboratory."
"I think that goes without saying."
"The Committee on Fisheries has also agreed to it unanimously, provided that the basic principle is not put at risk, i.e. that laboratories of this kind in a Member States should, basically, be given prominence."
"I must also add, that the action that Great Britain has opted for here is basically contrary to the procedure."
"I can understand my colleagues' disappointment, but all the same I am pleased that, after some difficult negotiations, we have found what I hope will be a good solution."
"Mr President, I am glad we are debating Mr Macartney's report today."
"It raises a very important issue."
"Why did the Commission not think originally of allowing Member State Governments the opportunity to change the different scientific stations that would be recognized?"
"It seems extraordinary to me that, when it drew up its original proposal, there was no provision for making this kind of very minor change affecting one Member State without the need for a full consultation process."
"Having said that, I recognize what Mr Macartney and Mr McMahon said about it causing a very great deal of dislocation and upset to those involved in Scotland."
"I declare an interest, being chairman of part of an organization that had to take on some of the staff involved in what was the Torry Research Station."
"My chief concern - and I wonder if at some stage we will get an answer from the Commission - is how the new arrangements which the President of the Commission has announced for food safety and the monitoring of food safety will relate to other parts and other agencies within the European Community?"
"How will this new food agency relate to what may well be a new food standards agency in the United Kingdom?"
"What control will it have over organizations such as the Torry Research Station which is now split between three or four different agencies?"
"The linkage between the European Community and the Member States is going to be vital for the future and we do not yet know how this relationship is going to take place."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mandate of Advisers on Biotechnology"
"The next item is the oral question (B4-0348/97) by Mr de Clercq, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on extending the mandate of the Group of Advisers on the Ethical Implications of Biotechnology."
"I have received two motions pursuant to Rule 40(5)."
"The vote will take place after the debate."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Gradin, we all know that biotechnology is potentially of great benefit to mankind."
"However, we have now been overtaken by news which shows that this potential is linked to great risks, and brings up important ethical questions, whether it is the cloning of sheep, or the news that a British doctor in Saudi Arabia is proposing to offer couples babies that will definitely be of the male sex."
"These few cases show what kind of ethical questions this technology can give rise to."
"They are proof enough that it is absolutely essential for us to have an advisory group on ethical issues."
"On 31 July 1997 the mandate of the group of advisers on biotechnology ethics (GABE) comes to an end."
"For the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, this fact provided us with an opportunity to think about how we wish to proceed further. Therefore we are asking the following questions."
"Does the Commission intend to extend the term of office of this group of advisers?"
"If so, will the group continue to operate with its present membership, functions and structure, or does the Commission intend to change its mandate?"
"I have to say that that would be desirable."
"In what form and with what aim will the consideration of ethical questions be organized in future, if the Commission is planning to change the mandate?"
"I would add to this another question. How quickly will this happen?"
"In what form does the Commission intend to involve the European Parliament in developing a structure for considering ethical questions at European Union level?"
"I eagerly await the Commissioner's answers, and perhaps during the course of the debate I may react accordingly."
"Given the importance of this subject, I do not think it is really necessary to repeat the fact that I shall fully exhaust my five minutes, in order to talk about this important issue."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this morning we are examining the issue of extending the mandate of the Advisers on Biotechnology."
"As we know, the field of biotechnology is a difficult one as it has an ethical, moral and religious dimension."
"In addition there are very technical problems, often difficult of access for non-specialists."
"We are also dealing with considerable social and industrial challenges."
"I should like, on behalf of my group, to pay tribute to the work carried out by Mrs Lenoir and her colleagues in the group of advisers."
"Their opinions have been precious on the subjects referred to them by the Commission."
"By means of their opinions they have acquired an undeniable authority, technical and moral."
"We do not always agree with their opinions, of course; and that is normal with such a difficult subject."
"The practice of individual opinions - and I am thinking of Professor Mieth's in the case of the patentability of biotechnological inventions - has offered vital answers to this problem, as it is a matter of clarifying political decisions and not standing in for the political decision-makers."
"Extending the mandate of this group is certainly welcome."
"It still has work to do and I am sure that Mrs Gradin will confirm that."
"But, at the same time, we should make the most of the further reflections offered by that extension to work out how it should be replaced by another body."
"We want the institutional authority of this body to be recognised and reinforced."
"It is difficult, we are told, to strengthen the nature of this body since biotechnology, as such, does not come within Community powers."
"That is true and the Court of Justice has recognized that, but it is only partly true - and that is why the group was set up in the first place - as biotechnology affects various matters which are part of Community scope and action."
"I would therefore ask Mrs Gradin and her colleague to think again about ways of giving this body, responsible for clarifying biotechnological choices, a stronger statute."
"We want the European Parliament to be involved in the appointment of the members of any future body."
"It is not at all in our minds to politicize this body but, on the contrary, to guarantee its independence and that of its members and, by doing so, to strengthen its authority, just as we do by appointing the members of the Court of Audit which in the past has enabled us to avoid certain over-politicized appointments."
"The mandate of this body must remain strictly consultative."
"It would be a mistake to transfer decisionmaking power to an independent body, regardless of its authority, given the diversity of conceptions and ethical cultures in the European Union."
"There is no unified European bioethics area."
"We probably need directives and references, and political responsibility must be taken in the democratic institutional framework that is ours, in a spirit of clear non-religious intervention, i.e. marked by an attachment to our values, our common values, and the rejection of intolerance and irrational behaviour which are all too frequent in this field."
"Mr President, the Commission has proposed that the mandate for the advisory group on ethical aspects of biotechnology be extended to the end of this year."
"The intention is that the group, working under the chairmanship of Madam Leonard, should be able to complete the work which they have started at the request of the Commission."
"It is primarily a matter now of looking at the draft of the fifth framework programme for research and development."
"A growing number of ethical questions are being raised as a result of progress in the field of biotechnology."
"So, the Commission would quickly like to give a fresh stimulus to the group."
"The new questions arising in this field affect people's everyday lives and ought therefore to be very carefully investigated."
"The Commission has therefore urged the group to put together a plan for their forthcoming work."
"Based on this plan we can give the group a new mandate, which we will do at the end of the year."
"This will also enable us to strengthen the role of the group, its structure and its position as an advisory and independent ethical group in the European debate."
"The Commission is satisfied with the work carried out by the group so far."
"At the same time, we consider that the group needs to be strengthened for the future to be able to meet the expectations held by our people which find expression in the questions asked of us here in Parliament."
"Meanwhile, the Commission will also have discussions on these issues within the group of Commission Members who work on consumer health matters."
"Mr President, Commissioner Gradin, the right time to answer would, of course, have been before Mr Cot gave us his opinion, rather than later, but I can make allowances for you, Mrs Gradin, if you do not listen attentively to what the other groups in this Parliament also have to say on this subject."
"I should also like my remark to be noted in the minutes."
"I would just like to say once again, Madam Commissioner, that the correct time was, of course, after Mrs Gebhardt's question, but we can afford to be tolerant, provided that you will listen very attentively when the other groups are giving their opinion on this subject."
"There is no dispute about the opportunities that biotechnology offers, and we must take advantage of them, and we must also be aware of our responsibilities as legislators in this field."
"However, these opportunities can only be made use of if people have confidence in the technology, if they know that there are limits, based on clear, ethical grounds, beyond which no one must go, and if abuses, whatever form they take, are punished."
"In this connection, it is certainly a good idea to set up an advisory group, drawing its members from various sources, both multi-disciplinary and multi-national."
"The way in which this group operates, however, is unsatisfactory in the opinion of my group."
"First of all, it is not transparent enough."
"There is no clear structure, which lays down who says what within this working group, and as a result it depends very much on the people concerned, and in our confidence in them, and I have to say that our confidence in the persons involved, and in the chairman too, is not exactly strengthened when they give to the opinion of the European Parliament as little consideration as they have been doing in the last few weeks."
"In March, we issued an unambiguous position on clones, and now we have the opinion of the group of advisers, and the difference between the two is very striking."
"The European Parliament was overwhelmingly against any cloning, including at the embryo stage, and we believe that the use of the Dolly process on human beings should be made a criminal offence everywhere in the world, and at least in our Member States."
"The group of advisers, however, has done some intricate manoeuvring here, and is proposing only implantation in the womb, and I believe that this is not at all what the European Parliament had in mind."
"So our confidence in the group of advisers has to some extent been weakened."
"This can have disastrous results, as we found, for example, in the case of gene manipulation."
"The directive on the patenting of biotechnological discoveries was also a disaster because in the Conciliation Committee we agreed, by way of a compromise, to a form of words proposed by the group of advisers, which was clearly contrary to the opinion of Parliament, which has said that is against this type of manipulation, and not just for a specified time, but against it altogether."
"In other words, no one took this opinion seriously."
"We must be aware of the fact that the legislator has a certain amount of responsibility here, and we can only have confidence in the group of advisers if we know that they take our opinion seriously."
"I wonder how the Commission can justify implementing the positions of the group of advisers in a ratio of 1: 1?"
"Naturally these are highly qualified people, but then we have such people here in Parliament too."
"In my group, for instance, we have Professor Casini, who is a lawyer who has been involved with these issues for a long time. Then there are the scientists Professor Trakatellis or Mrs Heinisch."
"We also have plenty of theologians in this Parliament as well, and not only in our group."
"What higher authority does Mrs Lannoye have, as a lawyer, which the lawyers here in this Parliament - who are involved with this type of work and who also derive authority from the fact that have been elected by the people - do not have?"
"Therefore I would ask the Commission to take our opinions more seriously than those of the group of advisers."
"The group of advisers can give advice, and it can even give advice about problems, but the decision has to be made by the legislator, and if the Commission does not base its proposals on that fact, then there will be friction."
"One last point: it is always argued that in the USA things are much more liberal, and that therefore we cannot be any more stringent."
"In fact, on the question of embryo protection, the USA are more stringent than the group of advisers of the European Commission, because in the USA at least there is no public money for expensive embryo research."
"And that does not exclude advisory groups."
"So that argument does not cut any ice here either."
"Thank you, Mrs Liese, but allow me to explain and absolve Mrs Gradin of all responsibility."
"In debates on oral questions the author of the question - in this case Mrs Gebhardt, deputizing for Mr de Clercq - moves the question and is followed by the Commission representative."
"An administrative mistake occurred today for which I take the blame, putting Mrs Gradin at the bottom of the list."
"When Mrs Gradin was unable to respond immediately to the author of the question, we did our best to put the matter right."
"She did not speak out of turn but we were rectifying a mistake for which I take the blame. I apologize to Mrs Gradin."
"I now give the floor to Mrs Breyer, on behalf of the Green group in the European Parliament."
"Mr President, Mrs Gradin, we in the Green Group do not, in any way, feel able to join in with the congratulations given to the group of advisers on ethics."
"On the contrary, The group of advisers on ethics has proved itself to be a group of hired applauders of the European Commission, and its job is simply to create acceptance for gene technology and biomedicine."
"In its reports and opinions to date, it merely covers the Commission's back as far as ethical issues are concerned, and in its most recent opinion on cloning, even the embryo research that has been prohibited in Germany is declared to be ethically acceptable."
"The cloning of animals is also given an ethical certificate of harmlessness."
"With its opinion on cloning, the group of advisers on ethics has once again proved that as far as they are concerned, it is not a question of the ethical assessment of new technologies, but a question of gaining acceptance."
"It makes no proposals at all about what steps should be taken at international level to stop the cloning of human beings."
"In view of the unsatisfactory reports from the group of advisers, and its obvious role as an acceptance creator, it is completely unthinkable that the ethics advisory group should be congratulated on its work to date in the joint resolution proposed by the Christian Democrats and the Socialists."
"This is a sign of political inadequacy in the European Parliament."
"Mr Liese has already referred to the example of gene manipulation."
"I would also remind the House that the group of advisers on ethics also declared that the Commission's secrecy regulation concerning the novel foods regulation was ethically acceptable, etc. etc."
"The ethics group also meets behind closed doors, and the opinions of Parliament, as Mr Liese has already pointed out, have not been taken into account at all in the group's work so far."
"In its work, the ethics advisory group has very much taken into account the interests of research, and has completely ignored the effects of the new technologies on society."
"The ethics advisory group operates as a sedative pill for the public."
"The discussion about social issues will be avoided altogether, if the public debate is delegated solely to so-called experts chosen by the Commission."
"The ethics advisory group does not inform the public; on the contrary, it tries to mollify public opinion."
"It is therefore completely incomprehensible that these two major political groups should be turning themselves into the lackeys of the EU Commission and the Group of Advisers on Biotechnology Ethics."
"Owing to the one-sided orientation of the group of advisers, and its role as the creator of acceptance for the EU Commission, in our opinion the mandate should not be renewed under any circumstances."
"Mrs Gradin, I can understand that the EU Commission is interested in having someone who will always keep their backs covered where ethical issues are concerned, but when it comes to public debate, this ethics advisory group has made no contribution at all."
"On the contrary!"
"We need to promote public discussion, for example, by holding consensus conferences like they do in Denmark."
"Instead of having an ethics advisory group that meets behind closed doors, we need democratic participation in our dealings with the ethical issues arising form gene technology."
"The human issues should not be left to experts appointed by the Commission, who meet behind closed doors; they must be discussed by society at large."
"My final point is this: the question of what is ethically permissible can only be decided on by society itself, not by competent experts acting as the guardians of that society."
"Mr President, it is true that I was representing the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights."
"Mrs Gradin, thank you for your reply."
"I also believe that it is right to extend the group's mandate until the end of the year, so that work that has been started can be completed properly and in peace. That is very important, so that we do not have to rush to have everything completed by the end of July."
"It is also right that the group should be strengthened."
"However, I must say that your answer did not completely satisfy me, and I would just like to say to my colleagues that this is not the time to be going into the question of the composition of this advisory group."
"The debate that we have to proceed with today is a completely different one."
"I myself have not always been completely happy with the replies that the group of advisers has given."
"That is quite clear, but the problem is that the group has to take decisions, and that actually helps to obscure the decisions."
"I should like to ask you, Commissioner, and the rest of the Commission, to think about whether the mandate of this group of advisers could not perhaps be changed in such a way as to ensure that the group identifies and sets out for the rest of us the main ethical arguments."
"Because it ought to be an advisory group that gives us the tools to take the right decisions, and it should not be compelled, at the end of the day, to take a unified decision."
"This would help to create transparency and would make it clear that we, the European Parliament, the European Commission, and of course the European Council, are the decision makers, rather than the advisory group."
"The advisory group is there to advise, and nothing else."
"And that really needs to be made quite clear."
"Mr Cot has already hit the nail on the head."
"It is also very important that this group should be pluralistic in its composition, and it is also very important that the European Parliament, since we want it to advise us, should be involved in the composition and mandate of this group and should also be able to talk to it."
"This is very important in order to create transparency, which is something that we are demanding, and something that is so important, particularly on issues such as these, that we should be able to show the people, the citizens that we represent, exactly how we work and how we reach our decisions, particularly on such ethically difficult issues such as biotechnology in all its aspects - and you know how many of those aspects there are."
"Just one final point: it is absolutely necessary that the group should be able to work completely independently."
"This must be guaranteed, and it must be one of the conditions that we should examine very carefully, independently from the client, i.e. the European Parliament and the European Commission."
"I have often had the impression that a certain amount of pressure was being put on the group, pushing it in a certain direction."
"It may be that this impression was wrong, but it is an impression that quite simply and naturally occurred to me, as to other Members, and therefore I think we should do everything to ensure that such impressions do not arise."
"Mr Commissioner, I think our debate should concentrate on the role to be played by the group of advisers on biotechnology ethics at European Union level."
"The Union has a duty to regulate sectors of the economy, like biotechnology, which have a determinant influence on the fundamental rights of the human being, like the right to life, physical integrity, identity, and individuality."
"By human being I also mean the human embryo immediately on conception, which is threatened by the interests of much efficiency-minded research."
"Biotechnology also relates to agriculture: in fact we are constantly witnessing the production of transgenic animals and plants."
"We all know that biotechnology in itself is neither good nor bad: it can offer great benefits but it can also create great risks."
"From the economic point of view the Delors report demonstrated what a frontline sector biotechnology really is."
"On the one hand, those who have invested money in research need to get a return through the patents system."
"On the other hand it is true - as I have said - that there are risks: risks of disturbance to the human species and to biological balances."
"That is why I think it is necessary to establish an authority, not at a political level, but at a professional and technical level, without the immediate preoccupation of representing people, without the immediate preoccupation of consensus, where opinions can be expressed in a strictly professional way, but only in terms of consultancy. They cannot replace the final decision by the political authority, far less become blanket opinions, as someone else has already said."
"The Commission provided for this by creating a group of advisers who have given their opinions. It is not appropriate to take positions on the content of those opinions now, although I obviously have personal reservations about some of them."
"As I say, the role this group assumes is important."
"Now, in my opinion, it has gone beyond the function of adviser to the Commission, becoming, consciously or not, I do not know, a sort of ethics committee for the Union."
"But then, if there is to be an ethics committee of the Union, it must have democratic legitimacy, and its members should not be nominated without consulting Parliament and the Council."
"I think there is a duty to remove this ambiguity: do we want to create an ethics committee or extend the role and responsibilities of the group of advisers?"
"In any case it must be clear that there has to be something different and new as compared with what has happened up to now."
"This committee must not become a mere opportunity for certain people to be visible."
"Relations between the European Parliament and the group of advisers or the ethics committee must be clearly regulated."
"Parliament must become a partner of the committee on a par with the Commission, able to ask for opinions about legislation in progress."
"The issues involved are so important, because the European Union is not founded on the market alone, but also on human rights, and human rights are profoundly bound up with ethics."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are seeing the typical Friday effect, as Parliament starts to break up and we are reduced to fewer and fewer Members."
"Therefore I shall be very brief, especially since I have the feeling that Mr Liese or Mr Casini have already expressed, very clearly, what the opinion of our committee is."
"We are in favour, in principle, of extending the mandate, but we are also quite clearly in favour of strengthening Parliament's influence on this advisory committee, and of strengthening cooperation accordingly, because we as a Parliament also have to act as a sort of conscience within the European Union."
"The results produced by the group of advisers so far do not show that the group is fulfilling this function."
"We therefore have a very important task in front of us."
"I just wanted to add that point."
"Mr President, a couple of years ago we as a Parliament rejected the first proposal put forward by the Commission on genetic patenting, and rightly so in my view, because that proposal did not contain an ethical dimension."
"I recall being in the Chamber when that vote was taken and I assumed, perhaps rather naively, that when the Commission reconsidered the whole issue of genetic patenting it would come back with a new proposal which would contain a proper ethical dimension."
"Sadly, so far at least - although next week there is a vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights - we have yet to see a Commission proposal which includes an ethical dimension."
"Dolly the sheep, however, changes everything."
"Dolly has nothing to do with genetic patenting, I concede that, but it has concentrated our mind wonderfully on the ethical issues of biotechnology."
"If it is possible to clone a sheep, it will obviously be possible eventually, whether it is this year or in ten years' time, to clone a human being."
"When we start going down that road, do we play games?"
"Do we allow a human being to be created in the way that Dolly was created and decide then that we have made a mistake?"
"And do we then kill that human being?"
"That is the ethical dilemma."
"Although I can understand why people say that there is no common ethics across the European Union because we all come from different backgrounds, there are some areas where I am confident that we can reach a common cause."
"That should be the function of an ethical committee when established, because I recognize - and it is important that this be said - that biotechnology is the way forward for medicine in the future."
"If it is possible now - and I am told it is - to identify the gene which gives women a propensity to breast cancer, and within five years we will see an elimination of the gene which gives men a propensity to prostate cancer, then, clearly, we must take that kind of advance forward."
"We have to face it."
"I have heard and seen on many radio and television programmes what I regard as naive scientists say: ' why should anyone wish to clone human beings?'"
"I can only recall what happened in the dark days between 1933 and 1945 when the eugenic principle was adopted and put into cruel effect in Germany."
"So we have to be very careful before we accept that there is not going to be any ethical dimension whatsoever."
"I have tabled Amendment No 177 to the Rothley report."
"A compromise has been put forward, which is not yet acceptable."
"What I want to see is the establishment of an ethical committee which would not just meet annually and report but be in a position to spot trends."
"It is important to do that to keep abreast of scientific development."
"Mr President, I would also like to say thank you for this interesting and valuable debate."
"As I have said, the Commission is quite prepared to extend the group's mandate until the end of the year."
"Parallel with this we intend to discuss, within the Commission group responsible for ethical matters, how we will continue this work and what the composition and nature of the mandate will be."
"We ask that we may come back to you on this."
"Mr President, I voted in favour of the motion by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, because it was considerably improved by the amendment proposed by Mr Liese."
"I would also like to point out to Mrs Breyer, however, that this is not a motion from the Socialists and the European People's Party, but a motion from the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, and I would like to say that I very much agree with her assessment of the notorious recommendation No 9, and I regret the fact that what she said, some of which was justified, was not submitted in the form of an amendment to the Legal Committee's motion - because then we could have voted in favour of it - but was moved as a separate motion."
"I would therefore ask that next time you make it possible for us to support your views by proposing an amendment."
"Europe Agreement with Bulgaria"
"The next item is the report (A4-0199/97) by Mrs Erika Mann, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, on the draft Council and Commission Decision on the position to be taken by the Community within the Association Council established by the Europe Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States of the one part, and Bulgaria, of the other part, signed on 8 March 1993, with regard to the adoption of the necessary rules for the implementation of Article 64(1) (I), (II) and (2) of the Europe Agreement (COM(95)528-4390/96 - C4-0089/97-95/0295(CNS))"
"Mr President, you have read out the title of the report quite correctly, and I should like to draw the attention of LL Members to the fact that a journalist, very amused, said to me, ' If you people in Europe always invent titles like that, then you should not be surprised if no one understands the content of these things, because they are much too complicated, and nobody can understand what you are talking about!' ."
"However, I can reassure all Members who are present that it is not really so complicated at all."
"It is, in fact, nothing more than an adjustment to the competition rules between the European Union and the Republic of Bulgaria."
"I think we should really give some thought to the question of why we invent such complicated titles."
"They also have their attractions, and in any case it is a matter of setting out the framework of the implementation provisions that are necessary in order to make this adjustment."
"The European Union and the Republic of Bulgaria have concluded a European Association Agreement, which came into force on 1 February 1995."
"The purpose of the agreement is to establish an association between the two partners to prepare Bulgaria for membership of the European Union."
"Incidentally, Bulgaria applied for EU membership on 16 December 1995, requesting that formal accession negotiations begin at the end of 1997."
"I should like to remind you that in July the Commission will be submitting a proposal to the European Parliament, with regard to how these accession negotiations should proceed and which countries should be involved."
"To that extent, it is also essential that we should reach agreement on this question today."
"I should therefore like to ask all Members of Parliament present to vote in favour of this report."
"In addition - and this is also important - not until seven years after the fall of Communism did the turning point come in Bulgaria."
"Only after the victory by the United Democratic Forces did Bulgaria turn openly to the West and say that it wanted to be a member of the European Union."
"Even more difficult is the question of how membership of NATO might look in future."
"We known that there is still intense debate on this issue, including in Bulgaria itself."
"The so-called free-trade agreements also make it possible to create a free-trade zone on an asymmetrical basis."
"This means that we will open up our market earlier than, and to a different extent from, what we expect from the Bulgarian side."
"In order to ensure that the free-trade zone functions successfully, and to make it easier for Bulgaria to adjust to the European Union, thus making EU membership possible, the European (and interim) agreements, for which the European Union alone is responsible, and which have been concluded with all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, contain detailed basic rules on competition, which are virtually identical to those contained in the EC Treaty."
"The purpose of the Association Agreement is to adjust national competition law of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, to bring it into line with the Community law of the European Union."
"This is the subject of the report that we shall be voting on today."
"For this to be possible, a package of implementing provisions under Article 64 of the Europe Agreement will have to come into force."
"This also has to be done - and I think that this is quite right - before the Association Council takes its decision, and this means that a joint position must be adopted by the European Union."
"The European Parliament has to be consulted - and I should just like to mention this here - on the basis of Article 87 in conjunction with Article 228(2) and (3)."
"This consultation is, moreover, compulsory."
"The implementing provisions must be completed within three years of the date on which the Europe Agreement comes into force."
"These implementing provisions - and this is really something very exciting - contain all the rules, as I have already mentioned, all the competition provisions that are set out in the EC Treaty."
"It is a question of adjusting Bulgarian national competition law to bring it into line with competition law in the European Union."
"It is a matter of recommending, observing and developing an effective competition policy."
"This is also the key that will ensure that all the CCEEs are able to create an effective market economy."
"This is necessary so that they can allow effective access to their markets and, of course, so that they can gain access to our markets."
"Part of this effective competition policy will consist of a legal framework, and then the implementation of competition policy, and then of course control."
"The authority responsible on our side is Directorate General IV, and on the Bulgarian side it is the Competition Protection Commission."
"Allow me to make a comment here. I believe that we cannot keep on loading more and more responsibilities onto Directorate General IV, without at the same time asking ourselves whether Directorate General IV should have more staff."
"As we know, it already has a wide range of tasks to carry out, and it is no longer in a position to carry out these tasks in detail, and as thoroughly as it needs to."
"We, as the European Parliament, will soon have to ask ourselves what recommendations we might make in order to change this situation as quickly as possible."
"One of the basic principles of competition policy is notification, in other words, an indication must be given of everything that is compulsorily notifiable, in the context of competition policy, both on the Bulgarian side and also on the side of the European Union."
"Another of these basic principles is the responsibility - as I have already mentioned - of a competition authority, to ensure that it is possible for information to be sought by both sides, as well as the exchange of secret and confidential information, and the range of group exemptions that are available."
"Then again, there is the principle of ensuring that arrangements are made concerning the way in which less important procedures are handled, and of ensuring that the Association Council is always concerned to find acceptable solutions when there are problems."
"Finally, there is also the principle whereby, in a case that does not involve both competition authorities - in other words when only one competition authority is competent, that authority keeps the other competition authority informed about the details of the case in question."
"As you can see, that is the normal framework and the normal range of options that we are used to working with in the European Union."
"We also know how important these have become now: we only have to look at the rows and disputes that have arisen, in the case of Boeing, for example, and in many other cases as well."
"We know that we need a basis for trust, and we need a common basis for all the countries that are linked to the European Union within the framework of the Association Agreements, so as to ensure that there is a common competition policy within this framework."
"On the other hand, however, we also need a satisfactory, secure package, in order to be able to protect our interests in an international context."
"This is going to become even more important in future."
"Naturally this includes fairness, in other words, it means that we tolerate and respect the fact that the CCEEs are in a process of political, economic and social transformation, and it means that we accept that they have other historically-determined prerequisites."
"We also tolerate the difference between France, Germany and England etc. All these things are involved in this package."
"This is why the procedure for the negotiations that will be taking place in the Association Council and between the individual competition authorities is so important."
"The European Parliament has an important role to play, and I am always pleased about the fact that in the Committee on External Economic Relations we are competent to fulfil that function."
"Once again, may I ask you to vote in favour of its proposal, and to consult it often in future about this common competition policy."
"Mr President, Mrs Gradin, ladies and gentlemen. It is better to be with one another than against one another."
"The friendly adjustment of Bulgaria's competition rules to bring them into line with the European Union is better than the possible use of trade-policy instruments against Bulgaria."
"That could be the leitmotiv of Mrs Mann's excellent report, which she has just presented to us and which we now have to come to a decision on."
"The Group of the European People's Party also emphatically supports the proposal for a joint position by the Council."
"We agree that trade between the European Union and Bulgaria can be put on a fair footing by applying the proposed provisions, so that it can rapidly expand and improve."
"This adjustment to existing Community law is an important step along Bulgaria's not so easy path towards membership of the European Union."
"I therefore thoroughly support Mrs Mann's report."
"However, perhaps I could just say something about the financial aid that we had do decide on this morning, without a debate, using the urgency procedure."
"We believe that ECU 250 million over a running time of 10 years is an excellent starting aid for the new Bulgarian government, which is making a determined effort to reform the public budgets and to create the legal framework conditions for a social market economy."
"The Prime Minister, Mr Kostov, and his Foreign Minister, in their talks with the Group of the European People's Party in Brussels last week, convinced us that the reforming powers that have come together in the new Democratic Union will quickly set about the task of modernizing the state and the economy."
"We have asked the Commission to provide the necessary assistance in a rapid and nonbureaucratic manner, and thus help the Bulgarian people to emerge quickly from a serious economic crisis and come closer to joining the European Union."
"However, today, on 13 June, we really cannot see why the Commission did not consult the Committee on External Economic Relations immediately after the adoption of its submission on 22 May."
"The Committee on External Economic Relations would not have had any difficulty, at its meeting in May, in drawing up a report, and submitting it today."
"Such negligence on the part of the Commission will not be tolerated by Parliament in future. May I also ask Mrs Gradin, very nicely - she is, after all, not responsible for this - to ask Mr Van den Broek and Sir Leon Brittan to consult us quickly, in future, on similar cases, and to ensure that this farce of a procedure is not repeated."
"Mr President, adoption of this report, of this very precise and lucid report by Mrs Mann, presents no particular difficulty."
"It covers the implementation of competition rules to prevent distortions in trade with Bulgaria."
"What is important, however, Mr President, is the message which goes out to the Bulgarian authorities along with adoption of the report."
"Mr Schwaiger has referred to the package that has been put together to cover the financial needs of the restructuring of the Bulgarian economy."
"We should remember that the European Union is not the only body which is contributing to the restructuring of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, and thus of Bulgaria, and that the concessions that the European Union has already made in the agreements that have been concluded, even though they accelerate access for those countries to the European Union, to the Community market, in the industrial products sector, constitute only a relative advantage because the overall framework of relations is shaped out in a much more general form by the GATT agreements."
"Thus we ourselves are dealing with individual aspects."
"What I think is of much greater importance, Mr President, is the message that must be sent to Bulgaria, and to the Bulgarian people directly, concerning the question of membership of the European Union."
"As you know, eventual membership of the Union is a main policy aim of the Bulgarian Government, and it is only on the basis of such a policy and institutional resolution of the problems that these agreements can have real content."
"Because if we simply conclude one separate agreement after another, to be implemented as per the case and in the absence of an overall political framework through which their proper implementation can be secured, we shall be simply be approaching matters in an ad hoc fashion rather than on an overall basis."
"Since membership of the European Union is a main policy aim of nearly all of the Bulgarian democratic parties, I think that agreements of this type are definitely likely to culminate in membership negotiations and eventual membership and that that in itself serves as a guarantee of their implementation."
"Mr President, we support Mrs Mann's report, which makes it abundantly clear that the same conditions must be created for all the associated candidate countries."
"I believe that this is absolutely essential, because our expansion policy and our policy towards Eastern Europe are at risk of coming up against a dead-end, as a result of our selecting, in a most extreme fashion, certain preferred candidates, thereby creating a larger group of wallflowers."
"I am against this, because things are never clearly black and white, but rather various shades of grey."
"We have only to look at what happened yesterday, in the Mixed Committee consisting of the Czech Parliament and the European Parliament, where they had such difficulty, in connection with the new levies that have to be paid, in getting the Czech Republic to undertake to give securities on the basis of European law and the Association Agreements currently in force, to see that even those who are first in the queue can still have problems."
"On the other hand, we have hardly talked about Bulgaria at all, and I am of the opinion that we should really bring about equality of competition, and we should, above all, make it clear that the European Union, as we understand it, is not a community of laws, and that Community law, including within the framework of the Association Agreements, only has to be observed after accession, and it is simply not acceptable that Community law can be broken in the pre-accession phase."
"This is why it is so important to take into consideration competition law."
"This is why it is so important to create fair conditions for Bulgaria and not to give her the Cinderella treatment!"
"Mr President, let me begin by congratulating Mrs Mann on her report on the rules of competition under Article 64 in the European Agreement with Bulgaria."
"The final decision, as has already been said, will be taken by the Association Council EU-Bulgaria."
"When it is adopted, in the form of a resolution, it will mean another important step towards the European Agreement and Bulgaria's preparations for future membership of the European Union."
"The decision defines the grounds for a healthy competition policy."
"It also provides a framework for cooperation between the competition authorities in Bulgaria and the Commission."
"It even includes regulations for resolving potential conflicts."
"The Commission shares the Honourable Member's view that agreements are needed on how the State subsidy regulations are to be implemented."
"Strictly speaking, this is not covered in this proposal as it forms part of separate legislation."
"The Association countries and the Member States are currently negotiating this legislation in the Council."
"Negotiations on state subsidies have proved far more complicated than the proposal which we are discussing here today."
"The Commission and the Council working party have thankfully reached an agreement on the implementation of a first round of state subsidy regulations for Czechoslovakia."
"So we will be able to use the Czech regulations as an illustration in the continuing negotiations."
"Mr President, the rapporteur maintains that the Council and Commission's proposal, particularly point 7, does not include regulations on the control of company mergers, i.e. merger control ."
"Let me clarify the position: The first proposal did not raise this issue."
"But it is present in the current document."
"In October 1996, the Commission took the decision to introduce a separate point No. 7 specifically to cover the merger of companies."
"Let me conclude by once again thanking Mrs Mann for her constructive and positive report."
"Mr President, I should just like to come back on the point raised by Mrs Gradin."
"You are quite right: merger control is also included."
"I forgot to mention it."
"It is not yet included in my report."
"Please excuse me."
"However, I must also say that the procedure by which we all receive documents, is very difficult. What I mean is, that we ought to have obtained information about the subsequent negotiations that you conducted whilst the old report was still being discussed."
"Usually, we Members of Parliament arrange things so that we go to the Commission and ask what negotiations are currently in progress."
"However, as you can see, in some cases it happens like this."
"I hope you will forgive us."
"We had actually already corrected it in this form in the debate in committee."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament approved the legislative resolution)"
"Norwegian salmon dumping"
"The next item is the debate on the statement by the Commission on the dumping of Norwegian salmon."
"Mr President, on 1 June the Commission approved a package of measures, including a price floor, the prospect of standby dumping duties, an indicative export volume ceiling, an increased Norwegian export tax and tight enforcement procedures that will counteract the dumping and subsidization of Norwegian salmon on the European market and eliminate the damage caused to European salmon producers in the process."
"Under the measures negotiated and agreed with Norway, Norwegian salmon exporters will respect a minimum price per kilo which, if broken, would automatically lead to the imposition of duties when selling to the European Union."
"There would also be an indicative ceiling on the rate at which Norway could increase exports over the next five years as well as an increase in Norway's own tax on salmon exports and a tight monitoring and enforcement regime to ensure that the terms of the agreement are upheld."
"The negotiations followed an investigation which showed that Norwegian salmon was being dumped and subsidized between 1995 and 1996, harming the interests of the European, mainly Scottish, salmon farmers."
"The complainant industries in the Community have been fully informed of the context of this package and have given indications that they find it broadly satisfactory."
"The Commission is holding regular meetings with the Community industry in order to discuss all the practical aspects of implementation and monitoring of these measures."
"The Commission has regularly informed the salmon subcommittee of the Committee on Fisheries of the details of this case, most recently at a meeting in Brussels last week."
"Throughout these investigations and subsequent negotiations with the Norwegian side, the Commission's main preoccupation has always been to protect the Scottish and Irish salmon farmers from unfair trading practices."
"The Commission is aware of the difficult situation in which salmon farmers in the Community located in rural and often depressed regions find themselves."
"Having given serious consideration to the situation, the Commission considers that the package of measures on offer, which has been the object of extensive negotiations with Norway, constitutes an effective defence of the interests of the Community industry."
"A five-year period of price stability and increased opportunities to compete under free and fair conditions can now be looked forward to."
"Briefly, the package consists of the following measures: minimum price undertakings."
"Norwegian salmon exporters will undertake to sell into the European Union market above an agreed minimum price per kilo."
"This minimum price will operate for five years."
"Norwegian exporters will have to show that their weighted average price over the three-month period does not fall below this price floor."
"Furthermore, it cannot fall below 85 % of the minimum price on any single transaction."
"There will be a review clause to take account of market changes."
"As in all anti-dumping cases, each party including the Commission and the complainants retain the right to request or initiate a review."
"If a Norwegian exporter does not respect the minimum price, he will be liable to pay anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties that will be on standby."
"The Commission will shortly propose the standby duties to the Council."
"They will apply to all those Norwegian salmon exporters who do not sign the agreement."
"Those who do not sign will get an exemption, but this will become null and void if they fail to comply with the price floor."
"The Commission has already received statements from a number of Norwegian salmon exporting associations, saying they will urge their members to adhere to the minimum price."
"There will be an indicative ceiling on the increase of Norwegian salmon sales over the next five years."
"1997 sales may not exceed 1996 sales by more than 11 % or by 10 % for every year thereafter up until 2002."
"The salmon market has, in fact, expanded by an average of 18 % a year for the last four years."
"The Norwegian authorities will increase their own export tax on Norwegian salmon from 0.75 % to 3 %."
"This will rise to 6 % if the export ceiling is breached."
"Monitoring and enforcement of the agreement will be tight, especially regarding the minimum price."
"The Commission will have the right to examine the accounts of any Norwegian salmon exporter to make sure that prices quoted are not artificially high in relation to the real ceiling price."
"Furthermore, the Commission will be empowered to check this against the accounts of related importers."
"Statistics on export volumes and prices will be provided on a weekly basis and there will be regular consultation between the Commission and the Norwegian Government to examine general and specific questions arising from the salmon market and to ensure that the terms of the agreement are respected."
"Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for that very full explanation of the problem."
"The only difficulty is that it is a bit late."
"What she read out to the House was contained in the press release which the Commission issued after the negotiations."
"Time and time again some of us in this House, particularly in the Committee on Fisheries, are told after the event."
"Under Article 90 of the Rules of Procedure of this House, the Commission is duty bound to consult with us on international agreements."
"This House has the right of dissent from these agreements."
"Is the Commission going to bring forward something in writing?"
"Yesterday, for example, we had in Parliament a Norwegian delegation discussing this."
"Those on the European side were somewhat handicapped in that they did not have before them the evidence which the Commissioner has just read before this House."
"The Commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, has behaved abominably over this issue."
"He has not taken this House into his confidence, which he should have done."
"We have been ignored and slighted; we have read about what has been happening in the newspapers."
"It is not good enough for the European Parliament, which was responsible for significant agreements."
"Neither the Rex Committee nor the Committee on Fisheries have had a major exposition on this matter by Sir Leon Brittan whereas some other committees have had some discussion."
"The Commission has to learn some lessons from this issue."
"I am leaving the question of the dangers and problems created for the Scottish and Irish industries to others in this House."
"I want to concentrate on the comitology aspect."
"We are not happy about what has happened in this event."
"I would like to make this point most forcibly, but Sir Leon Brittan is globetrotting somewhere else today and is not here to give us an explanation."
"Thank you, Mr President, and thank you, Commissioner, for your statement."
"I would like to congratulate Alan Macartney for his dexterity in keeping this matter before you as a Commission and making sure that we got a statement today."
"Alan Macartney deserves our thanks too."
"Madam Commissioner, you have just said to us that the producers in the European Union seem to be relatively happy with the outcome of the decisions that have been taken by the Commission and Norway."
"Well they would be would not they?"
"Anything would be better than what they have been facing in the recent past."
"They were faced with bankruptcy and anything was going to be a relief to them."
"I do not know that the statement that we hear from you is really going to be best for the future of salmon producers within the European Community."
"A minimum price will certainly help, but it will also help the Norwegians."
"They are going to know that they are going to get a satisfactory price for what they send into the Community yet they are still going to get their subsidies in Norway."
"There is nothing to stop the Norwegian Government still assisting their producers and making an even more unlevel playing field."
"You then say that there are going to be tight enforcement procedures."
"I hope that is true."
"I hope that is going to be followed through properly because what has happened in the past is that Norway has sent salmon into countries such as Denmark at the minimum price, and it was then processed and came out of those factories at a very much lower price than it originally went in."
"That is where all the problems have actually arisen."
"I hope that you will follow through on the tight enforcement procedures and make sure that does not happen in future."
"My great concern is that Norway has had the advantage of expanding its salmon farming quite considerably in recent years."
"We now recognize, as your report has done, that there was some undermining of the European market and the Norwegians were able to gain market share when our own producers did not have that opportunity."
"I am now concerned for the future that those salmon producers in Norway have reached such a size and economic value that they are in a very strong position to start buying up some of the companies in the peripheral areas of the European Community."
"If that were to happen it would be a travesty and the European Commission would be indicted for allowing that to happen."
"Mr President, it is good to have the Commission statement, and I thank Mrs Gradin for coming and making it."
"What many Members who have no direct interest in the salmon industry have asked me at the last couple of part-sessions is: how can it be that a non-member of the EU can have such a good deal at the expense of producers within the European Union?"
"If you are in any doubt, ask any Norwegian who is involved in the industry for their reaction to the deal."
"In the words of one correspondent who telephoned Norway immediately afterwards, they are 'cock-a-hoop' that they have escaped punitive duties."
"I hear from other sources, including the Norwegian Ambassador to the EU, that he is very happy with the agreement."
"The Norwegians' happiness must be at the expense of what should have happened, namely the automatic imposition of duties on 1 June by the Commission."
"That was the alternative."
"Everything that is said in this immensely complicated package has to be measured against the dissatisfaction at finding out that the Norwegians, who have been found guilty of subsidy and dumping, are getting out of gaol, so to speak, or certainly escaping a fine."
"There are still one or two questions to be answered, and I am not sure whether Mrs Gradin can answer them today."
"They certainly have to be answered as soon as possible."
"One is the point about still having to go to the Council and then to the Commission before any action can be taken."
"If any Norwegian producer is in transgression of the rules, there still has to be a decision by the Council authorizing the Commission; there then has to be a subsequent decision by the Commission authorizing, as I understand it, Sir Leon Brittan's Directorate-General to impose the duties."
"So instead of 1 June, I presume it will be the end of September before one can realistically expect anything, and then only provided there are no hiccups."
"This is the package and the delay is the price paid by the industry."
"To emphasise yet again, as Mrs Gradin and others have pointed out, it is the vulnerable peripheral communities who will pay that price and the Norwegians will be laughing all the way to the bank."
"The debate is closed."
"Adjournment of the session"
"Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to thank the Presidency's services for their cooperation."
"I must also add that there was an inexplicable gap in our hemicycle at the last two part-sessions: Mr von Habsburg was not here."
"All became clear when we learned that he had had an accident."
"Fortunately, he has recovered quickly and we are thankful for that."
"I am particularly happy to have him here every Friday, dignifying our sittings."
"Thank you all for your cooperation. Today it was particularly welcome as I have succumbed to a spring bout of pharyngitis, but at least it has reminded me how sensitive I am to the Spring, and that is no bad thing."
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.38 a.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 13 June 1997."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of the sitting of 13 June 1997 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, Friday's Minutes correctly record my protest that the plenary did not discuss financial aid for Bulgaria and Macedonia."
"The President also told me that according to her information that was the decision of the Committee on External Economic Relations."
"Let me make it quite clear that the Committee on External Economic Relations unanimously decided the contrary!"
"After all, this was an urgency, which we approved on Tuesday morning."
"The committee met on Tuesday evening in Strasbourg and decided unanimously that its chairman or a representative would present an oral report; and then suddenly, on Friday morning, we heard that there would not be a debate."
"I am absolutely in favour of accelerated procedures, but to find that an important political question, involving a lot of money, is not discussed either in committee or in plenary is quite contrary to parliamentary procedure and our Rules of Procedure!"
"Mr Posselt, I shall find out exactly what happened and let you know."
"Mr President, I want to speak on a point of procedure."
"In February I put a question to the Office of the Presidency on the building work in Strasbourg."
"Well, four months have gone by and I have received no reply whatsoever."
"This is no way for Parliament to operate!"
"I demand an urgent reply to my question, and to questions from other Members who are having to wait too long in contempt of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr Florio, the draft reply to your question was put before the Bureau this morning."
"The Bureau considered that a fuller answer was required, so the question is still pending and due for approval on 10 July in order to give you a fuller reply."
"Mr President, following on from what Mr Posselt said, let me point out that the Commission decided on financial aid for Bulgaria as early as mid-May, that the documents were available and that the Commission could have consulted us in the usual way via the Council."
"That did not happen either."
"As I pointed out in Strasbourg on Friday: in future different procedures should be introduced, not just at Parliament level but also in relation to the consultation procedure applied by the Commission and the Council vis Ã  vis the Committee on External Economic Relations."
"Otherwise we will not be able to carry out our important duties."
"Thank you very much, Mr Schwaiger."
"As I said to Mr Posselt, I shall find out what has happened and give you an answer."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Welcome"
"Urgent political matters"
"The next item on the agenda is a communication by the Commission on the economic agenda of the Amsterdam European Council and the Denver Summit."
"I call upon Mr Commissioner de Silguy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President Santer has asked me to report to you on the economic results of the European Council in Amsterdam and the G7 meeting held last weekend in Denver, Colorado."
"There are three principal messages emerging from these two international meetings."
"The euro is now an established reality, which is a good thing for Europe and a good thing for the world; the economic climate is developing satisfactorily, and employment has become the first economic priority of the national governments."
"First, the euro."
"The G7 summit ratified the results of the Amsterdam Council."
"The euro is here to stay."
"All the evidence I need is the completion of the preparatory work associated with its introduction, and the acknowledgement of its international dimension."
"The European Council in Amsterdam definitively adopted the legal framework for the euro, which, I should remind you, comprises three essential elements: the resolution on the new form of the European Monetary System; the two Regulations creating the legal status of the euro, in other words the monetary law of Europe for the year 2000; and the two Regulations - one preventive, one deterrent - which together with the Amsterdam resolution make up the Pact for Stability and Growth."
"This framework, which is necessary for the proper functioning of economic and monetary union, has been devised in close co-operation with this House."
"It will encourage growth and employment while preventing or correcting excessive public spending deficits."
"The European Council in Amsterdam also gave a specific mandate to the Commission, the Council and the European Monetary Institute on the work needed to place the international role of the euro on a clear and solid basis."
"Furthermore, in Denver, the coming of the euro was internationally recognized."
"The G7, in its communiquÃ©, emphasized for the first time that economic and monetary union, based on sound economic policies and structural reforms, would make a valuable contribution to the stability of the international monetary system."
"Secondly, the economic situation."
"As well as a favourable economic climate, the need for structural adjustments was confirmed in both Amsterdam and Denver."
"Regarding the economic climate, the Denver summit offered an opportunity to compare the situation in Europe with that in the United States, in particular."
"Over and above the traditional contrast between the American and European models, a very largely artificial contrast in my view, it became clearly apparent that the major difference between the two continents was the confidence the Americans felt in the power of their economy - a confidence which, sadly, is still lacking in Europe."
"And yet the European economy today is undergoing a genuine recovery, sustained by the efforts of the Member States to meet the convergence criteria as they prepare for economic and monetary union."
"The growth of the Community GDP - which was 1.6 % in 1996 - should reach 2.4 % in 1997 and 2.8 % in 1998."
"This return to a higher rate of growth should allow a net increase of two million in the number of jobs in Europe over the two years 1997 and 1998."
"Apart from the return of growth, a substantial reduction in European unemployment from its present intolerable, demoralizing level will be achieved through structural reforms - especially those affecting the employment market, education and research - and through improving the competitiveness of business."
"To be effective, however, those reforms are going to have to be universal, ambitious, socially sustainable and politically presentable."
"Incidentally, an interesting new fact that emerged in Denver was the link that exists between demographics, social systems and budget deficits because of the irreversible problem of the ageing population, especially in Europe."
"This ageing is significant."
"A single figure proves the point: the ratio of the non-working to the working population is expected to increase from 25 % to 51 % between 1995 and 2040."
"In the absence of any change in policy, this trend will result in a long-term deterioration of public finances, and pension costs could increase from 3 to 4 % of GDP between now and 2030."
"So there is no escaping the need to continue the policy of budgetary adjustment."
"The budgetary framework introduced by economic and monetary union, designed to re-establish the balance of public spending in the medium term, will release room for manoeuvre."
"And that can be utilized to finance welfare and pension systems."
"Over and above that, however, the need for progressive structural reforms was emphasized by the G7, especially as regards the reform of the pension systems and the role delegated to the pension funds."
"That, in essence, is one of the strong messages sent out both by the European Council in Amsterdam and by the G7 meeting in Denver."
"Thirdly, we come to employment and the co-ordination of economic policies."
"At the initiative of President Santer, the European Council in Amsterdam adopted a resolution on growth and employment, whereby the Member States, the Commission and the Council have given a firm commitment to make employment a top priority concern of the Union and a priority aim of their economic policies."
"In this context, the European Council recalls that sound macroeconomic and budgetary policies go hand-in-hand with strong, sustainable growth in terms of output and employment."
"Very symbolically, the European Council put both the resolution on the implementation of the Pact for Stability and Growth and the resolution on growth and employment under a single political umbrella: ' Stability, growth and employment' ."
"The European Council adopted two guiding principles to strengthen the place of employment at the heart of economic policy."
"The first was the development of the economic pillar of economic and monetary union."
"According to Articles 102a and 103 of the Treaty, the broad guidelines will be extended to cover competitiveness, the employment market, technological innovation, education, training and taxation, with a view to harnessing all economic policy in the interests of employment."
"In practice, the Council, acting on a proposal by the Commission, will be able to issue specific recommendations on these matters to the Member States."
"This is a significant advance along the lines of better co-ordination of economic policies such as this House regularly demands."
"The second guiding principle is the early implementation of the 'employment' chapter of the Amsterdam Treaty, without even waiting for it to be ratified."
"In this way, the Council will be able to make recommendations on employment policy."
"Finally, it will have a legal basis for making practical decisions to promote employment."
"The Commission will of course take full account of these two guiding principles in preparing the broad guidelines of economic policy for 1998."
"However, in order to be able to implement these European Council recommendations without delay, the Commission means to give concrete form to this new stimulus to employment, beginning with the extraordinary meeting of the European Council in Luxembourg devoted to this subject."
"This Council will decide on the concrete form to be taken by the new initiatives for employment adopted in Amsterdam."
"A particular priority here will be extending the role and activities of the EIB."
"Another will be the ECSC, where it has been suggested that a reserve fund should be set up to use the proceeds of the income available from 2002 to speed up research in sectors linked to the coal and steel industry."
"The Commission and Council have been invited to prepare, jointly with the EIB, a report on all these matters - and on many others, too, especially the SMEs - for this special European Council."
"Parliament will, of course, be involved in our work."
"This new stimulus to employment that has been decided on here in Europe will go hand-inhand with similar initiatives on a global scale - that decision was taken in Denver."
"For example, we have the forthcoming meeting at KobÃ© in November 1997, followed by the 'employment' G7 early in 1998 at the initiative of the British Prime Minister."
"In conclusion, may I emphasize the fact that both the Amsterdam Council and the G7 summit in Denver have sent out a message of optimism to Europe, a message that will help restore its self-confidence."
"The European Union faced a more difficult initial situation than its American counterpart, but Europe today is pushing ahead on the path to economic progress and structural reform."
"The first encouraging results are already apparent."
"The prospects for growth in Europe have not been so favourable for some years, and their effects should soon be felt in terms of competitiveness and employment."
"Finally, I should add that the impending introduction of the euro, in accordance with the conditions and timetable laid down in the Treaty, will provide a further boost to the recovery of economic activity in Europe."
"Commissioner, you have referred to the irreversible problem of an ageing population in Europe, and you have also referred very frequently to the need for essential reforms."
"So let me ask you a few questions: do you not think that one very important reform, intellectually, would be to review the excessively narrow concept of economic criteria that are accepted at these conferences, and that it might be high time to take account of a suggestion made by the World Summit on Social Development held in Copenhagen in 1995 which called for the child-rearing tasks performed within the family to be included in economic calculations?"
"Do you not think that, since family policies in all European countries are recording a reduction in family purchasing power, that the time has surely come to reform our economic programmes and take account, at long last, of the wishes of those European couples, those European women, who would like to have children but are unable to do so because of economic constraints?"
"Might not the best way to revitalize the economy in Europe be a process of demographic revitalization, which is a matter of political will and intellectual reform?"
"For my part, I see no incompatibility between demographic revitalization, an intellectual reform and a straightforward recognition of economic realities."
"Like it or not, Mrs Seillier, we are currently in a situation where the 'baby boom' generation still forms part of the active population, but from 2010 onwards we shall have an extremely serious demographic shortfall in Europe."
"The question that faces governments today is whether they may not already be able to address the problem, in political terms, to prevent today's working generations from facing retirement with pensions that are not sufficient to enable them to live."
"The issue today, Mrs Seillier, is to pursue our endeavours in the field of economic policy that are specifically designed to bring back to our national economies sufficient budgetary room to manoeuvre to enable them to bear the increasingly heavy burden of social spending in future years."
"Of course, that is no obstacle at all to efforts to develop and strengthen the role of the family, in the context of child-rearing and family policy, though as far as that is concerned, I believe that personal considerations are often more important than purely economic ones."
"Mr President, I was appointed on behalf of this House as rapporteur on the demographic situation in Europe."
"It is not so long ago that this report was adopted by Parliament, on which occasion much attention was rightly paid to the ability to pay pensions."
"If I may, I should like to differ from the Commissioner in regard to the fact of it being impossible to fund pensions in the future."
"It is much more a question of making a start at the appropriate time and of applying the correct system."
"In the past I asked for this question of pensions, including supplementary pensions, private pensions and government pensions, to be placed on the agenda of the European Commission."
"Subsidiarity had previously applied in this area."
"My specific question to the Commission is therefore: With a view to the employment summit can this become a matter for both the Commission and the national governments?"
"I entirely agree with Mrs Boogerd-Quaak: we need to act before it is too late and take precautions to deal with this matter, though I must add that the problem is made worse by the fact that an ageing population means increasing expenditure on health."
"After all, it is clear that more and more elderly people are often in need of care which is proving more and more costly."
"In financial terms, then, the problem is complicated by the existence of a link between an ageing population and increasing expenditure on pensions and health care."
"The Commission is of course taking a close interest in this matter, which is why, in my oral presentation, I made a point of stressing this problem of ageing."
"At the discussions that took place in Denver, the Commission's contribution on this subject was particularly extensive and much appreciated."
"I can also tell Mrs Boogerd-Quaak that this question is primarily of concern to the Member States because, in view of the principle of subsidiarity and as the Treaty stands, we cannot act for the Member States. But this problem does indisputably have a Community dimension - a European dimension."
"For this reason, and especially as we prepare for the extraordinary meeting of the European Council in Luxembourg before the end of this year, the proposals and recommendations that the Commission will make will take careful account of your suggestion."
"The Commission will take steps to ensure that these questions are perceived by the Member States in a co-ordinated way, and in particular that they exchange information on the measures implemented by each of them."
"I would add that very special attention will be paid to the problem of pension funds."
"Mr President, I have two short questions for the Commissioner:"
"The first is: at the Summit Conference in Luxembourg will the Commission contribute to discussions concerning certain additional financial items to support employment policy?"
"Because from Essen we know that employment policy cannot be made effective, or at least, jobs cannot be created, by words alone."
"The second question is: I heard a Minister for Economics - one of those who took part in Amsterdam - saying at a public meeting that it is conceivable that the Euro's beginning might be postponed for a year."
"I know you will deny this, but I would like to hear you repeat it emphatically."
"I can answer your second question immediately."
"I was there, from start to finish: I was at the Council of Finance Ministers in Luxembourg early this month, I was at the European Council and I was at the Denver summit, and I never heard anyone mention the possibility of postponing the euro."
"Indeed, on each occasion I found that all the participants -European and non-European, including the Americans - were firmly committed to complying with the timetable."
"And that determination was reflected in the communiquÃ©s, decisions and official comments that were issued."
"Secondly, and dealing more specifically with that European Council, I should perhaps add to what I said earlier: among the initiatives adopted in Amsterdam there is one that relates specifically to extending the role of the EIB, in three ways."
"Firstly, by establishing a special facility to finance projects by high-technology SMEs; secondly by broadening the scope of the bank's interventions to education, health, the urban environment and environmental protection; and lastly by easing the repayment period for loans to the trans-European networks."
"I also said just now that funds would be released from the ECSC reserves, especially with a view to creating a research fund for research in sectors linked to the coal and steel industry."
"I can also tell you that the Council will study initiatives to look into the possibilities of creating jobs for SMEs on the basis of a new report by the Advisory Committee on Competitiveness."
"Finally, the Council will also study good practice in each Member State in employment policy."
"On all these matters, I believe that the mandate is sufficiently detailed and sufficiently substantial to enable to Commission to present specific proposals to the European Council - proposals capable of bringing at least a partial answer to the present problems of unemployment."
"Mr President, thank you for taking up the question of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We have seen over recent decades that most jobs have come from small firms, that new enterprises can create a great many jobs and that the SLIM initiatives in particular are designed to relieve the burden on these firms and can therefore also produce greater competitiveness."
"What do you think the chances are in Luxembourg of making use of the training programmes, by increasing the appropriations for this area?"
"For I believe that training is the only means of really efficient job-creation."
"There are two different answers to your question."
"First, training is a critical requirement of SMEs."
"That is undeniable, it is clear, and we are working on it. But training is also one of the essential aspects to be implemented in the context of the ambitious Europe-wide structural policies which we must pursue in order to remedy the structural causes of unemployment."
"Secondly, bearing in mind the importance of the contribution made by the SMEs in terms of employment, the emphasis placed on these enterprises goes well beyond the aspect of training alone."
"In particular, the new approach being asked of the EIB - that it should release resources to enable SMEs, especially those working in leading-edge sectors which, by definition, are the ones that create jobs - should enable more resources to be made available to the SMEs."
"I would add, on this point, that the Commission has already tabled a number of proposals and made a number of recommendations which are, or have been, under consideration by Parliament."
"They are now in the hands of the Council, but some of them have been blocked at that level, and I deplore that."
"Even so, it will not prevent us, as we prepare for the special European Council in Luxembourg, from attaching particular importance to the SMEs and to their role in the campaign against the structural causes of unemployment; and, of course, within that framework, very special attention will be paid to questions of training."
"Mr Commissioner, today you have mentioned that the economic environment is favourable to improving the economic position of the Member States."
"The Italian papers have certainly emphasized the points you made about Italy from the statements you made yesterday."
"And we all remember the snapshot of Italy you gave us in this Chamber a couple of months ago."
"I now want to ask you two questions."
"Taking advantage of your presence here today, I would like to hear from your own lips your view of the situation in Italy and your opinion of Italy's chances of meeting the criteria."
"And secondly, what is the main reason for this change in the Italian position?"
"In reply to your second question, Mr Arroni, I would say that the political intent is certainly that of the Italian Government."
"What I said about Italy yesterday was the result of an analysis, a finding that shows that Italy is currently achieving highly impressive advances when it comes to economic convergence."
"And if Italy achieves the ambitions that its government has adopted, it will this year have achieved the greatest reduction in public indebtedness achieved by any European country in the last 15 years."
"Otherwise, as the government has not yet officially disclosed its convergence programme, I could not offer any precise assessment of it in public."
"Having said that, and bearing in mind the facts known to me, I did say that the objectives put forward, especially in the Italian 'Economic and financial planning document' , are sound."
"Moreover, the areas singled out by the government for budgetary reform are appropriate: pensions, social security, the civil service and the broadening of the tax base."
"I also added, and this may have received less coverage in the press, that the moment of truth would come in September when the government presents specific measures designed to give concrete form to these objectives, measures which, I believe, will be included in the 1998 budget."
"So it is out of the question at this stage to launch a premature examination, to make the Member States undergo a qualification test."
"The examination will take place in March 1998, based on the real results for 1997."
"What I can say today is that there is no doubt that the situation in Italy is developing along the right lines."
"That is encouraging, and it suggests to me that, if countries have the necessary political will comply with the timetables and conditions set out in the Maastricht Treaty for joining the single currency, they will succeed in doing so."
"Mr President, measures to get Europe back to work, that was the Commissioner's message to us today from Amsterdam."
"And we listened to it and certainly see it as a positive step."
"But I would like the Commission to tell me what action it is now taking to define the basic economic policy measures the Community and the Member States should take."
"If you, the Commission, and if the European Council took the recommendations by this House seriously and incorporated them in your own proposals, we might have different economic and employment policy results from those we have seen in the past following from your recommendations."
"Please tell us how this can be changed, for what the EU ministers of finance proposed in the past was not enough to really get Europe back to work."
"My second question, Commissioner, is as follows: I fully appreciate that you are also concerned with the international role of the euro."
"But I would like to know one thing: are you also thinking of the consumer, of consumer protection?"
"When will we finally have a regulation to ensure that EU consumers do not bear the costs of conversion?"
"When will we finally have a regulation that also ensures that no dual pricing system will be introduced?"
"First, Mrs Randzio-Plath, if you carefully study the conclusions of the European Council in Amsterdam - something I am not going to do here, though I am willing to go through them with you in person - you will find that the concerns of the European Parliament, especially those expressed in its resolutions on the Pact for Stability and Growth, have been extensively taken into consideration. Not only that, but I personally have taken the trouble, during recent discussions, to try to persuade the Council to adopt as many as possible of the ideas put forward by Parliament."
"Secondly, you ask what initiative we are going to take."
"In my speech just now I spoke in general terms about the approaches that have been selected, both in terms of co-ordination of economic policy and in terms of employment policy, and what we were going to do to follow them through."
"Confining myself to essentials, I think the first thing to do is to ensure that the content of Articles 102a and 103 is more oriented towards employment."
"That is why the broad guidelines of economic policy are going to be widened - as you will see when we present them next year - to take more account of competitiveness, the employment market, technological innovation, education, training and taxation."
"That may not be the end of it, because we shall, if appropriate, pursuant to Article 103(4) of the Treaty, propose to the Council that it makes recommendations on these matters to the Member States."
"In other words, there is a parallel between the powers of recommendation we have exercised so far in budgetary matters and those that we can extend into the economic field."
"Secondly, as far as employment is concerned, I think I answered your question earlier when I said that we were going to take maximum advantage of the fact that the 'employment' chapter of the Amsterdam Treaty will be implemented even before that Treaty has been ratified, thus providing a legal basis for more specific action."
"All these points are currently the subject of in-depth examination and analysis."
"I look forward to reporting back to you very soon, once the Commission's services have made progress with this work, and I can assure you that I shall keep you closely informed of the way our ideas are developing on this matter."
"Regarding the consumer aspect, we organized a round table discussion on 15 May which enabled us to identify a number of specific, practical problems including dual pricing or labelling, the date of issue of the banknotes, how long dual circulation should continue, etc. Following that round table, we organized and are now holding a number of workshops with consumers, banks and businesses, subject by subject."
"My objective would be to arrange two general meetings on these issues - one in autumn and the other in March - to see what solutions we can find to these problems, bearing in mind that it would be preferable to avoid resorting to regulation if possible."
"Our European Union already suffers from paralysis brought about by excessive regulation, and I would prefer it to err on the side of dynamism and consensus."
"At this stage, then, our work is geared to a quest for consensus, the objective being of course to enable us, when we make public the decision on the list of countries joining the euro in late April or early May 1998, at the same time to give specific answers to consumers on the specific questions they ask."
"What I can promise you now is that these practical matters are one of the essential areas on which the Commission is currently working."
"Mr President, the European Parliament has called for the whole economic cycle of a Member State's economy to be considered when determining whether it has an excessive deficit."
"This is wise, so as to ensure that a Member State which finds itself in difficulties is not driven ever deeper into the economic mire."
"However, the conclusions of the Amsterdam summit concerning the Agreement on Stability and Growth contain a direct reference to the Council declaration, which in turn stresses adherence to very strict, automatic procedures for assessing excessive deficits."
"They are to lead quite directly to fines."
"Is this not extremely unwise?"
"How is this to be reconciled with your efforts to promote employment, or was the declaration on employment needed purely to enable the French to return home in safety?"
"My first answer to that is that the Stability Pact is absolutely and completely consistent with the Maastricht Treaty."
"I would refer you to Article 104c of the Treaty, which states that the Council may resolve upon sanctions if certain conditions are present."
"In the present case, the Pact for Stability and Growth preserves the autonomy of the Commission intact in terms of its power of initiative, and preserves the autonomy of the Council intact in terms of its normal powers of decision granted to it by the Treaty."
"The Pact for Stability and Growth is a code of conduct, a guide to behaviour, which is intended to specify the conditions and timetable for the necessary action to restore budgetary equilibrium."
"I can tell you, Mrs Hautala, that as far as I know public deficits do not create jobs."
"I see this equally in the United States and the European Union - I am not talking about France, have no fear - and in the other European countries."
"In recent years, those countries which have done most to reduce their public deficits have also seen the strongest growth and created the most jobs."
"I am looking here especially at the Dutch presidency."
"This is no obstacle to undertaking structural reforms, but, both in Denver and in Amsterdam, the Heads of State and Government of every country did indeed stress the fact that there is a link of compatibility, I would even call it a synergistic effect, between the pursuit of a sound economic policy, the reduction of the public deficit, the stimulation of growth and the creation of jobs."
"I wonder if you would care to comment on the use of the Euro by international companies in the European Union."
"In those countries which have the right to opt out, or which may not be eligible at the start of monetary union, do you foresee large international companies using the Euro in practice and for accountancy needs, thus allowing the Euro to evolve in those countries as a recognized currency?"
"Will the Commission be making sure there is a legal base for that to happen?"
"Let me reassure Mr Provan."
"Of course international companies, even if they are not based in a euro country, will be able to use the euro."
"At present, the regulations adopted on the legal status of the euro are specifically designed to provide sufficient legal guarantees to ensure that the euro can be used by every enterprise in the world that wishes to use it."
"Secondly, I can pass on the news that the Commission has been working with, among others, those responsible for the finance markets on extremely technical matters of financial conventions and denominations, with a view to trying to lay down rules, at the request of the financial operators themselves, to ensure that the euro can be used on a harmonious basis."
"My third comment is this: clearly, if the euro is a good currency, in other words a stable currency, it will be an alternative to the dollar and it will be in demand among investors wanting to diversify their portfolios."
"So the euro is bound to grow and its use is bound to become more widespread as a trading currency and a payment currency and, also, a reserve currency."
"Commissioner, I should like to take another brief look at the specific proposals to boost employment which the Commission believes it can implement as a direct outcome of the European Council resolution in Amsterdam."
"Does the Commission believe that that resolution, the new chapter on employment and the integration of the social protocol amount to a sufficiently ambitious and explicit political commitment to enable the Union, between now and the implementation of the single currency, effectively to address the crucial and dominant problem of unemployment in Europe, and to respond to the urgent need and sometimes desperate anxiety of the social groups affected by it?"
"Or is the Commission perhaps inclined to consider, with sadness, that the conclusions of the European Council as summarized in the resolution on growth and employment merely encompass a few generalities suitable for firstyear students of political economy, bearing witness to the timid and often inconsistent vision of a minimalist Europe capitulating in the face of some of the serious difficulties that confront it - the social problem in this case?"
"To summarize, Commissioner, I doubt whether your apparent optimism is shared by our eighteen million unemployed."
"First, let me say that I quite agree that jobs cannot be created with documents and treaties."
"Nor can we give Europe back the confidence it needs to rediscover its drive and create new jobs if we are constantly going to throw in the towel and adopt the pessimistic view."
"Today, when Europe has the necessary know-how and is rediscovering the secret of growth, the best way of providing the necessary stimulus and will to succeed is by encouraging the people, not discouraging them."
"Secondly, the introduction of the euro will form an integral part of the solution to the problem of unemployment, because the euro will bring Europe greater growth."
"It will also enable Europe to eliminate the monetary fluctuations - ' competitive devaluations' as they were once known in certain quarters in France - which cost Europe a million and a half additional people unemployed in a two year period, 1995 to 1996."
"I believe, then, that the contribution made by the euro to growth in Europe will also be a valuable contribution to the struggle against unemployment."
"But the majority of unemployment is structural, and so structural reforms must be our primary aim, now more than ever."
"That means reducing the burden on the low paid, it means giving flexibility to the employment market, it means education, it means learning, training, all those fields of endeavour where perseverance and determination are required."
"Once again, on returning from the United States after seeing the Americans and talking to them, I realized that Europe was certainly no weaker than the United States but that we had one flaw - we don't believe in ourselves."
"And I believe that the role of politicians, of whatever party, today is to give back Europe's citizens that confidence in themselves."
"Mr President, there is a rather unusual, not to say original, question I should like to put to the European Commissioner."
"At the G8 meeting in Denver, which was notable for the lack of any positive decisions as far as Europe was concerned, a notable event was a cowboy evening paying homage to the American world order."
"The President of the European Commission, Mr Santer, like most of the leading figures present with the exception of Mr Blair, who refused, received a present in the form of a gold watch of very considerable value."
"Commissioner, might not this gift be an opportunity for the Commission and Parliament to set up a museum to store and exhibit all the gifts received in the course of their official duties by European Union dignitaries - Parliament, Council and Commission alike?"
"I feel that this would be the best way to demonstrate to European public opinion, to the citizens of Europe, the keen interest which we all share in the preservation of integrity and transparency."
"Do you wish to reply, Mr Commissioner?"
"I have taken careful note of the Honourable Member's suggestion."
"Personally, I have not received any such gifts."
"As for museums, let's have museums by all means, but do we want to bury Europe in museums?"
"To get back to employment policy, Commissioner, among the means available you mentioned recourse to broad economic guidelines, the extension of those guidelines and the Council's recommendations on employment."
"In particular, you also talked about extending the role of the European Investment Bank and making use of ECSC funds."
"I wonder if you could tell us what effects these two eminently practical ideas can be expected to have on employment."
"After all, as the Vice-President of the European Investment Bank, Mr Roth, has said, the Bank already takes account of employment problems in the investment projects it finances."
"On the other hand, the ECSC funds are not disposable funds - they are funds that come from industry and they cannot simply be appropriated and put to work for a Keynesian project."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner what the European Council had in mind when it settled on these two very practical ideas."
"Thank you for that question, Mr Fayot."
"I could spend two hours answering it, because it is technically complex."
"To keep things as simple as I can, what we are asking of the EIB is first that it should give easier, quicker access to credit, and secondly that it should reduce the cost of that credit to small- and mediumsized enterprises operating in high technology areas."
"So what we are talking about are specific, targeted schemes that will enable the EIB out of its own resources - out of its reserves, if I can put it that way - to provide easier access to borrowing for enterprises which need loans in order to expand, and this idea holds out promise for the future because the sectors concerned are the developing sectors of so-called high technology."
"As for the ECSC, as you know, it holds substantial reserves which it is obliged to retain because it has to cover the loans it has made to industry."
"The ECSC will cease to exist on 23 July 2002."
"A number of loans will still remain active, will still have a few years to run."
"So, as long as those loans need to be covered, the reserves will remain."
"The interesting point is that the European Council said that since those reserves were set up on the basis of a levy on the coal and steel industries, then when those reserves can be released they must be given to a fund which will enable research to be promoted in the industries connected with that sector."
"So, instead of ending up with this money being handed over to some unspecified recipient, we can feel certain that it will be appropriated and used to best effect to facilitate research, because research stimulates employment and because not enough research is being done in Europe."
"Mr President, now that it is becoming increasingly likely or almost certain that we will have the euro, I should like to ask the Commissioner what will happen to Europe's green currency system?"
"Will there soon be a green euro or when does the Commission envisage making concrete proposals in this area so that Europe will also have a single euro in the field of agriculture?"
"That is a very good question."
"We are already giving thought to that."
"What I can say is that the euro will simplify the situation, at least for the countries in the euro zone."
"Consequently, in agri-monetary matters, the difficulties that have arisen as a result of changes in exchange rates, and which have had agri-monetary repercussions, will disappear."
"So that will simplify the situation."
"Secondly, there will still be a problem to be sorted out with the non-euro States that are members of the European Union."
"The technical aspects of these matters are currently under consideration, and I can assure you that all the arrangements will be made to ensure that, as soon as the euro comes into existence, any difficulties that may still persist will be eliminated."
"Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"Takeover bids"
"The next item on the agenda is the report, drawn up by Mrs Fontaine on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the proposal for a thirteenth European Parliament and Council Directive on company law concerning takeover bids (COM(95)0655 - C4-0107/96-95/0341(COD)) (A4-0204/97)."
"I have received a request from the UPE group pursuant to Rule 129 of the Rules of Procedure for the report to be referred back to committee."
"I call upon Mr Florio to move this request."
"Mr President, we have made this request because we believe the issue needs to be examined more deeply."
"We would point out that this proposal from the Commission began life as a proposal for a recommendation and then made enormous strides, turning into a proposal for a directive."
"The consultations were geared to the proposal for a recommendation and not to the proposal for a directive it has transformed itself into on its travels."
"Now in the light of these considerations, the determination and the conviction has grown in my group that it is right to go further into the matter in committee and also, perhaps, to deal in parallel with the imminent - or almost imminent - discussion of the directive on the European limited company."
"So, on behalf of my group, I support the request for reference back to committee."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European Socialists I should like to tell the House that the matter was debated at length in the Committee for Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, taking account of all considerations and all aspects."
"It seems to me that there is no point in referring it back to committee now."
"I therefore suggest that we keep it on the agenda."
"I put the request to refer the report back to committee to the vote."
"(Parliament rejected the request) I call upon the rapporteur, Mrs Fontaine."
"Mr President, the report on takeover bids which I have the honour of presenting to this House on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights cannot be considered outside its historical context, and I hope you will allow me to say a few words on that subjects."
"It was in 1989 that the Commission, noting the proliferation of takeover bids, both friendly and hostile, in the European private sector, took the initiative of proposing the adoption at Community level of a number of joint provisions governing these practices."
"In actual fact, the Commission's proposal was nothing less than a harmonization directive."
"This House added a few amendments, but approved the proposal as a whole, in a report adopted back in January 1990."
"Since then, however, the truth is that the matter has been continuously blocked by the Council."
"Today, therefore, the Commission is suggesting a new approach."
"That approach takes the form of a framework directive establishing general principles applicable to takeover bids, without making any attempt to achieve detailed harmonization of the rules in force in the various Member States."
"It should be noted, incidentally, that since 1989 the Member States, one after the other, have made certain arrangements to regulate this matter."
"The new approach by the Commission is consistent with the undertaking given at Edinburgh in 1992 to respect the principle of subsidiarity and leave the Member States free to implement the principles set out in the directive, making due allowance for their national traditions and practices."
"Also, in the present case, this new approach is designed as an escape from the dead end created by the Council."
"It is common knowledge that the fiercest opposition has come from those Member States which felt that the harmonization initially suggested went beyond what was desirable or desired."
"In this context, you rapporteur felt strongly - and I hope Mr Florio is listening - that the Legal Affairs Committee should first give very careful consideration to the appropriateness of this new line proposed to us by the Commission."
"That was, as it were, a preliminary question which I put to the Legal Affairs Committee before any consideration of the merits of the instrument."
"Was legislation necessary or not?"
"And if so, was a directive the right way to go about it?"
"Should it be approached in the limited way proposed by the Commission?"
"The Legal Affairs Committee once again, after very careful study, answered both these questions in the affirmative."
"It instructed your rapporteur to continue her work along those lines - the lines of a directive of minimal harmonization, as the Legal Affairs Committee considers that the extreme diversity of national legislation means that takeover operations cannot be effected with the necessary degree of legal certainty to protect both minority shareholders and the employees of the companies targeted."
"It considers that an attempt at harmonization - even with limited objectives, even, let us be frank, a somewhat timid attempt - would nevertheless make it possible to establish a degree of fairness between the various stock market players, acting as a deterrent to purely speculative raids by the strongest of those players."
"I should add, ladies and gentlemen, that the argument along the lines of 'hold on, don't let's do anything until the fifth directive on worker participation, the tenth directive on cross-border mergers and the draft plan for the European company have been unfrozen' is too reminiscent of the 'web of Penelope' , which of course was never finished at all."
"These various projects -unfortunately blocked by the Council for years - have no sufficiently direct links with the subject before us today to justify a universal freeze."
"Indeed, the signal we are going to send could mark the start of a long-awaited thaw in this area of Community company law."
"With regard to the substance, therefore, our guiding principle was not to try to make the text more restrictive, knowing that the same causes would once again produce the same effects and the text would again be rejected by the Council. Adopting a pragmatic and efficient approach, we tried to make it clearer, more precise, but also more dynamic in view of its intended subsequent application by the Member States."
"That was the thinking that prompted our amendments defining the offeror, protecting minority shareholders and specifying the functions of the supervisory authority."
"Finally, and as we did earlier in 1990, we stressed the need for clear information for the employees."
"Some of our amendments, adopted from the excellent report by Mr Hughes on behalf of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, are particularly designed to enable employee information to be improved."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following on from the Amsterdam summit, which recorded a few timid steps forward towards giving the European Union that social dimension which it so grievously lacks, I hope this House will show that in such areas we will not accept paralysis or prevarication."
"I hope with all my heart that this House will approve the views expressed by its Legal Affairs Committee and its Social Affairs Committee in favour of this directive and the amendments we propose to give concrete form to our desire for transparency, equity and social equilibrium in the European single market."
"Mr President, first of all and not merely out of politeness or custom - I must congratulate Mrs Fontaine on the work she has done on a text which has an extraordinarily light touch."
"Mrs Fontaine is to be congratulated because she has attempted to make the content of that text a little clearer although within the limitations which she has pointed out."
"In fact, as she herself has said here and indicated in her report, Mrs Fontaine did doubt whether it was worth continuing to consider this directive and spending much time on it."
"She decided that it was and I congratulate her on the work she has done."
"Moreover, an attempt was made to put some flesh on the bones of this directive by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights and by means of some amendments."
"In fact the present proposal for a directive is an exercise which seems to me to have fairly limited results. That is because the principle of subsidiarity is applied to overcome the hurdle of opposition within the Council in giving its agreement to previous proposals."
"This is one of the cases in which the principle of subsidiarity has been used in a rather forced manner, because if this matter falls within the jurisdiction of the Member States, then all company law, or the greater part of company law, will fall within the jurisdiction of the States."
"And company law is not the same in Britain for example as on the continent."
"The British have very much put the brakes on this draft directive - I would mention that it was the government of the day - and it might in fact be said that there are many aspects of company law which are specific to AngloSaxon law and do not necessarily contain a Community dimension."
"However, the rapporteur points out - and I think this is important - that when we are aiming for a global approach, as we are now - it is clear that the European Union is not responding in this field of company law as might be expected when, strange to say, all aspects of trade are taking on a more international and global character and becoming ever more alike."
"I remember that when, many years ago, I was studying comparative law it was pointed out to me that it was not possible to harmonize everything and the example of family law and divorce law was quoted."
"This appears however to be practically harmonized throughout almost all the Union and, in contrast, we have company law which is not."
"I hope at least this text will be approved."
"We shall vote in favour with some amendments because something is better than nothing."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission proposal takes account of the principle of subsidiarity, on the basis of the experience gained with the aforementioned 1989 proposal, which failed."
"So the proposal simply sets out an objective, a framework, and by and large leaves its practical implementation to the Member States."
"However, this only minimally attains the objective of ensuring that the shareholders of listed companies will enjoy equal protection in the single market in the event of a takeover."
"In view of the very divergent rules on takeover bids in the various Member States, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights and my group rightly asked whether a recommendation might not have been more appropriate than a directive."
"I personally would have preferred a recommendation, although there were good reasons for the decision to opt for a framework directive."
"If we are to avoid distortions of competition and make the stock markets more transparent and give minority shareholders at least minimum protection, we need a minimum of legal certainty."
"Given the wide differences between national provisions on takeover bids, this legal certainty can only be achieved by fixing a legal framework of action, however minimal."
"The main way to ensure that the individual participants in the stock market act along the same lines is through harmonization and not through voluntary codes of conduct."
"In terms of content, the Legal Affairs Committee has made it even clearer that the Commission proposal is a framework directive by nature."
"Thus the report contains some amendments that give the Member States even more margin for reverting to their national systems."
"The directive goes into some basic points either too briefly or not at all."
"They include, for instance, the definition of minority shareholders, the inclusion of concerted action in the scope of the directive and the definition of cases in which the Member States can authorize their supervisory authorities to grant exceptions to the provisions of the directive."
"Taking account of the difficulties I have mentioned, I believe the Commission proposal nevertheless deserves our full approval, in the version proposed by the rapporteur."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to dispel any possible doubts."
"I have the greatest respect and esteem for the outstanding work the rapporteur has done and my request, on behalf of my group, to refer the report back to committee was not intended and is not intended in any way to sound like a criticism of the work carried out by Mrs Fontaine."
"As has already been said, the proposal for a framework directive on takeover bids is the result of an earlier initiative."
"In 1989 the European Commission had already proposed a classic harmonization directive, but it was not agreed by the Council."
"Then, when the single market came into force, the Commission at first proposed a recommendation, which I mentioned just now, and then a framework directive containing certain general principles, with the purpose of creating similar conditions in all the Member States, leaving them a wide margin of manoeuvre."
"So the Commission feels the current extreme diversity of national legislation does not permit takeover bid operations to be carried out in a context where rights are satisfactorily protected, and a mild harmonization - even if the Commission would have initially preferred a genuine directive which would be more binding - would at least allow some fairness to be introduced between the various players in the stock markets."
"The directive contains a number of points like this, which I shall not go through, but the Member States are left very wide opportunities to legislate in different ways."
"In a field like this, linked to the free movement of capital, we think it would have been more appropriate to identify a larger number of precise common rules."
"This has not been done."
"So with some regret, we find that when serious and important decisions have to be taken, the European Union does not succeed in taking them in common."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Liberal group I would like to say that we have serious doubts about this phase of the work."
"We are of the opinion that currently there are more important matters of company law requiring our efforts."
"By this, I mean the enormous problems which companies experience with genuine cross border operations."
"Vigorous action is needed, based on the report by the Davignon group; standardised taxation for companies operating in more than one Member State and we need to look into how we can handle the deficit."
"This is where we should be concentrating our efforts now and I hope that the Commission will commence work seriously on this."
"It is well known that the situation regarding take-overs varies in different Member States. The previous speaker has already mentioned this."
"Some countries have precise legal systems while others have voluntary systems in place."
"I hope that these will still be secure under the Directive even after the Commission's scrutiny of it."
"Even if we are talking about a framework Directive, there are issues in a framework Directive which ought to be specified."
"The proposal on applicable law, for example."
"I do not think the Commission's proposal or the proposal which resulted from the discussion in committee are satisfactory; Article 3.2 in particular."
"This is why we have made an amendment proposal for this particular point."
"I also think that it is important that we give real protection to minority share holders when we adopt such a Directive."
"This is not the case in Article 10."
"This is why we have made our amendment proposal."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I also think that the legal committee has made several proposals which are out of place in the modern world."
"For example, the proposed obligation that a report be published annually for five years after the take-over showing how employment has progressed."
"This gives employment but not real competitive jobs."
"Mr President, I should also like to join in the congratulations to Mrs Fontaine."
"She must feel as if she is receiving a bouquet of flowers."
"She dealt with this matter in committee very well."
"She united the committee at the end of the final vote, with the exception of two abstentions and Mr Cassidy voting against the overall committee decision."
"I think it would need a miracle by the Archangel Gabriel to persuade Mr Cassidy to come round to our position."
"The 1989 original directive has already been very well explained in this House."
"This directive is very much reduced."
"It is very temperate in its tone because it has taken into consideration what happened in the Council in 1989 and 1990."
"The United Kingdom has the highest rate of takeovers and takeover battles throughout the European Union."
"There were something like 1, 500 in the years 1995/96."
"It also has the excellent reputation because of the takeover panel of having knowledge of these particular matters."
"We accept that and the proposal goes a long way to accepting that."
"In Article 6 it says that the supervisory authority can be a non-regulatory body."
"The takeover panel in Britain has been catered for with that amendment."
"Hostile takeovers are now being seen across Europe."
"Krupp/Thyssen will be seen as just an interlude when we see the massive hostile takeovers of the future."
"Therefore, the Socialist Group takes the view that it is in the interest of competition policy in this field that we have some form of regulatory law in these matters."
"Concerning the Commission's hostility to Amendment No 11, in 1995-96 in my country alone 12, 500 job losses were due to takeovers and mergers."
"Amendment No 12 calls for those people who have funds or shares in the companies involved through their occupational pension funds - a growing number of people throughout Europe - to be involved in any final decision on these matters. I understand the Commission is concerned about this."
"If it wants to come back with different legislation, for example the pensions directive which is before the Council now, we could take this into consideration."
"In conclusion, the challenge to this House is Anglo-American law and whether Anglo-American law will supersede the European model."
"I hope and trust this House will reject that proposition."
"Anglo-American law has caused us grievous problems in the United Kingdom and I do not want to see it here."
"I am sure when it comes to the conciliation procedure with the Council, Mrs Fontaine will fight strongly on behalf of Parliament for our amendments."
"Mr President, I shall retain only one point from the speech I had prepared and that is to congratulate the rapporteur on her competent work."
"She did indeed manage to steer the ship of the European Parliament report with a masterly hand and I am sure she will manage to bring it safe to harbour."
"Having said that, I wish to make a broader analysis centred upon the debate between those wanting to regulate company law by means of a recommendation - which is why a request has been made for this report to be referred back to committee - and those who advocate that it should be regulated by means of a directive or at least a framework directive."
"After Amsterdam, Mr President, our next challenge is the third phase of Monetary Union and if that is to have any chance of success - and Europe needs this third phase of Monetary Union to be a success - we need to complete the internal market."
"When we arrive at that point we realise that there is one sector where there has been no progress as regards the internal market for the past twenty years and that is the companies sector."
"But that is paradoxical because the companies sector was the pioneer in European integration - the sector which gave the first spur to the internal market."
"This sector has made no progress for twenty years and now we are told that we should not issue a directive - which has had a most complicated ten-year history - but rather a recommendation."
"That is strange because I have also heard from the lips of the very people advocating the recommendation, that this directive does not go far enough and needs to aim at greater integration; they also argue, on a matter which is unconnected with this point, that we should be in a better position to lay down suitable rules if we waited until the Davignon report was finished and then issued a directive on the European limited liability company."
"I wonder, Mr President, what this constitutes."
"In Spain this is known as institutional filibustering and is tantamount to hoping to arrest the progress of the vessel of the European Union and there are two words behind this - one is subsidiarity and, paradoxically, the other is globalization."
"And between Scylla and Charybdis a realistic policy must be put into practice as my colleague from the Socialist group, Mr Verdi i Aldea, so rightly said."
"This directive is, in my opinion, insufficient but it is a first and absolutely essential step which we hope will be followed by other steps which are also absolutely essential in the field of company law."
"Mr President, naturally I join in the chorus of praise for the efforts of the rapporteur."
"However, I would warn her with the Latin phrase 'Timeo Danaos et dona ferentis' which means: Fear the Greeks even when they bring gifts."
"May I suggest to the rapporteur that she should look very carefully at compliments coming from the direction of Mr Falconer because they come from a suspect source."
"I have no criticisms at all of the work of the rapporteur."
"Within limits she has done a competent and workmanlike job."
"My criticism is aimed at the Commission."
"This proposal is the wrong proposal."
"The comment has already been made by Mrs Palacio and Mrs Mosiek-Urbahn that they would have preferred a recommendation rather than a directive."
"That is a perfectly legitimate point and I know the rapporteur raised it in committee."
"But this draft directive does not deal with the fundamental problem, namely that cross-border takeovers in Europe are extremely difficult to bring about and every country, or most countries, have barriers to takeovers."
"The great argument is that we must look after jobs and so on. But jobs will be much more in peril unless we succeed through cross-border takeovers in creating world size companies which will enable us to compete with the Americans, Japanese and others."
"The proposal in Amendment No 23 by Mr Falconer and others that investment fund managers who manage portfolio fund investments should be excluded from the takeover proceedings is simply out of touch with reality since most of those institutions represent pension funds which represent the savings of workers all over Europe."
"This proposal is the wrong proposal."
"I voted against it in committee and I shall vote against it tomorrow in plenary."
"I urge many others who have doubts about it to do the same."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission, I congratulate Vice-President Fontaine, on her fine report on this important measure in the area of company law."
"I think we can all agree on one point: the situation in the Community as regards takeover bids and the protection of minority shareholders where control of a company quoted on the stock exchange changes hands, is currently characterized by a mass of different rules which are fragmenting the market."
"In the light of the progressive integration of European financial markets, the Commission regards this as a real obstacle to the operation of the single market."
"As you know - and this has been mentioned - the previous attempt to remedy this situation was not very successful."
"The proposal for a directive drafted at the end of the '80s, and amended in 1990 to take account of the opinion of Parliament, met with strong resistance from some Member States."
"The discussions made it clear that it would be difficult to reconcile certain fundamental differences through a directive geared to detailed harmonization of takeover bids, all the more so as the detailed harmonization approach has to some extent had its day, not just in this specific case but in general."
"That is why this proposal is inspired by the spirit of subsidiarity, as Mrs Fontaine has mentioned."
"So some people seemed to want a recommendation, and others seemed to want a more meaningful, more detailed directive."
"We have opted for a framework directive, which sets some minimum principles and conditions while leaving it to Member States to apply it in the way that corresponds best to their own traditions and structures, and that includes self-regulation codes."
"The Commission's basic objectives are to ensure that, throughout the single market, shareholders of a company quoted on the stock exchange enjoy the same guarantees if control changes hands, and that there are minimum rules governing the progress and transparency of takeover operations."
"It is crucial to ensure that when a takeover bid is launched, it takes place in a context of legal security where all the interested parties are aware of the conditions they need to operate under."
"The Commission can accept the majority of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, with slight changes to the wording of Amendments Nos. 1, 4 and 6."
"But at this stage it cannot accept Amendment No 17, on the acceptance period for the offer because, in the light of the general economy of the text and its purposes, the reasons for it do not seem sufficiently clear."
"The Commission reserves the right to reconsider its position on this point at a later stage of the parliamentary process."
"Mr President, as regards the social aspects - and here I also want to thank the Committee on Social Affairs, Employment and Working Conditions and Mr Hughes - the Commission is in favour of the inclusion of the general principle of protection of jobs, contained in Amendment No 11."
"However it cannot accept two related amendments - Amendment No 13, information on employed personnel and Amendment No 21, consultation of employees by the management of the company affected by the takeover bid."
"We find it difficult to reconcile these two amendments with the concept of a framework directive and with the principle of subsidiarity."
"We accept Amendment No 14, but with a less rigid wording, and Amendment No 16 only partially."
"We cannot accept Amendment No 12 because it is not clear to us how people who are shareholders as a result of choices made by the managers of institutional investment funds can be involved in the procedure for carrying out a takeover bid."
"We tend to think this matter, which relates to the management of pension funds, should instead be regulated at the national level."
"Amendments Nos 23, 25, 26, 28 and, in part, No 27, presented during today's sitting, cannot be accepted by the Commission. However we can accept Amendment No 24, and the part of Amendment No 27 which provides for information of employees within a reasonable time after publication of the offer."
"I hope the European Parliament will continue to support our initiative and I agree with what has been said about the fact that there are other important initiatives on the ground: cross-border operations, the European company statute, the need for coordination of taxation systems."
"Prompt and positive consideration of this proposal can make an important contribution to breaking the deadlock on all these matters."
"Finally, Mr President, we have in drafting the proposal taken particular account of the concerns expressed by British MEPs and in Britain generally."
"The directive, as drafted, is intended to keep the UK take-over system as intact as possible."
"Litigation in the form of judicial review in the UK is already a possibility, although it is not a common tactic due to the reluctance of the English courts to intervene during a bid, as is the right of an injured party to sue for damages."
"The directive itself explicity encourages voluntary control to be exercised by the supervisory authority in order to avoid recourse to administrative or judicial action."
"I want to reassure those Members of Parliament concerned that we are as concerned as they are about these aspects and we tried to devise a mechanism that, while providing a framework directive, causes the least disturbance possible to a wellestablished and well-functioning system like the British one."
"Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner Monti."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at noon tomorrow."
"Dangerous preparations"
"The next item on the agenda is the report, drawn up by Mrs Baldi on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive concerning the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations (COM(96)0347 - C4-0426/96-96/0200(COD)) (A4-0186/97)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, dangerous preparations are currently governed by Directive No 88/379, which regulates their classification, packaging and labelling."
"The Commission's proposal, which we are now examining at first reading, is designed to update the directive in question, bringing together Community legislation on dangerous preparations in a single act."
"This proposed directive introduces changes to the 1988 directive geared to extending the scope of the directive on dangerous preparations to five new sectors, viz: 1) environmental classification and labelling; the original directive only covered the criterion of classification and labelling, with the wording 'dangerous to health' ; 2) pesticides and biocides, as the directive on classification, packaging and labelling of the parasiticides will be repealed; 3) safety data sheets, which the manufacturers must provide for preparations not classified as dangerous; 4) explosives, for which professional users must provide a safety data sheet; 5) labelling of certain sensitisers, by which products containing sensitisers, even below the normal limit for classification, must be labelled."
"The great majority of changes introduced are important because they are linked to the assessment of preparations as a function of the dangers they represent for the environment, harmonizing with the seventh updating, in line with technical progress, of Directive No 67/548 on dangerous substances which is closely linked to the directive we are now discussing in this Chamber."
"The aim has been to follow a process of harmonization of existing legislation on chemical substances and, while the proposal may not be easy for those not involved in the work to understand, it is also necessary to remember that the role of Parliament is to give political direction."
"Nevertheless I would remind you that assessment of the dangers of a preparation is based on determination of the following indicators of the danger of a substance: physical and chemical properties, properties with effects on health, environmental properties."
"What needs to be underlined once again is the importance of harmonizing the existing legislation, because different legislation currently in force in the various Member States on classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations, constitutes, as the Commission has rightly shown, an obstacle to intra-Community trade, sustaining unequal competitive conditions and having a negative effect on the functioning of the internal market."
"So a directive geared to regulate this sector is welcome, as long as consumer protection is always given priority."
"It is precisely to protect the health and safety of European citizens that we want the directive to introduce high safety standards in all the Member States: hence the requirement for safety data sheets, labelling of certain sensitisers and so on."
"Citizens have the right to see their health protected and this can be done through clear and transparent information, and legible and easily recognizable labelling."
"We have acted to ensure this by including, amongst other provisions, warnings recognizable by touch to protect blind people."
"However, in cases of non-dangerous preparations containing a substance with a health risk, where information on certain properties is not relevant to the protection of consumer health, simplified safety data sheets need to be introduced for preparations not classified as dangerous, because drawing up and updating full data sheets involve major cost, time and difficulty for small and medium-sized firms which often do not have the necessary human and technical resources."
"Finally, I would like to stress the fact that this European directive embraces and respects the wishes of the great majority of the Member States, as has emerged from the contacts I was at pains to make with the European national authorities, because the aim was to generate balanced legislation which takes account of Member States' different legislation, by improving it and trying to harmonize it."
"The amendments I have tabled in committee and in this House recognize the need to harmonize the legislation on chemical preparations."
"This proposal is intended to be a real step forward in this direction and it is the result of mediation across the various existing national legislations."
"Now the directive must be made feasible and operational."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Baldi for the amount of work she has put into this very complicated and important issue."
"The handling of chemicals is one of the most important issues which comes under the scope of the environmental sector."
"Every day we see the number of allergies increasing along with other negative effects on people and the environment."
"This is why I welcome the Commission's proposal which means we will be making a real effort at European level to deal with these problems."
"The Directive itself is difficult and technical, but adopting a political stance will be simpler when we see the effects."
"What we are doing now is deciding on legislation which will determine how hazardous goods should be classified, packaged and labelled."
"This is particularly important for the thousands of European workers who come into daily contact with these chemical products."
"They depend on detailed and correct information on how these preparations should be handled to avoid putting their own health at risk."
"It is Article 16 of the Directive which concentrates primarily on the working environment."
"One of the proposals in this Article is to make obligatory safety data sheets, which will have to contain information on handling."
"So it seems absurd that Parliament should intervene and try and reduce the standard for this type of safety data sheet."
"This would also mean that the three newest Member States, at least, would be forced to reduce the level of their current legislation in this area."
"We are talking about safety at work here."
"This is not bedtime reading which has to be made simple to make it easier for certain Members of Parliament to read; we are talking about important issues concerning people's health."
"But it is not just the working environment which will be affected by this Directive but the environment generally and our daily lives as consumers."
"Many of the products we buy in the shops have labels warning us of particular health risks or potential allergies."
"Against this background it seems somewhat unrealistic to say that it is consumer interest groups who want the impact of this Directive lessened."
"It is other interested parties who wish to see the standards in the Directive reduced and I sincerely hope that this House will reject such Directives and proposals which would mean that the type of safety data sheet which we already have in Sweden, Finland and Austria, for example, can no longer continue to be used in the future."
"This issue forms part of the agreements which were concluded during our membership negotiations."
"So I do hope that this House can see the benefit in starting at a high level when it comes to safety, for us as employees, as consumers and as members of society in Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me say on behalf of the EPP Group that this proposal for a directive concerning the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations is another good example of sensible European legislation."
"The question of dangerous preparations has been regulated on a Community-wide basis since 1988."
"But that regulation has been supplemented and amended on several occasions."
"The present Commission proposal not only revises and brings together various legislative measures but also closes a legislative loophole by covering the environmental effects of dangerous preparations."
"The reason this question is so complex is that it does not only involve a great many - several thousand - substances, but also an even greater number of preparations containing these substances."
"It is a matter of several hundreds of thousands of them."
"Things become even more complicated because preparations are not just sold to the end user but many of them are only used within the industry."
"Many small and medium-sized enterprises produce these preparations."
"They are also expected to produce all the necessary data."
"That means they must of course ensure that man and the environment are protected."
"In the case of any further data, however, we must achieve a reasonable balance between cost and added benefit."
"In this respect, I believe that the Commission proposal formed a very good basis."
"Even in the case of most preparations not regarded as dangerous, the producer must provide a safety data sheet if the users so wish."
"Labelling, of course, presents particular problems."
"On the one hand it has to be comprehensible to the end user, on the other hand it must include a lot of information that may be important to the processor but is of no interest whatsoever to the general public."
"I think it is important for the labelling to indicate really serious risks."
"There may be three, five or seven of them."
"But it cannot list another 20 potential or conceivable risks."
"That would involve too much labelling and would confuse rather than inform the consumer."
"The same applies to listing the chemical formulas, which the normal consumer cannot understand and where giving the more general name - for instance formaldehyde - would be more sensible."
"That is precisely why some of the amendments give rise to problems."
"Nor would such an abundance of information offer more protection; in fact it is more likely to do the opposite because it is confusing."
"Even if people might think that lists can clarify a generic term, in practice they do the opposite, for lists are limiting and disregard other possible aspects implicit in the generic term."
"These are the main reasons why my group will reject some of the committee's amendments."
"To finish let me draw your attention to one more point, Commissioner, namely the poor translation."
"The German version at least contains a number of mistakes."
"For there is a difference between 'patentierung ' (patenting) and 'potenzierung ' (potentiation)."
"There are several things like this in the text."
"I mentioned this in committee too, but unfortunately the mistakes were not corrected."
"I cordially request the Commission to look into this again."
"I am in any case informed, Mrs Schleicher, that the relevant department have put that right."
"Mr President, we are very pleased with the proposal for a directive which somewhat widens the field of application of the original directives, as this is a directive which incorporates in a single document the existing legislation which has long existed in the field of dangerous preparations."
"In particular, we believe the European Commission has submitted a good proposal because dangers to the environment are included in addition to dangers to health as mentioned in the existing text."
"This is progress."
"We also find it a useful improvement that preparations which can cause an allergic reaction are now also to be labelled."
"We, the Group of European Liberals, are strong defenders of a high level of protection for the environment and clear labelling for the consumer."
"I repeat, the Commission proposal seems to be a very reasonable proposal, although I would have liked to see further improvements on a number of points."
"In our view, the report by Mrs Baldi scarcely constitutes an improvement on the original Commission proposal and, unfortunately, some of her amendments in fact serve to weaken the original."
"This is why my group is unable to support the amendments which Mrs Baldi has once again submitted after they failed to be adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"We do, however, very much support the amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment which we believe usefully improve on the Commission text."
"These amendments concern matters such as the labelling of dangerous preparations which attain a dangerous concentration, if not individually, then when combined."
"If we accept these amendments, then together with the Commission proposal we believe it will make a good directive."
"I hope that Mr Bangemann is of the same opinion."
"Mr President, in its current form the Balti report is a good one."
"My group will be voting in favour of it."
"The report was not quite as good before the vote in the environment committee because, in its original form, some of the proposals it contained would have reduced the standard of regulations governing data sheets."
"Consequently, we will also be voting against all those proposals which have been raised again here aimed at reducing the standard of data sheets."
"On the whole, the report in its current form and the Commission's proposal are very good and they will lead to significant tightening up in many areas."
"Many more types of substances hazardous to health are now included which will be of benefit particularly to those with allergies."
"Pesticides are included as well."
"It is very important that the new Members are not forced to reduce the standard of their legislation by adopting regulations which are too weak."
"We will be voting for the report in its current format, and we will be voting against the UPE's amendment proposals."
"Mr President, I would like to welcome the Commission proposal."
"It is a much-needed and longoverdue review of this area of legislation."
"It is important not just for the safety of the environment but in particular for human health and safety."
"There are three things in the Commission proposal which I welcome."
"There is the general extension of information to preparations and substances dangerous to the environment, a new recognition of their importance; the extension of this proposal to biocides and pesticides, something which is much-needed and long-overdue; and an extension of the need to provide information on substances which are not necessarily dangerous by chemical characterization but when in use might pose some risks."
"The Commission proposal, like everything else in this world, is not perfect."
"Therefore I would commend to the Commission the majority of my colleagues' amendments which extend, clarify and develop the proposals of the Commission in a direction which is worthwhile and, in particular, the amendments which extend the provision of information through safety data sheets."
"This is a positive proposal which is in operation in some Member States already, including the United Kingdom and Sweden."
"It is important for suppliers to be obliged positively to provide safety data sheets to users."
"This really is essential."
"In addition, I would stress the need for good design of these sheets to ensure they are comprehensible to all users throughout the Union, which is not easy when dealing with technical material like this in many different languages."
"I hope that the Commission will examine this area carefully."
"I have some reservations with regard to proposals to allow the use of common or generic names without, in addition, the full names or details of the substance."
"I would hope that in these circumstances we would accept the safeguards proposed by the Commission as it is an effort worth taking and will pay off in time."
"Finally, I should like to thank the rapporteur."
"The gracious and enthusiastic way she has produced this report has made it very interesting."
"Her personal endeavour and commitment has made it a very enjoyable report to work on."
"Mr President, the directive on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations is certainly an important step towards genuinely completing the single market, because it is particularly necessary, in the field of chemicals, for us to have uniform labelling, uniform indications of risks and uniform methods of handling these dangerous materials."
"Certainly it is also important to approximate the Member States' different legislative systems."
"But, Mr Bangemann, it would have been a good idea also to incorporate the legislation on this matter that already exists in the three new Member States, Finland, Sweden and Austria, and not to wait for Parliament to point out, in the relevant amendments, that some Member States already have more stringent legislation, which is of course very sensible."
"My colleagues have pointed out on several occasions that in the case of dangerous preparations it is not just a question of the risks of individual substances but that it is often the combination of the various substances that presents a considerably greater danger."
"This needs to be pointed out, both to the processing firms and to those who buy the end products."
"I hope this amendment by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection will obtain the necessary majority here and that the Commission and the Council will approve it, because this is a most important point."
"I would like to add to another point my colleagues have already mentioned: for the sake of the consumer, we must ensure that these dangerous preparations are not advertised as ecologically safe and environment-friendly, or can be sold with these attributes, for that leads the consumer astray."
"Finally, let me turn briefly to the safety data sheets, which I believe are particularly necessary for small and medium-sized enterprises, even if they add extra costs, because the owners themselves are far more involved in working with their people than in large firms and they do not have the same chance to obtain information as large firms, which may have whole departments dealing only with chemicals."
"Mr President, Austria has had very strict and very progressive legislation on chemicals since 1985."
"During the accession negotiations Austria was specifically assured that it could keep this legislation for a transitional period, with the promise of very careful consideration as to whether the other EU states could not also adopt these high standards, so that Austria would not have to lower its own ones."
"We were given that assurance."
"So we were all the more surprised, Commissioner, at what the Commission then proposed!"
"Surely it would have been only natural for the Commission to submit a document containing all the stricter Austrian provisions."
"What Parliament or even the Council then did to it would have been another matter."
"Yet the Commission did not even consider it necessary to incorporate them in its draft!"
"Even stranger was the explanation in committee as to why it did not do so."
"The Commission told us: ' We asked the other Member States whether they might not be prepared to adopt the Austrian standards.'"
"To a minister, to an official, or to some secretary?"
"And in what form did it speak to them?"
"Did it write to them, or just make a few phone calls?"
"At any rate I consider this behaviour quite out of order!"
"I could now say as an Austrian that I don't care, that after Amsterdam we certainly do not have to suspend our legislation."
"But I shall not do so, for I am now an MEP and I am concerned about how that would look in Europe!"
"After all, we keep hearing from Amsterdam how important environmental protection is - top priority is given to sustainability in the economic sector too!"
"Very important, Commissioner!"
"We certainly hear that message, only we are gradually not believing it any more."
"For whenever it comes to practicalities, when it comes to implementing things, the Commission at least recoils."
"I very much hope the European Parliament will not recoil and that tomorrow we will approve the content of those amendments, which have in part already been law in Austria for the last ten years."
"Mr President, this Directive is important to all Member States of the European Union, but clearly, since agreement was reached on certain matters with the three new Member States during the accession negotiations, it is to be hoped that sufficient account will be taken of these points."
"Otherwise there is a danger that these countries will be left empty-handed at the beginning of 1999."
"The Directive, which was originally presented as an amending proposal by the Commission, has gradually acquired genuine substance of its own."
"The new Directive will unquestionably improve the existing situation, inter alia by collating and unifying EU legislation on dangerous preparations."
"It is also an improvement on the earlier Directive that the new proposal takes into account environmentally hazardous compounds and requires them to be classified and labelled."
"However, the job has been left unfinished."
"In the Directive it is proposed that, in the case of preparations which are not classified as hazardous substances but large batches of which contain small active quantities of hazardous substances, safety information for users should be provided to professional users only where required."
"However, this information would concern only substances hazardous to health, and not those hazardous to the environment."
"Yet decisions as to which compounds are to be used in practice are mostly taken at the work-place."
"It is there that it is decided how to use and store substances and how to dispose of waste."
"Many workers, as well as the trade unions, are aware of issues relating to health, safety at work and the environment."
"It would therefore make more sense to label these compounds in all cases with information about constituents hazardous to health or the environment."
"This is the purpose of Amendment 40."
"Certain sensitizing and possibly allergenic substances should be marked even if they can only provoke a reaction in sensitized people."
"Mr President, the directive we are discussing today does not just deal with labels on cans and drums and requirements to provide safety data sheets."
"It is a directive that will determine whether Danish painters are protected in the future against organic solvents."
"Many people in Denmark have a view on this."
"Unfortunately they remember it as one of the areas in which the EU is scrapping high Danish standards."
"In Denmark we consider that, while it cannot be demonstrated with certainty that painters suffer brain damage through being exposed to organic solvents, the mere suspicion constitutes sufficient grounds for taking action."
"Clearly therefore, painters need to know exactly what it is they are using. We now have some new friends in this circle: the three new Member States, who also support better labelling."
"In all three countries there has been concern that EU membership will lead to a lowering of standards on the environment and the working environment."
"The revision of the old directive, which also covers unwholesome things like pesticides, biocides and medicines, is viewed in these countries as a decisive test of whether membership can be reconciled with high Danish environmental standards."
"The European Parliament thus has a vital role to play here."
"It is up to us to put maximum pressure on the Commission and the Council of Ministers to ensure that we do not end up with inferior standards for consumers and workers."
"We are the only EU institution elected by direct suffrage in the fifteen Member States; we therefore have a duty to argue the case of the common man."
"Mr President, I do not want to discuss all the objectives we are aiming at in our proposal, because I believe it has become quite clear during the debate that the Commission, like Parliament, is endeavouring to improve the existing provisions."
"By and large all the Members who spoke in the debate have confirmed that."
"But in particular I want to thank the rapporteur and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, because we find most of the amendments they have tabled acceptable and think they improve the proposal which, I believe, was fairly good in the first place, taken as a whole - as Mrs Schleicher rightly pointed out."
"I want to concentrate mainly on the amendments now."
"We can accept 29 of the 39 amendments supported by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection either unreservedly or in principle: Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 27, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 and 39 unreservedly and Nos 6, 17, 24, 29 and 30 in principle."
"Since Amendment No 35 was adopted, Article 12 of the proposal has to be deleted, which of course means that the amendments tabled to that article lapse."
"Let me turn now to the amendments we do not want to accept."
"In our view Amendment No 4 would lead to unnecessary tests on animals because it would suspend the use of the conventional method."
"That is why we do not want to accept that amendment."
"Amendments Nos 8, 9, 11 and 12, to which Members from Sweden, Finland and Austria mainly referred, seek to introduce into the report a specific situation that exists particularly in Austria."
"It is not true that, as some of the ladies who spoke to these amendments believe, when we drew up the proposal we paid no regard whatsoever to the treaties we have concluded with the new Member States."
"For instance we also introduced classification and labelling provisions for pesticides, i.e. we incorporated legislative provisions that exist in, for instance, Austria."
"The same applies to substances that may pose a risk to the environment; we included this feature of Austrian law too."
"It is absolutely not the case, i.e. it is incorrect to say that we paid no regard at all to that."
"What we did not do is to incorporate a provision requiring that the chemical name of all dangerous substances contained in a preparation must be mentioned on the label."
"We rejected that idea because we believe - and this is not an affront to Austria, Sweden or Finland - that this would in fact be of no benefit at all to the consumer."
"On the contrary, if we listed all the substances that may be contained, even below the threshold level, we would have a mile-long list which no longer had any real meaning."
"I think it was Mrs Schleicher who rightly pointed that out."
"We did not do this just by the by; I want to tell you this because of the criticism that we just made a few phone calls."
"Of course we prepare our proposals carefully and we do so by discussing them with experts from all the Member States who can then put their own points of view in working parties."
"During these preparations we and the experts from the other Member States asked Austria to produce material or arguments to justify the special situation in Austria."
"It did not do so, which is why all the other Member States accepted the Commission's position."
"So you really cannot say that we proceeded in an arbitrary fashion without regard for these interests."
"I regard that almost as a personal attack, because I love Austria, and of course Finland and Sweden too!"
"All love affairs are dangerous, Mrs Flemming, that is why they are so wonderful!"
"So we did this for carefully considered reasons and I hope we will obtain Parliament's assent."
"On the question of translation, let me say I regret what happened."
"There are indeed a number of mistakes in the German version."
"We cannot correct that now, Mrs Schleicher."
"The document is in the Council's hands and the Council already has a proposal before it from the German delegation on how these mistakes can be corrected."
"So I assume all this can be sorted out."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at noon tomorrow."
"1998 estimate for EP and Ombudsman"
"The next item on the agenda is the report, drawn up by Mr Tomlinson on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the estimates of revenue and expenditure of the European Parliament and the estimates of revenue and expenditure of the Ombudsman for the 1998 financial year (A4-0178/97)."
"I call upon the rapporteur, Mr Tomlinson."
"Mr President, I should like to commend to the House the report that stands in my name on behalf of the Committee on Budgets."
"First, I want to say to the House that the one thing it should understand is that today's debate is the beginning of our budget procedure and not the end."
"I say that in the light of comments I shall subsequently make in relation to some of the amendments."
"This is not the conclusion but merely the start and, as you rightly pointed out, Mr President, when you read the subject for debate today, it is a report on the estimates of revenue and expenditure for the European Parliament and the Ombudsman."
"That is what we are establishing today."
"Therefore, at the outset, I want to emphasize, over and above the report itself, Amendment No 17 tabled by Mr Wynn which I urged him and my group to submit."
"Obviously I could not table it myself because it had not been dealt with in committee."
"The importance of Amendment No 17 is that in establishing the draft estimates we have gone over the 20 % ceiling of Category 5 appropriations which would normally be the maximum that Parliament spent in accordance with our normal practice."
"Therefore, Amendment No 17 contains a firm commitment to remain below the 20 % ceiling of administrative appropriations."
"I had a long discussion yesterday evening with the President of Parliament and with the Vice-President responsible for budgets."
"We are clearly agreed about the mechanisms which need to take place."
"There will be a rectifying letter sent by the Bureau of Parliament to the Committee on Budgets."
"That will need to be sent by the middle of September in order to effect the necessary changes."
"It means that over and above the suggestions that already exist in the draft report on the estimates, the Bureau has to face up to the need to find a further ECU 4m of cuts in the draft estimates and submit that proposal for ECU 4m of cuts to the Committee on Budgets."
"However, the letter of rectification will have to deal with other things beside that."
"It will need to see if there are any consequences, for example, of the outcome of the IGC in relation to places of work."
"That is going to be somewhat more complicated than people imagined at first sight."
"I do not want to produce a rather pejorative note into our discussion today but there will clearly be implications from the outcome of the IGC for the budget of Parliament and these will also need to be covered in the rectifying letter from the Bureau to the Committee on Budgets."
"The third area that such a rectifying letter will clearly need to cover - and I say this very clearly to the House - is the question about the outcome of the Bureau working group in relation to the transparency and control that was called for by Parliament in its resolution of December last year concerning Members' allowances."
"I and the Committee on Budgets will be resisting in the vote this week a number of amendments in relation to those allowances."
"That is not a value judgment on those amendments."
"It is intended as a proper respect for the competence of the Bureau to fulfil the mandate it has been given."
"It was asked to produce a report to Parliament by April."
"It has not been able to do so."
"Parliament and the Committee on Budgets are being extremely tolerant in accepting that it might take until September."
"But it cannot take beyond September."
"If we do not have the proposals from the Bureau for the transparency and control of Members' allowances in that rectifying letter in September, then it will be right and proper for the House to make its own decisions on the recommendation of the Committee on Budgets in the vote at first reading."
"I say that with as much clarity as I can because I do not want anybody to misinterpret votes that are made against some of the amendments."
"They are made not as a value judgment but out of respect for the Bureau competence, and include a promise that we will return to these questions at the reading of the budget in October if we do not consider that they have been adequately covered by that time."
"I now turn to the report itself."
"We work on the basis of the estimates that have been established by the Bureau on the basis of a report from the Secretary-General."
"The Committee on Budgets has mainly formulated proposals in six areas to work on the basis of the report that had been given to us and, we believe, to improve it somewhat."
"The first of those six areas is changing the updating of remarks and nomenclature, in particular in the statement of revenue."
"That is rather technical but, nevertheless, important to the clarity and transparency of our budget."
"The second area, which I have already partly referred to, is in relation to Members' travelling allowances."
"Concerning travel expenses, we have now reached an agreement with the Bureau that there will be no increase in the travel allowance, not even the increase for inflation for the year 1998."
"We have clearly incorporated that. It does not depend on future votes."
"It is in this draft report."
"The third area where we have concentrated our endeavours relates to the freezing of the establishment plan of the secretariat but, at the same time, within that overall context of freezing the establishment plan, there has been the granting of a certain number of upgradings on the basis of parameters set for career developments."
"There are a number of other areas that we will be looking at in some detail on the basis of reports we ask for in the course of the budgetary procedure."
"For example, there are a number of requests that we ask for further information concerning mission expenses and canteen expenses."
"I have to say that I do not feel any sense of grievance at the somewhat perjorative way I have been represented by the Staff Committee who advertise what they claim to be the price of Tomlinson."
"I had suggested that we put the appropriations for subsidies to the canteens into reserve until we could examine more fully how they were currently used and how they could be justified in future, if at all."
"I suspect, however, on reflection that the staff did not agree with its Staff Committee either because at the Staff Committee elections where this figured as one of the most prominent aspects of their election campaign, the Staff Committee found that it was 350 votes short of a quorum."
"That indicates the need for it to get its act together and fight on the real issues of concern and not on phoney issues such as whether they deserve a subvention to their canteens."
"The next major item on which we will be focusing relates to the whole question of building policy."
"One of the problems we have had in the 1998 budget is that although we move out of the Belliard building in order to occupy the new building, our lease on the Belliard building continues well into the next millennium."
"So there had been no provision made for the rent of the Belliard building."
"That might have satisfied everybody in theory, but it did not satisfy the landlord."
"The landlord needed to be paid."
"Therefore, we have had to enter over ECU 7m into the budget for the rent for the Belliard building until we have managed to dispose of that lease."
"An extremely important part of our building policy, therefore, is not just concentrating on moving into new buildings but making sure that we dispose properly of leases on existing buildings such as Van Maerlant and the Belliard building."
"Finally, there was the assessment and updating of strategy in the data-processing sector where the Committee on Budgets are collaborating very well with Vice-President Haarder who has responsibility in this area."
"A substantial amount of money is being put into the reserve until the data-processing strategy is somewhat clearer."
"There are many other things in the Committee on Budgets' deliberations which I could focus on."
"For example, we have looked at the whole question of telecoms in a liberalized telecommunications market."
"We find it somewhat surprising that as the telecommunications market has liberalized we have not gone to competitive tender for the provision of telecom services."
"So, the Committee on Budgets has called on the administration to produce an appropriate report with appropriate savings."
"Therefore, on the basis of what I have said, I will be opposing all amendments to the Committee on Budgets' report and urge people who have amendments to realize that frequently the best place for their amendment is not in the estimates but when we come to the reading of the budget in October."
"I can deal with the other part of the report in the remaining 20 seconds."
"It is in relation to the estimates of the Ombudsman."
"It shows the general state of satisfaction with the modesty of his requests and demands that it has received no amendment at all."
"I commend the report to the House."
"Mr President, first I should like to thank Mr Tomlinson for his report on the 1998 estimates for the European Parliament and the Ombudsman."
"This report clearly shows the need to continue the budgetary austerity line begun last year, so that the 2.7 increase in Section I as compared with last year is the correct and the most suitable figure which could be applied."
"But austerity should be backed up by sound financial management which would necessarily require greater interinstitutional cooperation and better use of technological resources, since data processing, as Mr Tomlinson has just mentioned, would make the work more efficient."
"I fully agree that we could obtain much more for the money which is to be spent."
"However, it must be noted that there is still a lack of transparency as regards the implementation of various parts of Section I, so information is rather scant: Epicentre, security, cleaning and maintenance."
"I also regret that the situation on the future of the Belliard I and II Buildings has not been clarified nor the transfer of the Maerlantd Building."
"Is the Maerlantd Building to be occupied by the Economic and Social Committee or the Committee of the Regions?"
"I am aware that none of these decisions is without its difficulties since, although we have buildings enough an to spare now, we might be short of them following enlargement."
"It is still essential to make sure that the removal from the Maerlantd building is coordinated in order to avoid leaving the building unoccupied which would entail further expense."
"I am confident that the competent administration will do everything possible to clarify the future situation on the accommodation front."
"As regards the last point which Mr Tomlinson mentioned on budgetary heading 1840 - the restaurant subsidy - I think that subsidy constitutes compensation to a firm which is providing a continuous and correct service to people who are not present for the whole week and many of whom are for one week in every month in Strasbourg."
"I therefore think that the subsidy provides some compensation for diminished use."
"If it is discontinued that will be reflected in an increase in prices and, finally, like the whiting biting its own tail, in even less use so that it will then be necessary to go out to eat, which would increase the time spent away from the offices."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Tomlinson for the spirit of thrift that ran through his speech to Parliament, and I want to thank the Committee on Budgets and the Bureau, on which I myself sit, for unanimously deciding to keep Members' expenses for travel and the like at the same level as last year or, more accurately, to keep expenditure for next year at the same level as this year."
"I should like to thank Mr Tomlinson for his clear insistence that the release of money to refund travel expenses in the future should of course be subject to the production of documentation showing that a journey has actually been made."
"That is the least that can be expected."
"The Liberal Group has a very clear position on this matter."
"No firm would cover travel expenses for its employees without proof that they have actually travelled."
"Our Parliament should not give politicians terms any different to those governing the conduct of our citizens."
"It is not a question of mistrust, it is about order, propriety and openness, so that everyone can see that things are being done correctly."
"We in the Liberal Group take an equally clear stance on Parliament's sittings in Strasbourg."
"We accept - albeit under protest - the ordinance that Parliament should meet every month in Strasbourg."
"But every month means 11 and not 12 part-sessions."
"We think that the Council of Ministers shows contempt for Parliament by not taking account of this, because it causes expenditure to increase quite unreasonably."
"It is important that Parliament get used to saving in all areas and that we do our work more efficiently."
"If we get used to saving, we shall also have money to spend on necessary projects, for example in the field of information technology."
"We must transform Parliament from the bogey it is in some Member States into a model, an example of a unique, effective and modern international Parliament working in close cooperation with the national parliaments and with ordinary citizens."
"That must be the goal of our activity."
"Mr President, there is increasing public concern that parliamentarians receive extra tax free income because of their high allowances."
"Such privileges are damaging to democracy and create a gulf between us and our people."
"In the interests of democracy such privileges should be abolished."
"Those responsible ought to take note of this before September."
"The Tomlinson report also proposes that funds be set aside for political parties at European level."
"This is a very strange proposal."
"Parties are created by the people."
"Their legitimacy arises from this popular base."
"To create 'super parties' by allocating money from above is democratically unnatural."
"It is contrary to national constitutions that foreign based parties should be able to intervene and be active in national politics, in competition with national independent parties."
"The creation of such 'super parties' which stand above society and above the people is alien to all democratic tradition."
"Democracy is not constructed from above."
"Nor is Parliament - and nor can they be bought with money."
"The whole of this absurd idea should be rejected."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that building policy is a very heavy burden on Parliament, which is why I also presume that retaining the 20 % limit is the most delicate question we will have to resolve at the first reading."
"Regardless of that, I believe we can no longer escape the necessary pressure for reform and the call for transparency in this House."
"In this context I would like to openly praise the rapporteur and thank him for including in his report a demand which my group has been making in this House for a long time."
"Let me refer you to paragraph 36."
"We too would like to see an ecological audit of Parliament's buildings."
"We cannot call on EU enterprises to observe the eco-audit directive while we ourselves sidestep it in the case of our own buildings and our own approach to paper and the environment."
"The second remark I would like to make concerns the public procurement system in this House."
"We have tabled a supplementary amendment on this and I would be very grateful if it could still be considered."
"In my view, this House is far too sloppy in its approach to public procurement."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control is currently examining the cases that have arisen in the course of last year and the year before and I believe a warning about the need to observe these public rules would be a good idea for us and especially of course for the administration and the Bureau."
"My third remark concerns the urgent need for transparency in relation to allowances for us, the Members of this House."
"We have now found that the working party set up to this end has not yet reached any conclusion and perhaps we should not just call for the appropriate reform proposals with a warning that we will come to our own decision at first reading in September but should say openly that in future Parliament itself will decide on Members' allowances, and not the Bureau."
"In this context, I certainly support the rapporteur."
"All the requests we, and in particular my group, have put forward on transparency in relation to travel allowances, checks on attendance by means of roll-call votes, auditing secretariat costs and the transferral of the general estimate of these allowances directly to the pension fund, all these requests which I and my group regard as minimum standards for transparency in relation to allowances, will be put before this House for a roll-call vote in September."
"Then we will see how serious the House is about transparency!"
"Mr President, with just two minutes in which to speak I must of course limit myself to a couple of fundamental comments."
"First of all, I once again regret that no serious attempt is being made to set an example as Members of Parliament."
"It is a fact that in all Member States - and partly as a result of the Maastricht criteria - our electors are being asked to make huge material sacrifices, with the imposition of new taxes and levies."
"But we ourselves are not touching our princely - even by parliamentary standards - expenditure allowances of various kinds. I know that I can now be accused of being a hypocrite."
"I understand such comments."
"I must certainly acknowledge that the leading proposer of amendments on this subject is a member of the Flemish Socialist Party, the party which is notorious for the bribes and other scandals of which not one penny has yet been returned to the taxpayer."
"But nevertheless, if tomorrow we support all the amendments which correct the anomalies of our allowances, nobody needs be a hypocrite any longer."
"Secondly, as a Fleming I want to categorically state that under no circumstances must savings be made on the back of translation costs."
"I note that members of the European Commission among others are increasingly trampling on the right to information in your own language."
"I experienced this once again in Strasbourg this month, for example, during a speech by Commissioner Cresson."
"Anybody who takes even a cursory glance at this Parliament's budget can immediately find tens of millions of ecus in possible savings."
"It is no exaggeration to say that in 'Europe' money is being thrown out of the window."
"In these circumstances, in my opinion anyone who wants to save on translation costs is motivated by other than budgetary considerations."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur."
"It is the typical style we have come to expect from him - combative and taking no hostages when he is fighting particular causes."
"However, I should like to echo the point that we are dealing with estimates of revenue and expenditure."
"We will come to our first reading later this year and that will be the time when substantive decisions will be taken."
"On behalf of my group, in contributing to this debate and in setting Parliament's budget for the 1998 financial year, I want to underline the following points."
"Firstly, we would like to make sure that the overall approach we take is one which respects a general rigour in monitoring the expenditure of the budget."
"So we find ourselves, as in 1997, in sympathy with Member States who are having to cut back on expenditure to meet the Maastricht criteria for the single currency."
"In doing so, we wish to retain the 20 % limit and quite clearly a decision will have to be taken as to how to do that."
"Secondly, looking at particular items, the Group of the European People's Party will be putting forward amendments, in particular on information policy, to make sure that we are going to get the right economies in both the Commission and Parliament budgets."
"We have done that in the past and will continue to do so."
"For example, we will aim at the objective of having common European houses in our Member States by the year 2000."
"Equally, we back the position of the rapporteur in the treatment of the Epicentre."
"We have to be extremely cautious about setting up a new system of information without coordinating it effectively with other means of distributing information to parliamentarians."
"In terms of building policy, now that the Council has decided that Parliament should have its seat in Strasbourg, we will be voting for the cheapest way in which we can purchase our buildings."
"The ten-year solution, however inconvenient, is the one we must stick by."
"Lastly, when it comes to the first reading we will be looking for the report which Parliament asked of the Bureau on the question of a statute for Members' allowances."
"That is the point in time when we must take a decision and not now, as one or two Members seem to think, in order to gain some short-term political capital."
"In the Amsterdam Treaty under Article 138(4) Parliament is asked to come up with proposals on how a common statute will operate."
"We will be looking to bring all these elements together and take some sensible decisions as to how our finances should be expended."
"Mr President, the estimate of the European Parliament's next year's expenditure has been drawn up most professionally. My thanks to Mr Tomlinson."
"Parliament's budget ought not to exceed 20 % of Category 5 appropriations."
"This document exceeds that ceiling by ECU 4 million."
"This is a blemish which ought to be expunged. I therefore support Amendment 17."
"Among the other main points, I should like to stress point 6(f) of Part B, concerning data processing."
"The European Parliament's systems are years behind those at the Member States' parliaments - at any rate Finland's. The rapporteur's stress on this point is accordingly justified."
"In my view it is also right that the rapporteur has cut expenditure on canteens."
"Originally, running costs amounted to two and a half million ECU, or approximately 100 Belgian francs per customer per day, assuming that every employee and every Member eats every working day."
"I do not see any need for subsidies. If the employer wishes to subsidize employees' meals, this should be done in a different way - openly, for example by issuing luncheon vouchers."
"Canteens and a possible Parliament shop ought to be organized by means of open competitions - the approach which has in fact already been adopted in many Member States. 3-079"
"Mr President, I welcome Mr Tomlinson's decisiveness with regard to Members' privileges and expenses allowances."
"He has decided to put these matters in order if the working party set up by the Bureau does not achieve anything."
"But as a member of the Bureau's working party, I have to say that Mr Tomlinson is far too polite."
"I would advise you not to expect too much of the working party."
"Its chairman, who is leaving Parliament to take up other duties, has just postponed the final meeting, at which proposals were supposed to have been made."
"It has been quite impossible for us to obtain definite information as to how the various amendments tabled affect Parliament's budget."
"But Parliament undoubtedly needs to reach a quick decision about this, as we know that the Court of Auditors is also taking an interest in the curious problem that expenses are paid here for journeys which have not been made."
"It is also known that citizens have complained to the Ombudsman about this administrative defect."
"Proposals therefore need to be made without delay."
"As Edith MÃ¼ller has said, the Green Group believes that travelling expenses should be paid only if documentary evidence is produced."
"This is the only way of overcoming the existing problems, which undermine the very legitimacy of Parliament."
"Roll-calls should also be held at plenary sittings to ensure that Members do not draw their daily allowances unless they participate in the electronic voting."
"I should also like to draw attention to the secretarial assistance allowance."
"This totals around 7 % of Parliament's entire budget."
"I believe there is a good deal of negligence here."
"A proper audit is called for."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at noon tomorrow, Thursday."
"The information society"
"The next item on the agenda is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0163/97 by Mr Hendrick, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the proposal for a Council Decision adopting a multiannual Community programme to stimulate the establishment of the information society in Europe (COM(96)0596 - C4-0030/97-96/0283(CNS)); -A4-0208/97 by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the communications from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on: -' The Information Society: from Corfu to Dublin, The New Priorities' , and 'The Implications of the Information Society for European Union Policies' (COM(96)0395) - (C4 0521/96) and-' Europe at the Forefront of the Global Information Society: Rolling Action Plan' (COM(96)0607 - C40648/96); -A4-0209/97 by Mr RÃ¼big, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on 'Standardization and the global information society: the European approach' (COM(96)0359 - C4-0523/96); -A4-0200/97 by Mrs Ahlqvist, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, European Parliament, Economic and Social Committee and Committee of the Regions: ' Learning in the Information Society: Action Plan for a European Education Initiative' (COM(96)0471 - C4-0528/96)."
"Mr President, my report is concerned with the awareness, raising and dissemination of information about the information society."
"As we all know, information in itself is power."
"And our job, as elected representatives of the people, is to disseminate that power to the people."
"We do that by creating an information society where information is plentiful and widely distributed and through reliable infrastructure."
"Information empowers people and we as Socialists cannot accept an information society of haves and have-nots."
"That is why the Commission with the support of this Parliament continues to support the multiannual programme to stimulate the establishment of the information society in Europe."
"The setting up of the information society project office is a tremendous step forward."
"The worldwide web and the Internet has developed into a phenomenal medium."
"The use of this medium will revolutionize society as we know it."
"The nineteenth century was the age of agriculture and the twentieth century the age of manufacturing industry."
"With computers and mechanization, most of our food, consumer goods and services will be provided by automated systems."
"Early into the next century, only approximately 8 % of our population will be employed in agriculture or manufacturing goods and services."
"The vast majority of human activity will revolve around the use of information and the twenty-first century will be the age of information."
"Information will be the raw material."
"Economic performance and prosperity will be determined by the ability to process raw information into knowledge, by the ability to transport that knowledge throughout information infrastructures, through fibre-optic cables and via satellite to destinations where it can be utilized to create wealth for our citizens."
"Teleworking, teleshopping, teleconferences are all activities which will utilize the new technologies and the new infrastructure."
"What we also need are people with the skills to do that."
"The multiannual programme will contribute significantly to making people aware of these new technologies and encouraging them to take up the new technologies and learn the skills required in order to utilize them so that they may find fortune in the future with work and prosperity which will keep Europe ahead of the game in terms of economic performance."
"In addition, we should not just set up a programme to stimulate such use without monitoring the effectiveness of that programme."
"Therefore, in my report I suggest that we monitor the performance of the programme using specific parameters which will say how effective that programme has been and ensure that the Community funds are being well-spent and used effectively."
"It is also important that we involve other players apart from the Commission, Parliament and national regulatory authorities in this process."
"I have therefore suggested that we set up a committee made up of industrialists and academics, experts in their own particular field, who could provide an input to the Commission, Parliament and the regulatory authorities so that this multiannual programme can take into account the views of people in the Community as a whole."
"It is for this reason that we hope to see an information society that will benefit all our citizens in the future and one which will give them the jobs and the prosperity they so desperately need at this moment in time."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the White Paper 'Growth, Competitiveness and Employment' already contains a notable overall view of what needs to be done to allow Europe to enter the 21st century as a major player in the information society."
"After the White Paper came the Corfu, Esssen and Dublin Summits."
"On each occasion the Council and Commission took the necessary measures. They were then either not implemented at all or implemented too slowly."
"Now the Amsterdam Summit has once again called for more employment and has decided to hold a special employment summit in Luxembourg."
"On paper everything is in place."
"The Commission proposals which we have before us today, studies by the high level group, the Club of Brussels, the information society forum, ... and just too many to name."
"What we must now do is make a final choice and then promptly act upon it."
"This is why I call upon the Council and the Commission to place all the proposed measures concerning the employment aspects of the information society high on the agenda at the employment summit."
"The ministerial conference in Bonn can provide the necessary first steps in doing this."
"The information and communication technologies are an example of a new activity by means of which new jobs can be created without too many extra European resources, provided the right conditions are created."
"In the telecommunications sector alone 150, 000 jobs have been created."
"The indirect effect of ICT on the European economy as a whole could lead to the creation of between 0.5 and almost 1.5 billion new jobs."
"Secondly, Europe must create a competitive environment for industry."
"An internal market which, unfortunately, remains inadequate, is resulting in an inadequate European competitiveness."
"This is why it is important to strictly respect the deadlines linked to the action plans."
"There is a need for improvement in areas such as combating government assistance to national companies and ensuring fair competition."
"In this connection, I support Commissioner Monti's proposals for the completion of the internal market."
"It is the Member States which are the biggest problem in this area. They are often too lax in implementing European regulations."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in the information society it is new small businesses which play an innovative role by developing new products and which are therefore important to boosting Europe's competitiveness."
"At the present time just 4 % of Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises have Internet access."
"It must be the EU's task to stimulate the activities of these small firms."
"The European Investment Bank can grant loans to new and fast-growing businesses, as was decided at last week's European summit."
"I also believe that a substantial part of the resources under the Fifth Framework Programme must be allocated to activities relating to the information society."
"At present just 2 % of the regional funds are used for this."
"The same applies to the European Social Fund."
"It is possible to do more and better things with the same money."
"The information society is not only a question of technology, it is also a question of the impact on society."
"I am pleased to see that the focus of the Rolling Action Plan is shifting to the social aspects of the information society."
"Hopefully this aspect will not be neglected at the ministerial conference in Bonn."
"Special attention must be paid to lifelong learning and adult education."
"Attention must also be paid - and this is probably the most difficult part of the European Commission's work - to creating a more flexible market and reformulating the rights and obligations of employees and employers."
"The Member States must always remember that a European population given the constant possibility to undertake further training under working conditions which take into account the new forms of work is a formidable weapon in the war of competition with the United States and Japan."
"The four policy lines on which I comment in my report are good policy lines."
"I am pleased with the documents as presented but, as I have said, at the end of the day ICT must be for people and not the other way round."
"My greatest concern is therefore the implementation of the correct regulations. This is why I call upon the Commission, upon us as a Parliament and upon the Council to produce fewer memos and take more action."
"Mr President, I want to congratulate the negotiators in Amsterdam on not downgrading employment to a question purely of convergence but on deciding that this issue will be discussed in depth at a summit in Luxembourg."
"I believe that a competitive European economy is the main point of departure for creating new jobs."
"That means we must work even harder to complete the internal market, which is where the information society has a central role to play."
"Mr Hendrick has highlighted this very well."
"This is where we must start."
"This is where we must make more progress."
"Of course standards form part of it and standardization can do much to make the European economy more competitive."
"For standards are not just a technical or legal matter; they are the precondition for creating competitiveness."
"In the field of information and communications technology, the development of standards is - and in my view must be - market driven."
"I believe that is crucial to the drawing up of standards."
"Four basic questions arise here."
"Firstly: official standards and the concept of publicly available specifications."
"I think we have to consider the technical and legal aspects of this."
"The second major question is the changing role of standards and of the European standardization organizations."
"I believe in future we will have to work more closely together both with the national and with the international standardization organizations, avoid duplication and twin-track situations and in particular speed up this process."
"The third question is the legal status of publicly available specifications, also known as PAS, in Community law."
"I believe that in relation to this legal status we must also consider to what extent this involves the software, hardware and manware areas."
"Mrs Ahlqvist will be going into that later."
"In the information society, learning is of fundamental importance and we need learning standards too so that we can see whether certain standards have been achieved and what standards are needed."
"The fourth question is the importance of strategic proposals for developing competitiveness through the standards policy."
"That brings me to standardization itself."
"It offers substantial benefits, namely legal and technical certainty for the users, for the firms, for the consumers and for the suppliers, and I believe that this is a most important basis and a fundamental consideration."
"But in the end we are also talking about a legal basis for the world-wide extension of these standards and taking direct account of essential requirements such as security - for security is always a central issue - network interconnection, application interoperability and data protection."
"Standards also offer the advantage of being published, which means they are easily accessible worldwide, without time loss."
"That means we can easily obtain carefully checked, written documents and opinions, on the basis of which we can then also improve our standards."
"At present these processes take too long: a period of 6 to 8 years is no longer compatible with the life cycle of products of these technologies."
"We also find, for example, that certain standards have never even been developed."
"A simple example is the electric plug; there are many different, incompatible systems in the European Community."
"We also have standards that were not developed quickly enough, where the European industry did not decide quickly enough, for example Video 2000, which never established itself."
"On the other hand we have standards that have achieved international recognition, such as GSM."
"GSM is becoming established worldwide and it is quite easy to telephone Slovakia or Russia today thanks to GSM."
"Now, with the introduction of the euro, for instance, new opportunities have opened up for standardization, and especially for the PAS."
"With the prospect of the introduction of banking codes we can already consider how Europe is to meet this challenge internationally and thereby become more competitive."
"I believe the report makes it very clear that both de facto and de jure standards should be applied and that new systems must also be developed."
"As in the case of proprietary rights - patents, trade marks, copyright, protection of patterns and designs - a complete system should be developed for standards, in which small and medium-sized enterprises and consumer organizations should be very closely involved."
"Mr President, this discussion today of the first report that I have had the pleasure of writing on behalf of the culture committee evokes special feelings for me."
"I am pleased to have been given this task, particularly because my homeland, Sweden, can in many ways be held up as an illustration of information technology and its use."
"The Commission has given the Swedish Department of Education the task of developing a school computer network which will be used throughout Europe."
"We have started work and I hope to be able to present the results to the culture committee at the end of the year."
"At the same time, I cannot refrain from mentioning the slightly bizarre fact that the position adopted by Parliament concerns a plan of action which was launched in December last year."
"I am not one of those who wish to increase the power of the European Parliament to interfere in everything but I really do think that when we do something we should do it seriously."
"It is true that I have had regular contact with the Commission and I assume that some of my opinions will be evident in the future handling of the action plan."
"But I really would like to emphasise that positions adopted by Parliament which are not legally binding must also be treated seriously."
"How will our people have faith in the slogan 'Citizens first' if the opinions of elected members are treated as pure formalities?"
"As far as the actual action plan is concerned I support the Commission's proposals for the most part."
"The initiative has three goals: to hasten the entry of schools into the information society, to promote increased use of multimedia technology in teaching and to strengthen the European dimension in education with the help of the tools of the information society, and to put emphasis on cultural and linguistic diversity."
"In order to achieve these three goals the initiative will concentrate on four courses of action which will support local and national initiatives."
"T his will be based on promoting the interlinking of school networks to each other and encouraging the development and spread of the programme."
"In addition, teachers will receive training and support and all those involved will be given information on the pedagogical opportunities offered by multi-media technology."
"Both research and pilot projects demonstrate that information technology makes the acquisition of new knowledge easier and stimulates personal development provided that it is adapted according to need and that the educational content is sufficient."
"Based on my experience as head teacher at HertsÃ¶n's high school in LuleÃ¥ I think that teacher training and information for parents are prerequisites for the success of the project."
"It is important that teachers have time to familiarise themselves with new methods of teaching and that they fully understand the possibilities."
"At the same time I know that parents have an important role to play in reinforcing school work at home."
"Both of these points are also underlined by the Commission."
"But the original action plan does not address an issue which I consider to be extremely important in this respect and that is the situation of the disabled."
"As a result of information technology, opportunities for disabled people are greatly increased both in education and at work."
"There is a need to develop software and information and to undergo training in order to take advantage of this."
"The wonderful thing about most software packages is that there is practically no extra cost involved in adapting them for the disabled provided this is done at an early stage in the development process."
"I think that this must be a political priority."
"The Commission have shown themselves to be in favour of my proposal which I hope will now be developed in more detail."
"The same applies to the aspect of equality."
"It is also extremely important that we redress the unfavourable balance between the sexes which even now can still be seen on the computer front."
"This is why I have proposed that a pilot project be created within the action plan aimed particularly at young girls."
"Regardless of the risks associated with the information society we must acknowledge that there really is no alternative."
"This is why it is important that we politicians enter the debate at an early stage and that we are aware of the opportunities available through new information technology."
"It is in primary schools and secondary schools that the new technology must be taught."
"Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights let me warmly congratulate Mrs Boogerd-Quaak on her report and thank her for fully incorporating in her report the unanimously adopted conclusions of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights."
"All the reports we are jointly debating today show that the European Parliament is fully committed to the Commission's policy on the information society."
"But they also show that we have to point to the dangers of unilateral development."
"Unilateral developments are becoming increasingly evident and the Commission must do more to counter them in its policy."
"While applications in the commercial and entertainment fields, for instance, are becoming increasingly varied and numerous, the field of public administrations is lagging behind at both national and EU level."
"We do not see comparable progress in improved citizens' access to public information, access to the law, or accelerated legal and administrative procedures."
"The same applies to non-commercial applications in the field of schools, education and culture."
"These useful applications would also make it more attractive to a larger number of women to use the techniques of the information society."
"Another possible field of application is rarely if at all mentioned in the action plan, namely the potential of the information society to strengthen the citizens' democratic rights."
"We could do with a more imaginative approach here at all policy levels."
"If we want to bring the project of Europe closer to the citizen, and after Amsterdam that will be more necessary than ever, we will have to embark on large-scale experiments in tele-democracy."
"Mr President, you are just ten years old and already surfing the Internet."
"You can put information on Voicemail and exchange data and news through your E-mail."
"You use CD-Rom not just for games and also make discoveries in virtual reality."
"Europe's young people are using the new information and communication technologies, which are still a mystery to many adults."
"Yet while a number of schoolchildren are teaching themselves, but also their parents, how to use these new technologies, others have no access to them: disabled pupils, pupils with learning difficulties and those who do not have the money to buy the basic equipment."
"The gap between those who know and those who do not know must be narrowed."
"They must be given equal access to these technologies at an early stage."
"They should be taught and learn how to use them responsibly."
"One aim of the European Commission's action plan, which we support in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, is to promote their use in primary and secondary schools."
"Regardless of the type of school, regardless of the level of qualification, minimum knowledge must be transmitted in order to equip young people for their future working and social life."
"These technologies are bringing Europe closer together."
"Children at school can contact each other across frontiers, learn to know other cultures and languages and develop common interests which can be built on through visits to the host families."
"At present the costs of equipping schools with data banks are still far too high and the multimedia applications are totally inadequate."
"Mrs Ahlqvist, the rapporteur, showed that very clearly."
"So we need to implement more pilot projects, such as our German 'schools on the network' initiative."
"That could link up ten thousand schools to national and international networks and multimedia services in the space of three years."
"At European level, the further training of teachers in the use of these future technologies is being supported through the Socrates programme."
"Let me draw your attention in particular to the need to support women teachers, for we must not allow them to continue to be disadvantaged in a technical world often dominated by men."
"There is also a shortage of pedagogical material at schools."
"To this end high-grade databases must be developed and used."
"To ensure that many people do not rely solely on computers, teaching must also aim to motivate pupils to develop a team spirit and work creatively in groups."
"It should also help ensure that information is not just swallowed but also interpreted and that pupils checks its veracity."
"In this way the new information and communication technologies can help pupils make judgments and decisions, which are essential elements of true democracy."
"Mr President, I am the rapporteur of the opinion of the Committee for Research, Technical Development and Energy on Mrs Ahlqvist's report on Learning in the Information Society."
"The committee unanimously accepted my proposal for the opinion."
"Mrs Ahlqvist has included most of the points raised by the energy committee."
"So I will just briefly describe three areas which I would particularly like to highlight."
"The first is that there is a big difference in terms of IT and Internet capability in the various schools in the European Union."
"Fewer than 5 percent of European schools had access to electronic networks in the middle of last year."
"This figure varies enormously between Member States."
"In Sweden and Finland for example two thirds of schools have access to the Internet while the figure is fewer than 2 percent of schools in Germany."
"This is something which we must bear in mind when we are discussing these issues."
"The other point on which we have spent much time is the attitude of teachers to the technology."
"Personally, I do not think that it is the young people and students who have the most difficulty in adapting to new IT information."
"The difficulties have more to do with the teacher's attitude and expertise."
"In many places it is now teachers who have the most difficulty in adapting to this type of information while young people view it more naturally."
"We must also be cautious in placing too much faith in multi-media technology."
"It is by no means certain that the use of multi-media technology will mean better teaching in schools."
"Multi-media technology should complement normal teaching methods."
"Schools also need funds for non-material resources, in other words, for teachers."
"This is linked with my third point which is that we must look seriously at EMU in this respect as EMU requires the fulfilment of certain convergence criteria which, for example in Sweden, has meant that the public sector, which includes schools, has had to make savings."
"I do not think it is right to make savings in such an important area as schools."
"Young people are the future of the EU."
"We should not therefore be making savings in schools as we are doing at the moment."
"Mr President, if we develop the immense potential inherent in information technology, we can improve the economy, we can make life easier, not least for the disadvantaged in society, and we can increase public information and democracy."
"There is no end to the possibilities; applications are emerging all over the place."
"But, if the EU is to take full advantage of and have its full share in this new market and in these new possibilities, we urgently need to bring about a single, homogeneous internal European market."
"There is a lack of legal security and legal predictability."
"That is weakening European enterprises with respect to their American counterparts."
"A large number of directives are in hand and awaiting implementation."
"The present rules of competition are inadequate."
"There is plenty to do."
"There is one bright spot - and we should be grateful to the Commission for it - namely that agreement was reached at the Amsterdam Conference to call upon the European Investment Bank to set up a new loan facility for advanced technology projects in small and medium-sized enterprises."
"That is a very important step."
"The Commission must be asked to step up its efforts to secure and improve the operation of the internal market in the field of information and technology."
"The Member State governments must take steps to ensure that the liberalization of the telecommunications sector is implemented in good time and on a fully unified basis by 1998."
"And we must not forget the part we ourselves have to play."
"The European institutions must also think of their own information technology policy."
"The Commission must do that, and so must we in Parliament."
"And indeed so must the European Schools, which are regrettably lagging somewhat behind with regard to these possibilities."
"There are problems in large parts of the education sector as regards the use of the new possibilities."
"As a former education minister, I would gladly speak at greater length on this, but I will instead merely echo the points very eloquently made just now by Mr Thomas Mann."
"Mr President, I have been asked, on behalf of Mr Ripa di Meana, to outline the views of the Committee on Culture concerning the Commission's two documents on the information society."
"It is clear that the Commission has a duty to take cultural aspects into account in this field, as Article 128(4) of the EU Treaty stipulates."
"However, the Committee on Culture is concerned that the Commission's plans for the information society do not take this duty seriously enough."
"The Committee on Culture has particularly drawn attention to the fact that practical ways of promoting cultural diversity are now needed."
"There is no shortage of fine-sounding words on the subject, but the specific proposals are not particularly impressive."
"One significant element in cultural diversity is multilingualism."
"There is a serious risk that the information society may become a monolingual society."
"This is not a development to be welcomed."
"The Commission ought therefore constantly to be making practical proposals concerning ways of promoting a multilingual information society."
"It is also important to point out that what is at issue is not merely equipment and technology."
"To a very large extent, we are also concerned with the type of social and broader societal impact information technology will have, and one cannot stress too much that these social and societal effects have not by any means been investigated as fully as their seriousness warrants."
"We are witnesses to a development which is nothing short of revolutionary: national tax systems will already be seriously threatened as people start to do their shopping through the Internet."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to concentrate on three parts of Mrs Boogerd-Quaak's report."
"I believe that the move to an information society signifies a radical change in our society."
"In my view, the information society is based on two pillars, technological development on the one hand and social and societal development on the other."
"Until now technological development has stood in the forefront, and it does indeed remain crucial to European industry."
"This area is marked by rapid technological change."
"Buzzwords such as broad-band networks, ISDN, Internet, Intranet, telematics in communications, etc., are commonplace now. The Commission's many efforts in this field are laudable."
"The rapporteur, Mrs Boogerd-Quaak, is supported in her call for the various activities to be integrated."
"We need more transparency in this area."
"The Commission must try harder to integrate the many individual information systems and regulations in a coherent and transparent whole."
"The second pillar of the information society is society and its societal aspects."
"Initially, not enough attention was paid to these aspects, but they are increasingly being given their due place."
"So I warmly welcome the fact that the Commission has made this clear in its green paper on 'Living and Working in the Information Society: People First' ."
"Here the key words are: lifelong learning, knowledge as the central qualification, etc., but also fear of technology, the disintegration of society into those who can handle the new media and technologies and another those who have no technical or psychological access to it."
"The rapporteur is right to recognize a deficit in relation to social and societal aspects."
"I can only share her view."
"We do not want an information society that is concerned only with how the few can boost their profits."
"The European concept of an information society must carry the citizens with it along the road to the future."
"Social change must also open up opportunities for the individual on a broad front."
"By that I mean giving the individual a greater say, more access to information, more chances of education and more opportunities for low-cost communication."
"And looking to the future, the EU must prepare itself for the next round of enlargement even at this stage."
"It is most important to involve the applicants for accession in the regulatory process if we want to have a homogeneous market in Europe."
"Once again we must also stress the importance of a European regulatory authority in the telecommunications field."
"I think that is the only way to ensure competition in this area and to reduce disputes between European operators and governments."
"Seven amendments have been tabled to the report as such, which our group supports except for Nos 3 and 4."
"They make it clear that the development of an information society must not call workers' rights in question."
"We reject any idea of a protection-free zone."
"We could accept Amendment No 2 if the words 'public service' were replaced by 'universal service' ."
"But this is probably just a question of terminology."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, during the last session we debated an own initiative report from the Committee on Research on the information society."
"Last week at the Le Bourget Salon we had the opportunity to hear about the commitment of the space agencies and European industry in the field of satellite transmission."
"In May, in Cairo, in the presence of Commissioner Bangemann, we sought to put on the agenda the initial elements of a plan for application of the information society via satellite with a view to a cooperation which goes beyond the confines of today's Union."
"The initiatives are really multiplying and we must give the Commission credit for that."
"It seems to me that the work on the rules of the open market is reaching completion, so a major obstacle for citizens in the information society is slowly being removed."
"I am pleased the Commission's plan of action that we are discussing today finally prioritizes the effort on education, perhaps the highest barrier for citizens and firms to scale."
"Linking schools to the Internet, introducing a wide band multimedia network for teaching and for the new applications, expanding the 'Citizens of Europe' initiative with additional programmes - these are all excellent ideas which the United States has already implemented, in its own way."
"What still concerns me and what I am still not clear about, is how the Commission intends to proceed on cooperation with the Member States and local government, on forms of incentive and financing, on the respective levels of economic commitment, on how to introduce the new techniques of keyboard and mouse into a system - basic education - which tends to have rigid programmes and rules, pretty limited resources and strong resistance to change."
"And I believe it is in these issues of flexibility in our society that the information society may encounter its greatest difficulties."
"Mr President, discussion of the information society has been dominated by technical aspects, at the expense of content."
"It is high time to consider the development of the information society from the point of view of people's needs and as a broad social trend."
"A time will come when an ability to use information and communications technology is an absolute precondition for full participation both in working life and in other areas of the life of society."
"The necessary skills must therefore be imparted to all, in order to try to prevent a fresh class division and a new kind of marginalization."
"Only an information society based on equality can strengthen competitiveness and employment."
"Mrs Ahlqvist's excellent report stresses that familiarization with information technology should begin at kindergarten and primary school to ensure that as many children as possible start out on an even playing field."
"Equally important is to give aging people an opportunity to learn how to use new technologies and information flows."
"This is one of the main challenges of lifelong learning, and appropriate materials and methods are needed to meet it."
"The availability of and access to information and communications technology are of particular importance from the point of view of regional equality."
"Distance learning must be developed, and peripheral areas must not be left behind in economic and social development."
"The extent to which schools are equipped with network connections varies very widely from country to country, as has been observed here."
"In Finland, more than two thirds of schools are networked, whereas the corresponding figure for the Union as a whole is less than 5 %."
"In this connection it is important to stress the significance not only of educational establishments but also of libraries, and their considerable potential to operate as regional learning centres open to all."
"Professional staff with up-to-date training in the library and information field can also help to find knowledge and afford access to experiences which exist in new forms."
"The position of information and communications technology in teacher training and in-service training should be enhanced."
"I believe that quality educational software and teaching materials urgently need to be developed."
"The Commission should also continue its efforts to develop a European multimedia industry so that it genuinely promotes Europe's linguistic and cultural diversity."
"(without microphone) ... emphasizes the dangers of exacerbating social inequalities in the course of realization of the information society, thus recognizing that the new technologies represent an opportunity for society, a step forward, provided they are made accessible to all through teaching and through the universal service, whose responsibilities include that of supplying the necessary equipment to the various public establishments."
"Well, although the Commission acknowledges the evolutionary and dynamic nature of the universal service, it is still refusing to extend it to include the supply of advanced telecommunication services to educational establishments."
"We agree with the Ahlqvist report when it deplores the total absence of any new resources to achieve these objectives."
"We agree with the analysis that attributes this total lack of resources to the budgetary austerity connected with the convergence criteria for the single currency, resulting in public spending cuts that have a particular impact on education, closing classes, abolishing jobs and providing no real training for the teachers in the new technologies."
"We regret that none of these reports offers any criticism of the dominant conception of education that emerges from the Commission's various communications."
"We cannot accept that, in the name of progress, the very foundation of education is being called into question by the theory that apprenticeship should be given priority over education and training as a way of meeting the needs of industry."
"Let us think back to paragraph 62 of the Herman report which cautions us against the illusion of regarding information technology as the solution to all teaching problems."
"We are still opposed to, and very concerned about, everything to do with excessively tight private or public partnerships, and especially everything to do with privately financed education."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission, far from concerning itself with a global, co-ordinated Union policy on the new technologies, prefers to dole out its thoughts and communications and papers of various colours little by little, depending on the highly objective criterion of the subjects handled by each parliamentary committee."
"And the parliamentary committees, basically, have had no option but to attend to their own individual helpings."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this procedural farce must end."
"If it is true, as they say, that the brave new world is coming, the world of the information society replacing the industrial society, should it not be our priority to hold, at long last, a sensible and rational debate in this House about the future of the new technologies and their far-reaching consequences for the 21st century?"
"So I can only welcome today's joint debate."
"The four reports before us do in fact touch on several areas of the information society: finance, standardization, education and training, the change in the value of 'work' , and the quest for dominance by the information technology multinationals."
"For the creation of infrastructures alone, Jacques Delors's White Paper puts the total finance needed to link up the entire European Union at 150 billion euros."
"Well, the Community's five-year programme has a budget of 45 million euros."
"That is devisory, it is not enough, and it will achieve nothing."
"Because, ladies and gentlemen, if we want to go out and play with the big boys we have to start by making sure we have the resources."
"Confronted with economic issues like these, I acknowledge with Mr Bangemann that prudence is the mother of safety."
"But, pace Mr Bangemann, there is every prospect that the European model of the information society will bear an uncanny resemblance to Microsoftland."
"And don't be surprised, ladies and gentlemen, if the European consumer continues to prefer the American original to the pale European imitation."
"And yet it is still not too late to take action to bring about a genuinely European model of the information society."
"Four months ago, the European Parliament adopted Mrs Morgan's discerning report on the information society, culture and education, advocating a European model guided by democratic, social, cultural and educational concerns."
"Taking due account of the human dimension is a priority for all of us."
"Because the supertechnological information society will be capable of manufacturing greater and greater wealth with a smaller and smaller workforce."
"And so we shall see - more than we see it today, more than we may believe - the generalization of parttime working and the partial wages it brings."
"That is why politicians have a duty to rethink the status of 'work' as the only vector of social cohesion in today's society."
"And that is why, too, things are going to change in schools."
"Children are going to have to learn by using the new technologies, not just learn to use them."
"And as for the politicians, where will they be, confronted by the IT multinationals?"
"Driven by the profit motive alone, the giants of information technology, telecommunications, optical fibres and the media are embarking on what they see as a great adventure - world domination."
"Well, if a nation no longer has control over the production of its own images or the power to supervise new technologies, is it still a sovereign nation?"
"That is the real issue behind this unstoppable revolution."
"In our Western democracies, Mr President, we refer to the media, or at any rate the press, as 'the fourth estate' . Isn't it going to become, quite simply, the first estate - the only estate?"
"That is the question we have to ask ourselves in the course of our future work."
"Mr President, the reports we are debating should be endorsed."
"Yet I have a sneaking suspicion that once again a lot of money is to be spent mainly on producing paper."
"I have nothing against detailed research and studies, but we have to consider whether it would not be more sensible to use the ECU 45 million available for the multiannual information programme to stimulate the establishment of the information society in order to implement projects of practical use."
"Let me give you a concrete example: if the European tourist industry is to remain competitive in the next millennium we will have to create comprehensive electronic information and reservation systems."
"The technical requirements for these kind of tourism marketing systems already exist; but because of its small-scale structures and fragmentation, the industry currently has neither the organizational ability nor the motivation to produce comprehensive, reliable and up-to-date information and reservation systems."
"For the many small and medium-sized firms that, after all, represent the backbone of European tourism, the key to the success of tourism will be not just the supply of information but accurate and rapid information."
"The tourists, i.e. the consumers of tourist products, book their holidays increasingly late and are becoming increasingly fussy."
"The consumers naturally expect detailed information at the press of a button and last-minute booking facilities from their suppliers."
"So we must encourage the development of networking between suppliers among themselves and in particular between suppliers and markets, especially travel agencies, but also directly with the consumer, for instance via the Internet, on a Europe-wide basis."
"The European tourist industry must set up information and booking systems that can be accessed world-wide even in the most remote regions, which will also help protect and create jobs."
"In the framework of the action plan, considerable progress could be made in this respect in the area of school education, motivation and the transfer of know-how, which would help make an industry that is constantly losing world-market shares become more competitive."
"Mr President, colleagues, one of the claims most frequently made on behalf of the information society is that it eliminates distances and thus makes it possible to use countries' land areas more effectively."
"Services can be used, businesses managed and jobs created without it being necessary to move to major population centres."
"However, this optimistic appraisal does not take account of two significant problems."
"They must be resolved to ensure that developments do not proceed in quite the opposite direction."
"Even if it were to be assumed that information technology and data communications improve employment, the added value they bring does not by any means in its entirety accrue to the benefit of society through traditional work: to a large extent, job opportunities and purchasing power pass to well educated town-dwellers, while in peripheral regions purchasing power does not grow."
"Another essential aspect of the information society is that of democracy."
"Democratic control and democratic opportunities should guarantee that even so-called marginalized groups have a chance to take part in electronic dialogue."
"Mrs Boogerd-Quaak's report is praiseworthy."
"I secured an amendment to it warning against the accumulation and globalization of information networks, the marginalization of the less educated and abuse of power."
"I also asked the Commission to investigate the information society's impact on employment and to stress that, despite information technology, there is still no substitute for a skilled teacher."
"The opportunities for both users and producers to use services in the information society depend on the existence of state-of-the-art hardware and public infrastructure."
"The required expensive, and in virtually every case private, investments are readily made in densely populated areas, and become concentrated there."
"This adds to the marginalization of areas where communications facilities are already inadequate."
"It seems rather alarming if 'general telecommunications services' are taken to mean providing basic services for certain groups of poor customers who are lagging behind, rather than adopting ambitious development objectives for society as a whole."
"The fact is that, in less developed areas, modern information technology equipment, and particularly access to the Internet, cannot be based on privately purchased machines."
"Accessible work stations are needed in public places, for example at schools, libraries and hospitals."
"Finally I should like to draw the Commission's attention to the fact that satellite communications and state-of-theart data communications ought to be possible throughout the territory of the Union, particularly in areas where the conventional telecommunications infrastructure is inadequate or outdated."
"A broad-band European intelligent network is a project of urgency."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as often happens here we seem to be overlooking the main issue and focusing on considerations which - while certainly quite legitimate democratic and moral priorities - are secondary in any consideration of ways and means."
"Because the main issue is that Europe has now fallen far behind the United States, far behind Japan, and the rate of growth of the big American companies and producers, in every field, is five times as high as that of their European counterparts."
"As Mr Scarbonchi rightly put it, Europe is going to become 'Microsoftland' ."
"That is the main issue."
"Why?"
"Because we all have our different priorities: for some of us it's the public service, for others the public sector; a third group is mainly interested in universal access, and a fourth wants to avoid inequality."
"All well and good."
"But in the meantime, what happens?"
"While we hold forth about everything we think the information society should be doing, others are creating it."
"And we, ultimately, will be mere users of what others have produced."
"I am in agreement with the content of most of the reports. I am not so happy about the measures proposed by the amendments, which incidentally are the same for every report."
"The amendments tell us that the workforce, the consumer, the representatives of this, the representatives of that, must be involved in the work of standardization, etc. The effect of all these conditions will be to make it impossible for any decisions to be taken at all."
"However much I may agree with the idea of consulting everyone, because there must be no limit to consultation, I am equally convinced that the making of decisions must not be shared out, because if it is there will be no decisions at all."
"That is Europe's problem, and that, sadly, is what many of us fail to see."
"When I read all the amendments that have been tabled, on Mr RÃ¼big's report or Mrs Boogerd-Quaak's report or Mr Hendrick's report, they all say the same thing: everybody has to be involved in the decision."
"Everybody has to participate."
"For heaven's sake, if you want nothing to be done, no participation at all, then the way to ensure it is to call for universal participation."
"We've seen something of the kind in Belgium: the idea was that virtually all the interests concerned should be involved in town and country planning policy."
"As a result, it is no longer possible to reach any decision at all."
"So the decisions are imposed by market forces, and horrible decisions they are for everyone."
"That is the end product."
"So let me make a solemn appeal to Honourable Members: don't sink your own ship, don't suffocate the European information society just when it needs all the air it can get."
"Mr President, I could not agree more with the previous speaker, Mr Herman."
"There are many occasions when I do not agree with him, but today I fully agree with him."
"Naturally, I should first like to congratulate Mrs Boogerd-Quaak on her report."
"I think that the problem, Mr Herman, does not only lie here with fellow Members of this House, but also with the European Commission."
"Because what does the Commission do?"
"It sends us a constant stream of documents about the information society. Each one bigger than the one before."
"There is a great deal of overlap between all these communications."
"Today we again have four documents with a great deal of duplication."
"We do not expect this."
"The Commission itself must better coordinate its different services in order to eliminate this duplication."
"A good example is that my report on the ICT industry was adopted at the last part-session."
"The Commission now comes out with its own communication on the subject."
"Thus we are rehashing the whole thing again."
"None of this brings Europe's citizens one step closer to the information society."
"So I also call on the Commission to better coordinate its activities in this area."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, basically what is known as the information society is the result of an objective process in the technology revolution which is unfolding, chiefly at the level of information and communication techniques."
"It is the result of the introduction of new technologies, services and innovations at an almost mind-blowing rate."
"It is undoubtedly the result of human achievement."
"Nevertheless, these achievements, having been pushed on by selfish interests and by the engine of commerce, have been appropriated by those doing the pushing and their use is very far from intended to benefit all humanity."
"Quite the reverse!"
"We are very concerned at the role which this process might play in accentuating - even exacerbating - yawning social chasms which are already so marked and so serious."
"In fact, it seems clear to us, that with the way it is being built, the information society is exacerbating and accentuating these chasms by creating a divide between those with access and those who are far from having access or who are excluded."
"The amendments we support to the Boogerd-Quaak report are designed to reflect that concern and, if they are adopted, we shall vote in favour of the report as we shall for the Hendrick, RÃ¼big and Ahlqvist reports and we congratulate all the rapporteurs on the work they have done."
"Finally, I cannot, nor do I wish to remain silent about the threat that we shall have to contend with different types of illiteracy under the umbrella of the information society as it is being built:"
"the illiteracy of those who do not learn to either read, write or count and who are thus forced to live as though in the last century or even several centuries ago and who will constitute a significant part within the large and growing number of social strata cut off from the new technologies; -the illiteracy of those who rapidly forget how to read, write and count because all they can do is click an electronic mouse, brilliantly of course, and who will live in a world of the future which I want, although I fight against it in that form, since it will create an ever-broader social spread with infra-humans on the one extreme and information supermen on the other who have no idea about Rimbaud and who are indifferent to the horrors of economics."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the three rapporteurs for their reports which are all excellent in my view."
"I have just a few simple comments to make in particular with regard to Mrs Boogerd-Quaak's report."
"In contrast to the views put forward by many of the speakers here, I do not think that we should be concerned about the USA's technological leadership in this area."
"This is in fact the same argument, namely that European technology is trailing helplessly behind the USA, which was used by Mr Servan-Schreiber thirty five years ago when he wrote about the American challenge."
"The fact is that the growth per capita during those thirty five years has not been any greater in the USA than in Europe and I am quite convinced that this will continue to be the case in the future as well."
"The reason that we do not need to be concerned is that trade is based on relative advantages."
"Europe has trade advantages in other areas instead, so it will not be a disaster if Europe does not become a world leader in every sector of Information Technology."
"I also think that if we really want Europe to take the lead in specialist technologies, we must base our thinking on the simple fact that eight out of ten Nobel prize winners for science come from the USA."
"So we must concentrate our efforts on basic research if we wish to lead the field in the technology of the future."
"But it is the question of equality in the information society which concerns me most of all."
"It is currently young, well educated and highly paid men who clearly predominate in the field of information technology."
"The problem, as I see it, is how can we spread this knowledge to the general public."
"I think that Mrs Boogerd-Quaak is absolutely right when she points to the role of schools."
"We have a clear responsibility here and we must ensure that information technology does not create a class-based society for future generations."
"Even now, we see well-off families, who are able to afford it, linking their home PCs to the Internet and in so doing giving their children knowledge of this technology right from infancy."
"Unfortunately, not all children have parents who are interested in computers or who can afford to buy a computer."
"We must tackle this problem in some way, I think, to ensure that we do not create different levels within the information society."
"Finally, Mr President, I would also like to point out the great opportunities which the information society gives us to decentralise employment."
"The fact that people located right up in the North can work together with people in the South on the same project gives us an opportunity to develop rural areas and to reduce the population concentration in the cities."
"Mr President, first I want to congratulate Mrs Ahlqvist, whose report I shall be discussing, on her work."
"The Commission Communication on which her excellent report is based is entitled 'Learning in the Information Society' and is intended as a European education initiative."
"Let me say as a matter of principle that perhaps we are not entirely doing justice to our education systems in suggesting that they are only just entering the EDP age."
"Information technology is already being taught and computer rooms already exist in schools all over Europe."
"Yet this initiative aims to emphasize that the use of EDP and the media represents a constant challenge which everyone involved in education has to face up to on a continuous basis."
"But we must not forget that education and training are a field where the primary responsibility lies with the Member States."
"So I am glad that paragraph 3 specifically refers to the Member States' jurisdiction over cultural and educational matters and that in other passages too the report resists the temptation to prescribe rules to the Member States, offering them suggestions instead."
"I must admit that I still have some reservations about paragraphs 13, 14 and 15."
"I am getting fed up with girls and women still being presented as technical dunces!"
"If you just look at the offices round here you will see that women are perfectly capable of using the new technologies."
"To say that there is a shortfall here would also mean that 40 years of coeducation was just a waste of time!"
"Nor should we be too didactic."
"The reference to encouraging play with these technologies as an educational tip may be harmless but it is superfluous!"
"I quite agree with the rapporteur that the changes proposed in the Communication must be accompanied by a reform of teaching."
"I think that is overdue."
"But teacher training is not really a Community task and I have reservations about supporting this from the structural funds."
"That is why my group will call for a separate vote on paragraph 27 and only vote for the first part."
"There are two other aspects I welcome."
"The first is the reference to the disabled, which I consider mot important, and the second is the proposal to examine whether the research and education programmes can be used for the networking of schools."
"But here we must decide clearly where the priorities lie and where we can then cut back."
"Despite these reservations, I wish the report success."
"Mr President, there have been many obvious points raised today but one sector which neither the Commission nor the majority of members have paid serious enough attention to is the need for Europe to create standards and an infrastructure for digital geographic information."
"By this we mean information bound to a certain place."
"There is one point in the action plan which mentions G12000, but there has been no action, although the French, German, Spanish and Dutch Ministers asked for action in this area in a letter to the Commission in 1994."
"We can make substantial savings in follow up work."
"Something must be done in the fifth framework programme for research."
"There is nothing in the 1998 budget for geographic information."
"If it is not included, the EU will be unable to do what is required of us, or what we promised at the G7 information conference a few years ago."
"We also need better co-ordination of the data bases created by the Commission itself."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing four reports on telecommunications and we are discussing them jointly."
"That is indeed sensible."
"For there are so many aspects to the information society that we can only consider them together."
"But what is the real situation in the European Union?"
"At present we as producers are losing market shares, and on an annual basis."
"We only have two large firms, accounting for just 10 % of the market, that are European."
"We are fuelling a broad social debate on the potential hazards of the information society, on those who might lose out."
"We do not have harmonized markets."
"We are cutting back on resources for research and development in the field of information technologies too."
"So we find the Americans asking us - as they actually did at a meeting last week in Bonn - why are you actually so against E-mail and the Internet?"
"Incidentally, when we discuss the Internet we spend more time on the risks and on child pornography than on communication between remote parts of the world."
"So what do we need?"
"First we need more R&D resources."
"And we need broad consensus on that."
"We cannot just finance things we want to keep."
"We must also finance things that will secure our future."
"This research has to be coordinated and to be applied research."
"That in turn also means we have to agree to pay far more attention to applications, going so far as really to offer assistance to the industry where that is necessary."
"We also need broadly based research on standards."
"Only if we can develop our own standards will we be able to conquer the markets of the future."
"And it is precisely in this context of the information society that we need a far greater and far better transfer of technology than we did in the past."
"Why is it beneath us to finance applications, why do we only stick to the basics?"
"There is nothing wrong with satellites that bring in money, with satellite applications."
"We do not have to confine ourselves to sending out research satellites."
"But above all, we will only create an information society and create networks if the people accept them, if there is a demand for them."
"In other words - and even if I do not think much of this in other contexts - in this case we need a broadly based information campaign, but also a positive information campaign that begins by listing the potential and opportunities of the information society rather than its possible risks."
"For the rest, we need a largescale offensive to promote teleworking."
"If we have a lot of teleworking that will also contribute to rural development and will encourage women to work by making it easier for them to combine family and a job."
"If we create a large number of teleworking jobs, we will have to introduce accompanying social measures."
"But if we reject this from the start and take a negative attitude from the start we will never make headway here."
"I sometimes fear that we will miss out on an opportunity for the future."
"In the field of the information society it is particularly important that we act centrally, and we must do so now."
"That is why these four reports and the four Commission proposals are so welcome at this particular point in time."
"Mr Bangemann, I would like to repeat something you did not understand correctly."
"So I will now say it in German."
"You were very defensive today."
"You need not be, for I did not say that all you send us is papers."
"I merely said that the various departments within the Commission keep sending us information and communications at different times."
"That is the reason for our reaction."
"We would like them to be integrated."
"I asked whether you could not coordinate the Commission's activities better."
"I never said that you do no work!"
"Perhaps you are aware that I too sometimes visit projects and give talks at conferences about telecities and suchlike."
"I am quite aware of all you do in this area and I am glad you do it."
"You then said that we are not losing any market shares."
"Perhaps you should have another look at my last week's report on the matter."
"In 1990 we had a 35 % market share and now we only have 29 %, which is a 6 % decline."
"But I will be glad to see you at the ELDR Group again..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon."
"Imports of hormone-treated meat"
"The next item is the debate on the statement by the Commission on imports into the European Union of hormone-treated meat (WTO)."
"Mr President, first let me apologize for the absence of Mr Fischler, who would have liked to make this statement in person but cannot do so and has therefore asked me to read out the statement on behalf of himself and the Commission."
"The WTO hormones panel forwarded the parties concerned two virtually identical preliminary reports, one for the USA and one for Canada, on 8 March 1997."
"The panel of expert's preliminary conclusion, and I stress preliminary, was that the EC ban on imports of hormone-treated meat was incompatible with a range of the WTO agreement's rules on health and plant health measures."
"Of course the Commission is disappointed."
"At the request of the European Union, an interim meeting was held with the panel of experts on 4 June 1997, at which the Commission made a number of comments on the panel's use of scientific data."
"The final report is expected at the end of the month, which is why the Commission does not want to adopt a position before the panel has completed its work."
"For even if there does not seem much prospect of a different conclusion being reached, that would certainly be a procedural error."
"The Commission will, however, do its utmost within the WTO context to ensure full recognition of the fact that European Community legislation can decide what level of protection it considers appropriate for its citizens."
"Mr President, Mr Bangemann, the Commission is not always able to adopt such welcome positions as this one."
"I gather from what you said and from a letter from Mr Fischler, which he sent to the chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection a few weeks ago, that the Commission, like the European Parliament, is adhering to its many decisions and resolutions to continue banning the use of natural or artificial growth-promoters, i.e., hormones, in the European Union."
"Their use is prohibited in the European Union for good reason."
"No long-term studies exist on the effects on humans."
"Scientists have produced very different assessments of the uses and risks of hormones in animal feed."
"Nobody knows the effects of the hormone cocktails that are so often used, not just on the animals but in particular on humans."
"When we consider all that, it becomes quite clear to myself and my group - and, I am sure, to the majority in the European Parliament - that we must adhere to our ban."
"Let me say a few words on the situation in the European Union and what we expect the consumer to accept."
"The loss of confidence we have suffered recently in the European Union in relation to food production, but also as a result of the BSE scandal, is quite incalculable."
"It can probably be calculated for farmers and can also be calculated for some distributing and marketing organizations, but we cannot calculate what it means for the people."
"If the WTO now forced us to authorize hormones, imported from the United States or wherever, labelled or not, we would face a further enormous loss of public confidence, and quite rightly so."
"That is why I am convinced that our strategy in reorganizing the market in beef and veal and milk must ensure that we continue to prohibit any use whatsoever of hormones."
"Moreover, we must evolve a strategy on how to deal with our partners in the framework of the WTO."
"Mr Bangemann, I ask you to take the appropriate measures in the Commission to enable us in the European Union not just to present the scientific evidence offered by the WTO but also to look into it."
"For once again, the supposed evidence of harmlessness that was produced has not been checked at all and we all know the old saying about ten scientists and ten different opinions."
"The same applies to lawyers."
"Looking at the evidence the WTO has submitted, I think we are just as capable of finding different evidence."
"If we want to be sure of ever building up any kind of consumer confidence again in the European Union, any kind of certainty or conviction that we are ensuring that our meat and food is harmless, we will have to adhere to our ban on hormones."
"Mr President, I agree entirely with Mrs Roth-Behrendt's final remarks."
"We are talking about consumer confidence and that is the most important thing."
"Our objective tonight as a Parliament is to reinforce the position we have adopted over several years and to make sure that the Commission keeps its resolve to maintain the current position of the European Community."
"I was intrigued to hear the Commissioner say that it would wrong for it to pre-empt any decision that might be taken following the final result that comes from the WTO panel."
"We must be careful because we are in a very strong position."
"A decision was taken by the Commission, by Parliament and all the way along the decision-making process in the Community."
"And just because there are certain influential companies in the United States which have great influence on the Hill, the decision-making process in the United States, it does not mean to say that we should weaken our resolve on this issue."
"It is not a question that what is good for the United States is good for the rest of us."
"Surely we in the Community must be allowed to take our own decisions on these sort of issues."
"We are going to run into many decisions and many difficulties in the World Trade Organization unless we have some mutual respect and mutual recognition of what others in the world believe."
"The WTO panel is going to come to a decision."
"I hope that the Commissioner is aware of the strength of feeling in this Parliament on the issue and that if the decision is maintained which is not satisfactory as far as we are concerned, the Commission will stand up for what we believe in, what the Union believes in and make certain that we do not allow meat to come into the Community that is not acceptable under our own legislation."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I take great heart from the words of my colleague, Mr Provan; I am always heartened to see a representative of the United Kingdom supporting a measure against the United States and against the tyranny which they now represent."
"The United Kingdom is Portugal's oldest ally and I therefore for the first time feel that there is in fact an old Luso-British alliance in operation."
"As regards the question of hormones, we all know that they are used also in Europe and the Americans know that too."
"They know that there has not been sufficient control in Europe."
"In Portugal, unfortunately, hormones are used and they are at the moment fetching more than cocaine - and that is the truth!"
"That is because they are banned!"
"I am, moreover, concerned about the philosophy of using hormones."
"Why should we use hormones?"
"Why should we want animals to grow more quickly when we have meat surpluses?"
"To be competitive?"
"It was the principle of competitiveness in the milk sector which led us to BSE..."
"It is true that, from the scientific point of view, it will not be long before research results show that hormones cause cancer."
"However, from the philosophical point of view, I always told the Americans that I did not agree with the fact that they had used a false concept of progress to produce more of what they were producing too much of."
"As regards health, we are all aware that the question of hormones as a cause of cancer raises major doubts."
"As regards control, we are all aware too that it is not sufficient in Europe."
"In any case I am even more shocked to see what the World Trade Organization panel is doing."
"How are the judges chosen?"
"We already had the case of the bananas in which the three judges were from Hong Kong, Australia and Switzerland."
"No-one knew anything about bananas."
"It appeared too that the panel judging the hormone question was made up of lawyers who knew nothing about hormones!"
"The intention is clearly to instal judges who are slightly impartial who naturally take a completely wrong view of the concept of justice."
"I hope that the Commission has the courage to tackle this problem and to rout the illegal designs of the United States."
"Mr President, once again this House is discussing the hormone question in connection with the United States."
"I can inform the Commission that the Liberal Group supports the Commission's resolve."
"We oppose the use of artificial hormones in meat production."
"The main reason for this - as other groups have already said - is that there still remains too many doubts among scientists about the effects of their use and as long as there is the slightest doubt we must not permit them."
"I therefore believe that we must support the European Commission in continuing to argue our case for as long as is procedurally possible."
"However, and this is also the view of the Liberal Group, I would not go as far as to say that we should condemn the WTO panel as such."
"It will be difficult to dismiss the arbiter in the event of a wrong judgement."
"We must therefore simply follow the procedures which are designed for such cases."
"But on one point I believe the Commission must prepare itself."
"In Europe we have another view of food than in the United States for example or other continents."
"We have another view of animal foods and the conditions under which animals are kept and transported."
"In this case I believe we must respect the consumers' wishes as much as possible."
"We are seeing this already in a number of Member States."
"We are seeing a multiplicity of quality marks, the one more environment-conscious than the next."
"I believe it is up to the European Commission to give leadership in developing something in this direction so that it is easier for the European consumer to recognize what is safe to eat and what is not."
"The customer is still king."
"He must be able to choose, he must have the choice and we must give European leadership on this."
"I am totally in agreement with what Mr Provan says: we must state what we want and we must promote mutual respect within the WTO."
"Mr President, Commissioner, you are waiting for the panel to complete its work, and I realize that, but you must admit that the World Trade Organization is producing one verdict after another, and all the verdicts are similar."
"Following the decision on banana imports, the WTO panel concluded that the European Union's ban on imports of hormone-containing meat was contrary to the rules of international trade."
"The refusal of Europeans to eat hormone-treated meat was considered no more admissible than the argument in favour of supporting the economies of the French overseas departments and the ACP States in the case of bananas."
"Once again, the WTO is giving precedence to commercial interests and the free trade principle over any other human consideration - health, social, cultural or environmental."
"Let us recall that when the European Union decided to ban imports of hormone-containing meat from 1 January 1988, the reason was not an artificial, protectionist attempt to prevent trade but an attempt to protect consumers against the harmful effects of hormones, whether natural or artificial - effects acknowledged by many scientific experts and by the European Veterinary Committee."
"In actual fact the United States Government, making light of the situation facing European farmers and even the health of their own consumers (several thousand people die of food poisoning every year in the United States, 4000 in 1996), have only one objective: commercial."
"Having been an importer, the United States has now become a net exporter of more than two million tonnes."
"They want to continue this trend."
"This commercial aspect is all the more important for them in that the question of growth hormones for meat conceals another: the question of the dairy production hormone BST, the authorization of which in Europe would open up an enormous market for American companies."
"This verdict by the WTO panel is unacceptable, as is the use of the Codex Alimentarius as a reference criterion on health and quality issues."
"We must refuse, therefore, to compromise on human health and food safety, which must take precedence over any other consideration."
"That is why our group calls upon the Commission and the Council not to give way to the WTO's orders, and calls upon this House to adopt the resolution."
"Mr President, my group is totally against the use of hormones and against imports of meat from the USA that has been treated with hormones."
"We do not want the stuff!"
"We do not need it!"
"We are supported in this by the majority of European farmers and the majority of European consumers."
"We have nothing against commercial interests in principle, but we are against commercial interests being defended to the detriment of the financial and commercial interests of the farmers of Europe!"
"And we are also against this being done to the detriment of consumer health."
"I believe the Commission must take a hard line."
"It may be unable to say anything more at this stage for procedural and strategic reasons; here we in Parliament are in a better position."
"We can and we will table a strongly worded resolution tomorrow and I am convinced that Parliament will adopt it with hardly any votes against."
"The Americans, or perhaps I should say the American chemical and agricultural multinationals, are adopting an arrogant, nationalistic and insolent stance."
"They are trying to impose their ideas about agricultural production and food on us."
"We have to resist that."
"There is no culture without agriculture!"
"If there is some other culture in America, then let them live with it, we do not want it!"
"We assert our right to develop and continue developing our own food culture, and it does not include hormones."
"Mr Bangemann, I am calling on the Commission to evolve a strategy directed not just at the panel but also at the forthcoming WTO negotiations."
"These considerations must be given their due place in the new agreements; for consumer and health reasons we must be able to reject certain things."
"The various states and organizations must also have the right to take their own decisions and should not be forced by others to follow a line they do not agree with."
"I do not think it necessary that our children should reach puberty earlier than they used to because of the use of sex hormones."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt rightly pointed out that no long-term studies exist on the subject."
"That is why we must strongly resist this and not allow it in the long term either!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome Mr Bangemann's reply."
"He says that every possible means will be employed to continue the battle and to justify our position before the World Trade Organisation."
"I welcome this and I hope that the Commission will continue to argue its case."
"The report by the panel of experts remains a provisional report."
"It simply fails to take any account of the opinions of the nine scientists appointed by the European Union."
"Our scientists came from Germany, Norway, Hungary, Puerto Rico and also the United States."
"I myself invited three of them to a conference in Brussels last month."
"They were Professor Metzler from Karlsruhe, Professor Liehr from Texas and Professor Epstein from Illinois."
"They stated outright that the so-called American hormones are never administered separately, but always in combination."
"And that it is precisely this combined formula which can have such harmful long-term effects on the human DNA."
"These can apparently take the form of gene toxic and carcinogenic effects."
"The scientific conference convened by the European Commission itself stated in its conclusions that more research was needed into the use of hormones in combined form and this is essential."
"Research into long-term damage is particularly important."
"Our nine experts also told the World Trade Organisation panel that the scientific data on which the United States based and is continuing to base its findings are hopelessly out of date."
"Everything is based on the so-called JEFCA report which dates from 1987."
"And more than a half of the 80 references were out of date in 1987."
"The United States is thus continuing to base itself on scientific data which are now more than 20 years old."
"We all know that scientific research is, fortunately, constantly progressing."
"What was considered harmless 20 years ago can today indeed be shown to be harmful."
"The whole history surrounding the DES hormone - which was originally seen as totally harmless - speaks volumes."
"It was only 20 years later that DES was shown to be carcinogenic."
"Clearly the argument that hormone treatment could be harmful should in itself be sufficient for the World Trade Organisation to accept a hormone ban."
"The principle of being safe rather than sorry correctly applies in the area of international decision-making."
"This is why we fully support the European Commission which in Geneva had already submitted objections or replies to that provisional report and we also support the Commission in what I hope will be its further efforts if things go against us and it appeals."
"An appeal if the World Trade Organisation maintains its original position."
"We also want the European Commission to already make preparations for a new scientific forum, a forum of independent scientists and not scientists who are in the service of industry."
"Scientists who are not only competent in veterinary science, but above all scientists from the field of human medicine and also scientists who are known and renowned for cancer research."
"Finally, scientists who first and foremost investigate the risks linked to the combined use of hormones."
"In this way we can further reinforce our risk analysis and at the end of the day we must certainly be found to be in the right."
"The principle of prevention must take precedence over all other considerations."
"Of course the general hormone ban must be upheld along with the ban on imports of hormonetreated meat."
"I naturally want to support the Commission in the position which it is now adopting and I hope that our resolution will receive unanimous support."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the use within the Community of anabolic substances in animal production has been the source of major controversy ever since the 1970s, involving politicians, consumers, scientific experts and the entire international community in a virtually continuous debate."
"So there is nothing new about the matter, and I will spare you the historical details."
"However, on 7 May this year the joint special group delivered its interim report to the parties - a report which, incidentally, should have been kept confidential as required by the memorandum on the settlement of disputes."
"The conclusions of that report are clear and unambiguous."
"The panel is quite clearly giving precedence to strictly commercial considerations over any legitimate concern for public health, and rejecting the principle of caution which consumers are entitled to expect."
"In its motion for a resolution, our group has called upon the Commission to organize as soon as possible a conference to determine consumer reactions regarding the health aspects of hormone-treated meat."
"In this connection, we must state our opposition to the panel's recommendation that voluntary labelling, stating that the beef or veal in question contains no hormones, might be one possible way of responding to consumer concerns about information."
"Quite the reverse: as in the case of genetically modified organisms, what is needed is obligatory labelling specifying that the meat has been treated with hormones."
"Be that as it may, the measures prohibiting the use of hormones in meat production are fundamental and cannot be called into question."
"Consumers would not understand it if those measures were to be lifted when the safety of these hormones has not been proved, or even tested."
"Furthermore, the production constraints imposed on European farmers must not be swept aside by imported products that are not covered by the same health and quality guarantees."
"What we ask, therefore, is that the dispute procedure should be carried forward to its conclusion, to the appeal stage in other words, and the whole of our group is ready to support the Commission."
"On that issue I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Mr President, Commission, there is no reason, is there, why meat should escape the new religion, the worship of the golden calf, which seems to be the one guiding principle of the public and of leaders in our so-called rich and civilized societies?"
"Why hormones, when - as was said earlier - we already have too much meat and too much milk?"
"Why?"
"The answer is simple: profit."
"If the Americans want to make us eat meat with hormones in it, their motive is not just the pleasure of selling us meat - the main motive is to make us accept the hormone principle, because of course the real profit comes from the production and marketing of the hormones."
"I understood that more than ten years ago, when I wrote the first report on somatotropin."
"The intention of selling bad meat, selling poor quality products, means that the consumer is being robbed twice over: first his trust is stolen, then his food values are undermined."
"Corticoids and other hormones, used singly or in combination, cause meat to swell."
"That means incorporating more liquid, which means the consumer is buying water at the price of meat."
"The interests of human beings, of the citizen, are non-existent, because the citizen is just an uneducated consumer and therefore submissive."
"Hormones are dangerous."
"No one, at least, is going to claim that they are vitamins."
"We fought against DES."
"We must fight against the others as well."
"Human health is at risk, clearly, but so too is animal health."
"It is already a proven fact, today, that the use of hormones causes bone deficiency in the mothers and, in the medium term, sterility in the offspring."
"It will obviously be necessary, even more necessary than it was with BSE, to insist on labelling, traceability and transparency."
"We in Europe are entitled to be culturally different in our diet."
"That is a right which you, Commissioner, can defend on behalf of the citizen and on behalf of human society."
"If Mr Bill Clinton sees fit to adopt a moralizing tone towards Europeans and accuse them of mismanagement or failure to understand modern society, as he did at the G8 summit, that's his problem."
"What I, personally, will not accept is that anyone should tell Europe's citizens that they have to eat poisoned meat because the Americans need the money."
"And that, Commissioner, is why I call upon you urgently to continue the struggle to ban this meat, and hormones in general, in Europe."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his statement."
"The hormone issue was decided by the European Union some years ago not on the basis of science but rather on emotion."
"I would remind the House that all food contains hormones."
"I give the examples of wheatgerm and green vegetables, etc. which contain many times the levels one would find in meat."
"But they are naturally occurring substances and not dangerous, synthetic cocktails."
"The US and the WTO will continue to insist that science, not sentiment, and scientific measurement, in particular, be the yardstick which determines food quality and food safety."
"Having put the ban in place, I see no option but to hold the line and to continue even if we have to buy our way out."
"A huge amount of damage has already been done to consumer trust and consumer confidence in the recent past."
"We cannot afford further risk to the industry."
"I would reiterate the appeal by a previous speaker for the setting up of a competent, independent, scientific body to act as a watchdog and to communicate with the public at an early stage, especially through consumer associations."
"It should be given the specific tasks of ensuring that the public is adequately protected on the one hand and, on the other, that new developments in food production be carefully explained at an early stage."
"Only in this way can fact rather than fiction govern our decisions on food law and food safety in the future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I believe we are in a difficult situation, and we are very well aware of it."
"We know more or less what the panel's decision will be."
"It will not look good for us."
"We can more or less anticipate that, meaning that we should prepare ourselves for a strategy, as many colleagues have pointed out."
"The second difficulty we see is that we are dealing not just with the USA and Canada but with other meatproducing countries too, such as Argentina, South Africa and Australia; there are others too."
"That means that in future we will have to consider a much further-reaching strategy, which will have to encompass an entirely new agricultural policy, an entirely new trade policy and an entirely new consumer protection policy."
"In fact we missed the opportunity to start a debate on this subject at the last WTO round."
"Let me remind Members that we opened up a new area by introducing trade and environmental questions into the conference in Singapore; similarly we should of course have tried to open a debate on trade and health and on trade and consumer protection at the last WTO round."
"It is essential that we do so if there is a next round."
"We do not know whether there will be one, but we will have to act promptly to introduce these ideas into the WTO discussions."
"We will have to go even further than this."
"We will have to consider crucial questions."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt rightly pointed out that we need to hold discussions with our partners and that we will have to discuss how on the one hand we can ensure free trade, which of course we do not want to disturb and which also protects our own producers, while on the other hand we can maintain very divergent cultural perceptions of different levels of protection."
"How can that be reconciled in future, and when will we have these kinds of rules?"
"I know these are fairly difficult questions, but I believe we must tackle them promptly."
"I am assuming that in any case the Commission will go to the court of appeal."
"Then we will definitely have a chance to underpin this strategy by the findings of new scientific research."
"The debate is closed."
"(The sitting was suspended at 8.10 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"Cohesion Fund - Structural Funds"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0167/97 by Mr Novo, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, on the Commission's annual report on the Cohesion Fund 1995 (COM(96)0388 - C4-0509/96); -A4-0210/97 by Mr Belenguer, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, on the Commission's Seventh Annual report on the Structural Funds - 1995 (COM(96)0502 - C4-0020/97)."
"Madam President, the report which we are presenting and debating today studies the seventh annual report presented by the Commission on the Structural Funds for the year 1995, a report incorporating amendments approved in the Committee on Regional Policy, which will certainly help to define and give form to the ideas which we are presenting in the current report."
"The year 1995 is of vital importance bearing in mind that it is the first full financial year of the 1994-1999 period of funding for which Austria, Finland and Sweden were finally included."
"It must be pointed out that there were over 400 Community initiative programmes presented by the Member States which led the Commission to acknowledge that certain problems were arising because of the complexity that entailed."
"The present report is therefore divided into five major sections dealing with implementation, complementarity, additionality, evaluation and follow up and, finally, the principle of coordination."
"As regards implementation, it is appropriate to say that there is an alarming degree of under-implementation of the budget varying according to the various funds, objectives and States."
"However, the improvement noted in the Objective 1 regions of the four Cohesion States - Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain - must be stressed."
"In my report I therefore request the Commission to analyse in the next report the causes of the delays in this implementation, the situation in the various Member States and the consequences for the global package for the 1994-1999 period."
"Similarly, we ask the Commission to provide us with information on the evolution of outstanding appropriations."
"Secondly, as regards complementarity with other Community policies, we welcome the Funds' concern to improve the environment."
"We also underline the Commission's concern to make it compatible with and complementary to other Community policies, since it must be borne in mind that the Structural Funds are the most important financial amount available to the European Union and that the Treaty itself makes cohesion a horizontal policy, which must be complementary to other Community policies."
"We therefore place special emphasis on the fact that the basic objective of the Structural Funds is to pursue economic and social cohesion in order to overcome the local and social disparities apparent in intra-Community solidarity, whilst pointing out that there are still regional disparities."
"Thirdly, as regards additionality, we are concerned to note that even the Commission itself cannot guarantee the principle of additionality, which worries us because one of the characteristic features of the Structural Funds is the additional nature as a back-up to state and regional efforts thus making sure that it is promoting cohesion."
"The Commission is still powerless to test this principle in seven Member States."
"I shall not mention which those States are, but for four of them the Commission says that it has no data and only incomplete data for the other three."
"In order to avoid this problem, we ask the Commission to look into the possibility of including clauses for the suspension of aid where the principle of additionality is not respected, including the requirement for each Member State to submit figures."
"Fourthly, as regards assessment and monitoring, we unfortunately have to point out that no complete and detailed study has yet been carried out on the first Structural Funds Programme."
"In that connection we welcome the Commission proposal to involve independent experts, still not appointed, as well as the attempts made in the field of montoring, we welcome the drawing up of the monitoring guide."
"However, the criteria and procedures bound up with the Structural Funds are still very complex, which is why I advocate simplifying the rules which would be helpful to these monitoring measures."
"Fifthly, as regards coordination, we note that coordination with the regional authorities has improved substantially, although it is still inadequate as regards the local authorities."
"However, the latter has improved as regards information."
"We underscore the good working relationship with the Committee of the Regions and the need to strengthen the principle of coordination so that both the local and regional bodies carry out the real policy of moving closer to the citizen."
"Finally, we reaffirm our confidence in decentralization as a method of managing the Funds, although it is appropriate to point out that the current system has an inherent contradiction, since, whilst the management of the Funds falls in almost all the States upon the State, the responsibility for that management falls almost exclusively upon the Commission."
"Finally, Madam President, my thanks to all the members of the Committee on Regional Policy for all the series of amendments presented and debated in committee to be debated a tomorrow's sitting and also to the secretariat and, of course, to all those who have cooperated in the drafting of the report."
"Mr President, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has been looking at the annual report on the Cohesion Fund by Novo Belenguer."
"We noted that the Cohesion Fund often understands the environment in too wide a sense."
"We can well imagine that water supply and waste disposal are genuine environmental projects."
"But when it comes to a dam which is clearly damaging to the environment - and this can also be read in the report - then the Committee on the Environment believes that it is very difficult to understand why such a dam should be seen as an environmental project."
"This is why it is a good thing that the Committee on the Environment is also involved with regional policy, which we call the integration of the environment and other sectors."
"This is why I am so pleased that a large number of our amendments have been adopted by the rapporteur and his committee."
"Our interpretation of the word environment is too wide."
"I would therefore argue for more purely environmental projects in the future: the combating of soil erosion, reforestation, nature conservation, the protection of habitats."
"These are matters to which cohesion policy must also pay much more attention."
"We submitted an amendment, Amendment No 4, on this subject, and I hope that the Commission also finds this amendment by our group acceptable."
"I support Mrs Shroedter in submitting a number of amendments in which she says that too much attention is paid to roads and too little to environment-friendly infrastructures such as railways."
"Finally, I should like to stress - and this opinion is also on behalf of our committee and is included in your report - that environmental impact reports should be drawn up by researchers who are not involved in the planning or implementation of projects."
"This must be the practice, it must be objective."
"This principle must not only apply to the Cohesion Fund but to regional policy as a whole."
"I am very curious as to how the Commissioner will react to this in order to achieve a more objective environmental impact reporting."
"I repeat, Mr President, I am very pleased that we have found the rapporteur and his committee so ready to accept our amendments out of this concern to integrate the environment into regional policy."
"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, I should like to begin my speech by mentioning that there are very few people present in the House when we are in fact discussing 34 % of the Community budget, which is intended for the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund and in this case we are dealing with the 1995 financial year."
"I think this debate should serve to point the way to what the Structural Funds should be, both as regards what they should be for 1999, when the current period of funding from the Structural Funds ends, and as regards the way the regulations need to be amended in order to make the implementation of those funds more effective to promote greater economic and social cohesion and greater local cohesion between the various localities which go to make up the European Union of today."
"Neither must we forget the new planned enlargement - taking us perhaps to 2004 - of the European Union."
"None of these points must be forgotten in the analysis of what the Structural Funds have represented."
"On this matter I should like to congratulate Mr Novo Belenguer on his report and to draw attention to some points which give cause for concern, such as the under-implementation of the Funds."
"That means that budgetary surpluses remain for allocation - and these might be very considerable - and we shall therefore have to decide how to use these amounts for the benefit at least of those States which have been the most assiduous in implementing the Structural Funds."
"The matter of additionality is highly disturbing, as Mr Novo Belenguer pointed out too, because there is insufficient information available to the Commission on the application by the Member States of the additionality criterion required for implementation of the Funds."
"The subject of coordination seems especially important to me, above all with the regional and local authorities, especially on those aspects on which the regional authorities have significant jurisdiction as regards the Funds."
"As regards the rural areas, the Structural Funds are a very important support for farming and rural incomes and in that connection it should be pointed out, as was agreed at the Cork Conference, that the decentralization of the administration of the Structural Funds should serve to avoid the danger which any future re-nationalization of the Common Agricultural Policy would entail."
"To this end, more information needs to be given on the possibilities for harnessing and disseminating the Structural Funds throughout the rural world."
"I think the European Observatory for Innovation and Rural Development which has been set up also deserves a mention and needs to be given the necessary powers."
"I therefore, for all the above reasons consider that this report is a positive one, but we must keep a watchful eye on the implementation of the Structural Funds in the future."
"Madam President, this Seventh Annual Report has 341 pages."
"It is very difficult for the ordinary Member of the European Parliament or the member of a national or regional parliament to read and digest this major volume."
"I would like to see a brief summary such as the Court of Auditors includes with its reports, so that the average Member of Parliament could quickly get some idea of what is contained in the report."
"The rapporteur for the Committee on Regional Policy, Mr Novo, expressed concern at the bureaucratic workload both at Member State and Commission level involved in the programming exercise."
"He blames this for the low level of utilization of the funds."
"We should note this point seriously and should also note that the four different funds, the seven objectives and the thirteen initiatives make for far too much administrative work."
"They also make an evaluation of what has been done more difficult."
"The Committee on Budgets is concerned about the low level of utilization which Mr Novo Berlenguer drew our attention to and recognizes that some states have had difficulty with the complexity of the regulations involved."
"The overall outturn for 1995 was 82 % of available funds."
"If we had had a simpler regulation we could have done much more and done it at a lower administrative cost."
"However, we welcome the fact that it was the poorer Member States which achieved the highest utilization and at least that gives us the satisfaction that the objective of social and economic cohesion is being achieved."
"In my opinion I recommended that whatever monies - and it appears definite that money will be pushed forward - are not utilized in the last year should be redistributed for the purpose for which they were intended amongst those states that succeeded in utilizing the funds available to them."
"Rapporteur of the Opinion of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment. (SV) Madam President, the Structural Funds must undergo basic reforms."
"Almost 100 of the 250 billion kronor which were allocated for the funds during 1995 have not been used."
"These are going completely to waste because administration and bureaucracy cannot keep up with processing the applications and allocating the money."
"It really is an utter scandal, this is a large sum of money which is not being used effectively."
"It is a matter of poor housekeeping with tax payers' money."
"There are also serious shortcomings in programme planning, supervision and evaluation."
"The most radical solution would be to allow each country to be responsible for their own regional policy, with certain objectives laid down by the EU regarding how the funds are to be used."
"We will not achieve this today, and must instead reform the funds one step at a time."
"I have several proposals from our committee which I would like to highlight: Bureaucracy, both in the EU and in the Member States, must be greatly reduced with fewer funds, fewer objectives and fewer Community initiatives."
"Programme planning, decision making and supervision must also be improved."
"More decisions must be taken at a local or regional level."
"It is our opinion that all regional political initiatives must be directed primarily at resolving the EU's serious problems; unemployment first of all, followed by improvements to the environment and better border region co-operation."
"The Novo Belenguer proposal also takes this view, and the view, we think, of the employment committee's proposal on greater decentralisation of decision making, more local decisions and better co-ordination between the Member States' regional policies and the EU's labour market policies."
"But, I am extremely dubious about the value of penalising Member States through the actions suggested in the report if they do not fulfil the principle of additionality, i.e. the addition of their own funds."
"I think that this is the wrong way to change and improve the function of the Structural Funds."
"But, on the whole I agree with the Novo Belenguer report."
"Madam President, the situation of the structural funds in the fisheries sector is as follows."
"Firstly: for the period 1994-1999 the budget allocation for the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance, i.e. the FIFG, is ECU 2600 m."
"Secondly, over the same period the allocation for the PESCA Community initiative is ECU 250 m."
"In the case of the FIFG, a number of innovative elements were added to structural policy in the sector in 1994/95."
"Following pressure from the Committee on Fisheries, new measures were introduced to provide, firstly, for early retirement for fishermen and secondly, for individual grants for younger fishermen forced to leave the industry following the withdrawal of fishing vessels from service."
"By and large, the FIFG commitment and payment rates in Objective 5(a) regions are average compared to those for all structural assistance objectives in the EU."
"The rate of implementation of FIFG assistance in Objective 1 areas is also satisfactory."
"This is not the case with the new PESCA Community initiative, although the general trend is positive."
"The 98 % programme authorization rate is still above average in relation to all EU Community initiatives."
"But the payment rate is substantially below average, which gives us cause for concern."
"The reason for this is that administrative procedures are too expensive, too complex and too slow."
"There is not enough coordination within the Commission either."
"Moreover, the Member States must also work more effectively, according to the European Court of Auditors."
"According to my information, things did not improve significantly here in 1996 either."
"The picture for 1997 looks different."
"Tomorrow the Commission will be holding a PESCA conference in Brussels."
"We hope it will confirm this."
"However, let me appeal to all concerned: keep the PESCA initiative alive during the forthcoming structural reform discussions, for every start-up phase is difficult and the fishermen need this initiative."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the European Commission's annual report on the activities of the Cohesion Fund in 1995 is a very important document, since it provides clear and full information about the Cohesion Fund's operation and effectiveness, records data and trends, and outlines perspectives."
"The positive assessment of the Fund's contribution towards achieving the aim of economic and social convergence acquires particular value following the publication, a few weeks ago, of the European Commission's general report on cohesion, which unfortunately makes it clear that the divergences between the European Union's better and less well developed countries have not yet been eliminated, while serious divergences are also to be found within the Member States."
"The approach to the aim of economic and social cohesion must therefore be recognised as a long-term and painful process, and not as an effort that can be completed within some limited period of time."
"Economic and social cohesion is not a fixed point but a constantly moving target."
"Granted the large developmental distance between the countries in terms of cohesion and other factors, which do not remain static but are changing all the time, it is unreasonable to expect that the aims of economic and social cohesion will be achieved in five or in ten years."
"In countries in the South of the Community, such as Greece, the main priorities of policy are still to modernize the infrastructure, attract investment, and to educate and train the population so that long-term employment prospects can be secured."
"In parallel, the strengthening of cohesion presupposes that policies will be adopted which mitigate the negative consequences of deregulation, unification of the market, and conformity with the prerequisites for participation in EMU."
"For example, with reference to the trans-European networks for transport, telecommunications and energy, I should like to stress that deregulation of the networks before their basic infrastructure is completed and before a certain minimum level of services is secured for the population as a whole, could lead to further divergence instead of convergence."
"We consider that these positions justify the need for transitional periods of adaptation, such as those requested by Greece."
"Consequently, much greater account should be taken of the dimension of cohesion when planning and implementing the Community's structural policies as a whole."
"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, I fully share the concern of the European Parliament in stressing that in the resolution under discussion on the Cohesion Fund ought, since greater regional internal disparities have been noted within the beneficiary Member States, to include an analysis of the possible impact of implementation of the Cohesion Fund on the said disparities within the field of the Commission's assessment of the socio-economic impact."
"The Cohesion Fund, like other funds, is essentially intended to promote economic and social cohesion."
"This is assessed both by the relative levels of development of the Member States between one another and by the degree of social and local disparities which exist within each Member State."
"In this context it is not irrelevant to mention the option which exists as regards the investment targeting option made within each of the four beneficiary Member States of the Cohesion Fund submitting projects."
"If there were no criteria for the options, the implementation of the Cohesion Fund itself might actually serve to increase the social and local disparities in the beneficiary Member States."
"For that to happen there need simply be a financing of projects exclusively or predominantly in areas with a higher level of development."
"There is still time to put right these points which seem to need to be put right."
"It is illogical and therefore untenable that the cohesion Fund should pay so little attention to the most peripheral regions."
"I am therefore very pleased to see the Commission, with the express agreement of the European Parliament, assuming a more flexible position on allowing projects with a value of less than ECU 10 million, since this approach will make it possible to invest more in projects aimed at less-developed regions, which helps to offset the over-concentration on aid to the more prosperous regions."
"But although it is essential to ensure that there is a contribution from the Cohesion Fund to realise the principle of economic and social cohesion, it is also essential, since this Fund is exclusively intended for the financing of investment in the transport and environment sectors, that it should follow the policies of the European Union in these fields."
"We therefore fully support the strategy announced by the Commission, to step up, by means of the Cohesion Fund, the implementation of Community directives, for example in areas such as water, supply, management and treatment."
"As regards the Cohesion Fund it seems clear to me that there are many points on which the European Parliament and the Commission agree. That is the result of course of a great deal of work together which we have all put in to this end and I should like to take this opportunity - and I think this is fully justified - to congratulate Mr HonÃ³rio Novo on his excellent report."
"We now only have to await the results."
"Madam President, first I wish to compliment the rapporteur Mr Novo for his excellent report."
"This is the first time the Commission has submitted an annual report based on a complete year of operation of the Cohesion Fund and it is the first time this Parliament has had the opportunity of examining how the Cohesion Fund has been implemented in the beneficiary Member States."
"Without a doubt the Novo report is exceptionally important."
"From the Commission report I am pleased to note that, globally, the results are positive."
"The budgetary implementation of the reference year was almost 100 % for both commitments and appropriations which is a unique and commendable result."
"However, I find it extraordinary that in at least one Member State, Cohesion Fund investment in one region has caused major problems in another."
"This has to be of great concern as it flies in the face of the purpose of the fund."
"I would invite the Commission, in conjunction with the Member State concerned, to find speedy and appropriate solutions to this problem."
"It is also heartening to note that no fraud was found in connection with the projects which were financed and this is an example to follow in other areas."
"Following on from a previous report in 1996 by Mr Hatzidakis on cohesion policy and the environment, it is fitting that the environmental aspects relating to the fund have been given particular emphasis by Mr Novo."
"It is clear that some improvements have been made in this sector, in particular in a better balance of projects between transport and the environment."
"I agree that more needs to be done here."
"Even though they do not apply to all the beneficiary Member States in the same way and to the same degree, I subscribe to the rapporteur's concerns about other environmental aspects relating to the fund."
"Mr Novo says that other environmental projects such as combating coastal erosion might be envisaged."
"On this point, I give my total support to the rapporteur."
"For a considerable time now, I have been on record that coastal erosion is no longer to be regarded as a local problem."
"It is not even a national problem."
"It must be regarded as a European Union problem."
"For European Union problems there must be European Union solutions and here I would emphasize that coastal erosion is a particularly important problem in Ireland."
"I can support paragraph 9 of the resolution on the assumption that the rapporteur is referring to regions such as the Azores and Madeira."
"In conclusion, the very existence of the Cohesion Fund has been of the utmost importance for Ireland."
"Through the Cohesion Fund good progress has been made in my country towards the objective of economic and social cohesion and it should continue to do so."
"Mr Novo's call on the Commission and the Council to guarantee that the Cohesion Fund will continue as of 1999 receives my full and unambiguous support."
"Madam President, the Commission's report is a kind of incomplete account, with many deliberate omissions, of the implementation of Community policy on economic and social cohesion, and of the action and effectiveness of the Structural Funds."
"On these issues we have two parallel reports which go together in one way or another, the Novo and the Novo Belenguer reports."
"They take a positive view of the Commission's report, but put forward a number of noteworthy critical views."
"In expressing my view of this two-sided picture, the reports by the Commission and those by our colleagues, I should like to say that while on the one hand they highlight the problem, on the other hand they are incomplete."
"The main problem concerns what the European Union is trying to achieve today with this policy of the Structural Funds, the policy of economic cohesion."
"It is striving for regional development, approximation, convergence, and the cohesion of countries and regions at some particular level."
"The account given shows that this policy has so far been negative, and has consequently failed."
"It has failed:"
"first, because the resources available are insufficient and ought to be increased and made more available,"
"secondly, because the programmes and Community initiatives are numerous and many-sided, but they have no priority or criterion of what they are trying to develop, and"
"thirdly, Madam President, even after the Amsterdam Conference there is no impulse in that direction."
"We fear that there will be a series of such deficiencies, that countries and regions will remain in a state of underdevelopment, that expenditure will continue to be squandered for bureaucratic and pointless or inappropriately prioritized, supposedly developmental purposes, and that the desired result will not be achieved."
"I can quote Greece as an example."
"It is very much a country with marked peculiarities, but these are not taken into account."
"It is as if a bulldozer were trundling across all the regions, all the countries, in the same way."
"But there are particular features, hyper-regionality, underdevelopment, concentration of the population in some centres and desertion of some other areas, and the various funds, programmes and Community initiatives take no account of these particularities so that the respective needs may be dealt with appropriately."
"And Greece is said to be always on the scrounge, as we are now hearing here, whereas this is not true."
"Greece only asks for what it is entitled to."
"What the Structural Funds provide for the four countries of the Cohesion Fund, in relation to Greece, is distributed unequally and the resources do not match the needs, if proper account is taken of the country's particular features and of those needs."
"Unless the problem is dealt with in that way, by a radical approach to Community policy on the issues of economic and social cohesion and the development of countries and regions, we will no doubt come back and debate more reports, but with no result."
"Madam President, making money available for infrastructure certainly does not automatically imply progress with cohesion."
"This is apparent simply from the fact that the development gap between poor and rich regions has still not been closed despite the large sums of money spent."
"So it is not a question of the amount of money made available but mainly of the quality of the projects."
"In the past, large road-building schemes in the cohesion countries have destroyed more than they have really achieved."
"We can only give a real impetus to sustainable development if we strengthen small-scale infrastructure."
"That applies even more to environmental infrastructure."
"Excessively large-scale environmental infrastructure places a burden on the citizens and communities of disadvantaged regions and makes them even poorer. that is why I call on the Commission to give preference to small-scale projects and to support those which will leave the next generation an environment worth living in."
"Parliament was putting on the emergency brake when it set upper and lower percentage criteria for the proportion of combined transport - road and rail - in its decisions on the trans-European Networks."
"There seems to be no other way of really implementing models of sustainable development, as called for in Chapter 10 of the White Paper."
"These decisions were parliamentary decisions and it really would be terrible if we bypassed them."
"Looking to the future, I doubt whether linking the resources for structural intervention to these convergence criteria really has produced any benefit."
"That is why I call for this link to be dissolved in the next Financial Perspective and for us to aim at making the needs and neediness of regions the main criterion for structural intervention."
"For it is a question of genuinely doing something for the people of Europe."
"Mr President, the Commission's reports on the cohesion fund and the other structural funds for the 1995 financial year have arrived punctually."
"The Commission's judgement is that the budget for the cohesion fund has been implemented satisfactorily and it is cheered by the fact that it has not been notified of any cases of fraud affecting the projects that have been financed."
"The Commission should pay equal attention to the goal of publicizing the availability of the structural funds and facilitating their use."
"The working document drawn up in 1996 by DG XIX expressly mentions an alarming underspend of structural funds appropriations, in addition to a great deal of disturbing data and analysis."
"The 1997 budget procedure envisages a reduction of the payment appropriations for the structural funds just because of the underspend."
"If we want targeted and effective projects which have a concrete and substantial impact in needy areas, we should first of all strengthen the initiatives designed to extend the means of disseminating information through modern communications technology."
"We must also change the complex rules, make them more transparent and easier to apply so as to discourage fraud at its inception, and encourage decentralization of the management of funded projects."
"Experience shows that in regions with decentralized management greater advantage has been taken of the opportunities offered by Community structural interventions, because the regional authorities are better equipped to assess them directly."
"For example, Italy, a centralized country, has the disturbingly modest rate of implementation of 28 per cent, whereas Germany, a federal country, has 66 per cent."
"If these statistics were published in Italy there would be an immediate upsurge in the struggle for independence in Lombardy."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 1995 was the first year in which the three new Member States, Austria, Sweden and Finland, played a part in European structural policy."
"A while ago this House debated and adopted an excellent report by Mr Rack."
"I believe that these countries have managed to implement the structural policy rather well, partly thanks to the experience they had already gained with their existing national regional policy."
"But let me also say in the rather carefree manner of a Member from a new Member State that we found it hard to get to grips with the red tape in the administration of these structural policies."
"Even though we have managed to implement them fairly well and properly in our countries, I must say - and this is something one has to bring up again and again as a Member - that we sometimes become a little discouraged when we apply to the European Commission or to the regional bodies."
"My second point, to which other Members have also referred, is that the amount of appropriations not utilized increased from ECU 15 000 m to ECU 23 400 m between 1993 and 1995, as the report notes."
"This in itself raises the question of the success of the structural policies."
"How successful can a structural policy be if it does not prove possible to make the money we budget for in Parliament available for the appropriate measures?"
"I think it is a rather unique situation in the world for money made available not to be used."
"To think that a few days ago saw the end of a summit that apparently placed special emphasis on employment, that once again found that we have some 18 million unemployed in the Union while at the same time we do not utilize these kinds of structural funds, I must say that speaks for itself and we Members simply cannot accept it."
"I would certainly support it and consider it most important for the Commissioner present here today to make headway in this matter."
"I believe we need one regional policy in the European Union."
"We cannot make distinctions on the basis of there being few rural areas here and more urban areas there, etc. I remember certain discussions in which it became clear that everybody in fact agrees on the need to concentrate resources, not just in other countries but in their own too."
"I think here we must support the proposals of the Commissioner responsible on the future reform of the structural policies."
"However they need to assume a different form, and Mr McCartin has already indicated on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control that we must be in a position to redistribute unutilized resources from one Member State to another, otherwise I think the future of the common structural policy will look rather gloomy, given the moves towards renationalizing the various structural policies."
"Madam President, earlier, Mr Costa Neves spoke on our behalf, for the European People's Party, about the report on the Cohesion Fund."
"I myself will therefore refer to the report by Mr Novo Belenguer on the Structural Funds, which I must say, is a very good report which was adopted unanimously by the Committee and for that reason I think Mr Novo Belenguer deserves to be congratulated."
"I would like to mention a number of points, mainly in order to draw various conclusions about the future, because the past, what happened in 1994 or 1995 or 1996, is something we should bear in mind when considering the review of Structural Fund regulations."
"The first point I want to dwell on concerns the issue of underperformance, i.e. the non-absorption of the resources of the Structural Funds. Here, I should like to point out that this is observed mainly among the wealthier Member States, not so much in the Objective 1 areas, and it applies mainly to the European Social Fund, which is not within the Commissioner's purview, but since the problem has arisen we should address it here in our debate."
"I want to say that it is an issue we should certainly all take seriously, both the Commission and the Member States, and besides all the other efforts we will have to make, I think we ought to see what can be done to simplify the regulations without preventing transparency, a thing that as I know, the Commission is already thinking about."
"The second point I want to mention is the monitoring and implementation of supplementarity."
"It seems that the Commission is naturally unable to guarantee its application completely, and there are serious implications that it is not applied sufficiently well, even during the present planning period."
"This is a very important issue, and the Commission must cooperate closely with the Member States to achieve the requisite improvements, perhaps with the threat contained in the report itself, in other words that funding should be cut if the principle of supplementarity is not ensured."
"A further matter that arises is the new assessment system proposed by the Commission, based on the intervention of independent experts."
"This is certainly a positive step, which will contribute towards the prevention or correction of certain mistakes, but mainly towards the qualitative improvement of the new programmes for the future."
"In each case, however, it must be ensured that those experts will be chosen on merit and with objective criteria, and provision must also be made to subject them to some form of control."
"In my view, the monitors will have to be monitored."
"Another point is the question of the environment."
"I know the Commission attributes great importance to that, and as Parliament, that satisfies us. However, I think further steps could be taken as well, especially where studies of environmental consequences are concerned, and those will have to be more substantial and more binding."
"Madam President, I conclude with a final comment concerning the participation of local and regional authorities, which contributes to the transparency of the programmes."
"I know that steps have been taken, but I think there could be many more, and more substantial ones, so that the participation of regional and local authorities can be truly substantial."
"Mr President, any member of this House who commits himself to the spending of Cohesion and Structural Funds is immediately popular with the citizen because the citizen sees an improvement in his own environment which is a good thing and which improves support for Europe."
"But there is a bomb beneath the support of the Structural Funds."
"A bomb of money which is not being spent."
"If this under-spending is not drastically but responsibly corrected than the support of the European citizen may well be lost."
"In the long term it is not possible to justify to the European citizen that there is a lot of money which is not being spent while the individual Member States are being required to contribute more to Europe."
"On the eve of enlargement that is a particularly inconvenient and difficult consideration."
"The shared burdens which we bear have grown into a shared sense of solidarity within Europe."
"This must remain both before and after enlargement."
"But before we come to that it must be made very clear what exactly the additional character is which warrants projects being funded out of European funds, as otherwise we are simply moving the money from one pocket to another and in this case also just sitting on it."
"So this is an appeal to all governments to submit good proposals to spend this money."
"On the eve of enlargement an unspent bomb of money sends out the wrong signal for the cohesion of European solidarity and certainly to Central and Eastern Europe."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I just want to comment briefly on two points."
"The first is additionality, where I am speaking more from the point of view of those who are making increasing attempts to obtain structural fund resources at local level."
"The problem is that we have several principles in the EU."
"One of the most recent and no doubt most rational principles is the need to reduce further public indebtedness."
"Since Amsterdam, it has been decided to adhere to this principle on a fairly lasting and strict basis."
"One effect of this, which is already becoming apparent at local budgetary level, is that small local authorities find it increasingly difficult to raise the complementary resources for EU projects, even if national and regional resources are of course contributed as a matter of course."
"We must ensure that this does not turn into a disastrous trend for certain regions."
"I believe we must try to prevent that in time."
"Secondly, I would like to make a comment on the principle of partnership."
"We still have major reservations in many respects about extending this principle."
"Let me at this point specifically thank the Commission for making serious efforts and also taking serious initiatives in this area."
"What obstacles still remain relate mainly to partnership between the national governments, the regional administrations and often between the latter and the local authorities."
"If I may say so, we in Thuringia, for instance, have a large number of regional development plans drawn up in a democratic manner which were not really taken into consideration when the programme planning documents were drawn up."
"Let me conclude by making one point in this connection: anyone who wants to deal with the crucial tasks in this area in coming years will have to attach considerably more attention to the principle of partnership, because the main task is in fact to use fewer resources more efficiently."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report on the Seventh Annual Report on the Structural Funds for 1995 is the first one to also cover the new Member States of Austria, Sweden and Finland."
"We recently had an opportunity to say something more specific about some of their experiences, in a separate report on the implementaton of regional policy in those three Member States, and I am taking the opportunity today to draw certain comparisons."
"They are very interesting at times."
"In many respects our report was very similar."
"We criticized the fact, which is indeed a problem, that in many cases there was and still is far too much bureaucracy both at Community level and in the Member States, too many programmes and, comparatively, too little money in the end."
"In many ways the picture in the three new Member States was more positive than on average in Europe, and certainly so in relation to some real black spots."
"In regard to the utilization of resources in particular, despite the fact that we have only been Members for a very short time, the three new Member States certainly managed to utilize a very large proportion of these resources in the start-up phase."
"I am pointing this out here because it is important to ensure that resources which were not utilized at the time can and must be used up by the end of this year."
"On the whole, utilization of resources was very good."
"This is exceptionally true in the case of SMEs, women's programmes, the information society and in particular LEADER and INTERREG."
"There were some not so good examples."
"In particular, the new Member States did not or not entirely manage to make it clear that EU resources were also contributed to the projects in question."
"We must draw the necessary consequences."
"We must provide more information and also learn from best practices; we must take the assessment seriously and must continue with careful planning in future too."
"We are glad to note that the Commission is itself planning to radically simplify and clarify the programmes for the next phase."
"We in the European Parliament will be happy to take part in this work, even though we will not yet have the new co-decision powers under the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this Seventh Annual Report is a special one, not just because for the first time it covers three new Member States but far more in fact because the report refers to the beginning of the second planning period, a time when the discussion on reforming the structural funds was already in full swing."
"There is really no point in looking back to the past, in this case to the year 1995, unless one draws lessons from it for the future."
"So I will not evaluate the many positive aspects noted in the Commission's report, in relation also to previous reports, but lay the finger on a few sore points."
"As with the previous annual reports, once again we note that in practice the beneficiaries face the problem of excessive bureaucracy and more or less inflexible disbursement procedures."
"That is why talk about the need to simplify the legal provisions and administrative procedures is not just a matter of empty words that keep sounding in our ears but an important factor of the reform, if we are to achieve greater efficiency and transparency."
"In my view the Seventh Annual Report also makes it clear that in regions where the administration has been decentralized, more use has been made of the possibilities offered by the structural fund interventions."
"Decentralized administration can also help resolve an acute problem in some Member States where the regions face long delays before receiving payments from Brussels."
"A further finding relates to planning."
"Here more account must be taken of the direct political responsibility of the regional players in setting the structural objectives and determining the assistance priorities."
"And if we want to create wider possibilities for structural fund measures in the year 2000 and later, regardless of statistical values, we will have to make provision for a relative number of changes, so that we can react to any unforeseeable structural fluctuations."
"In short, it must be possible to adjust programmes after they have started and in a flexible manner; that is a requirement we should set out in relation to the reform."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Novo and Mr Novo Belenguer, for their clear and balanced reports and to thank all those who took part in this debate for their valuable contributions, which are indeed most important because we are concerned not just with the year 1995 but, I hope, also with ensuring that together we manage to improve matters as from the year 2000."
"Let me begin by briefly addressing a few questions in connection with the report on the 1995 Cohesion Fund."
"I was pleased to see that real note was taken of the progress we have made towards a more balanced financing of environmental and transport projects."
"As you know, the Member States concerned are not overly enthusiastic about the Commission's endeavour to split the resources between environmental and transport infrastructure investments for the entire planning period, and I may say that the positive trend you noted in 1995 has stabilized."
"In 1996 we managed for the first time to split the resources almost exactly by allocating ECU 1200 m for environmental and transport projects respectively."
"I believe the suggestion that we link environmental and transport projects more closely is an interesting one, and we will look at it carefully in the context of what is feasible here."
"For the rest, Member States are also putting more emphasis on the need to build up rail, sea, combined transport and urban transport systems and to give precedence to environment-friendly projects over huge road-building projects."
"I do think we are making slow and gradual headway here, although I would not say that I am satisfied with this progress as a whole."
"We hope that the new directive on environmental impact reports, which the Council adopted in March, will also lead to an improvement in procedures; the Commission will ensure that these procedures are applied correctly and strictly."
"However, that is all we can do, for we probably all agree that we could imagine even better environmental impact assessments, that responded more closely to your concerns and ours."
"In connection with our agreements with Parliament on the greening of the budget, we have trained our own officials in the relevant areas in this particular sector, to enable them to see more clearly and become more aware of the problems involved."
"In the context of the greening of the budget, the Cohesion Fund will also commission independent experts to evaluate the Cohesion Fund's contribution to environmental protection and sustainable development in general."
"I am not sure this will earn us nothing but praise, but I do believe it is important and that it will teach us lessons for the future."
"As for small projects, especially in the field of environmental protection, let me simply point out that the Commission already takes an extremely flexible approach here, thanks to which it managed to achieve this 50: 50 distribution in the first place, and that we are also being somewhat flexible in relation to the distribution of funds normally intended primarily for large-scale projects."
"But I do agree with you that a great many local environmental projects need our support."
"That is why we have often combined a number of small projects, in order to place more emphasis on environmental protection in the cohesion countries."
"In your report you again asked for information on the application of the conditionality clause."
"Let me just point out that the procedure is explained in detail in the Cohesion Fund report for 1996, which responds to your request at the time when we first applied this procedure."
"In the report on the Structural Funds - 1995, for which I also offer warm thanks, you rightly criticize the low take-up of budgetary appropriations in the start-up phase 1994/1995, the complex procedures and the high - I think we can say excessive -level of bureaucracy both in the Member States and in the Commission."
"But let me point out that the budgetary implementation has been improved considerably in the meantime."
"In 1996 almost 100 % of budget appropriations were committed."
"Overall, the three-year rate is also satisfactory; but that does not mean that there are not exceptions in certain areas."
"In response to the Italian speaker I must say that it is not just the national programmes that are largely to blame for Italy's low rate of implementation, but simply that it is still the case that almost nothing has been done in some regions."
"Nor is there any universal remedy for this; basically, it means that all three levels, European, national and regional, must act in concert."
"But let me state in any case, by way of clarification, that the structural fund programmes are multiannual programmes."
"Clearly, if you plan an investment over several years, the expenses only tend to increase in later years, which does not necessarily imply poor management."
"Rather it means that it sometimes takes a while for projects to be clearly defined, funds to be allocated and payments to be made."
"Nevertheless, I believe that there certainly is a large grey area between the normal running of multiannual programmes and the occasional poor take-up of funds that we are criticizing here."
"I would be glad if we could make a concerted effort over the next structural fund period to define some kind of criteria for success, in relation not just to the take-up of funds but also to the quality of the programmes and projects, for it is pointless to spend money badly."
"We must try to combine spending money according to the rules and using it for good and successful projects, which will certainly not be an easy exercize."
"For the rest, let me also point out once again that in most of the cases where the slow disbursement of funds in the regions was criticized, the resources were blocked in the Member States' capitals, which means that there is a need for substantial simplifications and for improved procedures in the Member States too."
"Mr Belenguer, I am very pleased that in your report you emphasized the importance of the principles of European structural policy, such as economic and social cohesion, additionality and broader and deeper partnership."
"You also rightly underline the need for coordination with other Community policies and horizontal priorities, such as employment, the environment, equal opportunities and support for SMEs, which we also proposed in recent years as guidelines for the new Objective 2 programmes, but also as means of adjustment of the Objective 1 programmes in the mid-term evaluation, with a view to job-creation and economic revival."
"I think it is important to make real use of the mid-term evaluation now."
"There has been some delay because some things simply took a little longer, in relation also to the monitoring committees, i.e., the level to which we in fact want to assign more responsibility and which we think should have a greater say, until the experts are appointed."
"Yet I am certain we will have a chance to take a flexible approach to changes in the world and in economic circumstances and to pay more attention to means of actually creating long-term jobs, which is a major aim of the structural funds."
"We will also be undertaking evaluations on the subjects of employment, the environment, equal opportunities and support for SMEs in response to your wishes and I hope that the evaluation methods will gradually improve both in the Member States and in the Community."
"Basically, we finally made progress here for the first time about six months ago, in terms also of convincing the Member States to regard this not just as a bureaucratic exercize but as a chance to improve the implementation of structural policy; I hope that will bring us some way forward."
"In your report and during the debate, your proposals regarding the basic principles of the structural fund reform in the Santer package, which relate to the reduction in the number of funds, budgetary structure, decentralization and linking credits and loans more closely, also reflect central concerns of the Commission."
"The Commission will be adopting this package in Strasbourg on 15 July and submit it to Parliament on 16 July."
"That is why there are no concrete or official proposals yet at this point."
"I discussed some ideas discussed in the Cohesion Forum, in which many MEPs also took part, with members of the Committee on Regional Policy yesterday, so I will simply summarize them in a few words now."
"For instance, we discussed the need, which I think we all appreciate, for simpler implementing and financing procedures, for more transparency, for a reduction in the number of objectives, for a drastic reduction in the number of Community initiatives, for concentration on cross-frontier cooperation and integrating most of the Community initiatives in the mainstream programmes, and for decentralization, which of course also means a clearer assignment of responsibilities."
"We cannot have the Member States implementing the programmes while the Commission continues to bear the responsibility."
"During the reform of the structural funds regulation we will, therefore, also have to establish more definite rules, which will make things easier for all concerned and clarify the areas of responsibility, but also provide for monitoring and evaluation in future too which, I think, is an important aspect and one of interest to Parliament."
"I think we also agree on the need for more concrete and binding rules on the partnership principle."
"As you know, the problem here, in the past too, has been not so much a matter of the Commission's proposals as of the Member States' unwillingness to accept these proposals."
"Nevertheless I believe our past experience has shown the need to pursue this road and I am sure that the debate on Agenda 2000 and the reform of the structural funds regulations will offer us many opportunities for extensive consultation in the coming months."
"Thank you for your suggestions and for today's debate!"
"Thank you, Mrs Wulf-Mathies."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Agreement with the Kyrgyz Republic"
"The next item is the report (A4-0032/97) by Mr Chesa, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, on the proposal for a Council Decision (COM(95)49-11156/95 - C4-0685/96-95/0063(ACC) on the conclusion by the European Union, the European Coal and Steel Committee and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and the Kyrgyz Republic, of the other part, on trade and trade-related matters."
"Madam President, the reasons that led the REX Committee to approve the interim agreement on Kyrgyzstan are the same reasons that induced it to approve the economic and commercial aspects of the partnership agreement."
"That agreement is based on the difficulties and prospects of the Kyrgyz economy: difficulties resulting from the break-up of the USSR, difficulties linked to relations with the other Asian republics, and difficulties linked to the privatization and modernization of the economy, reflected initially by a drop in agricultural and industrial production, and also in food production."
"The partnership agreement of 1994, similar to those previously concluded with other States of the former Eastern Bloc, relates particularly to three main points."
"The first is the trade in goods, based on most-favoured nation treatment as far as customs formalities are concerned, textile products being the subject of a separate agreement."
"The second point relates to the provisions affecting business and investment, and especially includes conditions affecting employment, the setting up of companies, day-to-day payments, liberalization of transactions and the protection of intellectual property."
"The third point covers economic co-operation, with a view to assisting the process of reform, economic recovery and sustainable development in the Kyrgyz Republic."
"With this in mind, economic co-operation is focused particularly on economic and social development, the development of human resources, support for business, agriculture and food, non-military nuclear energy, transport, tourism, environmental protection, co-operation in general and many other fields."
"The width of this coverage provided by the partnership and co-operation treaty means that the future of economic and trade relations between the Kyrgyz Republic and the European Union is very promising."
"For all these reasons, I ask Honourable Members to vote in favour of the interim agreement between the European Union and Kyrgyzstan, particularly as the Committee on Budgets has given a favourable opinion."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the EPP Group I want to support our rapporteur, Mr Chesa, in his positive evaluation of the interim agreement and also propose that we approve the conclusion of the interim agreement."
"This will make it possible rapidly to apply the trade-related provisions of the partnership and cooperation agreement."
"Following the break-up of the Soviet Union, this Central Asian republic is still struggling not just with enormous political but also with very serious economic difficulties."
"The entire trade system has broken down and to provide normal supplies of food and energy proved well-nigh impossible for a long time."
"This resulted in an economic isolation that is still apparent today and blocked its further economic development."
"Paradoxically, Kyrgyzstan's difficult situation is exacerbated by the recently implemented customs union with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan because these two partner states have provided for and are also imposing trade restrictions on third states."
"At the same time, it is clear that there is much potential for developing economic and trade relations between Kyrgyzstan and the EU."
"The TACIS programmes were radically reformed for Kyrgyzstan, which may result in greater local interest and more investment partners."
"Kyrgyzstan's ambitious privatization programme is the main element of the economic reform that has been initiated."
"But at present the people do not seem to be very interested in becoming involved in the private economy and setting up small businesses, although there are signs of a gradual fall in inflation."
"That is why the following areas seem especially appropriate for closer cooperation between the EU and Kyrgyzstan: first, the development and implementation of a new national energy plan; secondly, the transfer of technical and administrative knowhow; thirdly, the establishment of joint ventures in the field of services, tourism and infrastructure."
"But what about providing the young people of Kyrgyzstan with business training?"
"How is the Commission organizing this help for self-help so that privatization will finally get under way?"
"Should we not make more use than before of the TACIS programme resources?"
"At any rate I think it is clear that the interim agreement offers a favourable environment for the development of trade and trade policy between the European Union and Kyrgyzstan and we should support this agreement."
"Madam President, let me begin with a few basic comments on the strategy pursued by the Council and the Commission of pushing for purely trade-related cooperation instead of a comprehensive partnership and cooperation agreement."
"The Greens cannot endorse this strategy and consider it far more important to implement the partnership and cooperation agreement fairly quickly, not to put the EU's interests in the forefront but to pursue an overall strategy to support the process of transformation in these countries."
"Otherwise this would have disastrous consequences for Kyrgyzstan."
"In practice only 20-39 % of the economy is privatized and there is scarcely any real legislation on privatization, only on leasing."
"Democratization is faltering and far greater support is needed in this area."
"On the other hand, it is very much in the EU's interest to exploit Kyrgyzstan's valuable resources, such as the gold and uranium mines, which has a destructive effect on this mountain republic's valuable nature reserves."
"What little still remains will then certainly be destroyed."
"The agreements are already in existence."
"Joint ventures are possible even at this stage."
"That does not primarily require an interim agreement."
"It would be preferable to follow the overall strategy of the partnership and cooperation agreement."
"Madam President, first I want to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report."
"The Commission agrees with him that this as an important step in our relations with Kyrgyzstan."
"The purpose of the interim agreement is to implement the provisions on trade and trade-related questions without waiting for them to be ratified by all the Member States' parliaments, and I believe this first step is also a positive one in regard to economic and democratic developments there."
"The interim agreement also contains provisions on observing the principles of democracy and respect for human rights."
"Its implementation allows for and promotes the expansion of trade relations, which are scarcely developed at this stage."
"It has been pointed out by several speakers that the weakest bilateral trade between the EU and any of the republics that have emerged from the former USSR is that with Kyrgyzstan."
"I also think that certainly means TACIS funds should be used for training programmes, with a view to restructuring the economy and also using own resources on the basis of own activities."
"That is why about one third of the TACIS funds is to be used for training programmes of that kind."
"With the entry into force of the interim agreement it will also be possible to put pressure on the Kyrgyz government to observe the provisions on respect for human rights in the event that this proves necessary and that human rights are violated in the very young and unstable democracy of Kyrgyzstan."
"So we hope that overall this represents a first positive step towards improving relations and improving Kyrgyzstan's potential."
"Madam President, I know that Mrs Wulf-Mathies is no expert in this field, but the fact is that we also keep being served up this promise to underpin democracy through the democracy clause by Mr van den Broek too."
"Yet when it actually comes to applying it, there is always a loud silence."
"I ask you to call on Mr van den Broek finally to apply a procedure that has been on file since 1995 so as to ensure that these promises really are kept."
"What we keep being promised should finally be done, i.e., where difficulties arise, the democracy clause must be applied."
"Hitherto we have had nothing but empty promises!"
"Mrs Schroedter, that was not a question, it was a continuation of the debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"PHARE programme"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A4-0165/97) by Mr Wiersma, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, on the Commission's PHARE 1994 and 1995 Annual Reports (COM(95)0366 - C4-0022/96 and COM(96)0360 - C4-0176/97)."
"Madam President, I am afraid that this is a debate being conducted for the Minutes."
"My apologies to all my colleagues who are still here this evening."
"This is a great pity because the PHARE programme is the European Union's most important instrument in granting aid to Central and Eastern Europe and hopefully it will also be the most important instrument in permitting the European Union's enlargement to include these countries."
"I fear that the way this item has been placed on the agenda will have dissuaded many people from participating in the debate, but it is clearly the aim to use this occasion to speak about the future of the PHARE programme."
"In six months' time a number of Central and Eastern European countries will be meeting on a Mediterranean island to begin discussions on enlargement."
"This is of course a very major investment in the future of a more integrated and secure Europe."
"It also makes it particularly urgent to undertake a thorough examination of the functioning of the PHARE programme as the most important instrument in this enlargement process."
"As I said, we have taken the opportunity of the annual reports to undertake a more fundamental appraisal of the PHARE programme, a forward-looking appraisal."
"The constructive position of Parliament in writing this report and the debate which has since taken place with the Commission on many aspects of it is unfortunately ill-rewarded this evening, with all due respect to the Commissioner present, due to the absence of Commissioner Van den Broek."
"I very much regret this, perhaps next time we should be somewhat more negative."
"I will nevertheless make a number of points, although as I have already said this is more of a debate for the Minutes. These are points which I believe warrant the greatest attention by the Commission in the short term in further developing the reorientation of the PHARE programme."
"For example, the assessment of the situation of the PHARE programme in Romania revealed an important defect in the programme which I believe applies more generally, namely the poor evaluations, or the lack of evaluations, which have an effect on project implementation."
"How can this be improved?"
"As a Parliament we have too little understanding of the actual effects of the billions which the European Union is at present investing in Eastern Europe."
"There is a serious lack of clarity about the objectives of the various PHARE projects in the Central and Eastern European countries."
"There is also a lack of clarity about how projects contribute to the reform process and will soon be contributing to the enlargement process."
"Only when we have effective evaluation instruments will we as a Parliament, and also the European Union, be in a position to see how our attempts to provide support also make an active contribution to a successful enlargement process."
"Secondly, and this is an important point, there is major under-spending in the PHARE programme."
"A large part of the funds allocated are either spent too late or not at all."
"I believe this is a very regrettable situation."
"It is a subject which has been much debated in this House, but I believe that in future we must focus primarily on ways in which this situation can be ended."
"It detracts from the value of the PHARE programme, but it is of course primarily damaging to those countries for which this money is intended."
"I therefore want to see more money going to major projects, especially to promote investments, to improve infrastructures in the candidate Member States and, first and foremost, for improvements in what I describe as the administrative culture in these countries, an administrative culture which still fails to comply with the standards in the European Union. In particular, it is important for governments and administrations in these candidate Member States to be able to apply the regulations and undertakings which apply within the European Union."
"Another important point I should like to highlight is the question of priorities."
"I am afraid that all attention over the next few years will be paid to the successful candidate Member States, if I may describe them in this way. Countries such as Hungary and Poland which everybody says will be included in the first round of new Member States."
"I can foresee this development and understand that there is a certain logic in it, but that is specifically why I want extra investments and extra attention to be paid to those countries which may well be joining in the second round."
"I believe that this must be a very important starting point for the Parliament."
"I should also like to say something about the management of the PHARE programme."
"There has been much discussion in this House on subcontracting, or the subcontracting of subcontracted projects, if I may put it like that."
"The Parliament and the Committee on External Economic Relations find that the Commission itself must assume more responsibility and in particular more political responsibility for matters which fall to policy-making officials who are subject to the authority of the European Union."
"In concrete terms this includes, for example, more staff for the PHARE programme."
"I should also like to draw attention to another important point in connection with the accession strategy."
"This is the matter of democracy and democratization."
"I believe more money must be allocated to developing and reinforcing democracy in countries which have applied for European Union membership."
"Finally - and I believe this is the last important point - when we look at the future and the investment of European Union resources in the candidate Member States, which is very important in enabling these countries to earn more, much greater attention must be paid to cofinancing, also within the PHARE programme, so that the countries themselves are also encouraged to commit resources to joint projects."
"These were just a number of points which I have been able to make in my allocated speaking time."
"I hope that the Commission will consider these recommendations, but above all that in future the Commission, and also Parliament, as we must also put our own house in order, will take the discussion on enlargement and the resources to be allocated to it somewhat more seriously."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like Mr Wiersma I am sorry that his report, which I think is a very good and important one, was put before such a small number of Members of this House."
"Since the main points of principle have already been made, let me perhaps make a few comments on our recent experience with PHARE."
"Firstly: a pan-European transport conference recently took place in Helsinki."
"I attended it and noted that one government representative after another from the Eastern European states emphasized the importance of the PHARE programmes for the development of the infrastructure programmes in their countries."
"If Europe is to grow closer together, which is the objective, it is crucial to expand the infrastructure, especially in public transport but elsewhere too, and that is where PHARE makes its contribution."
"The general maps in the two annual reports clearly show how much is being done for transport."
"I do believe, and this is a point Mrs Wulf-Mathies also addressed, that it will be important in connection with developments over the next few years to coordinate the PHARE programmes in Eastern Europe more closely with the regional and infrastructure programmes in the West so that we can achieve an even greater objective."
"Given that corridors were recently decided in Helsinki and that a tenth corridor has now been added, it is most important for this coordination to be achieved in practice."
"Secondly, I was in Zagreb in Croatia last week with a parliamentary delegation."
"We noticed how much importance is attached there to PHARE as a means of support and assistance for economic factors but also for integration and democratization."
"I think we initially had some reservations here."
"But we should consider entering into further talks, in the context of precisely this objective, as Mr Wiersma also said, namely promoting democratization, promoting the integration of the various ethnic groups, etc. so that we can make even more targeted and efficient use of PHARE in this area."
"Albania certainly serves as an example of money being spent and not being used very efficiently."
"I do not want to criticize anyone specifically, but I do want to point this out and ask the Commission to take greater care when it disburses these funds that they are used efficiently."
"I know it is difficult to convince a country: you will get money but you must change your administrative structures, change your approach, change your political structure."
"Yet that is most important, for otherwise the people of Europe will ask why they are handing out money when so much of it is spent badly or simply wasted."
"So it is important for the countries concerned, but also for the Western European countries, to take more care to ensure that these monies are put to the best use."
"On that basis we are happy to approve Mr Wiersma's report."
"We consider the PHARE programme an important one that will become even more so with the enlargement of the European Union."
"However, we also believe that the Commission must devote greater attention to ensuring that the resources are used efficiently."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the PHARE programme is, in my view, a legitimate child of the European Parliament."
"A few courageous colleagues put the available budgetary resources together at the end of the 1980s to promote the economic modernization of Hungary and Poland, countries which at that time were just trying to extricate themselves from the domination of the Soviet Union."
"Of course modernizing the economy means restructuring the economy with a view to a social market economy."
"We are very keen for the PHARE programme to be successful and to be integrated in the next few years in a longterm pre-accession strategy, which will also be reflected in differentiated form in Agenda 2000."
"But, and here I agree with the rapporteur Mr Wiersma, we cannot yet tell whether the PHARE resources are now being used more efficiently than they were in the beginning, whether they are being oversubscribed or are inadequate, whether the misdirection of funds mainly towards EU consultants that occurred in the initial phase has now been corrected."
"When you look at the well-presented reports you would think they were drawn up by an industrial association, although with the difference that they do not summarize the statistics of success but give statistics on expenditure that shows no prospects of success and no background of success."
"Of course that makes it difficult for the European Parliament, which attaches very great value to the favourable development of the PHARE programme, to monitor them."
"So we also think that there is no point in the long run in drafting reports of this kind but that we must change the monitoring systems, as the Hungarian president proposed a few days ago in the joint parliamentary committee."
"Mr Horn thought we should provide for a global pre-accession programme that would make the INTERREG funding, the PHARE funding and the European Investment Bank funding transparent while at the same time giving the European Union and the country concerned a chance to use the funds in a manner likely to promise success."
"The question is whether that is the right road to follow."
"We all have our own experiences."
"Perhaps it would be an idea for the Commission to check what happened with the human resources funding in Romania, as part of the PHARE programme."
"If you look at the composition of the Romanian parliament and government now, you will find a large number of young politicians who were initially given assistance in their capacity of members of unions or associations and now hold important political offices and also form part of the Romanian political elite."
"That is an example we can only look at on the basis of own experience."
"But we believe there must be other means of making the successes, which PHARE has certainly had, more visible in the long term, both for the Commission, which has to build on them, and for the European Parliament, which must monitor this expenditure more efficiently."
"Mr President, I share the opinion of Mr Wiersma and Mr Swoboda regarding holding a debate on such an important subject at such an hour."
"It is indeed a pity."
"The European leaders at the Amsterdam Summit did not succeed in reconstructing the European house so that it can accommodate more people without us falling through the floor."
"This makes the PHARE programme all the more important in protecting Europe's stability."
"Unfortunately, we must now draw the same conclusions as earlier in the evening in connection with the Structural Funds."
"The money is there, but not enough is being spent."
"In this case there is the possible excuse that the programme was originally technical in nature and had to quickly deal with a wide range of matters at various levels in society without the criteria being really clear."
"It is too wide ranging and insufficiently targeted."
"The rapporteur, Mr Wiersma, has submitted a good analysis of the situation, together with particularly pertinent recommendations."
"He first speaks of the need to arrive at a new strategy."
"To that I can give my support."
"There are certain priorities, such as promoting democracy, the observance of human rights, nuclear safety and environmental management."
"Also positive is the encouragement of cross-border cooperation which can promote stability in the region and the status quo."
"Regarding project implementation I would, however, like to see a greater increase in staff levels among the people who must implement them here as opposed to increasing the members of NGOs, and preferably more cofinancing with the governments in the respective countries."
"This would be a genuine bottom-up approach."
"In order to allow these countries to switch to our market system, PHARE should promote legislation providing for supervision of the banks and financial system because, Mr President, we all know that money laundering has also become very widespread in Central and Eastern Europe."
"Finally, our own house is not ready for the new members."
"But let us in any event lend the new inhabitants the right assistance to set their house in order, assistance which is better targeted than before."
"Mr Wiersma's report provides an accurate picture of the present situation and an excellent basis on which to conduct policy."
"I congratulate him on this and hope that the follow-up to this report can be discussed in Parliament on another occasion when more of Europe's representatives are present."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too must congratulate Mr Wiersma on his excellent report."
"This report could not be more clear."
"I therefore hope that the Commission - although Mr Van den Broek is not here to represent it - will take note of all the criticisms it contains."
"For how can we judge whether or not European funds are being efficiently spent if there are no criteria by which they can be tested?"
"I was recently with a delegation in the Czech Republic where I was asked whether the PHARE programme was primarily an employment scheme for Western consultants."
"The PHARE programme has slowly changed and grown from a programme for technical assistance into a programme to support the accession of Central and Eastern European countries."
"What does this mean for PHARE and future priorities?"
"First of all, it must mean improved infrastructure in these countries in the fields of transport, telecommunications, energy, know-how, and also - as Mrs Van Bladel has already said - in the banking sector, which is very important."
"In fact, investment is not possible without it."
"A second point is to reinforce the legal and institutional framework and assistance in areas where the Union is placing greater emphasis, such as free competition, the environment, nuclear safety and a favourable climate for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"This brings other demands for project support, both from the Commission and from the local authorities in Central and Eastern Europe."
"The Commission must make its procedures simpler and more transparent."
"But the Eastern European authorities must also be quicker to reform their institutions and reduce bureaucracy so that there is no more under-spending."
"However, Western governments cannot meet Eastern Europe's major financial needs on their own."
"There is a also a need for much private financing."
"The banks are ready for this."
"There is a proposal for a new Marshall Plan and that must primarily come from the private banking sector."
"These private investors must be attracted and this requires a stimulating regulatory framework in these countries, combined with stability."
"The European Union can actively contribute to this through the PHARE programme."
"Conditions can be imposed on these countries which can also serve to increase financing from the private sector."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too must thank the rapporteur for drawing up such a good report."
"I am especially glad that he has included many suggestions by colleagues and has had lengthy consultations with the various committees, which makes this an exceptional report, the like of which we have not seen before in this Parliament in connection with the PHARE programme."
"The efforts involved in the process of transformation in these countries need special support in areas where the problems are greatest, and we fully endorse that article."
"However, the situation is that PHARE alone is not enough to support the integration process of the Central and Eastern European countries prior to accession to the European Union."
"That is why it is so important to consider new ideas for a support programme worthy of the accession strategy, directed far more to the structural funds than to PHARE, because PHARE does not match up to an accession strategy in terms of funding available, range of support measures or procedures, which is why it cannot fund the aims in question."
"It is worth considering whether we should not even at this early stage use one or other of the structural funds for the Central and Eastern European countries that want to join the EU."
"Madam President, Mr Wiersma has written a clear analysis of the shortcomings in implementing the PHARE programme, namely under-spending, the major role of expensive consultants and external experts, and an insufficient evaluation of the results achieved through PHARE."
"In the meantime, the Commission has already taken on board a large part of these criticisms in the new PHARE guidelines which were drawn up in March."
"Future projects must be more in keeping with the pre-accession strategy."
"This means that the Commission will have a louder voice in determining the fund's objectives."
"More attention will be paid to the development of infrastructure and industry and to bringing the internal legislation of Central and Eastern European countries into line with that of the European Union."
"In the framework of the pre-accession strategy, priority must also be awarded to the creation of civil society."
"A society with efficient and democratic institutions which can count on sufficient popular support."
"Commissioner Van den Broek is aware of our concerns for the position of religious minorities in various Central and Eastern European countries."
"Through support for democratization PHARE will also promote the integration of these religious minorities."
"Finally, during a recent visit to East Germany by a delegation of the Committee on External Economic Relations, of which I was a member, it became clear just how important it is for the PHARE programme to be also applied to cross-border cooperation."
"For example, by combining PHARE with the INTERREG programme it is possible to prevent projects stopping at the border and thus being less effective."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in his excellent report Mr Wiersma has rightly identified the inadequacies of the PHARE programme to date and I agree with him when he calls, among other things, for the backlog to be reduced between commitment and payment appropriations and for more money to be concentrated on those countries that are lagging behind in the economic reform process."
"Also, I very much regret that evaluation has proved so inadequate up to now."
"I consider that unacceptable."
"I also regret the fact that the Commissioner responsible could not attend today."
"In future the PHARE programme will acquire a new role with the accession to the EU of the Central and Eastern European countries."
"So it is urgent to set new emphases and priorities within the programme."
"I hope that will also enable us to remedy some of the well-known inadequacies."
"I believe that with the adjustment of the support measures we should aim at giving the European Commission more say in the selection of programme priorities and projects in future, giving precedence to building up administrative structures and investments."
"The funds must be concentrated and spent more efficiently."
"Let me address one particular point on the basis of personal experience."
"In my view we should give more precedence to training measures, compared also with what the Commission has proposed in the past."
"As past experience shows, initial and further vocational training will play a quite central role in the accession process as a means of stimulating structural reform in the first place."
"So the same value must be attached to training people in these countries as to investment in physical assets."
"It is simply not good enough just to carry out company reforms under the fashionable heading of management training."
"The firms themselves must be involved far more in initial and further training at all levels, especially the non-professional level."
"I would ask you to take note of that."
"To achieve this we need to build up a network of committed multipliers for partnerships with Western European players."
"Investment in this area will create reliable partners for serious projects and have a knock-on effect that may be more important than any investment in physical assets."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Interparliamentary Relations between the European Parliament and the Slovak Parliament met last week."
"At that meeting we and the Slovak parliament noted that the Commission had done very good work there."
"The Amsterdam summit drew to an end at about the same time and finally decided that Slovakia would probably not be included in the first round of candidates for accession."
"We felt that excellent concessions were in fact made during our talks with the Slovak parliament, in relation to electoral law and consideration of minority groups, i.e., linguistic minority groups, all of which was to be achieved by the end of November, that means very quickly indeed."
"I believe that the PHARE programme created the necessary basis for this and that the moves towards accession have been very successful."
"The decentralized implementing system has proven itself and the delegations have also done good work, given that they include many experts who have worked together very well with the people in the Member States."
"But I also think it is important to involve the SMEs in this process, simply because contacts between people and personal experiences are very important."
"Let me also ask the Commission to introduce more educational measures in this field, to monitor expenditure and perhaps also to make the award of contracts and the evaluation more transparent."
"I also believe that the interparliamentary delegations can support all this very successfully, perhaps also the monitoring, an area where we could perhaps have closer cooperation in future."
"Madam President, the PHARE programme really is the most important European Union programme for bringing the Central and Eastern European countries closer to the European Union, which it has done with a great deal of real success so far, although there are still some serious shortfalls."
"Every year we in the Committee on Budgets discuss the difference between the commitment and payment appropriations in the programme and about its causes and results."
"Indeed we are in the process of doing so now."
"Of course there is a wide variety of causes."
"For one thing it is of course difficult to reach any judgment because of the lack of evaluation criteria; but even if we had them, we could not remove the causes of these shortfalls but only evaluate them better."
"In my personal experience, the PHARE programme is still too dependent on the national governments and on their at times very underdeveloped administrations, which means that we keep seeing regional partners drawing up and setting up wonderful projects and programmes, only for the central state then either not to approve them or to drag its feet."
"The participant Eastern European states also take very different approaches to the European Union's aid priorities."
"For instance, it is not very difficult to get an infrastructure project approved and running in Poland."
"But there is no desire at all there to develop a civil society, which means that hardly any money goes to this sector in Poland."
"The question is, of course, whether to leave it to the countries concerned to set the priorities or whether to decentralize the decision-taking more and involve the regions more closely in deciding the programmes."
"The Committee on Budgets has never wanted to cut the PHARE programme appropriations."
"But that is no reason for us to go on pushing the ECU 3 000 m along in front of us like a mountain."
"One point I would make in the light of the forthcoming negotiations on enlargement is that I believe we should consider how to make the PHARE programme more efficient."
"Mr Wiersma's report offers a number of suggestions."
"Some of them are feasible, such as the cross-border cooperation programme."
"Only, after all these years of talk, we should finally implement it!"
"Madam President, basically this is a welcome report because it clearly and plainly shows up the superficial and insubstantial nature of the Commission's reports, or rather of the two reports."
"In the rapporteur's view, these Commission reports do little more than sum up the projects that have been executed in those two years."
"I can only agree with him entirely."
"No concrete targets are set out."
"General objectives, such as transfers of technology, are of no use to effective evaluations of efficiency."
"So we have no results that can be monitored and accordingly no way of evaluating the programmes."
"Merely to describe the money flows in no way justifies the actual utilization of resources."
"The Court of Auditors has also noted the poor monitoring and execution of the programmes for some years now."
"It has referred to the need to rationalize their execution."
"It has referred to the lack of clarity in the utilization of the resources."
"It has referred to problems of coordination in applying the system."
"It has also referred to conflicts of interest between the players involved and, lastly, to the restricted invitations to tender."
"These inconsistencies criticized by the Court of Auditors must be remedied at once and in full, before we can discuss a possible increase in resources."
"Since we all know that only about half of the ECU 6 600 m made available in 1996 was used, there is in any case some doubt about the need to increase the capital injection yet again."
"What we need immediately is a clear definition of objectives, efficiency, transparency and a new, diversified support strategy."
"What we also need is more co-financing projects so that the Central and Eastern European countries can identify more closely with the projects concerned."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to give Mr Wiersma very warm thanks for his comprehensive report."
"Mr Hans van den Broek is presently at a Council meeting in Luxembourg, so I must apologize for his absence and ask you to accept making do with me instead."
"However, I can assure you that I will report back to Hans van den Broek on the debate and that I will also try to respond to the suggestions about linking INTERREG and PHARE projects within the framework of my responsibilities."
"PHARE is indeed the European Union's main instrument of cooperation with the Central and Eastern European countries while at the same time representing the most comprehensive international support project for these countries."
"We all agree that the PHARE programme must now be directed at and concentrated on preparing the partner states for accession to the EU."
"The Commission is aware of the weak points."
"On 19 March it therefore decided on new PHARE programme pre-accession guidelines."
"These general guidelines were forwarded to Parliament and the Council and we are pleased that the reactions were on the whole positive."
"The Commission agrees with many of the points Mr Wiersma made in his report."
"Two new priorities are provided for in the new guidelines: assistance for the administrative improvements needed prior to adopting the acquis communautaire , a point which was made by many speakers, and financing the necessary investment."
"In this sense we are responding to two of the rapporteur's main recommendations."
"More importance will be attached to investment and we will seek closer coordination and cooperation with the international financial institutions."
"In improving the cooperation with public authorities in the partner countries we also want to try to reduce the reliance on consultants."
"Apart from these priorities, we are also concerned with developing the civil society and strengthening democracy."
"We will continue to pay great attention to promoting and establishing democracy."
"The new guidelines also provide for a reform of programme management, including simplified planning and execution reports, together with greater decentralization and the transfer of monitoring tasks to the EU delegations."
"The list of measures includes a considerable reduction in the number of programme management bodies, integrating the programme more closely in the activities of the partner country's authorities, a thorough examination of the on-going programmes with a view to speeding up their implementation, reducing the financial backlog and a thorough revision of the handbook on the decentralized execution of the PHARE programme."
"Mr Wiersma, in your report you ask whether in future PHARE should concentrate more money on the countries that are lagging behind in the economic reform process."
"The Commission will look into this question in the context of the Santer package it will be putting to Parliament on 16 July."
"On the question of evaluation, to which Parliament rightly attaches very great importance, in 1995 the Commission introduced a new monitoring and evaluation system."
"Moreover, in line with the SEM 2000 principles on economic and efficient budgeting, the Commission has set up an independent evaluation body."
"This body will go beyond the existing ad hoc evaluations and be able to measure the global effects of the programmes more accurately."
"We will shortly complete a detailed interim evaluation of the PHARE programme, which we will forward to Parliament before the end of this month, and I hope that will give you a better basis for assessment because it is based on more than 80 evaluations carried out so far."
"We hope to see a critical and constructive dialogue with Parliament on the findings of the interim evaluation and will keep Members regularly informed of progress in this area."
"Lastly, let me turn to the PHARE programme on cross-border cooperation."
"As the rapporteur pointed out, priority should be given to supporting projects that aim at reinforcing democracy, respect for human rights and stability, together with social and economic integration."
"I welcome Mr Wiersma's suggestions here."
"When we implement the new guidelines for the PHARE programme we will pay serious attention to the aspect of cross-border cooperation."
"At the same time I would point out that cross-border cooperation is already being strengthened by the closer links between INTERREG 2a and 2c with PHARE in terms of both content and finance."
"Let me make it quite plain that this is a question of infrastructural and regional development."
"Let me also make it clear yet again that the review of PHARE does in fact involve increasing investment funds from 25 % to 70 % and increasing the TEN budget, which means we will be making some headway in this area too, even if it does not mean we can finance all the dream projects or all the necessary projects."
"Thank you for the debate and for your ideas."
"You may take it that we will seriously consider their practical implementation because we are just as keen as you to ensure that the PHARE programme is successful and makes a real contribution to simplifying the pre-accession strategy."
"Did I understand you correctly, Mrs Wulf-Mathies?"
"Did you say this document would be available by the end of the month, that is to say by Monday?"
"(Mrs Wulf-Mathies confirmed this.) The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m.)"
"Mr President, I have a point of order."
"At the sitting of 12 May, I asked you about the procedure for a call for tenders, and you told me that it was not a question for the plenary and that I should submit it in writing, which I did the same day."
"More than six weeks have now elapsed, almost seven, in fact, so we are well past the deadline."
"I raised the question again in Strasbourg and you have still not replied, so I should be grateful to have an answer from you today."
"Thank you, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel."
"The answer to your question is being prepared."
"As you know, answers must be approved by the Bureau."
"The answer to your question will be put before the Bureau at the earliest possible opportunity."
"I hope that will be on 10 July and that you will have the answer before the next Strasbourg part-session."
"Welcome"
"A delegation of members from the group of the Flemish Christian-Democrat Party (CVP) in the Belgian Chamber of Representatives have taken their seats in the official gallery."
"I should like, on behalf of the Parliament, to welcome them, as I welcome this further instance of collaboration between parliaments."
"European Council of 16/17 June - Dutch Presidency"
"The next item on the agenda is the joint debate on:"
"a report by the Council and a statement by the Commission on the European Council of 16/17 June in Amsterdam; -the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council on the activities of the Dutch Presidency."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to be here today to report on the outcome of the Amsterdam European Council and on the action we have taken during our presidency to develop the main items on the agenda which we discussed with you six months ago."
"And there is more for me to talk about than just the Amsterdam summit, however important a milestone that was."
"Our task during this presidency was to tackle the two main challenges facing Europe as it enters the next millennium: the introduction on schedule of a strong economic and monetary union and the enlargement of the European Union."
"There was also another reason why the Maastricht Treaty needed to be adapted."
"The European Union is a union of and for its citizens, and their expectations and concerns also lay at the heart of the discussions concluded at Amsterdam."
"I would sum up the results of the Amsterdam European Council as follows: we took a positive step towards attaining a Europe which looks after its people, its market, its currency and its environment, and an irreversible step towards the undivided Europe for which new and unparalleled opportunities were created in 1989."
"In addition to the preparations for Amsterdam, there were many other internal and external issues which needed to be dealt with and which we were glad to take in hand."
"We could not have been an effective presidency without the excellent teamwork which we enjoyed with all of our partners in the European integration process, including, first and foremost, the European Parliament."
"The considerable and very active contribution which you made to the preparations for the Amsterdam Treaty helped to establish it on firm foundations."
"We also enjoyed excellent cooperation with the European Commission, and the constructive and intensive support we received from the Council Secretariat also deserves a special mention."
"And of course, all presidencies depend to a large extent on what their predecessors have bequeathed them."
"In our case the Irish, carrying on from Italy, gave us an extremely solid basis in the form of the Dublin II draft treaty on which we were able to build."
"With your permission, I shall look in a little more detail at the results of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Certain aspects of the text to be signed in October are not exactly as the Dutch presidency would have wished, but I think that all in all there is no reason to be dissatisfied with what we have achieved, and I am delighted that, in many respects, this Treaty represents progress towards a better, more democratic, decisive and, in particular, more human Europe."
"There are a number of points I wish to emphasize here."
"Broadly speaking, the quality of European administration has been improved both institutionally and materially in the form of new, policy-reinforcing articles in the Treaty."
"The key words here are democracy and transparency."
"I would point out that the legislative role of the European Parliament has been substantially strengthened in three ways."
"Firstly, the cooperation procedure which was so unsatisfactory from the democracy point of view has been almost entirely abandoned and - except in EMU - replaced by codecision."
"From now on, the European Parliament and the Council will be genuine co-legislators on EC legislation, on an entirely equal footing."
"Secondly, the codecision procedure has been considerably simplified, mainly by abolishing the third reading which Parliament so abhorred."
"And thirdly, the codecision procedure applies for most of the new 'Amsterdam' provisions in the Treaty."
"Parliament's role in the area previously covered by the third pillar has also been stepped up."
"We are now moving towards the communitization of the free movement of persons, an area in which Parliament has not played a very significant role up to now."
"In the new Treaty, however, things are set to change, in that Parliament is given formal consultation rights and the right to adequate information."
"It also retains its existing budgetary rights."
"The idea of 'transparent government' is also finally taking shape at European level, first of all by streamlining the decision-making procedures, as I have already mentioned, and secondly by making the Treaties rather more accessible to the layman."
"A number of obsolete provisions are to be abolished, and a readable, consolidated text of the Treaty is to be issued as soon as possible after the IGC."
"In particular, transparency is to be achieved by providing information for the general public and access to the institutions' documents."
"This principle is set out in the Treaty and is to be developed in detail by the institutions in codecision."
"These are issues that directly affect the man in the street as a worker, consumer and someone who benefits from a better environment."
"The EC is to play a stronger role in a number of important areas of policy."
"First and foremost here is the decision to incorporate the Agreement on Social Policy into the Treaty, which rectifies an anomaly from the past and creates a firm basis for socio-economic development in Europe."
"But there is more to it than just that: the Treaty has actually been strengthened in a number of areas."
"There is the new basis for Union action in the fields of non-discrimination and equal treatment for men and women, and there are the provisions on combating social exclusion and the reference to fundamental socio-economic rights."
"Leading on from this, I would draw your attention in particular to the prominence given to policy on employment. The Union's soaring levels of unemployment are the most difficult social and economic problem facing Europe."
"The Treaty now contains a new Title which provides a basis for the Union to take action to boost and supplement the Member States' own policies, and together the Member States and the Union are sure to be able to pursue a more effective and, above all, a coordinated policy."
"There are recommendations on how individual Member States can be more effective in this field, and there is also provision for measures to stimulate employment while still meeting budgetary requirements."
"I shall return to this in a moment."
"I have already mentioned the communitization of the free movement of persons."
"The presidency had hoped for a quicker and more unconditional approach, but here again we have to count our blessings."
"This time at least - unlike at Maastricht - we were able to effect the transfer to the EC pillar, bringing a number of immediate advantages such as the use of EC instruments, the publication of proposals, a stronger role for the Court of Justice, Parliament and the Commission, and the reinstatement of the four freedoms on an equal footing."
"There are also some indirect advantages, however, in that there is scope for further development in future. The Schengen acquis has also been incorporated, establishing a basis for this highly successful form of intra-Union cooperation to continue."
"The Treaty now makes a number of provisions for progress in the field of foreign and security policy."
"It avoids radical communitization, offering instead improvements in three areas: firstly, better policy preparation; secondly, decision-making; and thirdly, clear implementation."
"Policy preparation is to be improved and given greater depth through the setting-up of a planning and analysis unit."
"Decision-making on CFSP matters is to be streamlined by introducing the possibility of constructive abstention and of majority decisions under certain conditions."
"And the appointment of a High Representative for the CFSP should help to strengthen implementation."
"On the CFSP budget, I should finally like to say how pleased I am with the interinstitutional agreement concluded with Parliament, and I am most grateful to you, Mr President, and to the Members most involved."
"The agreement forms an excellent basis for fruitful cooperation between Council and Parliament."
"On the important subject of institutional reform, I would draw your attention to the reforms decided for the Commission."
"The Commission President is to be given a stronger position and his appointment is to be subject to Parliament's approval."
"He will be able to appoint his Commissioners in agreement with the Member States, and to set out guidelines for them during their term of office."
"I regret the fact that the IGC was not able to reach a clear decision on the future weighting of votes in the Council vis-Ã -vis the composition of the Commission, on which a number of questions of principle have already been decided."
"A number of important decisions on vote weighting in the Council are now going to have to be taken before the next enlargement."
"On the subject of institutional matters, the Court of Auditors has been given greater powers to combat fraud, and to enable the institutions and the Member States to manage the Community's finances better."
"The Court of Justice too is given greater powers, including the possibility of examining whether the actions taken by the institutions are consistent with basic rights."
"One final word on increased cooperation and flexibility."
"I think we have struck the right balance here."
"On the one hand, establishing the principle of using the qualified majority means that we can have efficient decision-making, whilst on the other there are sufficient guarantees built into the procedure to prevent its excessive use."
"The EC pillar gives the Commission a central deciding role in terms of flexibility, and that is as it should be: the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties, and this principle is the cornerstone of the Community's legal system."
"All in all, I have the impression that Amsterdam has given us a review of the Treaty on European Union which, despite the concessions made on the original aims, has been worthwhile in every sense."
"The main preparations for economic and monetary union have now been concluded."
"We now have the Pact on Stability and Growth, together with agreement on the EMS II exchange rate system which is to apply from the third stage and on the legal framework for the euro - genuinely vital steps towards the introduction of EMU on 1 January 1999."
"There are many practicalities which are still to be settled, and it is important that clear information should be provided, but on the basis of the decisions taken and in view of the major efforts being made to achieve genuine convergence, I have every confidence that we are well on the way to introducing a stable euro on schedule."
"The single currency is extremely important, but it is not, of course, an end in itself."
"EMU is all about the links between people, currency and market, and we were able to reach some important decisions on this point in Amsterdam by adopting a resolution on growth and employment alongside the Pact on Stability and Growth."
"An efficiently functioning internal market and a healthy macroeconomic climate are essential conditions for generating employment, and the single currency and the single market are both crucial here."
"However, this also has to be seen in the context of finding an even balance between a monetary Europe, an economic Europe and a social Europe."
"The need to find this balance lay at the heart of the decisions that we took at Amsterdam."
"The Member States are to continue to bear the main responsibility for employment policy, but they could learn much more from each other and also work better with one another."
"Europe too, through a healthy monetary and macroeconomic policy, could give a more effective push towards creating employment, not by simply providing more money, but by encouraging Member States to make better use of some of the existing instruments and, as I have said, to listen to each other, learn from each other and work together."
"Altogether, the new employment chapter in the Treaty, the resolution on employment and growth, and the establishment of a genuine social policy at European level ought to form a useful complement to EMU."
"Besides the Intergovernmental Conference and EMU, preparations for the enlargement of the Union to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean formed a major part of our agenda."
"This enlargement needs to be well prepared, not just by the countries concerned but also by ourselves."
"We need to build bridges between the countries and people who are to help shape our undivided Europe, and we have tried to do this by ensuring that our structured dialogue with the applicant countries covers as many substantive issues as possible."
"In order to focus attention, each meeting dealt with only one or two subjects selected in close consultation with the Commission and after discussion with the applicant countries, and in this way we have been able to secure a genuine exchange of views on a wide range of topics, from preparations for the single market to the constitutional state."
"We have also been able to discuss things more freely and in greater depth."
"We feel that holding substantive talks with the applicant countries is important not just for the technical aspects of accession, but also, in certain cases, for strengthening popular support in the countries concerned, and we have the impression that our association partners appreciate this approach."
"At our meeting with the applicant countries tomorrow, we shall be informing them about the outcome of the Amsterdam summit and at the same time boosting their confidence in our future together in an undivided Europe."
"The efficient operation of the single market is still crucial for our competitiveness, economic growth and employment, and therefore for European integration in the broader sense, which was why we put this issue high on the agenda."
"Following discussions in the Single Market Council and ECOFIN, the Commission has drawn up an action plan with four strategic objectives: more effective rules, dealing with market distortions, abolishing sectoral barriers and ensuring that the single market offers more advantages for the man in the street."
"The European Council has given this action plan its full backing, and we hope that the legislative proposals relating to it will be adopted without difficulty."
"The concern to establish a better balance between the market and the environment continues to demand great efforts from us all, and this is why we are delighted that, as well as placing environment policy in general on a much firmer footing at European level, as in the Amsterdam Treaty, we have also been able to make significant progress in the policy we are currently pursuing."
"The presidency gave top priority to the problems of climate change, and the European Union has agreed a joint negotiating position for the global climate treaty to be concluded in Kyoto in December."
"We are to call for a 15 % reduction in the main greenhouse gases by the year 2010, and the Union has already started preparing measures to achieve this."
"Other important environmental measures taken over the last six months include the promotion of an integrated, sustainable water management system and the reduction of air-polluting emissions from road traffic."
"Major progress has also been made on the Union's internal security."
"The Dublin European Council had called for a comprehensive action plan against organized crime, with specific recommendations and a timetable, and a highlevel group set to work on this with great determination."
"The Amsterdam European Council was able to approve the group's report and has now given instructions for it to be put into practice."
"A wide range of measures to combat organized crime are now available: prevention measures, judicial instruments, improvements in practical cooperation, the extension of the remit of Europol, fiscal and financial aspects, and international cooperation."
"Progress has also been made on fighting the drugs trade, with the approval of an early warning system for synthetic drugs, and various forms of practical cooperation have been launched within the European Union and elsewhere."
"In this year against racism, we have succeeded in obtaining approval for the European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia, which is to be based in Vienna."
"I am very hopeful that the Centre will play an effective role in combating racist actions and mentality, and in fighting discrimination and exclusion and the human suffering that they cause."
"The Union's external policy was the focus of much of our attention, since the Union now maintains a wide range of increasingly varied and intensive relations on the international stage."
"It is also a fact that the links between politics and economics in international relations have become much more complicated."
"The presidency has done its best to promote the countless dialogues that the Union is pursuing with its various partners."
"I shall turn briefly now to a few of the important areas of external policy."
"The presidency sought to give a major new boost to transatlantic cooperation by producing practical short-term results to demonstrate the benefits of stepping up cooperation under the New Transatlantic Agenda, and by bringing about structural improvements to pave the way for further results in the longer term."
"The Union's summit with Russia strengthened and intensified cooperation."
"Political dialogue has been expanded and trade has shown a further increase recently, but the level of European investment in Russia is still too low because of the uncertain legal and economic climate."
"The European Council welcomed the new cooperation agreement between NATO and Russia as a vital contribution to a new European security structure."
"Yesterday there was an extremely useful and constructive meeting between the European Union and Japan, at which important agreements were reached on continuing dialogue in the areas of deregulation and distribution, amongst others."
"The presidency made great efforts to promote the Barcelona process, since it firmly believes that EuroMediterranean stability concerns everyone in the Union."
"A political Euro-Mediterranean conference was held on Malta on 15 and 16 April 1997 and demonstrated the importance which everyone attaches to the EuroMediterranean process."
"The political and security dialogue is to continue to be gradually developed."
"The options for setting up the Euro-Mediterranean free trade area scheduled for 2010 are to be studied in closer detail, and in the meantime work is to be done on making reciprocal trade easier and encouraging investment."
"Greater attention is to be given to the social, cultural and human aspects of cooperation, including human rights and the role of civil society."
"The Union has an important part to play in supporting the peace process in the Middle East."
"It has already played an active political role in cooperation with the US and in conjunction with its substantial economic assistance to the region, and this is to continue."
"I should like to express my appreciation for the excellent work done by Mr Moratinos, our special representative there."
"Relations between the Union and Turkey have been given fresh impetus following a number of developments during our presidency."
"At the informal General Affairs Council in Apeldoorn in March, particular attention was given to the development of our long-term relations with Turkey."
"The Association Council met on 29 April for the first time since October 1995."
"The setting-up of a committee of wise men to look into outstanding territorial differences between Ankara and Athens will, we hope, be able to make a constructive contribution to relations between Greece and Turkey and thus also to relations between Turkey and the Union, as well as towards finding a solution to the Cyprus problem."
"There have been further developments in relations between the Union and Cyprus in the form of agreements reached as part of a structured dialogue."
"The presidency's work on the Cyprus question focused on support for the UN, which is the body primarily responsible for finding a solution to the problem."
"Alongside the European Council's political assessment of events in the various countries of former Yugoslavia, as set out in the conclusions, I would draw attention to the coherent strategy that has been developed for the region."
"The presidency worked on developing a strategy for relations with all the countries of former Yugoslavia, except for Slovenia, which has a Europe Agreement."
"The result was a document setting out in detail the conditions under which the Union is prepared to strengthen its links with Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania."
"The Commission is to report regularly on whether the countries in question are complying with these conditions."
"We monitored the worrying developments in Albania very closely from the outset."
"When the crisis became widespread, the presidency helped the OSCE to set up a 'Coordinating Framework' led by former Chancellor Vranitzky."
"It is, of course, extremely important that the forthcoming elections - for which the Union is providing funding and observers - should clear the way to greater stability, with at least basic levels of democracy, plurality and readiness to reform."
"Mr President, I shall finish there."
"The European agenda, which is so often accused of being technocratic and cold, is actually directly determined by its immediate political environment, which is in turn heavily influenced by the political climate in the 15 Member States and the expectations and concerns of their citizens."
"There is increasing interaction between the 15 national political agendas and the Brussels agenda, and this very fact - that 'Europe' is clearly more prominent and is playing an increasingly important role in national elections, for example - presents a tremendous political challenge, not least for the presidency."
"And it was a challenge that we were happy to deal with on the way to Amsterdam."
"If we look at the slightly broader political context of the last six months, we feel that there is no reason to be dissatisfied, either with the results we have achieved or with the political will that has been shown to take Europe forward, step by step."
"And it has indeed been step by step, but they have at least been steps in the right direction."
"We hope that the results we have achieved have established a useful basis for the incoming Luxembourg presidency, and we wish Luxembourg every success."
"It can certainly count on our support."
"Thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council."
"I should like to pay public tribute now to the spirit of collaboration and the facilities which the Dutch Presidency has provided for this Parliament to work constructively within the framework of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"A special thank you."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council in Amsterdam marked a successful conclusion to the work of the Dutch presidency, to which I should like to pay earnest tribute for the energy, commitment and determination it has shown throughout these last six months."
"Since Maastricht, my priority has been to bring the European Union closer to the citizen."
"The Amsterdam Council did the necessary."
"Its conclusions on employment, on freedom, security and justice and on the environment, and the Treaty of Amsterdam, show that the public's concerns feature on our agendas."
"Those conclusions also show that we have embarked on a new stage in Community history."
"For that very reason, any additional step is difficult: we find ourselves treading on the most sensitive matters."
"Our progress is slow, I grant you, but progress it is."
"That is the great thing."
"Let me start with employment, the main concern of our citizens."
"It has been at the very centre of discussion, both at the Intergovernmental Conference, to which I shall return in due course, and at most of the discussions on other subjects between the Heads of State and Government."
"By laying down the final technical preparations, the European Council has given the final green light to the launch of the single currency on 1 January 1999, while improving the co-ordination of economic policies for the benefit of employment."
"The Member States have clearly confirmed their determination to go ahead with the euro under the conditions laid down."
"We all know now what the common side of the coins is going to look like: the euro now has a face!"
"As you know, the Pact for Stability and Growth was adopted in its entirety."
"It is accompanied by two resolutions. The resolution on growth and employment makes employment the specific and operational centrepiece of the Union's priorities."
"Then we also have the new chapter on employment, which will be implemented ahead of time, and the strengthening of the social provisions of the Treaty."
"Between now and the extraordinary European Council under the Luxembourg presidency we must do everything possible to ensure that concrete action is taken to encourage the creation of jobs."
"It's all very well to talk about these things at summit level - but words have to be translated into actions."
"That is the battle this Commission has been fighting for more than two years, with the support of Parliament."
"I also welcome the encouraging signals sent out by the European Council for the completion of the internal market, whose effect on competitiveness, economic growth and employment is essential."
"The Commission will ensure that the four objectives of the action plan are put into effect efficiently, and on time."
"All our institutions must take action, each in its own field."
"Finally, I welcome the launch of some 90 regional pacts for employment, each of which will act as a laboratory for employment throughout the entire Union."
"Now, Mr President, I come to the Intergovernmental Conference."
"This is the third time I have been involved in a revision of the Treaty of Rome."
"All the meetings went on into the small hours."
"So the idea of working for 18 hours at a stretch is not, in itself, anything out of the ordinary."
"The negotiations themselves have never been easy, and I can tell you that they were particularly difficult - sometimes even frustrating - on this occasion."
"I several times felt there was a lack of political will and a worrying tendency to give priority to purely national viewpoints."
"There were also a few isolated attempts to cast doubt on the key elements of our Community system."
"I am very glad to say we were able to rebuff those attempts."
"Negotiating is one thing, but the results are another."
"Have we achieved the objectives we set ourselves when this Intergovernmental Conference began?"
"Have we succeeded in strengthening the Union so that its enlargement can take place under favourable conditions?"
"Two weeks ago I spoke to you on the basis of a presidency text that represented a compromise."
"As I saw it, that text combined ambition and realism."
"And I hoped that an additional effort would be made by the Heads of State and Government to strengthen and improve it."
"The fears I expressed in this House on 11 June, Mr President, have to some extent proved well founded."
"In some areas, the positions reached have been abandoned."
"And what can I say about the proliferation of protocols and declarations: 14 protocols and 46 declarations?"
"That must be a record, which does nothing to make the Treaty easier to read."
"But let us not lose sight of the main issues."
"By comparison with the Maastricht Treaty, important advances have been made."
"The final result is very much the same as the opinion that the Commission presented in February 1996, as a quick analysis of the results shows."
"One of our ambitions was to bring the Union closer to its citizens, enabling them to feel that their concerns are being taken into account and to give their support to the new Treaty when the time comes for the ratification procedures."
"The net result here is positive."
"The new Treaty, as the Commission and the European Parliament both wanted, communitizes much of the third pillar and incorporates the Schengen Accords."
"I would have liked to see the Heads of State and Government already moving in favour of qualified majority voting and the codecision procedure, instead of giving themselves time to think about it. I do of course recognize how sensitive these areas are."
"But, at the same time, I would say to those who are hesitant about moving to qualified majority voting that it is precisely because this area is so sensitive and crucial that the European Union must be able to take the necessary steps."
"I note with satisfaction that, at the end of the transition period, the normal rules of the Treaty will apply as regards the Commission's exclusive right of initiative."
"That is a very good thing."
"With regard to the incorporation of the effects of Schengen, I hope that - as the European Council wishes - the measures for implementing the protocol will be adopted as soon as possible."
"A solution has been found to the problems of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark."
"On the subject of employment, we have a new chapter and a legal basis for measures to stimulate it."
"The social protocol has been incorporated, and that is a considerable step forward."
"The new text also includes positive points on the principle of equal treatment for men and women and a legal basis for helping victims of social exclusion."
"The European Parliament will be involved in these decisions, which will be of particular concern to the citizen through the application of the codecision procedure."
"The strengthening of the provisions relating to health and consumer protection was not challenged at Amsterdam."
"I am particularly glad that the European Parliament has been closely associated with the adoption of the veterinary and plant health legislation."
"With regard to Article 100a(4), the new wording allows the Member States to do more to respond to public concern about environmental protection."
"We have, however, taken steps to avoid any risk of the fragmentation of the single market, by allocating the Commission a decisive role in the procedure."
"The strengthening of basic rights, the recognition of the role of services of general public interest, which is an essential component of our European model of society, and the tightening of measures to combat fraud are all positive points that can be welcomed."
"Next, a word about subsidiarity."
"The Commission has no problems with the actual content of the protocol that was adopted, because it has been acting along those lines since I first came to office."
"However, the principle of subsidiarity must not be used as a pretext to prevent Community action where Community action is essential."
"The Member States, incidentally, would be well advised to put their own houses in order, because we are being flooded with requests for proposals or studies in the widest variety of fields."
"To say nothing of the national red tape that makes life so difficult for small- and medium-sized enterprises within the Union."
"Our second ambition was to equip the Union with the instruments for a foreign and security policy worthy of the name."
"In this area, the text largely fulfils the Commission's hopes."
"The instruments have been clarified, and qualified majority voting has been introduced on a broad front."
"Of course, certain checks and balances remain - constructive abstention, appeal to important national interests. Everything will depend on the use made of them."
"The structures, too, have been improved: the Secretary-General of the Council acting as the supreme representative of the CFSP, the new troika, the think-tank."
"Everything will come down to a question of political will."
"In defence matters, on the other hand, I am sorry to say there has been no real breakthrough."
"Negotiations on trade policy have been especially difficult."
"Some Member States were unwilling to take a major step forward, for a variety of reasons which, I fear, reveal a degree of short-sightedness."
"Rather than allow the presidency's text to be watered down, I preferred to safeguard the future."
"I successfully urged the addition of an extra clause to the existing Article 113 allowing the Council, in response to a proposal by the Commission and after consultation with the European Parliament, to extend the provisions of that article to intellectual property and to services."
"I am convinced that, sooner or later, reason and consensus will prevail and that this clause will be used."
"I now come to the institutional issues which have aroused so much comment."
"Very important progress has been made in two areas of direct concern to the European Parliament."
"The first is the codecision procedure: a breakthrough has been made in the area of democratization, with a very broad extension of codecision, and simplification of the procedure which will put the joint legislators on an equal footing."
"I see this as a genuine sign of confidence in the institution that represents the citizens."
"There can be no doubt at all, then, that the European Parliament has emerged from this conference in a stronger position."
"The other matter is the threefold reinforcement of the role of the President of the Commission. Furthermore, the President designate will in future be formally approved by the European Parliament."
"By contrast, little has been achieved with regard to the extending of qualified majority voting."
"The presidency's package was ambitious, and I regret that the European Council felt unable to sustain that ambition."
"There are of course some bright spots - research and the CFSP, for example, and areas such as employment, social exclusion, equality between men and women, and health protection."
"But many other provisions have fallen by the wayside."
"That does not augur well for the enlargement of the Union, but I live in hope that we shall be able to find some other way through these difficulties before too long."
"A word about agreements on closer co-operation."
"They should enable those Member States which so desire to move forward, and become a very valuable instrument in an enlarged Europe."
"In the first pillar, that instrument will be activated by qualified majority voting in response to a Commission proposal, and I welcome that."
"Finally, I should mention the composition of the Commission and the new weighting of votes."
"As far as the Commission is concerned, the strengthening of the President's role is an extremely encouraging sign for its future activities."
"He will participate in the appointment of the other Commissioners, and his key role in defining the political guidelines will be enshrined in the Treaty."
"The declaration on the internal organization of our institution is also welcome."
"I have said on several occasions that we intend to undertake internal reforms, and we shall do so."
"The importance of the question of how many Commissioners there should be was probably exaggerated during the negotiations, though it is now accepted by all concerned that a certain number should not be exceeded."
"I found that the largest Member States were willing, subject to certain conditions, to give up their right to a second Commissioner."
"That will not come easily."
"An agreement is, of course, linked to the revised weighting of the votes."
"I have no doubt that a solution will be found here, but, to be frank, this matter is of more interest to the Member States than to the Commission and the European Parliament."
"I can accept the present weighting system."
"Ultimately, the solution adopted by the Heads of State and Government regarding the number of Commissioners is not so very different from the Commission's view."
"We have always felt that the number of Commissioners should be reduced to one per Member State, and that the conference should provide an appropriate procedure for changing the system if the number of Member States rises above twenty."
"The reduction in the number of Commissioners, when the time comes, will be based on a general compromise encompassing the reweighting of votes, which will have to come into force on the occasion of the first enlargement."
"Furthermore, a new Intergovernmental Conference will have to undertake a complete review of the composition and functioning of the institutions - and I mean the institutions, not just the Commission - one year before Union membership exceeds twenty."
"As far as the institutional package is concerned, we shall of course have to show stronger political will when the time comes."
"I don't want to see us compelled, on the very brink of enlargement, to say to future Member States, ' You have done everything possible to prepare for joining the Union, but unfortunately the Union has not been able to prepare to accept you.'"
"(Applause) Mr President, the next few years will be crucial for the future of the Union."
"In a few weeks' time the Commission will present its opinion on the candidate States."
"It will present its proposals for Agenda 2000: the future of our policies, including the Common Agricultural Policy and the Structural Funds, enlargement, the future financial framework."
"We will need determination and political will."
"Let us begin by bringing the Amsterdam Treaty to life and taking full advantage of all its potential."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you very much, Mr Santer."
"I call upon Mrs Green."
"Mr President, I want to begin by expressing my warm support for the efforts of the Dutch presidency over the past six months."
"Whatever our assessment of the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference, we recognize the vigour and rigour which Prime Minister Kok personally has brought to the process."
"My group would certainly want to put on record our thanks to the Prime Minister, his Foreign Minister Mr Van Mierlo and his European Minister Mr Patijn and also the other members of his government who have given this Parliament such firm support."
"It is our role here today to make an initial political response to the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"For my group this Treaty will be judged on two major issues."
"Firstly, does the Treaty respond to the aspirations, hopes and expectations of the peoples of the European Union?"
"Secondly, does the Treaty make the Union ready for enlargement to Cyprus, the Baltic States and Central and Eastern Europe?"
"I want to make it clear that my group recognizes and welcomes the advances which the Amsterdam Treaty has brought in dealing with a people's Europe."
"Firstly, we very much welcome the decision of the Council to put employment at the top of its agenda."
"My group supports the inclusion of the new title on employment and the social protocol into the Treaty as well as the reference to fundamental social rights."
"We recognize that words in a Treaty never created a single job."
"But we also recognize that the new competence allows us for the first time to create a framework in which the serious coordination of the economic and employment policies of the Member States can begin."
"This is surely what we can do at European level to ensure that the work being done by Member States to deal with the curse of unemployment is sustainable, ensuring that economic and employment policies across fifteen of the richest countries in the world working in close and careful harmony will make a huge contribution to growth and real job creation."
"Knowing as I do the President-in-Office's commitment to the fight against unemployment, I should like to turn to him with a message from the Socialist Group."
"If the Council was really serious about job creation, there is a real opportunity to prove it immediately."
"The Union's broad economic guidelines are yet to be fully adopted by the Council."
"There is a stated commitment in the resolution on growth and employment to ensure that employment is taken into greater account when establishing the broad economic guidelines."
"You will also know that the Finance Ministers meeting in ECOFIN have a reputation for completely ignoring the entreaties of the European Council."
"We need the Prime Ministers of the Member States to exercise their authority and insist that the broad economic guidelines are now revised."
"Nothing would give a stronger signal of good intention than that."
"Nothing would silence the cynics more quickly than that."
"And, President Santer, nothing would prove the political commitment of the European Commission more than if they insisted on such a revision."
"Such a move would also give a clear signal that the summit on employment to be held in October under the Luxembourg presidency had real political muscle behind it and was intended to come forward with concrete proposals, rather than the usual ritual blah blah."
"The promises on employment now need some flesh on their bones."
"The adoption of the broad economic guidelines offers the first opportunity and the employment summit offers the second."
"On behalf of my group I also want to recognize the other positive aspects of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"The acknowledgement of respect for human rights; the new no-discrimination clause, although it is such a pity that in the European Year against Racism and Xenophobia the Council could not adopt this competence with qualified majority voting; the clear step forward on equal opportunities, the environment, public health and consumer protection; the developments on transparency and openness and the reduction in the number of decision-making procedures and the stream-lining and extension of co-decision for the European Parliament."
"I understand that some governments are even now questioning the extended list of co-decision, arguing that decisions made by unanimity in the Council cannot be subject to co-decision with the European Parliament."
"Perhaps the Prime Minister could draw the attention of Member States to the existent powers on culture, Article 128 of the present Maastricht Treaty and the existing powers on research, Article 130 of the Maastricht Treaty, both of which grant co-decision with the European Parliament while acting unanimously in the Council."
"The Prime Minister will have the total support of this Parliament in insisting that the list of articles to be dealt with by codecision, as published in the draft Treaty of Amsterdam and now widely circulated, is sustained."
"My group are also deeply disappointed with progress on the second and third pillars of the Treaty."
"We have made it clear all along and have supported your efforts to communitarize some aspects of the justice and home affairs pillar."
"We respect the fact that some transfer has been made but I want to repeat the real anxiety we have about the lack of parliamentary control which now exists in these areas - crucial areas of immigration policy, visa controls and asylum."
"By retaining unanimity in the Council and only consulting the European Parliament, real democracy in these areas is thwarted."
"On the issue of common foreign and security policy, we always knew it was going to be difficult to make real progress, in particular on defence issues and my group is pleased that we are able to integrate the Petersberg tasks into the Treaty."
"But we remain concerned about the lack of a coherent foreign policy voice for Europe."
"We hear what the Treaty says about a Mr or Ms CFSP but with unanimity in the Council, how will Mr or Ms CFSP know with what voice to speak."
"Perhaps our greatest disappointment is with regard to enlargement."
"We have grave misgivings about the inability of the Council to agree on any meaningful extension of QMV."
"More than any other issue, this puts enlargement at risk."
"With even more Member States at the table in the coming years, how can we expect to see high standards being set in European legislation to protect the living and working condition of Europe's peoples."
"Therefore my group believes that it is vital that before enlargement the European Council must come together again to address the question of majority voting in the Council as well as the composition of the Commission and the weighting of votes."
"I conclude by saying that my group is firmly of the view that a Treaty which, despite our misgivings, has made steady progress on the agenda important to our peoples cannot be dismissed."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, first of all I should like to congratulate Mr Kok and his colleagues most warmly on the excellent work they have done."
"The Amsterdam summit was certainly a great success for the euro, and we hope that the last obstacles have now been removed."
"I think that forces could now be generated by the euro that will give Europe fresh impetus."
"Amsterdam was able to achieve what we could not do at Maastricht, firstly with the social protocol - and here I hope the UK will apply the European legislation that has since been adopted - and also in making employment one of the European Union's main objectives."
"Ten years ago when we held the presidency, we tried to achieve a social dimension through consultations between the European social partners, European collective agreements and giving the Community a social focus."
"We wasted a great deal of time."
"But Europe needs to have a social and a human face, and we must be able to provide answers to the problems which exist in society, including above all unemployment."
"We hope that the Luxembourg summit will indeed produce some useful results here."
"The European Union has obviously learnt its lesson from mad cow disease, and Community policy on the environment, public health and consumer protection has been greatly tightened."
"There has been a real breakthrough in the protection of human rights, with the establishment of equal treatment for men and women, the fight against social exclusion and a ban on discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, for example."
"The protocols and declarations on the abolition of the death penalty and on voluntary work as an expression of social solidarity are extremely important."
"The establishment of the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice is an extremely high priority for the people of Europe."
"The Heads of Government evidently thought that intergovernmental cooperation was unlikely to produce efficient solutions here, since they have communitized the free movement of persons, asylum and immigration."
"However, this decision will not be applied automatically, and unanimity will be required for five more years before the Council can take majority decisions and the European Parliament is given the power of codecision."
"We are delighted that Europol is to start operating on schedule and that the Schengen acquis is to be incorporated into the Treaty."
"The regulations are extremely complex, however, especially the protocols with the UK, Denmark and Ireland allowing these countries to remain on the sidelines when it comes to freedom of movement."
"Progress on the common foreign and security policy was much more limited, and we hope that constructive abstention will make decision-making easier."
"The Petersberg missions and the policy planning and early warning unit which can be set up under the Treaty have been ratified, and the high representatives are a good idea."
"However, it has again proved impossible to integrate the WEU into the European Union or to expand our trade policy further."
"Before Amsterdam, people said that the European Parliament would be the big loser, but the opposite seems to be true."
"Our observer, Mr Brok, calculates that Parliament's codecision has been extended from 15 to 38 fields, an increase of 23, and the assent procedure from 8 to 11."
"Can the President-in-Office confirm this, particularly for those areas where the Council is to continue to decide unanimously and where Parliament is to keep its powers of codecision, as indicated in the official document we have been given?"
"The codecision procedure has also been drastically simplified in a series of very welcome reforms."
"I should like to pay tribute to the President of the European Parliament and our two observers for the decisive role which they have played here."
"However, the European Parliament must also face up to its responsibilities."
"Against all expectations, Parliament is now able to decide on the statute of its Members for itself."
"This is a major challenge for the House, and one which I hope we can bring to a successful conclusion within the lifetime of this parliament, by which time we must stamp out all abuses."
"The Council will be required to approve the statute unanimously, so we shall see then whether it intends to give Parliament the means to do its job in a credible way."
"The reforms at the Commission, with the new political role for the President, are a very positive development."
"The conclusion reached by the PPE Group is that Amsterdam has been a continuation of the major reforms that we have seen over the last 15 years since the Stuttgart Declaration in 1983, on the single market, economic and monetary union, the single currency and political union."
"Substantial progress has again been made, and we therefore support the Amsterdam Treaty."
"However, we also note that there is one crucial problem that has again been postponed."
"Over the next few years, the European Union must accept its historic responsibility by bringing democratic countries on the European continent into the Union."
"It cannot do this without institutional reform, and in particular without qualified majority decisions in the Council."
"This is why we have pointed out in our resolution that issues which need to be settled before new members are admitted to the Union have been totally ignored."
"Without these reforms, the Union will lose momentum, and if it is deprived of strength and coherence, I fear it will collapse under the weight of its historic mission to enlarge."
"Despite the very laudable results which this presidency has achieved, we cannot ignore the fact that there is one crucial question that remains to be answered."
"It is a question I have often asked myself when I have read the statements made by various prime ministers after the European Council, all claiming to have protected their national interests."
"Mrs Thatcher used to do this."
"Whenever she went back to the Commons, she would always say she had protected the national interest."
"But the great question is, who is defending the common interest? Who is defending Europe's interests?"
"Helmut Kohl has been doing that, and for many years."
"(Applause) Belgium's prime minister has been doing so, as have you, Mr Kok."
"This is the new spirit we need to generate, otherwise I fear that our historic mission to unite all the democratic countries of Europe within the Union will be too onerous, if we do not have sound, coherent structures and the political will to create a genuine Union rather than just a free trade zone, a genuine Union that has a role to play in the world."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the efforts made by the Dutch presidency, to which we pay tribute, the results of the Amsterdam summit seem seriously inadequate from the strictly institutional viewpoint, if we compare them with the ambitious objectives announced by the Member States when the Intergovernmental Conference was launched."
"The simple fact of the matter is that the plan to reform the institutions, so as to increase their efficiency and transparency, has been put off. This applies both to the idea of extending qualified majority voting, impossible without revising the weightings to take account of the demographic and economic importance of the Member States, and as regards reforming the structure of the Commission to enable it to play the full part assigned to it by the Treaties while at the same time safeguarding the legitimate rights of smaller States, which are full Members of the Union."
"As for the CFSP, the handful of useful adjustments made to the existing provisions, in order to reflect the lessons of experience, show no signs of any genuine political will on the part of the Member States to equip the Union with the institutions and procedures that would enable it to take an active part on the international stage worthy of its economic importance."
"We can only deplore this failure to live up to the high hopes vested in Europe by many third countries which are finding it harder and harder to tolerate the rule of a single world superpower."
"This impression of unfinished business given by the IGC's conclusions has served to obscure the significant and substantial advances achieved elsewhere."
"The inclusion of the Social Protocol and the chapter on employment in the Treaty, and especially the incorporation of Schengen into Community legislation, represent quite significant steps forward which must be welcomed as such."
"They emphasize, as if such emphasis were necessary, the value of the formula for closer co-operation now recognized in the Treaty which has recently enabled progress to be made by circumventing the obstacle of the unanimity rule."
"We also welcome the simplification of the legislative procedure implemented by the European Parliament, the inclusion in the Treaty of a legal basis paving the way to progress with regard to the status of European Members of Parliament and a uniform electoral procedure."
"In this context, Mr President, may I offer you my very warm congratulations on the crucial part that you played in this matter."
"In conclusion, Amsterdam is not the finished work that we might have hoped for at Turin, but it is a quite significant step along the long and difficult road to European political unification."
"It may be that the wager that seems to have been made on the single currency being a powerful force for political integration is a risky one, the difficult discussions on the implementation of a common policy for growth and employment having shown the limitations of the exercise."
"From the start, Europe has faced a choice between being a mere free trade area, with or without a single currency, and a genuine union of independent States, determined to make their voice heard in world affairs instead of muttering almost inaudibly as they did in Denver."
"Let us commit ourselves to ensuring that, in the further course of events, the challenges of globalization and the organization of our planet into large regional groupings capable of guaranteeing growth and full employment will show us the right course to set for Europe."
"Mr President, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of Communism marked a turningpoint in the history of Europe and the start of a new phase of development for the European Union."
"The Union's goal is no longer the integration of Western Europe: since 1989, our main raison d'Ãªtre has been the integration of both Eastern and Western Europe, bringing together all the nations who wish to share their destiny within a single legal framework."
"The Union can only complete this historic task if it is strong enough to bear its weight."
"The more Member States there are, the greater will be the disparity of interests within the Union."
"This means that we need to strengthen the Union before we enlarge it, and the Amsterdam summit certainly helped to do that."
"The most important advance in European integration since 1957, the introduction of the euro, has been brought a step nearer with the establishment of the stability pact and France's express support for a sound and therefore strict budget policy."
"However, I am still concerned regarding monetary union."
"Countries such as Germany, France and Italy still need at least another five years to reorganize their finances on a sustainable basis and to increase their competitiveness, but they are not doing enough to win the public's support for their policies."
"If the three largest Member States cannot meet the criteria on a sustainable basis, the European Central Bank will have no choice but to increase interest rates, causing enormous political damage for the Union."
"Ireland and the Netherlands have shown that reducing government deficits and increasing employment can go hand in hand: Germany, France and Italy ought to follow their example."
"Otherwise, I fear that the euro could become a divisive rather than a uniting factor."
"Another of the tasks of the Amsterdam summit was to strengthen the Union institutionally, and I welcome the fact that the Amsterdam Treaty has extended the legal nature of the Union."
"The new provisions on human rights, equal treatment for men and women, non-discrimination and wider powers for the Court of Justice are all significant improvements."
"The legislative powers of the European Parliament have again been strengthened, and I should like to thank Mr Brok, Mrs Guigou and particularly Mr Kok for their personal efforts here."
"These aspects apart, however, the Amsterdam Treaty is hardly a cue for an ode to joy."
"The summit stopped half way, deferring the most important decisions it should have taken."
"Asylum policy, the fight against crime, and foreign policy have hardly been made any more effective, if at all, and the Member States clearly prefer to maintain the pretence of national sovereignty, rather than acknowledging the reality of mutual dependence."
"Nothing has been done to correct the error made at Maastricht of allocating the Union tasks without giving it the money to carry them out."
"Such a Union is neither convincing nor inspiring."
"We cannot hope to build a strong Europe with weak institutions."
"Now that the Treaty has fallen so far short of expectations, there are calls in various capital cities for enlargement to be postponed for several years, until 2005 or later."
"Was that perhaps what some countries wished to achieve at Amsterdam?"
"That would be a dangerous mistake to make."
"Admittedly, the decisions taken on the euro and the EU Treaty are enough to justify only a limited enlargement, but a number of the 12 applicant countries should be able to join in 2002."
"It is important that this first wave should include one of the Baltic States, such as Estonia, since this will enable the Union to help maintain political stability in a region where NATO cannot yet act."
"Helping to maintain political stability in Europe will be the Union's principal task over the next few decades, so it is important for the accession negotiations to begin on schedule."
"However, they will only be completed successfully if the euro becomes a stable currency in 1999 and if the Union's decision-making is also made more efficient."
"Those should now be our objectives."
"(GUE/NGL) . (ES) Mr President, we thank the Dutch Presidency for the splendid work carried out, but should like to consider the results of the European Council."
"We have to say that, like the whole Parliament, our first reaction was one of great concern."
"The Commission expressed that same concern, and Mr Santer reiterated it today by saying that substantial elements of the Community system were in danger."
"Then we were disappointed over the past few days at the alarming news from Amsterdam and, finally, when we learned the results, consternation set in."
"We do not want to over-dramatize, but that is how we felt."
"We felt consternation, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, because the European Council results represent a failure of the plan to reform the European institutions with a view to enlargement and in our opinion it was a mistake to take such a tough line in ratifying the stability pact."
"I should now like to deal very briefly with those two matters, placing greater emphasis on the negative aspects than on the positive, not because I want to be alarmist, but rather because I have less time than the larger groups and must hand out the brickbats before the bouquets."
"In our opinion it is an error, and we know we are in a minority in the Parliament, to strain national budgets to make social policies, just as it was to punish large deficits with curious sanctions which run counter to the traditional concept of the redistribution of wealth."
"With such measures we are bound to push up the deficits where countries have them and make the solvent countries more solvent."
"One very positive point however is the proposal by the French government for at last an important institutional debate on employment which will reach its culmination in Luxembourg - not just in rhetoric, I hope, but in terms of decisions."
"As regards the three objectives for the Turin IGC on which there is great unanimity in the Parliament, I think that the problem is most serious."
"As regards the first objective - taking Europe closer to the citizens and overcoming the democratic deficit - timid steps have been taken far short of what was expected."
"A social protocol, albeit very limited, has been incorporated."
"Unanimity will be needed for social protection measures."
"The 'communitization' of the justice and domestic pillar will be very limited and there will be no real redressing of the balance within the European institutions."
"As regards the second objective - providing the Union with the means suitable for a more effective foreign policy, we think there was too little political willpower on common foreign and security policy and we would mention trade policy, where Article 113 dealing with trade policy became totally bogged down."
"In the third objective - improving the operation of the institutions with a view to enlargement - the failure was on such a scale that it would have been better to postpone the end of the conference."
"Nor can the cancellation of the third reading in the co-decision procedure be regarded as any great result either."
"That just shows how little was achieved at the conference."
"Amsterdam became a Maastricht II and does not constitute any substantial change on the road to political union - which is already essential in democratic terms for reaching Economic and Monetary Union - nor does it prepare for enlargement."
"We demand a more serious revision of the Treaty with a view to enlargement and the Parliament, without being corporatist, cannot accept that it should be prevented from giving assent on essential points when this European political union is being set up as demanded by all citizens."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the question we need to consider today is the condition in which the Union ship has left the port of Amsterdam."
"Is it equipped to withstand extremely stormy weather and to cope with the jagged rocks that lie ahead of us?"
"There seems absolutely no point to me in taking a magnifying glass to look for the positive points, the notorious 'small steps forward' ."
"We need to look at the overall structure and examine whether it is sound."
"If a house is crooked and its foundations are collapsing, we do not walk around it admiring the equipment in the kitchen or the furniture in the living room."
"We assess the damage honestly and consider how to put things right."
"Parliament was always convinced that, after Amsterdam, the Union would need to be ready to face three major challenges."
"As well as EMU, we also need a political union to counterbalance the one-sided monetarist approach that has led millions of Europeans to associate the euro, even before it is introduced, with social disintegration and job losses."
"But we do not yet have a European political union."
"Amsterdam may have polished up the Treaty's provisions on employment, but the Achilles heel has always been obtaining European funding to carry out the various measures."
"This is why we, with Mr Willockx, have in the past had to take measures on behalf of the Ministers of Finance, who are ever reluctant to loosen their purse-strings. Neither the text of the Treaty nor the resolution on growth and employment offers any kind of progress here in terms of concrete guarantees."
"Secondly, decision-making in Europe needs to be made smoother, more transparent and more democratic, so that enlargement can be approached confidently and calmly."
"Institutional reform was required for this, the main elements being the qualified majority in the Council, the right of codecision for Parliament and a wider role for the Court of Justice."
"On this last point, there already seem to be problems and disputes, as previous speakers have mentioned, and I would ask the Council for an explanation here."
"The Belgian prime minister called the institutional component an out-and-out failure, but we in the House - or the majority of us at least - are so polite and kind and diplomatic that we can no longer call a spade a spade, yet within a few months we shall once more be complaining that no one takes us seriously."
"If only we could begin to take ourselves seriously, starting with what we said yesterday, which we are already beginning to retract."
"Thirdly, the Union must make a clear and decisive choice in favour of sustainable development."
"Improvements have been made to the Treaty, but the main instrument - eco-taxation - is still blocked by the need for unanimity in the Council."
"Following the failure of Maastricht II, more and more voices in various groups have been calling for lessons to be learnt in terms of the Intergovernmental Conference format."
"The big question here in political terms is of course what to do next."
"Who is really going to protect Europe's overall interests?"
"I believe this is where Parliament comes in, and where it has a pioneering role to play."
"But it should not start by making itself a laughingstock with a resolution which goes against public opinion, media analysis and Parliament's own better judgement in giving an assessment that our electors would not see as an honest political evaluation."
"Mr President, much had been hoped for from the European Council in Amsterdam."
"Those hopes have been disappointed, to put it mildly."
"It is futile to conceal that truth with the exaggeratedly optimistic motion for a resolution before us today."
"The truth is a sadder story. Unfortunately, as others have already said, Amsterdam was not a success."
"I admit that there are some areas, and all credit to the Dutch presidency, where the net result is not totally negative."
"That applies to the single currency, for example."
"The euro has cleared the obstacle, after a fashion, and we welcome that just as we welcome the economic and social element where, at last, due consideration has been given to concerns about growth and employment."
"But even in those areas the progress made has been incomplete, because virtually no additional credit has been allocated to these activities."
"As to what institutions are to implement these policies, absolutely nothing has been done to clarify this issue."
"Indeed, it is the institutional questions left by Amsterdam that are the worst."
"And yet that was supposed to be the central point of the summit, based on months of preparation by a Intergovernmental Conference in which Parliament was partly associated."
"The optimists will tell us that the European Parliament has emerged stronger as a result of the extension of the codecision procedure, and it is true that the new Treaty does seem to strengthen our legislative powers."
"Even though, in this area, the Amsterdam text is sufficiently ambiguous to lend itself to restrictive interpretation."
"I hope it will not come to that, but we are on the alert."
"But if, today, we were to give our backing to the entire institutional reform package as presented to us, we should certainly be doing nothing for the prestige of our institution."
"For months, we have been saying that we wanted stronger institutions, if only to pave the way for the forthcoming enlargements."
"Well, the failings are obvious."
"The abandonment of the unanimity rule is far from becoming a reality."
"Many sectors still escape qualified majority voting: social affairs, taxation, internal and judicial matters that have now been communitized, etc."
"Nor has the European Council dealt with the problem of the weighting of votes, or with the problem of the number of Commissioners."
"It has refrained from recognizing the legal personality of the Union."
"It has provided for a highly ambiguous procedure for revising the Treaties before the coming enlargements."
"On all these points, and others too, the texts we adopted two years ago were much more ambitious than the one destined to become the Amsterdam Treaty."
"That is why we hope that another Intergovernmental Conference will be set up as quickly as possible to prepare, effectively and sincerely, for the forthcoming enlargements; or at the very least we hope to see a further reform of the Treaties."
"If the Heads of State and Government can only advance on tiptoe, let us at least give them the opportunity to tiptoe a long way."
"And then, perhaps, they will eventually arrive at a satisfactory result."
"Mr President, the Dutch presidency has managed under very difficult circumstances to conclude the IGC negotiations at the Amsterdam summit, for which it is to be congratulated."
"However, I am rather less enthusiastic about the actual substance of the Treaty."
"I shall not comment on the individual provisions - though if I did so, the number of minuses would far outweigh the number of pluses - but I would say that I like the way in which the principle of subsidiarity and the role of the national parliaments have been developed in two separate protocols to the Treaty."
"I see this as an acknowledgement of the importance of the national governments for the successful operation of the Union, and of keeping decision-making as close as possible to the general public."
"Whether those who drafted the Treaty share the same thoughts I very much doubt, because - and this is where the root of my objections lies - the Amsterdam Treaty continues to build on the old idea of a united Europe."
"It is yet another step - no matter how small such steps may be - towards further centralization, and totally overlooks the fact that the map of Europe has undergone a fundamental change since the fall of the Berlin Wall."
"It would seem logical to strengthen the European institutions to prevent the Union from losing effectiveness as a result of enlargement."
"But if we are to have a Union of perhaps 24 states in future, we cannot continue to build on a model originally designed for six."
"The addition of another two or three Member States would be possible on the basis of the Amsterdam Treaty, but the European Union needs a rather different structure if there is to be effective cooperation between 24 countries."
"That is why we need to have fundamental talks on the current form and substance of the Union and on the role of the European Parliament."
"The IGC was an ideal opportunity for the Dutch presidency to launch such talks, but it failed to take advantage of it."
"On the contrary, the thinking behind the Treaty was to increase democracy and governability by concentrating more powers at European level."
"A section on employment has been added, the social protocol has been incorporated, policy on asylum, visas and immigration is eventually to be communitized, and majority decision-making has been expanded, along with the powers of the European Parliament."
"In my view, this centralization will, in the longer term, produce the exact opposite of what was intended, by hampering enlargement and restricting governability and democracy."
"Even with the present Union of 15 Member States, there are serious failings when it comes to cooperation and compliance with European legislation, so how will things be with an enlarged Union and an even wider diversity of cultures, legal systems, political traditions and standards of living?"
"And will countries which have only just won their own sovereignty be prepared to hand most of it over to Brussels?"
"Integration already appeared to be reaching its limits at Amsterdam."
"Another important question is whether people can identify with a European Union in which decisions are taken at such a distance."
"Can they feel democratically represented by a Parliament which could grow to have 700 Members with 24 nationalities and a large number of languages, and where national political diversity will scarcely be reflected?"
"We seem to assume all too readily that a vastly expanded institutional structure will enable us to conquer evil in the world and build a better society."
"To sum up, the enlargement of the Union should be given top priority as a political necessity and a moral duty."
"In my opinion, the Amsterdam Treaty ought to have paved the way by reforming the Union into a more decentralized cooperative structure, with a limited number of tasks and more modest ambitions."
"President de Gaulle once said that it is difficult to make an omelette out of six boiled eggs, let alone 15 or 24."
"The stability of an expanded Union depends not on strong central government, but on the existence of efficient parliamentary democracies within independent Member States."
"I therefore hope that fundamental talks will take place on the future structure of Europe before the Union is enlarged any further."
"I have received, pursuant to Rule 37 of the Rules of Procedure, eight motions for resolutions to bring the current debate to a close."
"The vote will take place at noon."
"I call upon Mr HÃ¤nsch."
"Mr President, the Amsterdam Treaty is no peak achievement and there is no cause for rejoicing."
"But nor does the Treaty deserve the disapproval, scorn and contempt many speakers are heaping on it."
"It will prove itself better than its present reputation."
"Certainly, compared with the gigantic problems facing Europe, the heads of state and government have all turned out to be dwarfs."
"Mr President of the European Council, for obvious reasons that really does not apply to you!"
"The new Treaty has remained the same mishmash as the old one."
"Not a trace of simplification and clarity!"
"But above all, the Treaty still does not make the European Union capable of enlargement."
"We need further institutional reform before the next accession."
"Here it is more important to broaden the margin for majority decisions in the Council than to reduce the number of Commissioners."
"The Treaty does not measure up to all that needs to be done in the Union."
"But measured against the existing Maastricht Treaty, the new Treaty represents notable progress."
"Parliament has been strengthened considerably."
"We are co-legislators, with equal rights."
"Certainly, there are some gaps, but they can be filled."
"If anyone had prophesied two years ago that it would prove possible to replace the entire cooperation procedure with the co-decision procedure he would have been regarded as a nutcase!"
"Our strategy of concentrating on co-decision was successful."
"Our two representatives, Elmar Brok and Elisabeth Guigou, were successful, after spending a year involved in drafting the Treaty under difficult conditions."
"I would like to give special thanks to Elisabeth Guigou and Elmar Brok for the outstanding job they have done!"
"(Applause) I now hear that attempts are being made to tinker with the Treaty retrospectively because in some cases the codecision right was not established systematically, that attempts are being made to withdraw the co-decision right again in cases where the Council has to decide unanimously."
"I must warn against that!"
"The European Parliament cannot accept any retrospective amendments to the Amsterdam Treaty now that it is adopted!"
"(Applause) There has been some progress."
"Yes, I too would have wished for a better Treaty, but a better Treaty is no use failing the will to implement and apply it in full."
"The Treaty is a step backwards in terms of establishing freedom of movement because it requires unanimous decisions for the next five years."
"But although it was possible to take majority decisions for a whole ten years, the governments never did so!"
"We criticize the common foreign and security policy provisions as totally unsatisfactory."
"Yet they do allow for some action if the political will is there."
"For instance, if you want SFOR in Yugoslavia to have a new task and its mandate extended, you can decide on that, regardless of the provisions of the new foreign and security policy."
"But a chapter on employment is not an employment policy by a long way."
"So long as the governments do not do what they themselves decided, namely translate the Delors White Paper and the Santer employment package into political action, they can introduce as many employment chapters as they want in the Treaty."
"Incidentally, the point about fully applying the provisions of the Treaty applies to the European Parliament too."
"We must change our method of working if we really want to make effective use of our new rights."
"(Applause) So we need this Amsterdam Treaty and we will not stand still; but, Mr President of the Council, the method used so far for amending the Treaty is finished."
"If you continue in this manner you will achieve less and less in future, until you are faced with nothing."
"The Union will be forced into further reforms sooner than you might think."
"We in the European Parliament will ensure that in so doing it does not lose sight of the vision of a just, democratic, united Europe with the ability to act, to create jobs and to secure peace."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to begin by welcoming Mr Kok here to the European Parliament in Brussels."
"You may have seen that an enormous complex is under construction to secure our seat here in Brussels, even after enlargement, so it is with mixed feelings that we view the Council's decision that we should meet twelve times a year in Strasbourg."
"Why does the Council feel it necessary to take a decision on this for us?"
"Would it not be something better left to Parliament itself?"
"Mixed feelings seem to have been the order of the day in this debate on the results of the Amsterdam summit: we are positive about what has been achieved, but we also feel that we have to criticize what has been left halfdone or not done at all."
"We are positive about the way in which the position of ordinary citizens has been strengthened in the Treaties."
"The non-discrimination article has been taken almost word for word from Parliament's resolution of March 1996, and it should provide an effective barrier against racism and other negative forces in society."
"We are also positive about the improvements to the provisions on equal treatment for men and women, though we regret that they are not to have direct effect."
"We shall be urging the Commission to come up with some directives very quickly, so that the new provisions can be made a real force for change in society."
"We are also positive about the steps taken regarding openness and democracy in the Union, though here again we need implementing directives to flesh out the new articles on openness."
"But a European law on open government could be very salutary for Brussels bureaucracy, and some of the army of lobbyists here in Brussels could work to much better effect if they did not have to charge a great deal of money to obtain information for people which they should now obtain for themselves."
"We are also positive about the partial consolidation of the Union's democratic standards."
"If I have calculated correctly from Elmar Brok's list, the European Parliament will soon have the final say on around 80 % of all European legislation, and I agree with our group chairman when he says that Parliament has certainly emerged the winner in this Treaty."
"However, we are rather less positive about the failure to achieve an outcome on budgetary powers."
"It cannot be good for more than ECU 50 billion to be spent on agriculture in particular without any parliamentary control."
"Unfortunately, there are also a number of negative points, especially in the policy area."
"Europe's employment policy has been given fresh impetus, which is something that we welcome."
"We support Jean-Claude Juncker's employment conference and hope that it too will produce results."
"A certain amount of progress has even been made on environment policy."
"The main problem lies with internal security, foreign policy and immigration and refugee policy, where little progress has been made, and yet they are all extremely important to our citizens."
"The fact that our approach to organized crime and cross-border cooperation on police and judicial affairs is still not really off the ground is a serious matter, and actually defies belief when you think how the Mafia is gaining ground in Central and Eastern Europe."
"It now presents a major threat to enlargement and the role of the European Union."
"Even on foreign policy, we seem to be drowning in indecision, which is simply unacceptable."
"I do not blame the Dutch presidency here, which has put forward a number of constructive proposals, firmly supported by a motion from the Second Chamber in the Netherlands. No, I blame some of the Heads of Government, who simply did not wish to make progress on this issue."
"We have also let people down when it comes to policy on asylum and refugees, where the public wants to see improvements, better coordination and more fine-tuning, none of which has really been achieved."
"I do not have much more to say now."
"Enlargement is far too important to be allowed to stagnate because of the lack of motivation shown at the IGC."
"However, I would recommend that the areas of internal security, foreign policy, asylum and refugee policy, vote weighting and decision-making should all be reviewed over the next three to four years, to ensure that all the groundwork is done before accession."
"Perhaps, with enlargement looming, it can be done: the Union often works best under pressure."
"Finally, a few words about the presidency as a whole."
"The unfortunate start made by some members of the Dutch Government such as Mrs Sorgdrager and Mr Zalm has been offset by the good work done by other ministers, for example Mr van Mierlo on human rights, Mrs de Boer on CO2 policy, Mr Melkert on employment policy and Mr Pronk on support for Africa."
"There can be no doubt of the regard in which the Dutch prime minister is held here."
"There are not too many genuine Europeans among the present Heads of Government, and our group chairman is right that general European interests often come second to small-minded national interests."
"You are one of the few genuine Europeans, and I hope that you will be with us for a long time to come to help promote progress in European cooperation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the draft Amsterdam Treaty is the result of a fifteen month-long conference, during which proposals from all the institutional and other players engaged in the revision of the treaty were evaluated, and the negotiations, which were not always easy, produced the compromise of this draft treaty, agreed and initialled the Member States."
"There were great expectations of this reform, and there has been great progress, but there is also great disappointment."
"It has been said that the Single Act forged the single market, that the Maastricht Treaty was the framework for economic and monetary union, and that the Amsterdam Treaty will bring the social chapter back into the centre of Europe's priorities, with all its corollaries of balance between the macro-economic and political factors of concern to the Member States."
"We certainly applaud this positive thrust and we will back it, but that is not all. We also take a favourable view of the progress achieved in the area of more genuine and effective integration, for example the compromise which has led to agreement on the budget stability pact, the inclusion of the social protocol in the treaty, the new chapter on employment, the strengthening of certain common policies like the environment, health, consumer protection, inclusion in the treaty of the Schengen acquis , the advancs made for EUROPOL, the establishment of a forward planning and early warning unit under the CFSP, and the extension and simplification of the co-decision procedure."
"That list is obviously not exhaustive and I could continue, but unfortunately I must move on to painful points."
"The fact is we do not think there has been sufficient progress yet on the institutional profile."
"In our opinion, certain priority issues needed to be settled before the planned enlargement, in order to ease the adhesion procedure and avoid adding an appendix of unresolved institutional problems to the important negotiations."
"Obviously I am referring to the procrastination over the decision on the new weighting of votes in the Council and the linked political problem of the composition and functioning of the European Commission."
"Furthermore the slow progress in extending majority voting in the Council undermines the core of the process of integration of the Union, and represents a serious threat to the actual decision-making capacity of the European Union."
"The current system of treaty revision also needs to be reviewed as soon as possible, escaping the narrow intergovernmental focus and thus reducing the democratic deficit and involving the citizens more directly, through their elected representatives, in the process of European unification."
"Clearly we still have a long way to go, but we are optimistic and the first test will be in a few months' time when, after the necessary harmonization of texts and finalization of legal details, the treaty will be signed and the European Parliament will then give its final opinion on its content."
"So, for the sake of the European Union, its Member States present and future and their peoples, we trust that this period of polishing and desirable reflection, may lead to the approval of a treaty more adequate to the 21st Century, until a future and more profitable intergovernmental conference can be held."
"Madam President, the link between a bold reform of the institutions and the opening of accession negotiations has never been challenged either by the Member States or by the European Parliament, for the very good reason that that link was obvious."
"Such a reform, a necessity for fifteen Member States, became imperative in the interests of the candidates for accession, in order that the negotiations could be conducted on a sound institutional basis."
"The failure to achieve this institutional objective is a disappointment."
"That, Prime Minister, is why it would have been more realistic to acknowledge that the hoped-for result had not been achieved, that this could be remedied by setting a new and clear timetable, and that the accession negotiations could go ahead within its constraints."
"The responsibility of Members of the European Parliament is to evaluate the content of the Treaty, to give their opinion and to justify their position to the electors."
"We have a duty to be demanding."
"How are we to approve a draft that contains little or nothing of what was considered essential in resolutions tabled by certain Members of the European Parliament and adopted by a large majority?"
"The European Commission, for its part, is responsible for defending the overriding interest of the Union."
"In this context, Commissioner Oreja made a courageous and uncompromising statement before the institutional committee."
"Does President Santer believe that it should be up to Members of this Parliament to defend the authority of the Commission, especially as regards the visibility of the common foreign and security policy?"
"This responsibility borne by the Commission implies a rigorous attitude, independence of judgement and a duty of rigorous evaluation."
"We hope the Commission will be able to show its worth in its mid-July report."
"My final and perhaps most important point is this: the failure of this conference is also a failure of the intergovernmental method."
"What we have to do now is restart the machinery."
"Europeans have never lacked imagination and determination."
"Such is the political will that must inspire us now, and I have no doubt, Prime Minister, that you will be among the best tomorrow."
"Madam President, the European Council's agenda in Amsterdam was overwhelmed by the introduction of the employment question, at the request of the French Government, and under the pressure of the social movement."
"Admittedly, the acceptance of the pact seems to me to be a serious act, but the fact remains that the debate on employment has begun."
"That is a worthwhile result, springing from the widespread recent mobilization of opinion in Europe - at Vilvoerde, for example - or the political debate that has been initiated in France and elsewhere."
"The French members of my group reassert their total opposition to the stability pact, which imposes a restrictive framework on budgetary policy and demands austerity criteria, backed by penalties, to satisfy the demands of the financial markets."
"This pact, which makes a mockery of the sovereignty of the peoples of Europe, is an obstacle to any effective, sustainable solution to the unemployment problem."
"The resolution on employment and growth adopted at Amsterdam opens up various avenues of exploration which might lead to the creation of jobs, but it still bears the heavy imprint of the European Council in Essen, with its emphasis on competitiveness, flexibility and reducing the cost of labour."
"The extraordinary European council on employment, this autumn, will provide an opportunity for the peoples of Europe to obtain a hearing for their demands, expressed by the Europe-wide social movement."
"We are going to set to work to play our full part in the pursuit and intensification of the mobilization of the citizens' social movement, to achieve a re-orientation of European unity and to make social progress and employment the driving forces of a new economic development in Europe."
"Madam President, here we are on the threshold of the 21st century, yet democracy in Europe still seems to be languishing in the 19th."
"Those of us who have read the various non-papers and treaty texts produced over the last six months have watched the IGC teetering on the brink of yawning democratic abysses, and if we have not fallen in, then ironically enough it is not because the Heads of Government realize that European integration needs to be more democratic, but because of their belief in the fiction of national sovereignty."
"Of course, some progress has been made in the Amsterdam Treaty, but what is really significant - and I shall not list every point, since everyone else has already done that - is the vexed question of the environment guarantee."
"Those Member States which care for the environment have had to fight to be allowed to do in their own countries what Europe will not do for them."
"On employment, the real issue is whether Europe should be given the instruments to shift taxes from labour to energy consumption and capital, and to improve the distribution of work."
"We are no closer to any measures on this, and all the Treaty does is to create false expectations, not real jobs."
"The strict adherence to the timetable for EMU stands in stark contrast to the way in which the enlargement of the Union was casually pushed onto the back burner at Amsterdam."
"The forthcoming negotiations will be all about breaking the bad news and passing on the message that Western Europe is too busy with its own affairs."
"A larger Union requires a longer yardstick and, measured by that yardstick, this Treaty falls some way short."
"It is worrying that the communitization of immigration and asylum policy is not to be accompanied by the introduction of normal democratic checks and balances."
"The national parliaments are no longer to deal with these issues, and the European Parliament merely has the power to make recommendations."
"What is even more telling, of course, is that the Heads of Government have decided that we have seats in Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg, and that we are to meet twelve times a year in Strasbourg."
"If Parliament accepts this lying down, it really is not worth a button."
"Madam President, my provisional, personal view following Amsterdam is that the de facto barriers to integration have become operational."
"We see that the common European denominator is even smaller than we thought in Maastricht."
"I believe account should have been taken of the fact that the process of integration is bound to be a gradual one, that common action cannot be imposed by decree but can in fact only be achieved step by step on the basis of a common European will."
"We also find that certain areas are not at all or not yet suitable in this regard."
"Only if we realise all this and leave the Member States a national margin for decision will further development be possible."
"The hope expressed by the Committee on Institutional Affairs, namely that the Treaty could be improved after the event by the way it is interpreted seems an extremely deceptive one."
"I do not think one can replace a lack of political agreement by oversubtle interpretations without causing precisely that unease among the people that it was one of the main aims of the Treaty revision to remove."
"Madam President, if we look back at the problems we faced before and during the Amsterdam summit, we can see straight away that the Dutch presidency has done a very good job, particularly in getting 15 signatures at the bottom of the Treaty."
"Our congratulations go to the presidency on its skilful handling of the matter."
"However, the few minutes available to me here today cannot all be devoted to singing the presidency's praises."
"It is an MEP's role to make a down-to-earth assessment of whether the outcome of the IGC corresponds to our own ideas and objectives."
"On a number of issues this is indeed the case, and we feel that progress is gradually being made, but unfortunately it does not apply to those specific areas that will make enlargement possible, where you would need a magnifying glass to see any sign of progress at all."
"The same is true of the very necessary changes in cooperation on justice and home affairs, where important decisions have been postponed."
"What are we to make, for example, of the new title covering freedom of movement, asylum and immigration?"
"What are we to make of freedom of movement that now has so many conditions attached that it no longer deserves the name of freedom?"
"We are also going to have to wait and see if there is eventually to be majority decision-making and whether Parliament will have the power of codecision."
"And of course we already know that our original demands for the Court of Justice to have normal jurisdiction have not been met."
"We cannot broaden without deepening, as we have said in the resolution."
"We need to get back to the negotiating table."
"Those who have only just finished all the hard work this time will undoubtedly be horrified at the idea, but the process of reform will simply have to be resumed very shortly."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to thank the President of the Council, Foreign Minister van Mierlo and Mr Patijn and their team for the real spirit of cooperation they showed Elisabeth Guigou and myself in the past months."
"I am also convinced that we will see similar cooperation on a number of practical matters in the coming days and weeks."
"I think that when we evaluate this document we can often proceed on the basis that the better is the enemy of the good."
"For we find that measured against our expectations of the future European constitution this is not exactly a grandiose example of progress."
"On the other hand - and I became a Member of the European Parliament in 1980 - we have experienced dramatic and positive change in the European Union with the three intergovernmental conferences of 1985, 1991 and 1997 and there were more developments in the European Union between 1985 and 1997 than between 1958 and 1985."
"I think we should remember these developments too and remember the situation as it was at the outset."
"So we should be a little fair in our judgment."
"This Treaty has brought a social balance."
"The Single Act was a treaty on the internal market."
"The Maastricht Treaty was a treaty on economic union. Now a social title has been added, the Social Protocol of 1961 and 1989 has been incorporated, an employment title has been included, the European Court of Justice has been strengthened and the Treaty includes a number of additional civil rights."
"This increased balance in the Treaty may not be sufficient, but it deserves to be noted."
"I believe that it is better to communitarize fields of justice and home affairs in the first pillar and to adhere to unanimity for a while longer than to leave them in a third pillar and decide by majority voting even at this stage."
"Why?"
"Because in incorporating them in the Community structure the heads of state and government have recognized that the intergovernmental approach is not the right one and that the classical approach to integration established by Monnet is preferable; eventually we will still manage to establish majority decision-making."
"That is the strategic decision we should be looking at and that we discussed in the past."
"In the field of foreign and security policy, we have managed thanks in particular to Parliament's activities to ensure that the Commission is involved in planning and analysis and in other areas too and that it is no longer just the governments and the Council alone that decide."
"The situation still looked quite different a few months ago!"
"Surely that is an important step towards gradually incorporating this aspect into the acquis communautaire too."
"The fact that Petersberg tasks have been integrated, that the European Union can now issue guidelines for the WEU, that the Union can conclude agreements with third countries in the second and third pillar too, surely these are remarkable steps forward which, I believe, need to be recognized."
"In regard to flexibility, Schengen and so forth, this means that the areas that are in the first pillar under the normal Treaty are also decided according to the methods of the first pillar; no Pillar 3a or 3b or whatever has been introduced."
"That too is worth noting."
"But we also note that this Treaty has one crucial weakness."
"That weakness is that we have too little majority decision-making to give us the ability to act."
"The heads of state and government admitted this, pointing out that there will be another intergovernmental conference before the accession of the sixteenth Member State."
"I think that admission may have further consequences."
"I could imagine, for instance, that the decision, which is to be taken in the Council, to include justice and home affairs in the majority and codecision procedure in five years' time could be modified and that the timeframe could be reduced, for instance to a date before the first round of enlargement."
"Then we would not need another intergovernmental conference but could make considerable progress in this area."
"Perhaps the Council could include this in its deliberations."
"At present, the European Parliament normally has codecision rights on legislation."
"The President of the Commission can only take up office with the approval of the European Parliament."
"The Commission as a whole has to be approved by the European Parliament."
"The budget cannot be adopted against the will of the European Parliament."
"Treaties on enlargement, association agreements and many other agreements with third countries require the assent of the European Parliament."
"There are criticisms to be made, there are many more things we have to achieve and we have to make it clear that these intergovernmental conferences are perhaps no longer the right method to use."
"We must make it clear that in the long run we need a constituent assembly that includes the national governments, the European Parliament and the national parliaments, in order to overcome some of the bureaucratic resistance."
"But we should no longer say that this European Parliament has no influence!"
"We will be holding elections in 1999, when we should honestly tell the citizens that this European Parliament is a factor of European policy and that few matters in Europe are still decided against the will of the European Parliament!"
"Only then can we obtain a high level of electoral participation and only then can we draw the necessary strength to wrest even more from the Council in the next round."
"So I would ask you not to play down the results achieved for Parliament; instead we should show more self-assurance and make use of the instruments we have to move ahead!"
"Madam President, after two years of discussions, Parliament produced an ambitious list of desiderata which have by no means been satisfied."
"Does this mean the end for Europe?"
"Not in the least."
"At the very last moment it was decided to go ahead with economic and monetary union, an ostensibly technical economic measure which could actually generate a feeling of political solidarity in the longer term."
"What is worrying is that the road to enlargement is still blocked by the problem of the structure of the institutions, and I find it particularly regrettable that even the Benelux countries could not find it in themselves to propose a rotating Commissioner for the Benelux."
"The Council's continuing secrecy is also sending the wrong signals to the young democracies of Eastern Europe, and is still evidence of the democratic deficit."
"It is unfortunate, not to say completely unworkable, that the number of Members of this House is to increase to 700."
"Why can we not be realistic enough to impose our own restrictions and say that 400 to 500 Members is enough?"
"And do the people of Europe feel any safer now?"
"The President-in-Office announced a package of measures, but unfortunately what he himself does in practice is exactly the opposite."
"The arrest warrant for the international drug-dealer Bouterse has still not been issued, while the public prosecutor has been suspended for some reason."
"And Brussels has yet to give the green light to the new legislation, so for now drink-drivers are let off scot-free, which is hardly likely to make people safer."
"I understand that the chairman of Parliament's Legal Affairs Committee, Mr de Clercq, has asked the Justice Minister to come here and give us an explanation."
"Measured against what we hoped it would achieve, Amsterdam was not a success, but the Heads of Government who directly reflect the voters' wishes in the 15 Member States chose to decide otherwise."
"This is our snapshot of how Europe looks at the end of the 20th century."
"The Dutch presidency did what it could and deserves congratulations, if only for managing to hold together 15 Member States with different problems."
"Amsterdam was not a failure, but a small step forward."
"Strasbourg, more than Brussels with all its bureaucracy, is still the symbol of peace in Europe."
"Madam President, with all due respect for the positive aspects, we must nevertheless concentrate on the objectives the Amsterdam conference did not achieve."
"First, given the total failure to carry out institutional reforms we are surely faced with the following dilemma: either the already very poor decision-making structures in the European Union will worsen with the accession of new Members or we will have to postpone enlargement."
"Neither option is acceptable, which is why we must emphatically call for the institutional reforms to be undertaken sooner and for the deadlines set in Amsterdam to be brought forward substantially."
"Secondly, the results in relation to a common foreign and security policy are nothing if not modest; the Denver summit showed what great challenges Europe is facing in this regard, for the United States wants to establish its predatory system as a model for the rest of the world!"
"I believe we have to adjust to this situation and I seriously doubt whether the Amsterdam intergovernmental conference has taken the necessary institutional steps for doing so!"
"Mr President-in-Office, in Amsterdam important steps were taken, but they were fragmentary and uncoordinated."
"One thing is certain, namely that you saved the progress towards the since currency."
"That is no small matter, but it does not seem to me enough for the time being."
"Besides monetary union, economic union too remains outstanding, economic government as some people call it."
"Besides the very positive declarations, a serious policy against unemployment and a truly common social policy remain outstanding."
"All these things remain unclear and depend on other decisions, which were not taken at Amsterdam."
"What will you decide in the autumn?"
"What proposals will you bring us for the budget in the future?"
"Or might you set up all those policies with no budget - or with the budget as it is today?"
"That would be strange and unbelievable!"
"And of course, another thing that remains outstanding is a clear perspective for political union."
"No country will give up resources and sovereignty for another country, but only for a political whole."
"It will therefore be necessary for you to try a new Intergovernmental Conference or to postpone enlargement."
"Until then, do at least try to boost the Union's political credibility."
"There will be no action by the Common Foreign Policy unless we seriously condemn all the atrocities committed in Somalia by 'peace-keepers' from countries belonging to the European Union."
"Madam President, I should like to begin by congratulating the President-in-Office of the Council for the tremendous effort he has made in a matter which appeared difficult to achieve."
"No-one thought two or three weeks ago that it would be possible to conclude the draft Treaty in Amsterdam."
"However, I think that many aspects have been covered - there have been many great developments and great progress - but I should like to point to one important gap from the legal point of view."
"We are working to build a Community legal order in which decisions are taken in the general interest and not for the good of one State or specific group of persons and in real terms for me that means that my greatest concern lies in the articles on flexibility."
"Flexibility presupposes the introduction into the Community legal order of principles applicable to relations between States under International Law."
"There is the danger that in Amsterdam the States have rediscovered International Law."
"I would point out that International Law was invented 500 years ago by another Dutchman - not the President-in-Office of the Council - but Hugo Grocio."
"So I do not know whether we now need to return to this International Law discovered 500 years ago by that illustrious Dutchman."
"This is a different matter; we are creating a supra-national entity and, in that aspect, I think we are running into inadequacies in the European judicial area."
"This is something pointed out previously by the chairman of the Socialist group and I think that we must have moved further forward in the field of creating a European legal area because, when the acquis communautaire of the Schengen Agreement is incorporated in the European Union, we might find ourselves in a situation where, since there were no national frontiers, a person might commit a crime in one country with no border checks then enter another country."
"That means, in specific terms in this Community, that there is no sense in talking about political asylum when the States are already governed by Community Law rather than International Law."
"The articles on the right of political asylum might even presuppose a retroactive element, since I do not think it is possible for a Member State of the European Union to be able to grant asylum to a person who has committed a crime in another country and I do not see any sense in invoking political asylum when we are in a Community governed by democratic States."
"In a Community governed by democratic States political asylum is absolutely meaningless."
"If one State is failing to fulfil the conditions for democracy then it cannot be a Member of the Community."
"There are certainly some exemptions under which expulsion is possible, but I do not see how it is possible for the authority of a State, a judicial authority or an administrative authority, to deny entry to a person who has committed a crime in another member country of the Community - having regard to human rights, which are based on the constitutional guarantees in the Community Treaties - by invoking the provisions of the right of asylum."
"Here international agreements on asylum are not applicable; they are applicable only under International Law."
"If we want to be sure of having a free European judicial area, in accordance with constitutional principles, asylum must now be regarded as the major omission from the Treaty of Amsterdam, since it was not possible to set up a European judicial area proffering simultaneously guarantees of freedom and security."
"Thank you, Mr Medina Ortega."
"Your speech proved interesting enough to stop the clock."
"On this occasion, fortunately, we have more time available for this important debate than we did last time."
"Madam President, at this first part-session following the Amsterdam European Council, I welcome the results, above all concerning the European Parliament, whose role has no doubt been strengthened."
"I am convinced that increasing the powers of our institution is the best way of keeping alive the idea of Europe sown in the Treaty of Rome."
"Nevertheless, directly linked to the results of this summit, one event did give us great cause for concern, since in some way it contradicts the bases of this united egalitarian Europe to which I already referred."
"During the conference, the United Kingdom tried to have the right of Community countries to register ships in any Member State -dubbed by them quota-hopping - limited in the final text."
"The initiative of introducing amendments into the Treaty was not a success due to the fact that it was impossible to include such limitations, contrary to the existing acquis communautaire , although an it was a matter of forcing through a Commission statement smoothing the way for the British demands, which was finally blocked by the Council."
"Faced with the possibility that the IGC might be incapable of producing any text, President Santer, on his own initiative and in an amazing unprecedented decision, sent a personal letter to the British Prime Minister in which he unilaterally put at his disposition the services of DG XVI to assist one country - Great Britain - to get their own way over the other Member States even going so far as to make suggestions in that letter which clearly contradicted even three judgments of the European Court of Justice."
"Such unilateral action - with the President of the Commission deciding personally to go to the defence of a given country in the face of Community interests behind the backs of the rest of the Member States and the Community institutions and the Parliament itself - calls into question the supposed impartiality and essential transparency which affects the whole Commission, despite what Madam Commissioner Bonino said in an attempt to mitigate the terms of the letter and does not, Madam President, as you will understand, exactly enhance the prestige of the European Union."
"I think that the most fundamental duty of the Commission is transparency before the Member States and if the institution over which Mr Santer presides thought that the Community laws - including the judgments of the European Court in Luxembourg - could be interpreted as by Mr Santer, that opinion should have been put before all the Member States and not merely before one - and within the framework in which the problem had arisen."
"Mr Santer, you have set a most serious anti-democratic precedent, which neither the Member States nor the Parliament should tolerate, which is why we at the minimum demand the relevant and public explanations."
"Madam President, one minute is too short a time for a proper fundamental analysis of the Amsterdam Treaty, so I shall concentrate on one issue."
"The Protocol on asylum policy includes an Article which means essentially that an EU citizen is prevented from receiving asylum in another EU State."
"In practice this curtails the right of asylum and is in breach of the Geneva Convention."
"This is not the only reason why this is a wrong decision, it also sets a very dangerous precedent if other parts of the world should start to apply the same practice, i.e. that regions will not accept asylum seekers from each other."
"So this decision taken in Amsterdam is a very unfortunate one."
"After the decision was taken attempts were made to tone down its effect."
"But it is obvious that it breaches the Geneva Convention and the UN refugee commissary has confirmed this."
"It does Belgium credit that it has indirectly renounced this decision in a special declaration."
"It is a pity that more Member States did not do the same."
"Madam President, I did not expect more from Amsterdam, and as has very rightly been assessed, Amsterdam turned out to be neither a mountain nor a molehill."
"Of course, like any treaty, it must be judged in relation to the potential it can promote and the perspectives it outlines."
"From that standpoint, I think the results of the meeting were not bad."
"Looking, first, at the issue of employment, it is worth stressing the balanced line pursued by this Treaty, despite the fact that the new provisions on employment could have been more ambitious."
"However, much will depend on the way those provisions are implemented."
"Equally important is the fact that the Social Protocol was incorporated in the Treaty."
"This eliminates one of Maastricht's important weaknesses, which we had repeatedly criticized severely."
"The Amsterdam Agreement did not solve the institutional issue, which it refers to new negotiations at the beginning of the new millennium, and I hope that those amendments will be based on the ideas upon which the ideal of the building of Europe was based, and that counterproductive and artificial discriminations between the Members will be avoided."
"We should not underestimate some of the new Treaty's provisions which represent progress in the right direction."
"I refer particularly to the joint decision procedure and the abolition of the third reading, which has allowed a balance to be established between the roles of Parliament and the Council."
"The results of the Amsterdam Agreement in the area of the Union's foreign policy activities are limited and not up to what we had hoped for."
"Traditional refractoriness prevailed once more in Amsterdam, and no provisions were adopted that would allow the Union to develop its own role."
"As I have already said, much depends on the way the Treaty will be implemented."
"The inadequacies we have all noted can be compensated, within the limits of what is fair, by dynamically making the most of the new prospects that are opening up."
"Madam President, who would claim today that the Intergovernmental Conference has fulfilled its mandate?"
"The positive results of two years of negotiations are confined to a few points."
"First, the broadly based introduction of employment into the Treaty, as a commitment for which positive signals are to be given at the extraordinary Council in Luxembourg; next, the integration of the Social Protocol into the Treaty, primarily the result of the victory of the Labour Party in the United Kingdom; progress with the services of general public interest, which are recognized as forming part of the common values of the Union with a part to play in the promotion of social and territorial cohesion; and an almost unexpected extension of the scope of the codecision procedure, essentially into areas associated with the completion of the internal market and legislative tasks that have been virtually completed."
"Outside the mandate of the Intergovernmental Conference, and a product of the electoral victory of the socialists in France, Amsterdam finally brings us the good news of the resolution on growth and employment, an essential counterpart to the resolution on the stability pact, though that is not to say that a genuine economic government has been set up."
"But, as for the rest, we have been short-changed."
"Amsterdam was supposed to bring democracy, efficiency and transparency to our institutions."
"Instead of the extension of qualified majority voting and the abolition of the right of veto, the sine qua non of any further deepening of the Community, we are offered co-operation, cumbersome to put into practice and ideally designed to hinder the Community dynamic, even though such co-operation will exist anyway because of the euro."
"After the three pillars of Maastricht, the worm in the bud of European integration, we now find ourselves in charge of four pillars."
"From the institutional standpoint, the Amsterdam Treaty is a step towards non-democratic government."
"Amsterdam was supposed to enable the European Union to function better and expand."
"In Madrid, the Heads of State and Government had undertaken to begin enlargement negotiations six months after the conclusions of the IGC on the basis of its results."
"Clearly, they have not reached that point."
"The Heads of State and Government must learn lessons from this, as they failed to do in Amsterdam."
"The Amsterdam Treaty is not a satisfactory conclusion to the Intergovernmental Conference."
"If Europe is to be a power tomorrow, it needs to progress in both political and social affairs."
"On the social side we have achieved something, but on the political side we have hardly started."
"We need to break free of our national self-interests, to produce a collective burst of energy."
"With the Spinelli project, this House gave Europe a new impetus."
"We need to rediscover it."
"Madam President, I also think that we have reason to welcome the Treaty and congratulate the Dutch Presidency."
"Right from the very moment when Sweden joined the Union two years ago we have been fighting to make unemployment a matter of common concern in the Union."
"There were many who thought that we would not succeed but obviously the 18 million unemployed in Europe are a reality which has forced even the most unwilling governments to agree to this in the Treaty."
"Now we must fulfil the Article in the Treaty through practical action."
"We have a great responsibility to ensure that this happens, at the additional summit meeting on unemployment, for example."
"Another proposal which has received attention is increased openness in the European Union, something which we Members from Sweden greatly welcome."
"This is not a controversial issue in Sweden where we have high degree of openness and transparency."
"But there are great differences between the Member States in this respect."
"It is important now that this Article on increased openness in the Treaty is also given a clear and substantial content and that the Union's institutions really do live up to it."
"I think that the results of this Treaty, from the Swedish point of view, show that, contrary to what is sometimes said, the small countries do have the opportunity to influence the primary direction of policy within the Union."
"Mr Santer complained earlier that there were too many national interests involved in this process."
"I would like to point out that, even if I have spoken a great deal about Swedish issues, I think that these are now European interests."
"Employment is a European problem, openness is a European interest, equality is a European right and the environment is a European responsibility."
"Madam President, against many odds it proved possible to broaden the agenda for Intergovernmental Conference to include the subjects that concern people most."
"Everywhere in Europe people single out unemployment as the problem the political systems should get to grips with first."
"At the start of the Intergovernmental Conference, not many people thought that the EU would get its employment chapter, but it happened."
"Of course balmier winds were blowing that way, with the election results just achieved in Britain and France."
"Now the EU has an obligation to tackle unemployment."
"In Denmark a new economic policy has made good progress in creating jobs."
"But the effect of this policy would be far greater if it were a common EU policy."
"And great expectations are pinned on the jobs summit in Luxembourg this autumn."
"What is more important than anything else, however, is that the achievement of a result in Amsterdam means that negotiations can be started with the Baltic and Central and Eastern European countries."
"These countries have a right to claim EU membership, and the civilian cooperation between countries which were previously on a war footing with one another or were divided by a concrete wall is the EU's contribution to peace and stability in Europe."
"The affirmation in the preamble to the Treaty on European Union of the principles on which cooperation in the EU is based, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and non-discrimination, was a pious hope at the start of the negotiations, but in the end it became a reality."
"The Amsterdam Treaty is truly an improvement of the EU in the direction of cooperation which prioritizes and tackles the problems that people consider important."
"I should like to begin by thanking all those who have spoken, particularly for their kind words about the presidency which I shall gladly pass on to my colleagues in the Dutch Cabinet, because much as I am grateful for what people have said about me, we always worked as a team."
"So I shall be delighted to pass on your compliments to them."
"I should also like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Brok and Mrs Guigou for their contribution on behalf of Parliament - and this also goes for Parliament's President, of course - to the progress which has been made."
"We very much appreciated their assistance, and I am speaking here particularly for the Dutch Government, because even before we took over the presidency, we worked very hard to ensure that Parliament would be able to play an active part in the discussions."
"Having shared my responsibilities with Mr Patijn, I shall now confine myself to a certain number of areas and he will shortly give his response to some of the other points that were made."
"I listened very closely to what you had to say, of course, and I can see that, like public opinion in general, you too have mixed views on the outcome of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"There are good points and bad points, and these have led to various different political consequences and conclusions."
"It is less than many of us, including the presidency, had wanted, hoped for or imagined, but it is still progress."
"And it is progress which you should not belittle, because if we do, we are first of all likely to demoralize the public - who may well be left with the impression that no progress can be made - and secondly we are simply likely to underestimate our own individual ability to follow up on these achievements."
"That goes for national governments, the Commission, national parliaments and the European Parliament."
"There are real possibilities for building on these newly laid foundations, and the building of Europe is and always has been a process of growth."
"It is simply a question of whether we wish to go on building with faith in our own strength and with the courage of our convictions."
"I sincerely hope that we will, not just in these last few days of our presidency, but afterwards as well."
"Employment and all the related social aspects are to be given much more prominence in Europe in future years."
"This is a major step forward, and one that was very necessary too, given that we intend to introduce the euro in 1999, a move which needs to be accompanied by a much more high-profile social, employment and economic policy."
"This is a point I would make to the group chairmen, who have all mentioned the subject this morning. The introduction of the euro and the completion of the final stage of EMU are of vital political and economic importance as the final element in the single market, establishing a basis for increased political cooperation in the years to come and giving Europe greater economic power in the world."
"I think we sometimes underestimate just how far we still have to go to maintain and consolidate Europe's structural position after all the catching-up we have done since the mid-1980s when the single market first really came to the fore."
"So we need to introduce EMU at the agreed time and according to the criteria agreed in the Treaty, but we must also ensure that Europe is strong not just in monetary terms, but economically and socially as well."
"At the recent Denver summit, the Americans once again tried their hardest to prove to us that their economic model is the best, and I should like to take this opportunity to say that Europe can and should be proud of its own model of economic dynamism and social justice, and I think that many Americans and indeed many citizens of other major countries in the world rather admire Europe for being able to balance the two."
"We have now managed to strike the necessary balance between Europe's social needs and a stronger employment policy."
"I would point out to the leader of the socialist and social democratic group, Mrs Green, that all governments are now going to have to continue working on the tasks we set ourselves at Amsterdam."
"This applies to finance ministers, social affairs and employment ministers, economic affairs ministers, prime ministers - everyone without exception."
"I also see no reason to question the contribution made to this process by the finance ministers, who have worked very hard over the last few days on the stability pact, the agreements and the resolution on growth and employment."
"Many speakers mentioned the special Luxembourg summit which is to focus on employment."
"There are four points I would make here."
"Firstly, the date for the summit is to be fixed by the new Luxembourg presidency."
"Secondly, the summit needs to be prepared in great detail, mainly by Luxembourg of course, but we must all do what we can to help."
"Thirdly, the agenda should focus on practical, comprehensible issues, so that people know what they are talking about."
"Fourthly, you should not harbour any exaggerated expectations."
"You must not think that a few hours' discussions at the summit, whenever it is held over the next six months, will produce miraculous solutions immediately generating thousands of new jobs."
"However, it will certainly be an important occasion, bringing together all the various ideas and philosophies from around the Union and demonstrating that, as well as a sound monetary basis, attention is also to be focused on developing the coordination of economic policy and a stronger employment policy."
"I heard one Member this morning say that more European money needs to be provided."
"What is European money - apart from the euro that we are about to introduce?"
"You cannot simply say that if the Member States do not have enough money to pursue their employment policies, all we have to do is turn on the European funding and jobs will appear."
"It is not as easy as that."
"But we can make every effort to ensure that the funding available through the European budgets is used in a more employment-friendly way, and we must learn to work together, learn from each other and listen to each other's ideas about practical employment policy."
"In recent years - and I can say this because I myself was one of those responsible, I am not trying to blame anyone else - an enormous amount of time has been spent on monetary issues and getting experts to agree on EMU, while much less work was done in comparison on the social aspects."
"We are now busy making up lost ground, and we must go on devoting all our energies to this even after the end of our presidency in a few days' time."
"I would strongly urge you not to underestimate the progress that has been made on the foreign and security policy and the Community approach to the movement of persons."
"Mention has been made of the Petersberg missions, and if little progress has been made on integrating the WEU into the European Union, it is because there are a number of diametrically opposed views on the subject in the 15 Member States."
"What we have done, in a number of texts at least, is to give some indication of how these views might be reconciled to enable progress to be made."
"Moving on to the subject of institutional reform, I must first say that I agree with all those who have voiced criticism here."
"You may think this is a rather stupid thing to say, since I am supposed to be here to defend the overall outcome of the summit, and indeed I do, because I think we could not have gone to Amsterdam without a genuine basis on which to conclude the talks."
"So I support the outcome as it stands, we have no intention of running away from it, but I really think we should have had the courage to go a little further on majority decision-making than we did."
"Indeed the presidency fought long and hard for this during the preparations and at Amsterdam itself, but in the end we had to agree to let certain Member States reduce the already limited list of extra areas where majority voting was to apply."
"There were enough for me to be able to support it, but there were less than we might have hoped."
"Next, vote weighting."
"There came a point during the last night at Amsterdam when it became clear that Member States had certain mutually exclusive ideas on this issue."
"Some were adamant that we should simply have a second ratio based on population size and refused to consider any kind of reweighting on the lines of what the presidency proposed, or indeed any other alternative."
"Others wanted the exact opposite."
"So as things stood during the last night at Amsterdam, we had the choice of either accepting that these ideas were irreconcilable and ending up with nothing, or trying to do what we did, which was at least to agree that with the first wave of enlargement, the larger Member States will give up their second Commissioners - a highly significant political development - and to agree now, by way of compensation, that before the first wave of enlargement takes place, assuming that it involves less than six Member States, we will have a new distribution ratio for the number of votes in the Council."
"This could of course simply be putting off the evil moment, in that we cannot rule out the possibility that the problems we had at Amsterdam will re-emerge when the time comes to decide on enlargement and therefore on the new weighting of votes."
"But if this happens - and this is a political comment - and Member States try to use this problem to block enlargement, they will be taking a huge responsibility upon themselves."
"I can assure you that I am all in favour of enlargement as soon as possible."
"We know that careful preparations need to be made, that the members must fulfil a number of criteria and that they are not yet economically in a position to do so."
"There are also the Copenhagen criteria of democracy, minorities and human rights."
"But if the applicant countries are committed to meeting the requirements and are able to qualify, then the Europe of Fifteen must not be allowed to slow the pace of enlargement, especially not just because they want to change the weighting of votes to give themselves more power."
"In 1989, we were all euphoric - at least I assume you all were, like me - at the fall of the Wall and the end of oppression, dictatorship and Communism, and we knew that we wanted to offer the people in the countries concerned the prospect of forming part of a new, undivided Europe."
"We cannot allow the stalemate on vote weighting to stop the Union from enlarging at an appropriate pace, and this is why we find it hard to accept the idea, which many Members here have suggested, of having an entirely new round of intergovernmental negotiations before the first wave of enlargement."
"That would be very dangerous, since we would risk reopening so many questions that we could unintentionally bring the preparations for enlargement to a grinding halt."
"It was agreed at Amsterdam that an institutional review is to be carried out at a later stage, once we reach 20 Member States."
"So if the first wave involves less than six Member States, there will already have to be an agreement on vote reweighting, while if the limit of 20 is exceeded, there will have to be institutional reforms which - as far as we are concerned - should cover not just the size of the Commission and vote weighting but also the decision-making procedures."
"Our whole institutional structure will be in the frame, as it were."
"It will be worth the effort, but the question is whether we should allow it to affect the pace of the first wave of enlargement."
"I personally certainly would not recommend it."
"Finally, Mr Martens spoke very passionately about the conflict between national interests and European interests which became so evident in many of the statements made and at the summit itself."
"Things are actually rather more complicated than that."
"It is not unusual for the national interest to be simply the product of political and institutional relations within the Member State concerned, and I wonder if the clash of national and European interests which you encounter in some Member States is really as clear-cut as it seems, since it is in everyone's national interest that we should make progress at European level."
"How could it not be in the Member States' interests, looking 15 or 20 years down the line from now, for us to continue to make steady progress on the construction of Europe?"
"We all know that there are times when you have to accept a slower pace, and other times when things move swiftly."
"And events are always happening in the Member States to slow things down."
"But I would suggest - and this is my final word on the subject, in the form of a sort of appeal - that we should focus not on the disappointment that many of us, honourable Members here, members of governments and the presidency, feel about certain sections of the Treaty, but on the determination that has been shown to continue down the road we have chosen, perhaps sometimes more slowly than we might wish, but nevertheless to press on tirelessly, because we want our children and our grandchildren to inherit an undivided, prosperous and peaceful Europe. If we fail now to strengthen the foundations which the Amsterdam Treaty has established, we may perhaps be making a mistake of historic proportions."
"Mr President, following the speech by the President-in-Office of the Council, I shall be relatively brief and not go back over all the points that have been raised in your speeches, which in any case generally reflect the concerns we expressed ourselves in our introduction."
"In assessing the future Treaty of Amsterdam, we are to some extent confronted with the old conundrum of whether a glass is half full or half empty."
"It all depends on how you see it, on whether your attitude to the Amsterdam Treaty is an optimistic one or a pessimistic one."
"We are well aware of the breakthroughs achieved at Amsterdam."
"The President-in-Office, too, has just explained his own disappointments and his anxieties about the future."
"On the other hand, though, we should recall what was at stake at the European Council in Amsterdam."
"I am completely certain that if it had not proved possible to reach agreement both on the single currency and on the pact for stability, growth and employment, it would also not have been possible to reach agreement on the Intergovernmental Conference."
"And vice versa."
"That was what was at stake at Amsterdam, and the Dutch presidency avoided that stumbling block."
"Indeed, it was one of the notable successes of that presidency that it achieved agreement on the preparations for the single currency because, as we know very well today, the euro is up and running along the right lines; its other achievements included the successful completion of Articles 102a and 103 of the Treaty by formulating the economic guidelines and incorporating the employment objective; again, it also succeeded in completing the negotiations at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Of course, at the Intergovernmental Conference, compromises did have to be accepted in order to achieve unanimity among the fifteen Member States. But in order to evaluate those compromises one needs to know whether they were progressive ones."
"And yes, there were progressive compromises, compromises that head in the right direction."
"There was no retreat on any point."
"That is the essential thing for all of us - the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council - if we are to derive maximum benefit from all the potential inherent in the new Treaty for the future of Europe."
"If I may, Mr President, I should like to return to a question which Mrs Fraga EstÃ©vez put directly to the President of the Commission a little while ago."
"It has nothing whatsoever to do with the European Council in Amsterdam, and in fact relates to an issue that was not even mentioned in Amsterdam: quota-hopping."
"In reply to Mrs Fraga EstÃ©vez, may I make it quite clear that it is proper for the Commission to give an answer to a Member State when it is asked a question."
"It is the most basic courtesy for a President of the Commission to reply to a Prime Minister regarding a problem with the application of Community law, which in fact is what the quota-hopping issue was about."
"Knowing that the quota-hopping issue is a very sensitive one, not just for the British but equally so for the Spanish, Mrs Bonino as the Commissioner responsible and I myself wanted to ensure that the Spanish authorities were always kept informed about contacts with the British authorities."
"The Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties, has always respected ECJ case law, and as far as quota-hopping is concerned it must be said that the Court has accepted the requirement for a genuine economic link to exist between the boat and the Member State to which the fishing quota is allocated."
"Turning more specifically to the manner in which this link can be demonstrated, I confined myself in my letter to the British Prime Minister to listing a number of possible alternatives -landing a minimum percentage of the catch in a port of the Member State that holds the quota, some of the crew members residents of that Member State, the ship sailing from that Member State on a majority of occasions - all these alternatives being compatible with the Court's case law provided they are applied in a proportionate, non-discriminating and non-cumulative manner, in other words leaving it to the owner of the boat to choose one particular way of proving this economic link."
"There was one question, or rather a concern, that was raised by a number of speakers to which I must reply, relating to the scope of the codecision procedure."
"In the Amsterdam Treaty, we did indeed agree that the scope of codecision and Parliament's involvement in it should be considerably extended."
"Some Member States said that if we moved certain articles from the qualified majority list to the unanimity list, then we would also have to move the same articles from the codecision list to the consultation list."
"The presidency did not see the logic of this, firstly because it was not specifically agreed at Amsterdam, and secondly because there have been precedents since the Maastricht Treaty that matters requiring a unanimous decision in the Council, such as the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds, could still be adopted by Parliament by codecision."
"So the presidency does not see any reason to change the decisions that were made at Amsterdam."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place immediately."
"Votes"
": rejected"
"Joint motion for a resolution on the meeting of the European Council on 16/17 June in Amsterdam"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"As I am sure you are aware, the Amsterdam Treaty has as yet to be ratified."
"It therefore has no effect on the work of this House."
"Mr President, you are absolutely right."
"That was clearly one of Mr Fabre-Aubrespy's less ingenuous interventions in this House."
"As a man who is greatly concerned with these matters, perhaps if he had attended yesterday he would have understood that today we are only establishing the estimates."
"The budget votes will be in October and will be in Strasbourg."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, I wish to make a personal statement."
"Mr Tomlinson, who unfortunately seems not to be in the Chamber at present, made a comment about me just now, in which he not only said that I had got my facts wrong - forgetting that, even before the Amsterdam Treaty, we had the Edinburgh Decision, whose existence I noted -and also stressing my absence from the Chamber yesterday afternoon."
"I could derive some satisfaction from the fact that he noted my absence, but I should simply like to remind him that I was present at the meeting of the Committee on Budgets when his report was examined, and that I participated in the discussion. The reason I was unable to attend this House yesterday was, quite simply, that I had a municipal council meeting and that the speaking time allocated to my group made it impossible for me to be present on that occasion."
"Mr President, we have heard it said on numerous occasions during this debate that the draft Amsterdam Treaty fails to prepare the Union's institutions for enlargement."
"My group agrees with that statement, though I am sure our reasons are not the same as the federalists'."
"As far as they are concerned, adapting the institutions to deal with enlargement means, quite simply, speeding up the application of their unending programme, first by generalizing majority voting on the Council."
"They hope to compensate for the risk of dispersion which they believe the prospects of enlargement pose by a tightening up of centralized procedures."
"For us, however, this strengthening of a monolithic Europe within a single institutional framework would be an error, imposing greater rigidity where what is needed is greater flexibility and greater capacity to adapt to the requirements of different peoples."
"Under these conditions, enlargement does not require any acceleration of the federalist programme."
"What is does require is a rethink on the subject of Europe, and the emergence of more differentiated institutions."
"At the Amsterdam Council, it was as if the Heads of State and Government, presented by the Dutch presidency with a preparatory text largely inspired by the old arguments, had second thoughts and ultimately preferred to wait to obtain a clearer view of the enlargements before decreeing certain reforms."
"Which is why we feel as we do."
"Granted, we are on the wrong course, but in fact the vessel is drifting, engines stopped."
"An intellectual conversion like the one awaiting Europe does not take place overnight, and it is not insignificant that the idea of reinforced co-operation has become established, pending the arrival of differentiated co-operation at some future date."
"Let us allow time for ideas to germinate."
"Mr President, unlike the majority of my group, stifled by ponderous Dutch arguments, and despite the vote on Amendment No 7, I did not vote for the resolution, which seemed to me to be too weak."
"We must call a spade a spade, and call a failure a failure."
"The mission is unaccomplished."
"The Union is not institutionally ready for enlargement."
"And that poses the problem of ratification."
"At previous key moments - the Single European Act, Maastricht - disappointment has been tempered by the feeling that, however slowly, Europe was moving forward and that its progress should be encouraged."
"Today, is ratification the short cut to genuine reform, to the essential strengthening of the institutions?"
"Frankly, I have my doubts."
"Mr President, the Treaty of Amsterdam includes a number of improvements to the existing Treaties."
"On the other hand, it singularly fails to make the necessary changes to make a union of more than 30 Member States capable of functioning."
"The improvements are numerous."
"They concern the employment chapter, the social chapter, better language on environment, public health and consumer protection, the extension of the co-decision procedure and the procedural changes to that procedure that this Parliament wanted and asked for."
"It includes many other things as well."
"Therefore, the Treaty should be ratified because it is a step forward."
"But it is an insufficient step forward, especially as regards the capacity of the Union to function with over 20 Member States."
"On that issue the European Council itself recognized that it has to return to the issue at least as regards the weighting of the votes and the size of the Commission. We must ensure that it also returns to that issue as regards the extension of the field of qualified majority voting because anything that requires unanimity in a Union of more than 20 Member States will be subject to paralysis."
"That is the challenge facing this Parliament."
"We must make sure that enlargement incorporates the necessary institutional changes."
"We are very pleased that employment has got its own chapter in the Treaty."
"Many of the governments of EU Member States are not prepared to invest public funds to get people back to work."
"As long as there is a lack of political will, particularly among the Christian Democrat/Conservative and Liberal parties, we will not see any marked improvement in employment in Europe."
"The areas which we oppose in the new Treaty include the fact that more political areas are to be centralised at EU level."
"The European Parliament will also gain co-decision rights in a significant proportion of EU legislation and will be able to influence the financing of foreign policy."
"Giving greater power to the European Parliament is a step towards increased federalism in Europe and there is reason to doubt whether the European Parliament is mature enough for this task."
"In contrast, the role of national Parliaments, the bodies which after all have the greatest democratic legitimacy in each of the European countries, has fallen into oblivion."
"The only thing which has been offered to national Parliaments is that they will have access to the Commission's Green and White Papers in good time."
"It has now been confirmed, once again, that the sessions of the European Parliament will mainly be held in Strasbourg, committee work will take place in Brussels and administration will remain in Luxembourg."
"Such duplication of buildings, unnecessary travel and transport is an unacceptable waste of resources."
"There is also a risk that enlargement of the EU to include those States in Central and Eastern Europe who now wish to join will be delayed if a new Intergovernmental Conference has to be held when five new countries have joined, as there are eleven countries interested in joining."
"The final position adopted on the common foreign and security policy was essentially based on the joint initiative taken by Sweden and Finland prior to the Intergovernmental Conference."
"This we support."
"We cannot support the text of point 10 in the joint resolution proposal which expresses disappointment over the fact that there has been no integration of the WEU and the EU."
"We think that these organisations should be kept separate."
"Nor can we support points 8 and 12."
"The common resolution proposal supports the continued implementation of EMU and the stability pact."
"We do not think that these two political actions will help to increase employment, growth or peace in Europe."
"Unfortunately they could have the opposite effect."
"It is our fundamental view that the EU should be a co-operation between independent States."
"We want to see a Europe in which democracies cooperage, not the creation of a 'superstate' ."
"It is a myth that a European Federation is the only way to achieve maximum growth and employment."
"I voted against the final resolution because of the adoption of Amendment No 12 tabled by the Greens, which rejects the protocol on the seat of the institutions."
"."
"(DA) The Amsterdam Treaty consists of a series of small steps and some great leaps in the direction of MORE UNION."
"There is not a single decision that is referred back from Brussels to the Member States and regions."
"On the other hand, there are new transfers of power and the introduction of majority voting in new areas."
"The two things will ensure more centralization of decision-making in the EU."
"In form the Amsterdam Treaty is an international agreement, but in content it is the constitution for a new state with common rights and freedoms and Union citizenship."
"Important decisions still require unanimity among the governments - but as voters, we no longer need to be asked."
"We lose our sovereignty as electorates."
"The democratically elected national parliaments lose legislative power."
"The European Parliament is to get more power to put forward amendments and veto new laws."
"But the right of veto is not democratic government and, even if the European Parliament took over the legislative power, it would be a poor replacement for the local democracy that is possible in the Member States and regions."
"There is as yet no European people that is prepared to have a common European government."
"And government without the people is government without democracy."
"That is the democratic poverty of the Union and the reason why every democrat must vote 'no' to the Treaty that has come out of Amsterdam."
"We, who prefer a Europe of Nations to a United States of Europe, also have other reasons for voting 'no' ."
"We do not want a common foreign policy with majority decisions, a common foreign ministry and a common foreign minister."
"We do not want armed forces mixed up in the civilian EU."
"We do not want a common legal affairs policy and a federal police force."
"We want gentle and friendly borders around free and democratically ruled nations and binding cooperation on all cross-frontier questions."
"In one area, the Amsterdam Treaty is better than its predecessors."
"There are kind words on employment."
"But it is difficult to discern the new jobs that are to replace those which are being swept away by the conditions for the single currency."
"Openness can now be blocked by three countries, such as Spain, France and Germany."
"The environmental guarantee is being cut back in terms of content and coverage and geographic scope."
"Enlargement in Eastern and Central Europe is being put off."
"We want to make Europe whole, not to divide it, and we call on everyone to demand a referendum."
"The conclusions of the Amsterdam summit leave a sour taste and a feeling of incompleteness, even of a missed opportunity."
"I admit, let's make no mistake about this, it is much better than Maastricht!"
"At every level, genuine progress has been made, and we should tell the negotiators as much, and congratulate the Dutch presidency."
"We agree that, when it comes to employment, the fight against unemployment and the idea of a social Europe, there has been real progress, thanks to the political changes in the United Kingdom and especially in France, with clear perspectives and a specific timetable."
"The framework is now in place; a framework within which we can act."
"It confirms much of the Commission and it confronts the European Parliament with its responsibilities."
"The Luxembourg employment summit lies ahead."
"The national governments, the Commission and Parliament no longer have any 'right to fail' , nor any right to be vague in their proposals or unclear about their commitments."
"Europe's citizens expect specific measures and a specific timetable... at least as specific as the monetary, financial and banking timetable."
"On the institutional front, the balance sheet is much more negative."
"Parliament's powers have been strengthened by the broadening of the codecision procedure, but the inability of the summit to decide on the necessary action simply to make the Council and Commission 'manageable' in the event of enlargement is a serious failure."
"We cannot reasonably open negotiations on this basis, because we would be condemning the European Union to total inefficiency and inertia."
"The European Union, then, must very quickly go into greater detail with its proposals to favour growth and social change and to counter unemployment, while at the same time reopening the debate on the European institutions, which must be very swiftly adapted and reformed if a crisis is to be avoided."
"This view was reflected in spirit in the joint motion for a resolution, and I was prepared to vote in favour."
"However, the rejection of the protocol confirming Strasbourg as the seat of the European Parliament prompted me, together with my French colleagues, to vote against."
"Like many of my colleagues in the European Parliament I wished to see a large step forward in European integration taken at Amsterdam."
"This has not happened."
"What we have is a number of small cautious steps improving and deepening integration."
"These small but significant steps are welcome nonetheless."
"The power and influence of the European Parliament has been strengthened in a number of areas, our ability as a small Member State to nominate a Commissioner has been preserved and a new chapter on employment has been inserted into the Treaty."
"Most importantly EUROPOL, the coordinating police agency, will be given an operational role and the 15 Member States have promised to strengthen the fight against drug trafficking and related crime."
"Little progress was made in improving the operation of EU foreign policy."
"We will remain impotent on the world political stage until we have the courage to develop a strong EU foreign policy."
"I have always favoured a properly negotiated enlargement of the Union to the East."
"The failure of the Amsterdam Summit to agree on institutional reform will make these negotiations complicated beyond belief as all the decisions not taken at Amsterdam will now have to be negotiated with the acceding countries."
"My remarks today are made in full awareness of the responsibilities facing us - facing me."
"As a new Member of this Parliament, may I first thank Honourable Members for the way I have been welcomed here - the advantage of being a novice."
"I shall be as brief, simple and straightforward as possible."
"Amsterdam has brought both results and disappointments."
"But the bottom line, it must be said, is that Amsterdam is a failure for Europe, and unless we can remedy that failure today we shall face more serious failures tomorrow."
"I shall not dwell on the positive achievements of Amsterdam - others have already done so, excessively in some cases."
"So what are the shortcomings and the failures?"
"I would list the principal ones as follows: 1. social issues lack a proper legal basis and the necessary financial resources; 2. the Union has not been endowed with the legal personality it needs; 3. hopes of a common defence policy have become more remote; 4. there are insufficient resources for common foreign policies; 5. reinforced co-operation has been virtually stalemated in advance by the conditions for its implementation: those states which want to go farthest will be unable to do so; 6. the citizen, once again, has been forgotten: the texts are becoming more and more incomprehensible, debates more and more obscure, and citizens' rights are still not clearly safeguarded."
"How can we really expect the public, in their day-to-day lives, to accept that this Europe, with its much-vaunted merits, is indeed beneficial?"
"And, last but not least, 7. the reform of the institutions has, in essence, been deferred until the third millennium."
"Let me dwell for a moment on this fundamental point. I have attended the meetings of the Committee on Institutional Affairs since 18 June."
"The issue here is not legalistic quibbling but the future of the enlarged Union."
"The Union cannot move forward on a single monetary leg."
"It cannot move forward on two legs - one monetary, the other social."
"Because the legs cannot move, cannot act, without a brain to give them orders."
"And that brain is policy, and, therefore, the institutional structure that allows it."
"It means taking decisions by a majority vote, not unanimously."
"To be even more specific, it means the taking of genuinely European decisions, that is by a majority vote, rather than paralysis or the accumulation of nationalistic micro-decisions."
"If we can agree on this diagnosis, we need to seek the means to cure the patient, and especially to prevent his disease becoming chronic."
"The medication is already known: the reform of the institutions and, primarily, the extension of majority voting."
"All we need is for the patient to agree to take the medication."
"Today, he is refusing to do so."
"We must explain that he needs it, and strongly urge him to swallow it."
"With this in mind, let us not be too diplomatic today."
"That is not our job."
"Let us say, clearly and concisely, that it won't do."
"And, before any enlargement takes place, let us demand a further review of the Treaties, which in essence means a review of the European constitution."
"Let us ensure that this review takes place more democratically and transparently, so that the peoples of Europe can begin to understand it and, consequently, to support it."
"Many voices have been raised in this House to say the same thing."
"An amendment tabled by members of various groups, in paragraph 1 of the compromise motion, asserts it forcibly."
"The PSE, at the urging of the French socialist delegation, has taken its cue from that motion and supports the essential demand: reform of the institutions, now."
"We welcome that."
"If we are firm in our criticisms and our proposals, we may cause a little alarm today but we shall serve a purpose tomorrow."
"I hope I have not alarmed you too much, and that I can serve a purpose tomorrow."
"I shall vote in favour of the joint motion for a resolution accepting as a whole the result of the European Council held in Amsterdam, especially the new Treaty to be known as the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"However I am not fully happy about it."
"In any case the best of the Amsterdam agreement is that agreement was reached as regards the stability and growth pact, thus strengthening the agreement to realise Economic and Monetary Union and the Euro within the time-limit and under the conditions envisaged and, formally, we have a new Treaty, although this new Treaty cannot hide the major gaps and worrying delays decided on key questions."
"The European Union has for years lacked leadership and ambition."
"It is not responding to the challenges of the present world situation, nor is it taking advantage of the extraordinary possibilities available to the EU following the situation created when the Soviet Union broke up and Central and Eastern European companies gained access and freedom which the European Union should welcome with generous solidarity."
"I repeat my concern at the excessive weight and veto of the Member States in the decision-making process, the modest progress in the role attributed to the Committee of the Regions and the limitations now in existence for the development of European policies in the field of external relations, justice and domestic policy, even within the scope of economic and monetary policy which is absolutely necessary and essential since we are to have an internal European market and the prospect of Economic and Monetary Union and a single European currency."
"I again condemn the serious uncertainty created because no agreement was reached on the necessary institutional strengthening for the political leadership which the European Union requires for the twenty-first century."
"."
"(DA) The Danish Social Democrats have one or two objections to the resolution."
"Paragraph 10 on the integration of the WEU into the EU cannot be supported because of a Danish reservation."
"In addition, it is not possible to support the incorporation of the Schengen Agreement into the Treaty, and we do not consider that enlargement has become more difficult following the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"We are not therefore voting for paragraph 5."
"Despite these objections, we vote for the resolution because it affirms that the areas that are most important to us, such as openness, democracy, human rights, the environment, consumer protection and employment have been given a higher priority in the new Treaty."
"Lindqvist (ELDR), Eriksson, SeppÃ¤nen, SjÃ¶stedt and Svensson (GUE/NGL), Gahrton, Holm, Lindholm and SchÃ¶rling (V), Bonde (I-EDN), in writing."
"(SV) Perhaps the Amsterdam Treaty does not go as far as many would have liked or as many feared."
"But even so the power of the EU will greatly increase and it will be the supranational bodies, the European Parliament, the Commission and the Court which gain increased power."
"The European Parliament will gain co-decision rights in approximately 75 % of real EU legislation and influence over the financing of foreign policy."
"The Commission and the Court will, for example, have more say in issues which previously fell into the area of inter state co-operation, that is in issues concerning foreign and security policy and domestic and justice matters."
"In a separate protocol, because of the planned enlargement of the EU, there is a promise of more votes to those countries with two Commissioners, in other words the larger countries."
"The only thing of any substance offered to the National Parliaments is access to the Commission's Green and White Papers in good time."
"The development of the Union should be placed in the wider context as well."
"The fundamental laws of the EU have changed completely three times during the last eleven years."
"The European Union Act in 1980 introduced majority decision making on a large scale, particularly in order to promote free movement of goods, labour and capital, which radically restricted the sovereignty of Member States."
"The Maastricht Treaty in 1991 introduced new regulations for foreign policy and for domestic and justice affairs."
"But above all Maastricht was a breakthrough for EMU."
"Currency union in itself will lead to closer integration and a real reduction in self-determination for the Member States."
"The Amsterdam Treaty is confirmation that the Union is moving constantly towards ever closer union, a federation, although the speed and intensity of progress in this direction may vary."
"The Amsterdam EU Treaty is an assault on democracy."
"I believe that the resolution tabled by the major political groups does not adequately reflect the gravity of its consequences."
"For that reason I have voted against that resolution."
"Democracy was ruled out of bounds by EU leaders for some of the most important developments made by the Treaty, especially in the area of justice and home affairs."
"The European Parliament was given a mere consultative role in most justice developments but now has no say whatsoever on Europol, the federal police force."
"The role of the European Court of Justice in most developments remains unclear."
"On environment policy, the Treaty has become a charter for stagnation."
"Member States will be barred from implementing ambitious strategies for environmental protection that went beyond the EU norm."
"Effective waste management measures, such as Denmark's ban on aluminium drink cans, would be among those placed in jeopardy."
"The goal of boosting employment stated in the Treaty is incompatible with efforts to achieve economic and monetary union (EMU)."
"It is vital that the Treaty is put to referendums in all the Member States which have the referendum instrument."
"Otherwise citizens will be denied any real voice in the EU's future development."
"The democratic deficit will be greatly widened."
"I reject suggestions that fears over Irish neutrality were allayed at Amsterdam."
"Although a proposed merger between the EU and the nuclear-armed Western European Union (WEU) was postponed, the Treaty still provides for 'the progressive framing of a common defence policy [which] will be supported, as Member States consider appropriate, by cooperation between them in the field of armaments' ."
"There is no doubt that Ireland is being sucked into a military union, which wants the support of its own arms industry."
"The Amsterdam Summit was very disappointing and even a serious failure."
"Hopes were not high, but the results were even more disastrous than expected."
"In the first place and as regards the institutional questions, one basic conclusion needs to be borne in mind: the planned amendments to the Treaty are fully within the spirit of Maastricht and do not take the slightest account of the marked reservations and mounting opposition which has grown up and is still growing up on all fronts."
"It is true that some of the negative proposals which were on the table were not, at least specifically, considered."
"There is an insistence on a federal framework, although it has not been adopted: decision-making powers are concentrated at Community level, the citizens are ever more remote from the decision-making and consequently democratic deficits are increased."
"At the same time, at the economic and social levels there are one or two aspects which need to be mentioned."
"First unemployment and its inevitable link with a forced march towards a single currency and the stability pact - fundamental questions at the present moment - were finally included on the agenda for the Summit, as we had always advocated."
"In spite of that, the Council decisions in this field are disappointing."
"There are too many intentions and too few measures and means for putting them into practice."
"The present restrictive policy is continued for the most part with the inevitable negative effects on the field of employment and at the same time there is a total lack of effective measures and means for fighting unemployment; that runs completely counter to the intentions stated in the social field."
"A majority in the European Parliament is still far removed from reality and the anxieties and concerns of the citizens and is again showing an inclination to blindly follow the relevant Council decisions."
"That seems clear from the motion for a resolution under discussion. We shall therefore not support it or vote for it."
"Following the accusations against European public opinion - with great headlines in the media, citing nationalist prejudices and visions in the building of Europe, it is a good thing for the European Parliament to be the forum for the expression of the views of the institutions - the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament."
"Over and above any detailed analysis, the message which should get through to public opinion is that the Treaty of Amsterdam is a new, positive step towards the political building of Europe."
"Having said that, one negative point is that there is a lack of political willpower to move forward in fields which were perfectly defined in the preparatory stages."
"We must condemn the basically nationalistic type of view adopted by quite a number of Heads of State and Government, forgetting that the best defence for national interests is within the EC."
"The existence of 14 protocols and other such statements in itself constitutes a failure by the European Council which did not have the political stature historically required to move forward in unity whilst preserving diversity."
"Myopia ruled the day."
"Nor was the long wording of the preamble a good sign, but it was rather a further indication of the denaturing of the Treaty, which is peppered with articles laying down petty rules."
"One further cause for concern is the steps taken by some governments which have recently come to power and have not followed the principle of institutional loyalty which should oblige governments to adhere to agreements already signed."
"The citizens should demand that European policy be made a state matter quite apart from the whims of the previous government."
"I have always maintained that it is perfectly possible to evaluate progress."
"All aspects of communitization of the second and third pillars of the second and third pillars would be a clear sign of real willpower to pursue European integration."
"If reasonable progress has been made with the third pillar and within the scope of foreign and security policy, all will depend upon the political willpower shown by the Heads of Government."
"But the citizens should not blame Europe for any possible failure in this field; it is non-Europe which is responsible."
"The extension of voting by qualified majority and of policies governed by the co-decision process is another key political barometer."
"Certain significant aspects of progress must be noted: Parliament and the Council are in certain fields still redressing the balance of their power for the benefit of European Unity."
"Institutional reform is still pending, but it is better that it should be."
"Some of the proposals debated entail a denaturing of the spirit of the Treaties."
"The Council is clinging on to the right of veto, unanimity and blocking majorities."
"They give it the illusion that it has decision-making power."
"However, it is well known that solitary voting never achieved anything other than political isolation."
"The famous blocking minority, as its name indicates, serves only to delay the building of Europe."
"It would be impossible to understand the scope of the Treaty of Amsterdam without mentioning that its birth was preceded by the ratification of the irreversible launching of the single currency."
"The Euro will dictate all the most nationalistic and individualistic trends."
"We should be glad: Europe is continuing its inexorable political construction."
"Fontaine report (A4-0204/97)"
"We consider the report presented by the rapporteur contains a significantly better proposed Directive than the proposal from the Commission."
"Above all we would like to emphasise the proposals on employee rights put forward in the report."
"It is important to promote the protection of the employee and the small shareholder in this respect."
"But the adopted position in question only applies if a Directive is to be established at Community level."
"We consider it doubtful that there is a real need for a Directive at Community level."
"Tomlinson report (A4-0178/97)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group does not give its approval to the Tomlinson report."
"It is, in fact, unacceptable for five reasons."
"This report is unacceptable, first, because - as I said earlier - it is presented during a supplementary part-session in Brussels whereas the budgetary session is held, and will continue to be held, in Strasbourg."
"This report is unacceptable in that it envisages eleven five-day part-sessions in Strasbourg and seven additional part-sessions in Brussels, which is contrary to the Treaties, whether we refer to the Edinburgh compromise or to what will shortly become Community law in the wake of the Amsterdam European Council meeting."
"The report is also unacceptable in what it has to say about the reimbursements, charges and expenses of Members of the European Parliament."
"How can we overlook the hypocrisy demonstrated by our colleagues in adopting the proposed amendment when we know - and I am particularly well placed to know, because I am a member of the working group - that the working group set up by the Bureau is going to lead to nothing."
"Nothing has changed regarding this very important point."
"The report is also unacceptable with regard to Parliament's buildings."
"The rapporteur, Mr Tomlinson, worries about excessive reliance on monies obtained from the European taxpayer."
"It's true, we need only look around, inside and outside this Chamber, and we will see that we could hardly build or buy much more than we already have built and bought here in Brussels."
"Finally, the report is unacceptable in that it deals with the financing of the European political groups."
"The budgetary will is further increased to respond to the aim fixed by Article 138a of the Treaty, by adapting the nomenclature of Chapter 37, even though there is no necessity to justify this creation."
"All this presages nothing good for the 1998 budget."
"We await that budget and we shall participate in its discussion, but the decisions that have been taken - because decisions they are - have not directed that budget along the right lines."
"We must make some comment on this budget even if we are voting for the report."
"1.The most ridiculous thing from a cost point of view is that Parliament is located in three different working areas."
"This gives rise to excessive and unnecessary administrative costs but is not something which Parliament itself can control.2.It is unreasonable that travel expenses are paid according to a fixed rate per kilometre."
"Travel expenses can be easily administered by giving Parliamentarians travel cards."
"Our voters rightly wonder what we are doing with their money, and they have taken exception, amongst other things, to our generous expenses."
"Almost BFR 2 billion in travel and subsistence allowances for 626 Members really is a very considerable sum indeed."
"At the end of last year, after yet more critical coverage in the press, the President of Parliament promised that improvements would be made, but since then all that has happened is that a Bureau working party has been set up."
"The rapporteur, Mr Tomlinson, has taken a step in the right direction, for which I congratulate him, but I still think that the voters are waiting for a clearer signal from us."
"That is why I and a number of colleagues have tabled an amendment to the effect that travel and subsistence allowances can only be refunded on the basis of the actual costs incurred, for which documentary evidence must be provided."
"Approving this amendment would show public opinion that we mean business."
"Openness and transparency also mean that every citizen of the Union should be able to read about the activities of the EP in his or her own language."
"We should like to see this principle of 'equality' set in stone, as the Amsterdam summit set it in the Treaty."
"We agree generally with the proposals put forward by the rapporteur with respect to the budget."
"It is a good thing, for example, that there is finally to be an environmental review of the European Parliament buildings and methods of working which hopefully will lead to better use of information technology in Parliament."
"With regard to amendment proposal 3, which concerns the Members' pension fund, we have of course decided to vote in favour of this."
"This is a moral and ethical matter which has great symbolic value."
"It is important that the Members who belong to the pension fund are allowed to pay from their own accounts, which means that Members must actively participate instead of having the amount deducted directly from their allowances."
"We are voting against the proposal to establish a staff shop in the European Parliament's new building in Brussels."
"It is unacceptable to have separate shops selling tax free goods to the 'EU elite' who are already taxed at a low level on their salaries."
"We are hesitant about the allocation of money for European Political parties as in some cases they could be seen as a fanciful excuse for increased subsidies and not a requirement of the people."
"On the other hand we support the motion that all official languages should be treated equally in the European Parliament, and that all documents used must be translated into each of these languages."
"Finally, we support amendment proposal No. 15 which states that travel expenses for members should only be paid for actual costs incurred and not, as they currently are, in the form of a generally high allowance which does not require receipts showing actual costs."
"."
"(DA) I have voted for Amendment No 15 to paragraph 10 from Mr De Coene, despite the fact that I sit on the working group in Parliament whose task is to draft proposals on changes to the conditions under which Members work."
"I agree that the rules on travel should be amended so that Members are refunded for actual travel expenses duly documented."
"On the other hand, it would surely be too bureaucratic if expenses for entertainment and eating out etc were to be covered by refunds of expenditure actually incurred."
"In that area both public bodies and private firms apply a form of per diem expenses."
"We must make some comment on this budget even if we are voting for the report."
"1.The most ridiculous thing from a cost point of view is the fact that Parliament is located in three different places."
"This gives rise to excessive and unnecessary administrative costs but is not something which Parliament itself can control.2.It is unreasonable that travel expenses are paid according to a fixed rate per kilometre."
"Travel expenses can be easily administered by giving Parliamentarians travel cards.3.Furthermore, we think that the EU parliamentarians' pension fund should be self sufficient and not subsidised by public EU funds."
"Previous subsidies ought, therefore. to be reclaimed."
"The system of travel expenses and allowances must be changed to bring it into line with what is acceptable to the general public."
"The expenses system must be more open, easier to follow and easier to control."
"Travel expenses should be refunded on submission of a receipt."
"The EU budget should not be used to finance European parties."
"There must be a complete cost review of all buildings which have been or are being built in Parliament's three working locations to examine whether resources are being used effectively."
"Parliament must do its utmost to ensure that the buildings which have been built, the administrative buildings in Brussels for example, are not under-utilised or used in such a way which gives rise to unnecessary costs for the people."
"STOA is the European Parliament's office for Scientific and Technical Options Assessment."
"Although administratively it forms part of Parliament's Directorate of Studies (DG IV), it is nevertheless an independent assessment body working for our institution."
"It is steered by a group of Members of Parliament representing each of the specialized committees: the STOA panel."
"STOA assists these committees in areas where science and technology play a dominant role."
"The STOA's work programme is drawn up at the end of each year for the coming year, in response to proposals from the Members of the various committees and taking due account of Parliament's timetable."
"It is adopted by the STOA panel and by the Bureau of Parliament."
"The reports prepared by external contractors, selected by invitation to tender, result in working documents that are presented to the STOA panel before being considered as definitive STOA documents."
"As a result of this reorientation, STOA is an assessment office that assists the activities of Parliament and is better co-ordinated with the work of the committees, while retaining its independent expert status."
"It is therefore clear that the merging of the two budget items 260 and 261 is incompatible with the constant efforts of STOA to guarantee management based on greater budgetary transparency: the appropriations included in item 261 are specifically intended to finance STOA, whose mandate was confirmed by the Bureau at its meeting of 17 February 1997."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control also receives a quarterly report on the implementation of the budget."
"Thus, the adoption of paragraph 37, and in particular the one-third reduction in the pre-allocated amounts, would result in the circumventing of the political responsibility exercisedby the Bureau of Parliament and the STOA panel, in favour of a purely administrative form of management involving at least three authorizing officers."
"Apart from casting doubt on democratic control, such an arrangement would lengthen the reporting period and jeopardize the recently restored co-ordination of the work of STOA with that of the committees."
"For all these reasons, and in agreement with the members of the STOA panel, I ask you to vote against paragraph 37 of the motion for a resolution contained in the Tomlinson report, in order to enable STOA to continue assisting the committees in their legislative activities involving science and technology, upon which, among other things, the future of the European Union's economy depends."
"The completion of the new buildings in Strasbourg and Brussels presents huge budgetary problems for the European Parliament, and cuts will have to be made in other items to finance them."
"The Tomlinson report makes a start on this by proposing, amongst other measures, that the establishment plan should be stabilized."
"However, further cutbacks will also be needed before Parliament's budget can be definitively adopted."
"With the current Tomlinson package, we are still more than ECU 4 million above the group chairmen's recommendation of 1988 that Parliament's budget should not exceed 20 % of total administrative expenditure."
"An additional factor is that, in drawing up its estimates, the Bureau has assumed a very favourable ECU/BFR rate, but if the current positive trend were to change in 1998, the Bureau would have serious problems."
"Something will have to be done, amongst other things, about the voluntary pension scheme for Members."
"The expenditure here may be 28 % less than in 1997, but this figure gives a misleading impression, because there was an extremely large deficit in previous years, two thirds of which was made up by Parliament anyway."
"Parliament will also have to make some very necessary savings on travel and subsistence allowances."
"It is extremely important that the working party should deal with these problems and bring forward some proposals as soon as possible, so that they can be included in the budgetary procedure for 1998."
"I support the rapporteur's proposal to freeze travel and subsistence allowances at 1997 levels pending the working party's conclusions."
"I also support the idea that the budget heading for the European political parties should be dropped, but I am opposed to the inclusion of a reference to Article 138a of the Treaty in the remarks on items 3705, 3706 and 3707, which would open the way for funding for international political structures which are quite separate from the European Parliament."
"I also object to the creation of a new A7 post for the European Ombudsman."
"This institution seems to be expanding endlessly, and particularly at a time when the budget margins are small, the block on recruitment recommended by the Bureau should surely also apply to the Ombudsman."
"To sum up, I broadly support the Tomlinson report, but extra cuts will have to be made in a number of areas before the first reading if we are to prevent Parliament from claiming more than 20 % of category 5 for itself in 1998."
"Hendrick report (A4-0163/97)"
"."
"(DA) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a Council Decision adopting a multiannual Community programme to stimulate the establishment of the information society in Europe."
"The development of the information society in Europe is having a dramatic influence on the way people live, learn and work."
"Marginalization and exclusion are very real risks in the context of the development of new information and communications technologies."
"The Danish Social Democrats want to avoid new class divisions in society due to the development of the information society and therefore take a very positive view of initiatives in which the legislator plays an active role in influencing developments."
"For that reason the Danish Social Democrats voted 'yes' ."
"But the Danish Social Democrats are opposed to the proposed legal basis for this measure."
"It is a fundamental principle of law that the legal basis used for legislation should be as specific as possible."
"We think that other legal bases could be used, such as provisions authorizing initiatives in the field of the internal market, TENs, education, the environment and transport."
"To disseminate 'information' on the information society - who could gainsay that?"
"Workers, employees, those working in the educational and social fields will all need far more information than is circulated today if they are to master the changes summarized under the heading 'information society' ."
"But that is not enough - and even 'information' cannot just be absorbed passively!"
"We finally need a broad social debate, a democratic discussion on the forms of the 'information society' ."
"The question cannot simply be: ' how do we adjust to the new situation' , but 'what kind of information society' do we want, what form should we give it?"
"Let me dare to make a prediction: unless the EU itself makes political provision for a democratic debate on the information society in Europe, the people will take over this task and fight for it themselves."
"If the Commission and the Council continue to fail to tackle this task, the political forces in this Union will simply have to begin here and now to get a social debate under way."
"Boogerd-Quaak (A4-0208/97)"
"Let me simply point out that Commissioner Bangemann, who has been plaguing us for years with his policy of small steps (which he describes as inevitable for technical reasons), has already promised to present this House with a framework directive on preparing for the information society."
"We are waiting for it!"
"However, the aim must not be to establish deregulation and privatization as the main principle of our technically imparted social and cultural communication processes, as Commissioner Bangemann still wants (cf. the 'convergence' debate)."
"On the contrary, we must in fact try to determine more clearly what the limits and conditions are of private acquisition, to allow people to organize and structure media communications democratically themselves again and take this out of the hands of the billionaire monopolies that are trying to acquire private ownership of the 'collective idea' of the 'global village' as a new source of wealth."
"Ahlqvist report (A4-0200/97)"
"I have voted for this report today as I share the rapporteur's welcome for the Commission Communication on Learning in the Information Society."
"As a former teacher myself, I am struck by both the opportunities and the challenges which information technology presents to our education services."
"The Commission's proposals to encourage the use of multimedia teaching are therefore to be supported."
"One of the best ways for children to learn is by doing things and this is made much easier if the child or student is able to use a multimedia computer."
"Such technology is often more familiar to children than adults, so the Commission is right to encourage teachers to learn how to us I.T. to improve their teaching."
"However, I share the rapporteur's concern that a further objective needs to be put into the Commission's Action Plan."
"There is a danger of simply using technology for its own sake without thinking through its impact on all aspects of our life."
"Children should be encouraged to see information technology as not just something they use at school to learn or at home to play games on."
"It will affect their whole lives in future."
"The more familiar our young people are with such technology at an early age, the more likely they are to make the systems work for them - rather than the other way around."
"In the information society in its globalized state anyone not moving forwards is moving backwards."
"Urgent, on-going and coordinated action is therefore needed by the Member States to create a European industry which is sound in content and new generations who are in general able to use the information and communication technologies to advantage, that is to improve the quality of life."
"For such education to be provided effectively and swiftly we must promote the translation into other European languages of the best educational software and multi-media products made in Europe, in particularly those which encourage education for citizenship."
"Finally, there should be a survey of the existing non-government cultural bodies in each Member State which could actively support schools in the development of projects at grass-roots level as the only way of avoiding social fragmentation. The greatest danger to be avoided."
"Chesa report (A4-0032/97)"
"We have voted in favour of the report by Mr Raymond Chesa on co-operation with Kirgizistan."
"We have done so because we naturally support the establishment of economic and trade relations with all the new States which have grown up following the break-up of the Soviet Union."
"But we are critical of the structure of the report which concentrates so greatly on economic liberalisation and privatisation."
"In a country where, according to the report, 70 percent of the population live in poverty, greater attention should have been paid to the question of how there can be real development linked with a fair distribution of resources."
"Hormone treated meat"
"Mr President, the European Parliament is rightly in revolt against the preliminary report by the World Trade Organization which, responding to a complaint by the United States and Canada, condemns the European ban on imports of hormone-treated meat."
"The unfortunate thing about this business is that the report's argument is based, in particular, on a provision contained in the agreements of the Uruguay Round, approved by this House in 1994."
"Article 2 of the agreement on health and plant health measures provides for the possibility of restrictions on international trade in order to protect human health only if those restrictions are based on scientific proof."
"Now, in the case of growth hormones although we have very serious indications that they are harmful, we do not have absolute proof."
"Of course, logic dictates that the principle of caution should be enough to justify our ban."
"Unfortunately, however, Article 2 of the agreement to which I have referred makes no mention of the principle of caution."
"Nor does it make any reference to the fundamental right of peoples to choose their form of agriculture, food, way of life and society."
"During the mad cow crisis, many Honourable Members accused the European Commission of having made the free movement of goods a higher priority than consumer health."
"Now here we are again with precisely the same problem, this time with the aggravating circumstance that this disastrous policy has been inscribed on a tablet of stone - an international treaty."
"Brussels today is being hounded by the consequences of its past actions."
"We therefore call upon the institutions of the European Union not just to refuse to yield in this matter of hormonetreated meat but to lodge an official request for the renegotiation of the GATT."
"The case of the hormone-treated meat shows, yet again, just how many defects and injustices that treaty contains."
"To challenge them is not a matter of protectionism but the just defence of our peoples' rights."
"."
"(DA) The Danish Social Democrats consider that the WTO panel which dealt with the complaint of the USA over the EU ban on the import of beef treated with hormones did not look at the right context for this affair."
"The panel's approach is that it is a question whether the EU has a consistent policy in the field of concern over hormone residues in beef."
"Three issues are mentioned: the EU has no limits for the content of natural hormones in meat, the EU has no maximum values for residual concentrations of hormones for the veterinary treatment of animals and, finally, the EU allows Carbadox to be used as a growth promoter in pig production."
"We do not think that matters can be presented in a manner such that, if one thing can be accepted, then the other must also be accepted."
"Health measures must of course be based on scientific principles, but complete scientific certainty and unanimity are rare."
"If there is scientific uncertainty as to the harmfulness of a substance, the government must be free to give consumers the benefit of the precautionary principle."
"We think that the EU's consumer policy in particular should be based on this thinking and that this is where the great difference arises between the WTO and the EU."
"International trade must be built on the rights of consumers and concern for public health, not on the interests of the market."
"The recent arbitrary decision by the World Trade Organization on the banana market has revealed a growing and perceptible tendency for this Organization to bend to the interests and wishes of the American economy."
"This time the WTO decision that the measures banning the importation of meat treated with hormones are not justified goes beyond the bounds of what is acceptable, since it disregards scientific and veterinary opinion, shows contempt for public health, forgets the minimum rules for the health and welfare of animals and tries to undermine the confidence of consumers as a whole in the quality of meat sold in the European Union."
"An appeal must be made against that arbitrary WTO decision, but also the current ban on importation from the USA and Canada of meat from animals treated with growth hormones must be firmly upheld by means of stepping up external and internal controls to make that decision effective."
"We must also insist on a total ban on hormones at world level."
"Continuing that line, public health and animal health must be protected and we must stop or prevent the spread of new diseases such as BSE."
"For all the above reasons we shall vote in favour of the political resolution approved today by Parliament."
"Novo Belenguer report (A4-0210/97)"
"One year after the reform of the Structural Funds for the period 1994-1999, the Commission has presented its report on their implementation."
"Unfortunately, the verdict still has to be extremely unfavourable."
"Unfavourable as regards the slowness of the administrative procedures; unfavourable as regards the under-implementation of the appropriations by the Member States; and unfavourable as regards respect for the principle of additionality."
"I congratulate the rapporteur for the Committee on Regional Policy on his work, and on his presentation of all these criticisms."
"In my capacity as the elected representative of an Objective 2 canton, I, like all the other local actors (the relevant authorities and the social partners), am confronted with these problems with the setting-up of projects to create jobs."
"We have a duty to set up a flexible system, involving the simplification of the decision-making procedures and greater additionality with other Community policies (employment SMEs, the campaign against exclusion)."
"I think Mr Novo's report will provide a sound basis for discussion in the run-up to the official Commission proposal on the forthcoming reform of the Structural Funds."
"The Structural Funds, as you all know, are one of the essential elements of the European Union's economic and social cohesion policy."
"It is therefore extremely important that we should be vigilant regarding their implementation, to ensure that they are as effective as they possibly can be."
"Mr Novo Belenguer's report has the virtue of singling out the continuing problems with the management and implementation of the Structural Funds, and of proposing lines of action to remedy these defects."
"That was why I voted for it."
"I would simply like to stress two points made in that report which seem to me very important."
"The first is the underimplementation of the Structural Funds."
"The problem is a substantial one, even though today's figures are less alarming than they were in 1995, the first year of the programming period."
"I also speak as the representative of a French department."
"This under-consumption is closely linked to the cumbersome procedures that have to be confronted by those involved in local development."
"It seems necessary for the implementation procedures to be simplified, at both Commission and Member State level."
"One way of achieving this simplification, undoubtedly, is by reducing the number of Community initiative programmes so as to avoid the piecemeal scattering of funds and provide the local actors with a clearer framework."
"Let me also briefly mention the importance of partnership, emphasized by Mr Novo Belenguer in his report."
"Great advances have already been achieved, but it is essential to continue along the same lines."
"By doing so, we shall achieve a better match between local needs and the utilization of the Structural Funds."
"Finally, I cannot conclude without expressing my disappointment regarding the recent decisions made at the Amsterdam summit."
"Mr Novo Belenguer's report makes clear the need for the European Parliament to be a joint legislator on issues associated with the Structural Funds."
"I share that opinion."
"However, contrary to what was proposed by the Dutch presidency, the codecision procedure has not been adopted for the provisions of Article 130d concerning the Structural and Cohesion Funds."
"The assent procedure remains in place."
"I regret that very much, and I hope that between now and the signing of the Treaty in October 1997 the European Parliament will be able to indicate its disagreement on this point."
"I am happy to support this report today."
"I think that people across the European Union will share the rapporteur's wish to see a more effective system for spending European funding in our regions."
"Those who bid for EU funding know that money is limited."
"They appreciate that they have to come up with high quality projects in order to be considered."
"So it is unacceptable that so much money allocated for regional and social projects goes unspent."
"It is simply unjust that some projects receive no money, that others only receive a minimum amount, whilst elsewhere in the budget precious funds sit in the bank unused."
"I am frankly amazed that Germany, which contributes so much to the EU budget, is so slow to take its fair share out - two-thirds of the Social Fund money allocated to Germany could not be assigned to projects."
"I agree with the rapporteur that we should decentralize decision-making on funds, involve local authorities more in the whole process and see the Commission as a kind of regulator to see that funds are spent properly."
"If there are countries unwilling or unable to spend their allotted share of EU funds, I can assure them that many deserving groups and individuals in my own constituency would be happy to put those funds to good use."
"This waste of scarce resources has to stop."
"I hope this report will act as a spur to the Commission and the Council to act quickly on this problem."
"That concludes Voting Time."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"(The sitting was closed at 1.20 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 26 June 1997."
"Statement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, all honest men and women in the Basque Country and throughout Spain were, barely 48 hours ago, devastated by the brutal assassination of Miguel Angel Blanco, an Ermua town councillor."
"In recent days, millions of such men and women have taken to the streets in an impressive display of solidarity, shouting 'End all violence' and declaring 'Yes to freedom, peace and tolerance' ."
"Consistent with its evolution and the line it has always taken in the past, the European Parliament most emphatically condemns not only this odious attack on fellowship but also the attempt made to impose the will of a minority on the democratically elected majority."
"Nor can we tolerate the mere fact of representing one's fellow citizens being grounds for losing one's life."
"We in Europe have too often experienced the dark side of dictatorship and intransigence not to be able to recognize it once again in those who murdered one of our fellow citizens last Saturday."
"We would like to offer our most sincere condolences to the family of Miguel Angel Blanco and our support at this difficult time."
"We must offer our express support, also, to the democratic political forces which have unanimously called for ETA and Herri Batasuna to be ostracized both inside and outside Spain."
"I would call upon all of you, as representatives of the citizens of Europe, to join with me in a minute's silence in tribute to this cry of sorrow, but also of hope, which has poured forth spontaneously from the people."
"We, ladies and gentlemen, are Miguel Angel, too."
"(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of the sitting of 26 June 1997 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, there is a mistake in the verbatim report of the sitting of 25 June."
"In the evening, we discussed the allocation of funding under the PHARE programme, and I said that it would be better to increase the number of staff working on this at the Commission to ensure that the funding was allocated more effectively."
"I used the term 'bestaffing ' , but this has unfortunately come out in the verbatim report as 'bestraffing ' , which is completely wrong."
"It is also entirely wrong that PHARE funding should be used in Slovakia to buy history books containing xenophobic comments, and it is regrettable that the Council will not give me an answer to my questions."
"Thank you, Mrs van Bladel, although I would point out that this does not relate to the Minutes of the sitting but to the verbatim report, which includes all speeches in their entirety."
"However, we will take note of your point."
"We shall now hear from Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz."
"Mr President, could you please find out how it could possibly happen that the representative of the Dutch presidency-in-office of the Council in Zimbabwe, in reply to a question by the local NGO and government representatives, stated the European Parliament's position on CITES."
"Just eight days earlier, the European Parliament had adopted a resolution in the topical and urgent debate which runs to about three pages in length."
"And yet the presidency's representative said in as many words that the European Parliament had no position on this!"
"I find that scandalous."
"We are not playing at parliaments here, we are a parliament."
"It really is about time that the representatives of the Council took note of that fact!"
"The Council representative cannot say that Parliament has no opinion on something just a week after Parliament has adopted a three-page resolution in its topical and urgent debate."
"Thank you, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, I can assure you that we will indeed verify precisely what happened and what the Dutch presidency said and, if necessary, I shall approach it to draw its attention to the matter."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Mr President, on 12 May I asked you a question about a call for tenders for the supply of furniture to Parliament."
"You told me to put the question in writing, which I did on 14 May."
"Nine weeks have now passed and I have still not received an answer."
"On 26 June, I asked you at the Brussels part-session when I could expect a reply, and you said it would be before the next Strasbourg part-session."
"The first day of that has now arrived, and I have still not received a reply."
"I do not understand how you can treat firms in the Union as you are doing, and this was what I wanted to ask you about."
"What kind of an example of transparency is this on the part of Parliament?"
"I should be grateful for an answer from your office by tomorrow at the latest."
"Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, you are right that I said you would have your reply before the beginning of this week, but there are a great many questions to answer and the services prepare replies as and when they can."
"What is more, these replies have to be submitted via the Bureau - I do not draft them personally."
"In any case, as the Bureau will be meeting this afternoon and on Thursday of this week, I hope that you will receive your answer this week."
"We shall now hear from Mr Gallagher."
"Mr President, I wish to refer to a very serious incident which occurred over the week-end in my constituency in County Mayo."
"In the villages of Glencullen, Glenamoy and Bangor Erris, many families were left homeless when flash floods swept through their homes, rivers burst their banks, floods caused landslides, left roads impassable and destroyed farm buildings and houses."
"Sheep and cattle were lost, crops destroyed, and it was nothing short of a miracle that human lives were not lost."
"This will have serious economic and social consequences for that entire region."
"I would ask Parliament to support a call to the Commission to make funding available to assist these people who have suffered as a result of this natural disaster."
"I realize that it is not the only region in Europe that has suffered - there have been disasters in other areas - and I hope that Parliament will support a call to the Commission to make the necessary funding available to this region of Mayo."
"Thank you, Mr Gallagher, this is not, however, an item on the agenda."
"The normal channel for such items is the topical and urgent debate."
"Mr Titley would like to speak."
"Mr President, one week ago today a bus carrying pupils from St James's School, Bolton, which is part of my constituency, was involved in a serious accident in the French Alps."
"As a result of that accident, three young people lost their lives."
"I know this House will share my sense of sorrow and grief at such a tragic loss of life, and I would be grateful, Mr President, if you could pass on to the school the condolences of all in this Parliament."
"This accident has once again highlighted the issue of seat-belts in buses, especially those carrying children."
"It is particularly tragic that St James's School has a policy of always using buses fitted with seat-belts."
"Unfortunately their bus broke down and they were forced to hire a local French bus which did not have seat-belts."
"This tragedy perfectly illustrates the need to have effective European-wide legislation to protect our citizens travelling between Member States."
"I would request, therefore, Mr President, that you write to both the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council to highlight this tragic loss of life and to urge them to consider how EU legislation on seat-belts in buses can be further improved."
"Finally, I wish to place on record my gratitude to the Commissioner for transport, Mr Kinnock, for the prompt and sympathetic way in which he has responded to me on this matter."
"Mr President, I am sorry, but I cannot accept the answer you have just given me."
"You have told me twice before that you would ensure that I received a reply as quickly as possible."
"The fact is that the head of your tenders service is perfectly capable of answering my question."
"If it is so difficult to find out whether firms in the various Member States have equal opportunities in calls for tenders, I really wonder just how transparent Parliament is."
"Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, you have already reiterated your point on two occasions, but it is not an item on the agenda."
"There are channels for asking questions and channels through which you will receive your answer."
"I shall accept no more interventions on this point."
"Membership of Parliament"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have to inform you that Mrs PÃ©ry has written to advise me of her resignation as Vice-President with effect from Tuesday 15 July 1997 and as a Member of the European Parliament with effect from Wednesday 16 July 1997."
"Pursuant to Article 12 of the Act concerning the election of representatives to the European Parliament, by direct universal suffrage, Parliament establishes this vacancy and will inform the Member State concerned."
"On a personal note, although I believe I would be expressing the feelings of the entire House, I think we should show our gratitude to Mrs PÃ©ry for her long years of service as Vice-President of this House. She has always been most conscientious and I am sure that her work has met with the approval of all Honourable Members."
"The French authorities have informed me that Mr Eric Pinel has been appointed to replace Mr Philippe de Villiers with effect from 17 June 1997."
"I would like to welcome our new colleague and refer to the fact that, pursuant to Rule 7, subparagraph 4 of the Rules of Procedure, every Member of the European Parliament occupies his or her seat in the House and on its various bodies with full enjoyment of rights, despite the fact that his or her credentials have not been verified or that there has been no decision regarding any possible opposition."
"Order of business"
"We shall now move on to establish the order of business."
"A final draft agenda has been distributed, pursuant to Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure, by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting on Thursday 10 July 1997, and the following changes have been proposed or incorporated:"
"Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: (no change)."
"Mrs Baldi would like to speak."
"Mr President, I have a request concerning Wednesday and, more particularly, the Commission statement on the 'Planet Earth Summit' , that is the New York Summit."
"This important statement may end up being given too late, at midnight, because we have a very busy agenda, and so I would like to ask whether it could be brought forward to Tuesday or postponed to Thursday."
"Otherwise, it may not be properly appreciated, and Europe clearly needs to leave plenty of time for that statement."
"Mrs Baldi, I would remind you that proposals for changes may be submitted up to one hour prior to the sitting."
"This proposal you have now made was not submitted an hour in advance and therefore, most regrettably, it cannot be taken into consideration."
"Mr Blot, you may now speak."
"Mr President, I have a question that I should like to put to you concerning the agenda."
"Today, as you know, is the 14th of July, a national holiday and a day celebrated by all French citizens."
"Does the Chair intend to pass on a simple courtesy message to parliamentarians, to officials working for the political groups, officials of Parliament and everyone else who works there and who is a French national - on behalf of everyone here of course."
"I am sure our friends, as indeed we ourselves, would be deeply touched by such a gesture, especially as I believe courtesy is one of those essential parliamentary customs that help to ensure that an institution such as ours always runs smoothly."
"Mr President, I shall be grateful for whatever you may be able to do or say in this respect."
"Mr Blot, you know that any request calling for courtesy will always receive a favourable response from the President of the European Parliament."
"You yourself have expressed what should be the content of the suggested message."
"With your permission I will adopt your words and accordingly call on all the French delegates and Members to adopt it. Thank you."
"Mr President, may I just ask you to confirm here in plenary that voting on the Rothley report will be on Wednesday."
"It is printed in the agenda as such but there seems to be a deal of confusion and, given the sensitivity of this issue, it is important that everybody hears from your lips when the vote will be taken."
"The vote will be taken on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"Thursday:"
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left-Nordic Green Left is requesting the inclusion of a Commission statement on the issue of fraudulent exports of beef originating in the United Kingdom."
"Mr Novo will now speak in support of the request."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you, know a few days ago Commissioner Emma Bonino, at a press conference, stated that there had been cases of fraudulent exports of beef from the United Kingdom."
"I think that there are various reasons why we should discuss this matter in plenary session."
"First of all, the information given by the Commissioner was imprecise and incomplete, which only added to media speculation and raised concerns among the public at large. The European Association for Consumer Protection reported on this."
"Secondly, the Commission's information came late in the day. Two months before this press conference the Standing Veterinary Committee informed the Commission of these facts."
"Thirdly, as the Commissioner informed the press, albeit without enough detail and without giving all the necessary information, she should now at least inform this Chamber - if possible, with complete information this time."
"Fourthly, it was situations of this type that turned the mad cows crisis into such a serious matter."
"We must not repeat past mistakes and therefore should discuss this situation at once."
"Fifthly, I think that this subject, brought to light by the Commissioner, Bonino, lies outside the competences of the BSE monitoring committee."
"There is no link between the two."
"For all these reasons I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to agree to our request for a Commission statement on Thursday on the fraudulent export of beef from the United Kingdom."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt will now speak to put the case against the request."
"Mr President, I have listened carefully to what Mr Novo had to say."
"Towards the end of his remarks he said that Mrs Bonino's statement had nothing to do with BSE."
"That surprised me, in view of his initial remarks."
"My group and I are not in favour of adding a statement by Mrs Bonino's to this week's order of business, for the following reason: Parliament has appointed a temporary committee to monitor the activities of the Commission in connection with the Committee of Inquiry into BSE."
"This temporary committee sits in public -its meetings this week take place today, tomorrow and on Thursday."
"All Members of this House are free to attend the meetings and to hear the explanations given by the Commission."
"Commissioner Fischler will be doing that today."
"Mrs Bonino and Mr Novo have no need to wait until Thursday for a Commission statement - Mr Novo is very welcome to hear a statement today, by attending the meeting of the temporary committee."
"When Mr Novo says that the information from the Commission came too late, his information differs from mine."
"For example, it was not the scientific committee that advised the Commission - it was the Commission's department for the combating of fraud."
"If the Commission is to act responsibly, it will report when all concerned - public prosecutor's office, police and customs authorities - have taken the appropriate steps."
"At present, I have no reason to doubt that the Commission did that."
"We shall hear Mr Fischler and Mrs Bonino this evening, and tomorrow we shall hear from Mr Cunningham, the British Agriculture Minister, followed on Thursday by Mr Boden, the Luxembourg Agriculture Minister and Council President."
"So Parliament's committee should have comprehensive information available."
"There is therefore no need for the Commission to make a statement in this chamber."
"(Parliament rejects the request)"
"Mr President, forgive me for requesting that we return to Wednesday's agenda but you yourself have stated that the agenda for Wednesday remains unchanged."
"Am I to understand that, as is customary, question time to the Council will still be held between 5.30 and 7 p.m.?"
"That is correct."
"Thank you for giving me the opportunity to clear this matter up."
"The Conference of Presidents has cut question time to the Council by thirty minutes in order to incorporate an extra Council statement."
"What has happened is that the Spanish version contained an erratum and mentions the period as being from 5.30 to 7 p.m. instead of 6 to 7 p.m., which is, in fact, correct."
"Mr President, with all due respect not only to yourself but to the Conference of Presidents, I would like to point out that the usual custom is for the Council to reply to questions from Members for an hour and a half every Wednesday."
"In the case in point, according to my information, there are 37 questions tabled by Honourable Members, who are expecting to receive a reply from the Council."
"In my view, reducing or postponing question time merely detracts from the importance of this dialogue between Members and Council representatives."
"Therefore, with all due respect, I would like to place on record my disagreement with this timetable change and with this reduction in the question-time period."
"Thank you, Mr GutiÃ©rrez DÃ­az."
"The agenda is an extremely heavy one this week and the Groups understood that three Council statements - statements which also constitute a form of parliamentary dialogue - had to be made and, therefore, it has been decided exceptionally to introduce this change to the agenda."
"Mr Posselt would like to speak."
"Mr President, I should like to support what Mr GutiÃ©rrez DÃ­az has just said."
"This has become a very frequent occurrence, simply because question time, which for years took place from 9 pm to 10.30 pm, has been moved to the afternoon."
"At some stage, somebody discovered that the Council is too tired in the evenings and so moved question time to the afternoons."
"Since then, it has been cut short or rescheduled on about every second or third occasion."
"I believe it should be moved back to 9 pm, and then the problem would be solved."
"Thank you, Mr Posselt."
"I have already explained why the agenda has been changed."
"You would have to bring the matter of your disagreement up with your parliamentary Group, given that the Groups have agreed to the change concerned."
"Annual report of the European Ombudsman for 1996"
"The next item is the debate on the annual report from the European Ombudsman for 1996."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I begin by thanking you for finding time in the busy schedule of the July session for the Ombudsman to present his annual report. The practice that the Ombudsman presents his report in person signifies that the European Parliament follows the best parliamentary traditions of those Member States that have established an Ombudsman institution."
"The report concentrates on the work in dealing with cases, although considerable administrative effort was still necessary to complete the process of establishing the Ombudsman's office and to set up an information campaign. In future it should be possible to devote a greater proportion of time to dealing with complaints and initiatives."
"During 1996 the Ombudsman office handled 1 014 cases."
"Of these, 842 were new complaints received in 1996; most of them were sent by private citizens, only 86 were from companies and associations; 29 complaints were transmitted by Members of the European Parliament; three own-initiatives were launched during the year."
"In total 210 enquiries were begun in 1996."
"The institutions concerned were the European Commission in 187 cases, the European Parliament in 19 cases and the Council of the European Union in 4 cases."
"These numbers reflect the fact that the Commission is the institution which most frequently has direct administrative dealings with European citizens."
"The inquiries were completed in 102 cases."
"The inquiries resulted in 82 findings of no maladministration."
"Two complainants withdrew their complaints and in 12 cases the matter was settled by the institution in a satisfactory way for the complainant."
"There were 34 findings of maladministration, 32 of them were closed with a critical remark to the institution or body concerned."
"One complaint and one initiative resulted in two draft recommendations to these institutions or bodies."
"The first draft recommendation was immediately accepted by the body in question, the other, resulting from the own-initiative on rules on public access to documents, seems to have been generally well received."
"So far there has not been an occasion to present a special report on a case of maladministration to the European Parliament."
"This is partly because most of the Community institutions and bodies have taken a cooperative attitude towards the Ombudsman, especially by looking for friendly settlements directly with the complainant."
"Furthermore, the established procedures for dealing with cases necessarily take time to complete and many investigations may have not yet reached the stage at which a special report would be appropriate. The first occasion to present a special report will most likely arise later this year."
"Although many national ombudsmen have this same problem, the proportion of complaints outside the mandate still seems fairly high to me. It might also be argued that the high proportion of complaints deemed to be outside the mandate shows that the Ombudsman has interpreted the term maladministration too narrowly."
"In our report for 1995 it was stated that 'there is maladministration if a Community institution or body fails to act in accordance with the Treaties and with the Community acts that are binding upon it, or it fails to observe the rules and principles of law established by the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance' ."
"Furthermore it was stated that 'the European Ombudsman must take into account the requirements of Article F of the Treaty of European Union that Community institutions and bodies are to respect fundamental rights' ."
"A list of examples of maladministration was added to this definition."
"At the same time it was stated that the experience of national ombudsmen shows that it is better not to attempt too rigid a definition of maladministration."
"The report of the Committee on Petitions on the Ombudsman's annual report for 1995 for which Mrs Ahern was the rapporteur noted that it was wise and right to avoid at that stage too rigid a definition of maladministration. Now there is more experience of applying the provisions concerning the European Ombudsman."
"As the question or the definition of the term maladministration has now been raised, I undertake to provide a more precise definition in my annual report for 1997."
"This will give the European Parliament, and its responsible committees, the possibility to make observations on this issue and further clarify the situation."
"I argued that the Ombudsman's primary duty is to deal with complaints and underlined that the power of own-initiative should not be used too lightly. It could be used when a series of complaints had focused attention on a specific body or on a particular type of administrative activity."
"The Ahern report stressed that own-initiative inquiries should be an important tool for the Ombudsman. It stated that 'this form of inquiry may acquire a far greater importance in the years to come to the benefit of the democratic functioning of the Union and therefore of the Parliament and the citizens' ."
"In the debate last year a more frequent use of own-initiatives than I had announced was urged."
"There seemed to be an opinion that the Ombudsman's activities should have a higher profile."
"In 1996 a third of the complaints that led to an inquiry concerned the way that the European Commission exercised its responsibilities as the guardian of the Treaties."
"This concerned supervision of the fulfilment by Member States of their obligations under Community law."
"As explained on pages 67 and 68 of the annual report, it appeared, on the basis of these complaints that the Commission's procedures caused considerable dissatisfaction among European citizens."
"I therefore began an own-initiative inquiry into the matter."
"The result is that the Commission itself should consider enhancing the position of the individual complainants in the procedure as a matter of good administrative behaviour."
"The initiative does not deal with the Commission's discretionary power to decide whether to bring an infringement before the Court of Justice or not."
"Lack of transparency was also a frequent subject of complaints leading to an enquiry. As explained on page 82 of the annual report, these complaints were an important consideration in the decision to begin the own-initiative enquiry into rules for public access to documents."
"It concluded with a recommendation to have rules on public access to documents within three months. Although the institutions and bodies generally welcomed this recommendation, the time limit proved to be unrealistic."
"The same policy for the use of the own-initiative power underlies the Ombudsman's next such inquiry. This concerns what appears to be the frequent and routine use of age limits as an admission requirement for the Community institutions and bodies."
"The use of own-initiatives in carefully considered issues provides a good opportunity for both the institution or body concerned and the Ombudsman to deal with the problem in a comprehensive and satisfactory way."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the Community institutions and bodies for a year of cooperation in a constructive atmosphere."
"In particular I would like to thank you, Mr President, and your predecessor, Mr HÃ¤nsch, for your supportive and understanding attitude to the work of the Ombudsman as well as to the many Members and officials of the European Parliament who have assisted in that work."
"I would also like to address the Commission and its responsible member, Mrs Gradin, and thank her for her firm commitment to an open and accountable administration."
"A special tribute is due to the Secretary-General of the Commission, Mr David Williamson, for his role in setting up the basic principles for cooperation with the Ombudsman's office."
"As he will soon be leaving the service I would like to stress how significant his role has been in guaranteeing a good outcome of our common work for the European citizen."
"I would also like to express my gratitude to the chairman of the Committee on Petitions, Mr Fontana, to his predecessor, Mr Newman, and to all the members of the committee for their clearly expressed interest and cooperative attitude in their contacts with the Ombudsman's office."
"Special thanks should go to Mr Papakyriazis, who has shown a serious and thorough attitude in producing the comprehensive and detailed report now before us, which contains many useful observations and proposals to develop cooperation between the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman while maintaining the independence of the two bodies."
"The right to petition the European Parliament and the right to apply to the European Ombudsman together constitute a unique possibility to promote the rights of European citizens."
"The observations and proposals in the Papakyriazis report provide a basis for looking for effective ways to serve that noble purpose."
"For my part, I hope that there will be an occasion in the near future to turn these ideas into feasible and practical measures to establish a smoothly working relationship."
"Thank you, Mr SÃ¶derman."
"Annual report on the activities of the European Ombudsman in 1996"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A4-0211/97) by Mr Papakyriazis, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the annual report on the activities of the European Ombudsman in 1996."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr SÃ¶derman, ladies and gentlemen, this evening I have the great honour to put before Parliament the report by the European Parliament's Committee on Petitions concerning the annual report on the activities of the European Ombudsman in 1996."
"This is in fact the first report covering the activities of the European Ombudsman for an entire calendar year, and I believe it therefore gives us a chance to take a more mature and detailed look at this new institution."
"Because the European Ombudsman is indeed a new institution, but one with a long history in this chamber."
"It was in this chamber that the European Ombudsman took its final shape, and in here of course that the first European Ombudsman was elected in 1995."
"A Europe close to its citizens would not be tangible, could not become a reality if its mechanisms were unknown, if it was itself hostile and inaccessible to European citizens, for whose benefit indeed the European Union was created."
"The Ombudsman is one of those who are called upon to work patiently, persistently and vigorously, and if necessary to fight in order to neutralize circumstances which corrupt or violate the concept of fair administration by the European Bodies in the exercise of their function."
"Today, speaking on behalf of the collectively responsible committee of the European Parliament, I am presenting a report which was fortunate enough to be approved unanimously, with no opposing vote and no abstentions."
"On behalf of the committee, then, I would like to congratulate the European Ombudsman first on his detailed, extensive and informative report."
"But we also congratulate him on its substance, on his work during 1996 and its results. the institution of Ombudsman is a historic European tradition, though the European Union's Ombudsman is a recent body with new potential and new demands."
"We also want to congratulate the Ombudsman for the specific results brought by his investigation and settlement of the complaints in a number of particular cases."
"The cooperation so far between the European Union bodies involved allows us, I believe, to be optimistic about the future."
"There were of course cases when the Ombudsman encountered some resistance, just as there are cases still to be resolved."
"We believe the European Parliament is the institutional body that can and must show its solidarity and bring to bear the particular political weight that goes with the exercise of parliamentary control, when the Ombudsman confirms that the European Community's institutional bodies have failed to respond."
"That does not in any circumstances mean that the European Parliament is trying to influence or discuss the autonomy and independence of the body known as the European Ombudsman."
"It is, however, necessary continually to deepen the cooperation between us, a concept which the European Parliament brings us by definition with its European Ombudsman, working in parallel every day towards a common goal."
"The report contains specific proposals in twelve articles of the final resolution."
"I will not dwell on these by mentioning specific practical indications for fuller cooperation and coordination of our activities."
"I only want to say that there must be an increase in depth, a greater effort to inform citizens, because our citizens in all Europe's countries have a somewhat confused picture of what are the respective responsibilities and powers of the European Parliament and of the European Ombudsman."
"I will not revert to the issues mentioned earlier by Mr SÃ¶derman."
"We agree completely that a pragmatic approach to bad management is the most helpful way."
"However, the need to define more accurately the content of what fair administration means, is I believe common ground between us."
"We completely agree about the need and perspective for own-initiative investigations."
"In conclusion, I say that we are all dealing with a new institution, and this after Maastricht, where the Ombudsman was officially established. Today, after Amsterdam, the European Ombudsman has a new dimension and a new scope."
"I believe we stand together in observing and reinforcing his role, always to the benefit of the citizens whom we, the European Parliament, represent."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists I want to congratulate the European Ombudsman, Mr SÃ¶dermann, on his excellent annual report for 1996."
"I commend it to all the Members of Parliament."
"I know it is available in all the languages this week."
"Those of us who have had a chance to study the report before now know the very thorough way in which it is set out; in it Mr SÃ¶dermann explains his first full year of work and the cases of alleged maladministration that he has investigated."
"It is important that Mr SÃ¶dermann emphasized in his speech the own-initiative enquiries that he is undertaking, because those own-initiative enquiries emanate from important issues; they do not come out of his head but arise from complaints he has considered and complaints which have drawn to his attention general problems that require his intervention."
"As we have heard, complaints concerning environmental assessments on the Newbury Bypass and the M40, both in my own country, the United Kingdom, led the Ombudsman to believe that the Commission was failing in certain ways and that it was more appropriate for a general examination of the procedural position of individual complainants in the Article 169 procedure to be looked at, and also, his owninitiative enquiry arising from complaints to promote public access to documents held by Community institutions."
"These are all things we thoroughly welcome."
"It is important that the rights of the citizen to complain to the Ombudsman about alleged maladministration should be more widely publicized, as should the right of the citizen and resident to submit petitions to the European Parliament on other matters that concern the sphere of responsibility of the European Communities and the respective responsibilities and duties of the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions."
"In conclusion, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur from the Committee on Petitions, Mr Papakyriazis, who has produced a balanced report that looks very closely at the work of the Ombudsman, Mr SÃ¶dermann, rightly congratulates him on his work and puts forward support and positive proposals for the future."
"Mr President, following after Mr Perry's report on the activity of the Committee on Petitions, which we had at the June part-session, and Mr Papakyriazis' report on the activity of the Ombudsman, I too wish to endorse Mr Newman's invitation to all honourable Members to read Mr SÃ¶ndermann's excellent report."
"Through those two reports, the European Parliament is seeking to tackle in a specific and not just an abstract way the crucial and fundamental issue of European citizenship: citizenship founded on the awareness of all European citizens that they belong to a community in which sovereignty resides not with the modern despots - that is the bureaucrats - but with the law, a legislative process in which citizens themselves participate with their own representatives in the national parliaments and the European Parliament."
"Regrettably, the European Parliament does not have full powers to initiate legislation, it has only powers of codecision, though these were extended at the recent Amsterdam summit."
"This, however, is a very serious gap, a structural gap for a parliament: the basic responsibility of Parliament should be to legislate, but that is not possible."
"The absence of legislative power has a twofold consequence: firstly, since citizens do not feel involved in the legislative process, a serious democratic deficit exists in the relations between citizens and this House."
"Secondly, European integration is not being based on a process of induction, moving from fact to law, from the particular to the universal, but on an abstract and deductive process: moving from the law to the directive and individual reality and from the general to the particular."
"That gives rises to crises of rejection, failure to act, the problems national communities experience in assimilating Community directives: in other words, the Union may fail because citizens do not perceive themselves as subjects but as the objects of decisions of the Community Institutions or even, in some respects, the victims of what is decided at a Community level."
"On the other hand, the Commission has to monitor the application of the law, it has therefore to act as the guardian of European construction."
"But the ancients said: Quis custodiet custodes ?"
"Who will keep an eye on the guardians?"
"Where there is a failure to comply with the law, it is citizens themselves, Europe's citizens, who have only two practical possibilities open to them under the Maastricht Treaty."
"There are two main channels: one involves referring the matter to the European Parliament via the Committee on Petitions - the famous right of petition - and the other involves appealing to the European Ombudsman in the event of maladministration by the Community Institutions, and Mr Papakyriazis has described the work of the Ombudsman in his report."
"The separate - the one is political and the other administrative - but complementary and collaborative activity of these two bodies is designed both to create a system for the protection of Europe's citizens which does not rely on the courts but is simple, effective and free, and to identify and bridge all the many gaps which prevent general abstract and - frequently - remote legislation from actually being applied, so that we achieve the full European citizenship to which we aspire."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr SÃ¶derman, I am a Northerner so I usually say what I mean."
"I say that this is an excellent report from the Ombudsman and I hope it will set the precedent for future reports."
"It concentrates on the main central issues and does not get lost in the details."
"I think that this report will assist us in gaining a clear idea of what good administration is; we have a right to longer, more reasonable time limits for dealing with issues, fuller explanations for decisions and greater equality which the Ombudsman himself also mentioned."
"In future, we also hope to see greater openness as a result of his own-initiative enquiries."
"I also think that this one and a half year period has demonstrated that the Ombudsman is needed as the guardian of the guardians, as he said about Article 169."
"We support the contents of the report but there are areas in the commentary from the petitions committee with which we cannot really agree, but which my colleagues in the Group will raise later."
"Mr President, in point one of Mr Papakyriazis's report, he congratulates the European Ombudsman on his comprehensive and well-structured annual report for 1996."
"Such congratulations are not a mere formality - they are well-merited but I think we should also express our congratulations retrospectively regarding the felicitous idea of creating such an institution within the scope of the European Parliament in the Maastricht agreements and also congratulate ourselves on the high standard of collaboration between the European Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions."
"At this juncture, it would be appropriate to point out that such collaboration has been promoted by the personality of not only Mr SÃ¶derman but also those of the two chairmen who have headed our Committee on Petitions during this period, Mr Newman and Mr Fontana."
"In his intervention, we were told that the way is now being opened for a concept of European citizenship which involves the knowledge that, in the face of maladministration, it is possible to have recourse to the Ombudsman, an Ombudsman who has demonstrated initiative and who should be congratulated on having taken the initiative to monitor this fundamental function of the Commission, by which I mean ensuring compliance with the Treaties."
"He should also be congratulated on having responded - on his own initiative but with wide general support - to this concern about the transparency of our institutions."
"I therefore feel Mr SÃ¶derman is to be commended on his report and on his work and that Mr Papakyriazis is to be commended for his interpretation of it which has enabled us to give the report our unanimous approval in the Committee on Petitions, and I believe that the report will also be unanimously approved in this part-session."
"Mr President, Mr Ombudsman, colleagues, it is a pleasure for me, on behalf of the Green Group, to congratulate the Ombudsman on a very successful year's work."
"During the year he has also managed to adopt a high profile, as the European Parliament asked him to last year."
"I should particularly like to congratulate the Ombudsman on his own initiatives, especially that concerning complaints about Community legislation."
"It is extremely important to improve complainants' position, so that they can follow exactly the consideration of their complaints."
"They should have the right to receive information about the dialogue between the Member State and the Commission."
"They may, after all, also have reason to supplement their complaints on the basis of the information they receive."
"On another point, the initiative to increase openness at the institutions is far-reaching and a genuine foundation stone of democracy in the European Union."
"We look forward with interest to the Ombudsman's first special report on the subject."
"The Amsterdam Treaty already places greater emphasis on openness, but I am sure the Ombudsman has spurred on efforts to increase openness by his very existence."
"Mr President, last week the Bureau of the European Parliament approved Parliament's rules on openness."
"Unfortunately it did so behind closed doors."
"It was not possible even for Members of this house to participate in the drawing up of the rules."
"In many respects, regrettably, they are weaker than the Council's rules on openness."
"In my opinion this represents a serious failure, because the European Parliament wanted to present itself politically as the champion of openness."
"But this time what is at issue is particularly access to administrative documents, and Parliament ought to act in an exemplary manner in this respect too."
"Mr President, I too would like to compliment not only the rapporteur on his excellent report, but also - indeed especially - the Ombudsman on his excellent work and for this function - so essential to the European Union - which he has succeeded in vesting with a measure of importance."
"Essential in the sense - and this is perhaps not always sufficiently strongly emphasized - that his job is to deprive those national governments that are forever seeking to pass every kind of worst evil off onto the Community institutions, thus transferring problems they were unable to resolve at national level to a European level, of a certain number of excuses."
"We know, of course, that it will take more than an Ombudsman to resolve a far more fundamental problem, the problem of democracy in the European Union, a democracy so little respected that if the European Union were to seek accession on the basis of the same criteria as countries applying to join the European Union, it would certainly be turned down."
"Obviously we are not expecting the Ombudsman to be involved with matters at that kind of level but, in any event, he can stamp out a number of evasions and make it less easy for the national governments to use the Community Institutions as a scapegoat."
"A few words on matters on which my Group would like the Ombudsman to work more energetically: although he has already expanded the use of the Internet, he needs to find ways to encourage it to be used still more widely, to enable the citizens of Europe to send in their complaints via the Internet, to find ways of making people more aware of the existence of the Ombudsman, in particular by using more traditional communication media, such as national and regional newspapers, for example."
"Perhaps one could also suggest to him that he should try to see whether, together with the Regional Committee, it might not be possible to find a way of spreading knowledge about the existence of the Internet, its role and its essential function, even in the most backward regions of the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Ombudsman is completely independent in the performance of his duties."
"That is laid down by Article 138e of the Treaty, which also stipulates that the Ombudsman must submit an annual report to the European Parliament on the outcome of his inquiries."
"I should like to make four points about the report by Mr Papakyriazis, which I very much welcome and on which I congratulate him."
"The Ombudsman said in his speech just now that there is no strict definition of maladministration, and I think it would be a very good idea if he looked into this more closely before the next annual report, so that a more accurate definition can be established."
"Secondly, the concept of own initiative."
"If repeated complaints are made, the Ombudsman must respond to them by carrying out own-initiative inquiries which will - and do, of course - involve contacts with the other institutions."
"He has congratulated them all on this, but in my view we should not be too naive here."
"The Commission will naturally provide whatever information is required, but that does not mean that the problem has been resolved."
"Take BSE - mad cow disease - for example."
"If that had been the subject of a complaint to the Ombudsman, I wonder what would have happened."
"I think that where there is maladministration, there should be more thorough checks, and Parliament should have a role to play here."
"Mr Ombudsman, you said in your report that some 65 % of the complaints submitted were outside your remit."
"It would be very useful for us and for the general public to know what happened to those 65 %."
"Did the people concerned simply receive a letter telling them that their complaint would not be dealt with?"
"I think we should investigate how many of these kinds of complaints could be forwarded to the Committee on Petitions, so that people could be given suggested solutions, rather than just a negative reply."
"So in addition to the 32 cases covered in the annual report, we would also be very interested to know what happened to the rest and why they were rejected."
"Finally, a subject which various speakers have already mentioned: information for the citizens of Europe."
"A new right has been established for the people of Europe, but they do not know anything about it, and through no fault of their own."
"However, there are information centres."
"The European Parliament has information centres in all the capital cities, as does the Commission."
"What are they doing to let people know about their fundamental right to submit complaints?"
"I think this is something we need to look into."
"Mr President, we have now had our first annual report from the Ombudsman."
"His activities have been rather modest, but I welcomed his recent attack on the lack of openness in the Council."
"I think the role of the Ombudsman must gradually be developed, and Parliament must allow scope for this."
"Our legal and regulatory relationship with him is a difficult one, in that he is independent, while at the same time being required to report to Parliament."
"If this instrument of our people's Europe is to be fully effective, we must not be too severe and we must not regard him as a rival."
"This report by Mr Papakyriazis is full of unnecessary criticism of the Ombudsman, and seems to expect him to do many things that are not actually his job."
"He is not responsible for maintaining the institutional balance, and it is also too much to expect him to detail every single complaint in his report."
"The Liberal Group has therefore tabled a number of amendments, and will also try to have a number of paragraphs rejected in order to give the Ombudsman the scope he needs and deserves, not as some poor relation of the Committee on Petitions, but as someone who can investigate people's complaints against the institutions independently."
"Finally, I entirely agree with what my colleague Mr Chanterie said."
"Following on from what Mr Bertens said, I think it is important for the European Parliament to send out the right political signal with this first report from the Ombudsman."
"It is sending out entirely the wrong signal for us to warn him to be careful not to disturb the balance between the institutions, so paragraph 4, which in my view is the worst thing in this entire report, simply has to be dropped."
"The Ombudsman's role must be allowed to develop and must be judged by his achievements, and this is why I also think it is madness to try to define what we mean by maladministration, mismanagement and the like."
"These things will gradually emerge with experience, so let us not put the cart before the horse."
"My first point, therefore, is that we should ensure that Parliament sends out a positive signal that it supports the Ombudsman, not that it is trying to undermine him."
"And secondly, we must make it clear that the extension of the Union's responsibilities, including those under the third pillar which concern people's basic rights, should mean an extension of the powers of the Ombudsman as well."
"We have tabled amendments to this effect, which I hope will secure a majority in the House."
"Mr President, I should also like to congratulate the Ombudsman on his first annual report covering a whole year."
"The fact that four members of the Liberal Group have asked to speak today demonstrates the importance we attach to the Ombudsman institution."
"The Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions together constitute a very important, one might almost say - with all due respect for the European Parliament - the most important democratic instrument, in the entire Union."
"It is a direct route whereby ordinary citizens can alter incorrect decisions."
"A precondition for that of course is the ability to find out what is happening. That is why I am particularly glad that one of the initiatives the Ombudsman has taken is to investigate how easy it is for the public to gain access to documents."
"The Ombudsman had to conclude - I was going to say unfortunately - that the situation is not satisfactory, but that outcome is in fact a fortunate one in the sense that the Ombudsman is now recommending that the institutions establish rules for document access. Without that, as I said, the public cannot find out what is going on."
"I think that this first report shows that the Ombudsman institution is on the right track and that good results have been achieved in relation to the resources made available."
"I therefore congratulate Jacob SÃ¶derman on this report."
"Mr President, it was as a result of strong Danish advocacy in conjunction with the Maastricht Treaty and an initiative of the European Parliament that the European Ombudsman institution became a reality."
"It is thus with great anticipation that we awaited the first whole-year annual report from the Ombudsman, which is covered by the Papakyriazis report."
"As has been pointed out on several occasions, it is very important that the public in the EU become more aware of the European Ombudsman's functions and powers."
"So far not enough information has been provided on the possibilities open to both individuals and enterprises to complain to the Ombudsman."
"It is thus important that the Ombudsman act as a guarantor of the openness of EU institutions to the public."
"It is also important that the Ombudsman be given access to documents and information in the various EU institutions when he deals with complaints."
"Many of the complaints the Ombudsman has received up to now are concerned with document access."
"This is a sign that all is not well with the process of translating the Maastricht Treaty aims on openness into practice."
"The European Ombudsman quite clearly represents an improvement of democracy in the EU, and he can contribute to making the EU system more transparent by giving European citizens a chance to complain when they feel badly treated."
"It is therefore important to foster an awareness among the EU public of the existence of the Ombudsman and of ways in which they can complain."
"It is the only way we can secure the development of an EU that does not work against its citizens, but acts for them and upholds their rights."
"I think it is splendid report, and I would like to congratulate the Ombudsman on the good results achieved in his first period of activity."
"Mr President, may I begin by congratulating both the Ombudsman, Jacob SÃ¶derman, for his annual report and Mr Papakyriazis for his report."
"I read them both with great interest."
"The function of European Ombudsman was introduced in 1995, so 1996 was its first full year of operation."
"This makes both the report and this debate of particular importance."
"The job of the Ombudsman is to check that our European Institutions are managed correctly and, on behalf of the people of Europe, to put the spotlight on administrative errors."
"More than 80 percent of all complaints involve the European Commission."
"This is to be expected when you consider that it is the Commission above all which makes decisions which directly affect the people."
"Let me emphasise that we set great store by the work carried out by the Ombudsman."
"It is of help to us in the Commission in improving our own procedures and routines."
"Every administrative function improves in the knowledge that it is under scrutiny."
"Ultimately, it is the people's right to know that their institutions manage themselves properly and that money raised through taxes is being used in a correct and sensible manner; these are the core issues here."
"I am the person within the Commission who is responsible for our relationship with the Ombudsman, Mr SÃ¶derman and I would like to thank him for his co-operation."
"We in the Commission are continually striving for a good working relationship with the Ombudsman."
"We do what we can to keep to our deadlines and make our answers to him as comprehensive as possible."
"So we are, of course, pleased to see that the Ombudsman himself, in his report, has made note of the Commission's positive attitude to his work."
"During the last year our work involved finding appropriate ways of working closely together."
"Naturally, there were a few initial teething problems during this first year and some considerable discussion took place on the interpretation of the role of the Ombudsman according to the Treaty and the Statutes."
"But, generally, I think that we have managed to resolve any problems very well."
"Mr President, Mr Papakyriazis' report raises two issues, in the resolution and the motivation, which I would like to comment on: Point 4 in the resolution proposal and points 13-16 in the motivation section raise the issue of investigations into the discretionary powers of the institutes."
"By this, I mean particularly the Commission's power to open or conclude cases of infringement under Article 169."
"Here the resolution text underlines that, and I quote 'The role of the Ombudsman should be to support the institutional balance which is established in the Treaty and in particular the proper exercise/..../of the European Commission's/.../discretionary powers' ."
"The resolution goes on to say that it is necessary to identify clearly any anomalies in the operation."
"This suggests that this balance would in some way be threatened."
"During 1996 there were a number of cases which did involve Article 169 and there was a certain amount of confusion."
"We had a thorough discussion about this in the Commission and reached a clear position on it."
"I cannot now see any problems in our relationship with the Ombudsman in this respect."
"It is my view that both the Commission and the Ombudsman have handled these matters in a balanced and responsible manner."
"I also welcome the investigation which the Ombudsman is carrying out, on his own initiative concerning how these matters are handled, particularly with regard to information to and consultation with the complainant."
"We intend to provide the Ombudsman with our opinions and proposals before the end of the month."
"The Ombudsman has also taken the initiative for another investigation."
"This concerns openness and access to documents."
"I welcome this initiative as well."
"It encourages the institutes to be as open as possible."
"The Amsterdam Meeting which recently came to a close also demonstrates that this is an area where progress has been rapid and where we expect great things from all of the Institutes within the European Union."
"Finally, Mr President, I also agree with the view in point 8 and 10 of the resolution, that people must be made aware of their right to submit petitions both to the European Parliament and to the European Ombudsman."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Fishing off the coast of Senegal and in the waters of Mauritius"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"(A4-0220/97) by Mrs PÃ©ry, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of an Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters concerning the interim extension of the Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of the Republic of Senegal on fishing off the coast of Senegal for the period from 2 October 1996 to 1 November 1996 (COM(96)0611 - C40032/97-96/0287(CNS); -(A4-0224/97) by Mrs PÃ©ry, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council Regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol establishing, for the period from 1 May 1997 to 30 April 2001, the fishing rights and financial compensation provided for in the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of the Republic of Senegal on fishing off the coast of Senegal (COM(97)0324 - C4-0322/97-97/0179(CNS)); -(A4-0229/97) by Mr Gallagher, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council Regulation relating to the conclusion of the Protocol defining, for the period 1 December 1996 to 30 November 1999, the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of Mauritius on fishing in the waters of Mauritius (COM(97)0043 - C4-0136/97-97/0035(CNS))."
"Mr President, it gives me great pleasure to be able to present a fisheries agreement that is imbued with a new spirit, in that it takes account of the interests not only of the European Union but also of the indigenous Senegalese fishermen and of fish stocks."
"Let me briefly give you the facts."
"The previous protocol, concluded for a two-year period, expired on 1 October 1996, even though negotiations on an extension had not been completed."
"This protocol was renewed for a period of two months to avoid a break in fishing activities."
"Subsequently, negotiations were broken off and our boats were obliged to stop fishing."
"I would remind you that a debate was held here during the November 1996 plenary and that our Assembly passed a resolution taking note of the breakdown of these negotiations and setting out the terms for a resumption of the dialogue."
"We felt that greater account needed to be taken of the depletion of fish stocks in Senegalese waters, the relational difficulties between industrial and non-industrial fishing, and the growth in indigenous fishing activities."
"In December 1996, I myself went to Dakar on behalf of the European Parliament, not to resume negotiations, because we did not have the necessary authority for that, but to resume the political dialogue."
"The message must have got through because, in the meantime, a new agreement, which I see as a positive one, has been concluded."
"It is for a period of four years instead of two and extends from 1 May 1997 until 30 April 2001, and therefore offers increased stability to both parties."
"It is a mixed-type protocol covering three types of fisheries: trawling, pelagic fishing and tuna fishing, which you will recall feeds the local fish processing industries."
"Fishing zones have been changed to take account of the local concerns of non-industrial fishermen."
"Because of this, EU vessels of more than 150 GRT - accounting for most of our vessels fishing off Senegal - now have to fish beyond the twelve, rather than six, nautical mile zone."
"This protocol offers more flexibility for European shipowners, as licences may have a duration of three or six months, though dates have to be strictly adhered to."
"However, the fees paid to Senegal by the shipowners increased by 10 % per annum for four years."
"Technical inspections of European fishing vessels will be subject to more stringent conditions."
"A biological rest period is, for the first time, required by the Senegalese authorities."
"It is of a two-month duration and applies, without discrimination, to demersal inshore and deep-water trawling, and applies to all vessels: Senegalese, European and other."
"This requirement has been accepted by the European Union."
"Mesh sizes have been increased, especially for cephalopods, from 65 mm to 70 mm."
"The cost of the agreement is 18 million ECU a year, 48 million for the agreement as a whole."
"So it is the overall picture that I see as positive."
"I wish to highlight a declaration by the Government of the Republic of Senegal, which is annexed to the protocol and stipulates that: ' a significant percentage of the overall financing compensation will be used in the fisheries sector, in accordance with the aims of sustainable development of fishing, including non-industrial fishing' ."
"This commitment by the Senegalese authorities was set out in concrete form in a letter from the Minister for Fisheries to Commissioner Bonino confirming a decision by the Senegalese authorities to allocate 50 % of the total compensation to the Treasury and use the remaining 50 % in the fisheries sector on the basis of the aims of sustainable development referred to under the headings of the protocol."
"It is precisely in that area that we can talk of a new spirit and of progress in achieving a balance of interests between both parties."
"Let me conclude by saying that some of my colleagues, from the Committee on Budgets in particular, would like to see a mid-term review of this agreement."
"I consider that such a request is not only acceptable but would also encourage both parties to observe the spirit of this new agreement."
"Mr President, a fisheries agreement between the Community and Mauritius was concluded in 1989."
"The first protocol to this agreement was in force from 1990 to 1993 and the second protocol between 1993 and 30 November 1996."
"Therefore a new protocol for the period December 1996 to November 1999 has been initialled and Parliament has been consulted on it."
"Pending Parliament's decision this week, the delivery of its opinion, and the Council's as well as Mauritius' signature, the agreement is applied on a provisional basis, pursuant to an agreement on this in the form of an exchange of letters."
"The first payment of financial compensation to Mauritius was made at the end of May 1997."
"It is a quite typical access to resources/financial compensation protocol."
"The protocol provides opportunities for 43 vessels."
"The figure has been more than doubled and, of course, this is to make it possible for Spanish shipowners to benefit from the agreement."
"The limit of the capacity is 100 gross registered tonnes."
"The financial contribution is, in total, ECU 1, 746, 750, which is an average of ECU 582, 250 per annum."
"That is an increase over the previous protocol, which was ECU 1, 455, 000, equalling ECU 485, 000 per annum."
"This considerable increase in the fishing opportunities obtained explains the rise in price."
"Included in this, fractions of the financial contribution are earmarked for scientific and technical programmes and for promoting skills and knowhow of Mauritian nationals engaged in sea-fishing."
"In spring 1996, the Commission reported the following rates of utilization of the fishing opportunities obtained from Mauritius: tuna seiners: 85 %, and vessels fishing by line: 10 %."
"The Committee on Fisheries drafted a set of guidelines to be applied to fisheries agreements and protocols."
"These guidelines make possible a check-list as a test of each agreement's and each protocol's conformity with the aims of the common fisheries policy, its coherence with relevant aims of the Community's regional policy and development cooperation policy and its conformity with the Community's obligations and undertakings under Treaties, codes of conduct and declarations adopted at international level."
"No proper framework for the fisheries agreements exists yet and their evaluation is rendered more difficult by the lack of fixed routines for the collection and communication to Parliament of all relevant information involved."
"Recent improvements in the Commission's reporting on utilization of fishing opportunities and on the execution of the budget lines concerned, as well as the speeded-up transmission of new protocols, deserve credit, but these improvements are far from sufficient."
"They cannot make up for the continued absence of a comprehensive evaluation system which is needed to improve the basis for the Commission's actions, Parliament's opinions and the Council's decisions."
"Local fishing communities do not appear to be adversely affected by the activities of the Community fleet."
"These communities are reported not to engage in tuna fisheries."
"The Community vessels may not fish within the Mauritian 12-mile zone."
"The effects of the protocol on the Mauritian economy can be expected to be positive."
"In this context it is notable that Mauritius' GDP per head is in fact higher than that of Portugal and just slightly lower than that of Spain."
"The new protocol with Mauritius should be approved."
"The Commission must, however, endeavour to improve its collection of relevant information and make this information available to Parliament."
"To that end, it should adopt a uniform procedure of the type outlined in the Committee of Fisheries' own-initiative report on the fisheries agreement 1997."
"In conclusion, Parliament should not be asked retrospectively to approve any protocol."
"If the information was available on time, then the Committee on Fisheries and Parliament would expedite the report and make this available, together with approval, if necessary, prior to any payment being made."
"I wish to refer to one amendment which suggests that, because of the importance of tuna-fishing in this area and the fact that a number of states border the Indian Ocean, it should be looked at on a regional basis."
"Mr President, the EU buys up fishing rights in third countries because fish stocks are declining in its own waters and there is overcapacity in its fishing fleets."
"One is tempted to ask whether the EU is in reality merely exporting overfishing by its boats to the waters of poor countries, at whatever cost."
"It is necessary to ensure sustainable fisheries in the EU, but the same applies with even greater urgency to the developing countries, fish being one of the few resources available to the poorest of them."
"In Senegal the fishing industry employs some 250 000 people, and it is the non-industrialized inshore fisheries that are most vulnerable."
"Senegalese fishermen are worried by EU fishing operations in their waters."
"It is their fish, survival and livelihood that are at stake, as was explained by representatives of the Senegalese fishermen during the deliberations on this matter in the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"It is a concern that is impossible to ignore; the Senegalese fishermen actually asked the committee to vote against the agreement."
"It is therefore difficult to share the unbounded enthusiasm shown by Mrs Pery for the new agreement with Senegal."
"I have to concede that improvements have been made to the fishing agreement with Senegal, but not enough, and I can only regret that the opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation was not taken more into account."
"The reason why we chose not to reject the agreement with Senegal but instead to demand a mid-term review is that, amongst other things, the agreement has already come into force."
"What is particularly disturbing is that, although the fishing zone has been extended in principle from six to twelve nautical miles, a smaller number of vessels still have access to coastal waters to the detriment of the Senegalese fishermen."
"Even though EU access to species living close to the shore has been reduced, it is still significant and represents a problem for local fishermen."
"The local oceanographic research centre has reported a drop in both stocks and in the average size of species that are fished commercially."
"It is therefore unacceptable in terms of both the development of the non-industrialized fishery and the fight against poverty that EU vessels should be allowed at all to catch demersal species close to the shore."
"In addition, the protocol for the first time provides access to coastal pelagic species."
"Pelagic species, notably sardines, are an important source of cheap protein, for the poor population in particular."
"The fishing operations by EU vessels thus give grounds for concern."
"The fishing agreement will certainly not help the poor local fishermen in Senegal."
"On the contrary."
"Although a large part of the financial compensation from the EU will be deployed in the development of local fisheries, this is not much of a consolation if there are no more fish to catch."
"I strongly urge you to vote for Amendments Nos 6 and 7 and, especially, 5, which calls for a mid-term review."
"That is a condition of my voting for the resolution."
"Mr President, I should like to focus on three vital points of the Pery report on the fishery agreement with Senegal."
"First of all, to emphasize that for the first time this agreement covers a four-year period, which gives boat owners some stability, as well as fishermen and businessmen linked to the sector, since it allows them all to plan in the medium term."
"Secondly, I should like to say that this agreement has a considerable dimension, enabling some 150 trawlers, pelagic fishing boats and tuna boats to fish, involving 48 million ECU of compensation."
"Despite the fact that this is a medium-sized agreement, it is of some importance for the European Union fleet."
"Thirdly, I should like to mention what I think is the most important point - although fishery agreements are essentially commercial texts, this one is proof that, when well negotiated, they can also be an important instrument for supporting the development of these countries and their fisheries sector in particular."
"In this particular case, around half of the Community payments will go into developing the sector, from research to taxation, into non-industrial fisheries, into restructuring the sector as a whole, into the biological protection of resources."
"I think that this is interestingly innovative and might be an idea for negotiating future fisheries agreements with a similar dimension and equilibrium."
"I should finally like to congratulate Mrs Pery on her excellent work."
"It is a shame that the European Parliament is losing a colleague of such calibre but I wish her all the best for the future!"
"Mr President, I always seem to follow Mr Cunha in these debates."
"Our opinions are the same on many things but when it comes to international fisheries agreements we often differ just a little."
"The Liberal Group has put down two amendments to the Senegal agreement and one on Mauritius."
"The Mauritius amendment is similar to ones we have tabled before on international agreements and it is to accuse them of not being commercial agreements at all."
"In fact they are highly subsidized agreements which we feel it is very difficult to justify, except by saying that if we do not pay money as taxpayers towards these agreements, we will be undercut by major fishing nations, whether it be Korea, Japan or previously the Russian Federation."
"But that is a false argument and a difficult one."
"These fishing agreements should be primarily negotiated by the industry itself."
"There is no real reason for the state to be involved."
"More than that, by subsidizing them we are encouraging a worldwide problem of overproduction and overcapacity in international fisheries which, of its own right and economically necessarily so, causes excess depletion of stocks on a global basis."
"How are we to tackle that?"
"One of ways put forward in FAO and WWF discussions has been that this matter should be taken up by the World Trade Organization."
"It has the powers and over the next year should try to exclude state subsidies in this fishing area as much as it is trying in other areas of economic activity."
"It is no different from that."
"That is why we have tabled these amendments."
"In addition, my colleague Mr Eisma who is very involved in environmental issues has tabled an amendment asking for a mid-term review of the Senegal agreement to check whether or not it is working correctly in terms of impact on local fisheries and the state of stocks."
"We as a group would strongly support that."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs pery, our Group has insisted on the need and the advantages for both sides in setting clear rules and principles to enable European Union fishing fleets continuous access to non-Community waters."
"As a basic guideline, we have supported the notion that a twelve mile zone has to be reserved exclusively for local coastal and non-industrial fisheries, as they are the economic and social base of many regions in all nearby countries and in the case of Senegal the essential base for people's food requirements and their very survival."
"Let us not forget - indeed let us highlight - some of the positive aspects of this agreement, such as accessory fishing or increased financial compensation for developing the local fishing sector."
"While emphasizing and recalling the effects of certain aspects of multilateral controls on fishing fleets, we have to say that we have some doubts about the proposal, albeit with limits on quantity, on access by trawlers to Senegalese fishing stocks located within the twelve mile zone."
"We hope that this will be duly corrected so that we are in keeping with the whole spirit of the agreement."
"I now wish to congratulate Mrs Perry who is sadly leaving us. That means she will not be producing any more European Parliament reports and we are losing a colleague who is known for bringing high quality texts before the European Parliament."
"Personally and on behalf of my Group, I wish her all the best for the future."
"Mr President, I am sure everyone here is aware that the Greens have fundamental problems with the European Union's approach to fisheries agreements."
"We are not opposed to fisheries agreement in principle."
"But we strongly object to the way they are negotiated and the basis on which they are negotiated."
"When I was doing the Madagascar report, we did a detailed study on the Madagascar fishing agreement and we found it severely wanting."
"Since then we have voted against agreements."
"The Mauritius agreement is very similar to the one with Madagascar, Mauritius being a neighbouring island."
"Senegal presents another problem."
"It is a renewal for four years and for the first time it gives access to EU vessels to the pelagic stocks."
"These stocks are a major target of the large important artisanal fisheries sector and the fishermen are very worried about the impact this will have on their livelihood and the food supplies of the coastal villages."
"That is why we, in conjunction with the EDN Group and Mr Macartney, have proposed an amendment calling for a mid-term review of the agreement."
"We would like this mid-term review to consider the impact of EU fishing on both the fish stocks and the artisanal fishing community."
"This is a proposal which is strongly supported by the artisanal fishermen in Senegal."
"The review should be by an independent body and not by those who have vested interests in the continuation of fishing by the EU."
"If the impact is found to be negative, we want a renegotiation of the agreement to eliminate those fishing activities which cause the problems."
"I have a very simple question for the Commission and I should like to have a reply tonight."
"I should like to know: if Parliament approves our amendment for an independent mid-term review, would the Commission accept such a review?"
"Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating Mrs Pery on her report."
"She and I had the good fortune of going to Senegal and talking to the fishermen."
"Perhaps that is one reason why the agreement with Senegal is an improvement on some of the previous agreements."
"One of the defects in the system is not only that we often get presented with a fait accompli but that we do not get a chance to go to the country concerned."
"It is certainly not provided for by the committee's budget."
"This puts the rapporteurs at a great disadvantage."
"Also, in the case of Senegal, we had people appear before the committee."
"That has helped to redress the balance somewhat."
"We still have problems about the timing of agreements in general, but again, I see some progress in the Senegal case as opposed to some of the others."
"There are still debates about costs and benefits."
"I will come back to that in a minute and would perhaps want a comment from the Commissioner."
"Other grounds for satisfaction are that we have moved to a longer distance from the shore before the EU fleets can come into operation."
"The big worry in all these countries is that their indigenous, traditional, in-shore fleet will never have the chance to develop or will find their catches have been scooped up by the big, powerful European fleets."
"On the question of the cost of these agreements, I take issue with my colleague Mr Teverson from the Committee on Fisheries."
"I would see this agreement as being an opportunity for European fishing fleets to benefit."
"The criticism that comes from many parts of the Union is: why is it that only certain countries take advantage of these agreements?"
"Why is it Spain, France, Portugal and Greece in particular?"
"The question I would like to ask the Commissioner is: is there any problem about fishermen from other countries getting involved?"
"What is the procedure?"
"This is a question that is now being asked."
"I would be glad to get a reply to that question."
"Generally speaking, international fisheries agreements need to satisfy a twofold objective."
"On the one hand, as far as the European Union is concerned, they need to allow its fleets to pursue their fishing activities on the high seas and thereby safeguard jobs in fishing and related industries. On the other hand, as far as the partner States are concerned, international fisheries agreements need to contribute to the sustainable development of their economies."
"These two objectives are by no means mutually exclusive and should be pursued at one and the same time."
"Overall, this has been the case with the agreement that is being proposed to us."
"As regards Senegal, it is worth recalling that this country has 700 km of coastline and that 500 000 people are engaged either directly or indirectly in the fisheries sector, which alone accounts for 11 % of the country's primary GDP and 2.5 % of its total GDP."
"Senegal was the first country to sign a fisheries agreement with the European Union."
"We are now about to enter what might be called a third generation agreement."
"Our Group notes with satisfaction that this agreement places greater emphasis on traditional fishing which, in line with commitments made by the Senegalese government, should benefit until 2001 from a significant share of the financial compensation paid by the European Union."
"The substantial outlay proposed in the area of training, and more specifically in training for fishermen's wives, who handle the commercial management of fishing-related businesses, seems to us to be entirely appropriate."
"Non-industrial fishing is to be developed from top to bottom, in its entirety, everywhere."
"With this in mind, our Group deplores the compartmentalization which separates structural fisheries policy from development policy."
"What I am trying to say is: would it not be better, rather than regularly breaking up large parts of our European fishing fleet - a spectacle that those of us who have witnessed it find it difficult to justify - to sell these boats to the non-industrial fishermen of the European Union's partner States, at special prices naturally?"
"Such a course of action would enable the non-industrial fishing fleets of our partner States to modernize, especially from the point of view of safety at sea and certain fishing techniques."
"This proposal seems to us fully to meet the needs of many ACP countries, including of course Senegal."
"This is something we would be in favour of, as indeed we would be in favour of the demand for a mid-term review of the agreement, one of the merits of which is that it extends over a longer period than its forerunners."
"Mr President, we have to make up our minds; or, more precisely, we are being asked to give an opinion on two agreements: the agreement with Senegal and the agreement with Mauritius."
"I hope you will forgive me if I concentrate my attention on the island of Mauritius, once called the Ãle-de-France - indeed it was French from 1715 to 1810."
"And while on the subject, let me say on this important date in the French calendar, the 14th of July, that the fact that these agreements are being concluded at all is because both Senegal and Mauritius are independent States."
"We have witnessed in these agreements the part played by the principle of self-determination, the right of people to be masters of their own destiny, the principle of nationhood."
"These principles have, as I say, played their part, and it is France that gave them birth on 14 July 1789."
"In other words, today is not simply a national holiday but a day of celebration whose dimension is universal."
"I am truly sorry that Mr FaurÃ© is not with us today, champion of human rights that he is. It is not just the Bill of Rights of 1689 or the 10 amendments of 1787 to Jefferson's Constitution, but no less so the 1989 Declaration that has given them a universal dimension."
"We working people, we have to work even on a universal holiday!"
"This agreement, then, is but one in a whole series of agreements: there has been the unfortunate agreement with Morocco, which in order to help Spanish fishermen from Andalusia and elsewhere and some Portuguese fishermen had us paying out very large sums just at a time - as my colleague Mr Souchet was telling us earlier - when our fishermen, European fishermen that is, were being forced into smashing up their own boats!"
"There was in any case a need for these rules to be harmonized, as the Committee on Fisheries made a point of telling us in April in an own-initiative report, because the same old problems are coming back to haunt us and the same solutions are needed!"
"Coming back to the specific case of Mauritius, the agreement here constitutes a kind of toll allowing entry into an economic zone over which Mauritius has exercised exclusive rights since the Montego Bay Convention on the Law of the Sea, in which, incidentally, neither Mauritius nor Senegal figured very much, as it concerned principally the countries of Latin America and East Africa."
"So, we have in effect a toll of the order of 20 ECU per tonne, which I believe can rise to 50 ECU if the quantities are exceeded, plus of course a financial compensation package of 1.7 million ECU."
"That actually poses a problem as regards the cost/benefit analysis, the problem of a fair balance between the two contracting parties: given that the per-capita GNP in Mauritius is higher than that of the Portuguese and almost equal to that of the Spaniards, just how far should one go in continuing to give presents to people who are at least as rich as those giving the presents?"
"The most interesting aspect, however, is that of cooperation with developing countries, which Michel Rocard deals with in his report."
"I do of course see that that is one way of preventing immigration by recruiting crews locally, by landing fish locally, or by setting up joint-venture businesses."
"I am particularly glad that in this agreement with Mauritius 110 000 ECU are being set aside for promoting skills and know-how among local fishermen."
"That being the case, we cannot but subscribe to this kind of agreement which, over 3 or 4 years, the period covered by the agreements with both Senegal and Mauritius, should open up interesting new prospects."
"On this point I go along with Mr Souchet."
"These agreements belong to the third generation, or the third wave, of such agreements and they have our wholehearted support."
"Mr President, this is the first fisheries debate since Amsterdam."
"Parliament hoped that Amsterdam would bring progress in the joint fisheries policy towards the debureaucratization of legislative processes and another attempt at democratization, by increasing the responsibility of Parliament."
"This is a perfectly normal political right of a democratic assembly in a democratic society."
"However, our contributions to Amsterdam were ignored."
"We are now approaching the year 2002, and it is incomprehensible that Parliament is not to make any more extensive contributions to the codecision process."
"The entire internal market is involved in the codecision process."
"And that makes it all the more puzzling that fisheries are to be excluded, now that the period of temporary exemptions has come to an end."
"We must compensate for the lack of attention paid to us by the European Council by ensuring that our work in this House is even more tightly organized and strictly supervised, and by practising greater openness."
"The challenge begins here."
"Parliament must grant the necessary powers to the Committee on Fisheries."
"We should therefore also make the fullest possible use of the powers granted to us in the codecision process."
"We must not allow the issues of veterinary law to be removed from the jurisdiction of the Committee on Fisheries, together with similar issues such as the establishment of specific laboratories for fisheries products, and so on. Because I venture to assert that this specialized committee can rightly claim that it has the greater knowledge!"
"We are also dealing today with the international fisheries agreements with Senegal and Mauritius, as we have heard."
"I congratulate the rapporteurs on the quality of their informative reports."
"Here again, though, I must say this: in the future we are going to demand, and take action to get, greater punctuality from the Commission and the Council, greater transparency and, especially, greater powers."
"The Committee welcomes dialogue and accepts constructive contributions."
"But I can say with complete confidence that it will not allow itself to be used as a tool and will not get involved in any differences of opinion, including differences with other parliamentary committees, which may be harmful to those who depend on fishing for their living."
"And, in conclusion, I too would like to wish Mrs Pery every success in her future position."
"Mr President, I wish to endorse all the praiseworthy remarks that have been made about Nicole Pery and to add one more: her experience was very valuable for the Committee on Fisheries because she is also on the Committee on Development and Cooperation, and the two aspects are linked in a report, of which I was the rapporteur, adopted in this Parliament in May."
"We have to look very carefully at the links between development and international fisheries agreements."
"I am very pleased to know that the Commission really seems to be starting to do this, probably under the influence of Mrs Pery, with the Senegal agreement."
"This is clearly a better agreement than agreements we have had in the past."
"The three principles enunciated in that report on international fisheries agreements last May seem to have been partially heeded, but not completely."
"Sustainability: yes, we have taken notice of it, but we are allowing trawlers in."
"I hope it works and that we have a mid-term review."
"Cooperation: clearly there was much more cooperation and, clearly, the artisanal fishermen were consulted in this case - a process which ought to continue and perhaps be made stronger in the future."
"Coherence: I like the idea that a large proportion of the money in the Senegal agreement will be spent on development."
"I hope the monitoring of the spending of that money will be very stringent and that we will see results over the four years."
"In conclusion, I welcome the improvements in the agreements."
"I endorse Mrs Langenhagen's remarks about Parliament in relation to these agreements."
"That was in the report I referred to before."
"We ought to stress that this Parliament wants more say in what happens in these agreements."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, naturally I would like to express my thanks for the important work done by the two rapporteurs - both Mrs PÃ©ry and Mr Gallagher - however, I would like to thank Mrs PÃ©ry in particular for her work - not only for this report, but also for her past work on our Committee on Fisheries."
"We will greatly miss her reliable and dependable work, her knowledge and her dedication to the fishing sector since her appointment to our committee."
"I wish you the very best of luck, Mrs PÃ©ry, in your new post."
"She will be greatly missed by all of us, but we will always have at our disposal her magnificent work, her magnificent reports, which have sometimes addressed complex issues, as you will be aware."
"However, I would also now like to thank the Commission and draw attention to the new phase of collaboration we have initiated between the Commission and this House, which is marked by the agreement with Senegal."
"The text of the agreement with Senegal was sent to our committee the day after it had been signed, which enabled Parliament to give its opinion in this part-session before the first financial compensation payment was made."
"The agreement with Mauritius has also benefited from this arrangement between the Commission and Parliament."
"I also have to draw attention to the fact that, obviously, in recent months, the forwarding of information has been speeded up in such a manner that I clearly have to praise the efforts of the Commissioner."
"These are two good agreements and we should congratulate ourselves on having obtained greater fishing opportunities for the Community fleet - I refer to the agreement with Mauritius - and for having been able to extend the agreement with Senegal from two to four years, which will allow greater stability."
"Therefore I do not understand why there has been a request for revisions mid-way through, when even Senegal has not requested this."
"I say again, the extension from two to four years will bring greater stability for the fleet fishing there."
"However, allow me to continue - the most significant aspect of this debate, to my mind, is the increase in collaboration between institutions and, Madam Commissioner, I, as Chair of the Committee on Fisheries, wish publicly to acknowledge that this is the mode of action which will enable us to continue with such work. My hope is that the situation will even improve in the future."
"Forgive me, but I have heard certain things here about which I would like to ask a number of specific questions, so that the Commissioner might reply to them."
"I am referring to questions as to whether the agreements are to be used only by Spain and Portugal."
"Given that we are speaking about Senegal, I would like the Commissioner firstly to tell me which Member-State fleets are going to make use of this agreement."
"Secondly, I would also like her to clarify the issue regarding pelagic species, as this is a matter which has greatly increased the cost of this agreement. I would also like clarification regarding which Member States requested access to pelagic species."
"Mr President, in my opinion the new agreements and renewed agreements with ACP countries require new attitudes."
"Not least, there must be maximum cohesion between trade and development policy."
"Also, in my opinion, there must be overwhelming concern and action to preserve fishing stocks so that we have a sustainable fishing policy."
"Article 130u of Title XVII obliges the EU to ensure coherence between development policies pursued and the fishing agreements."
"However, the agreement arrived at with Senegal obviously undermines to some extent the development objective of poverty alleviation, because the agreement gives the EU fleet and others, I presume, access to demersal species and to pelagic species, which are the principal source of protein not only for Senegalese people but also for those peoples of Africa who live in landlocked countries."
"Furthermore, there is, it seems to me, within the agreement some considerable disregard for the expanding needs of the artisanal fishing fleet and warnings about the decline in fishing stocks."
"Senegal provides us with an example of the dangers, of what can happen when we take a narrow view of fishing agreements."
"The EU, in my opinion, as part of EU agreements must assist ACP countries in terms of scientific monitoring, facilities for training and providing inspectors, and with the boats themselves to allow them to inspect the catches taken by ACP and EU countries, and, of course, the objective must be a sustainable fishing policy."
"I wish to commend to you and to the House the Pery report and to call upon the House to give it its wholehearted support and consent."
"And, as the co-chairperson of the ACP working party, I extend to Mrs Pery my hopes for every success in the future not only on behalf of this House, but also on behalf of a whole host of members from the ACP countries."
"We will miss you."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank Mrs Pery for her report and indeed for many important contributions that she has made in this House over the years, particularly in the area of fisheries, but also in general."
"Mr Gallagher as well, I might say, is also a great expert in the area of fisheries, but we do not want to praise him too much yet, because he is showing no indications that he is going to leave here and we do not want to be taking it back at a later stage."
"I have nothing in principle against the whole question of these fisheries agreements."
"I support this as a normal commercial activity between the European Union and the competent Member State authorities, who have a right to sit down and make this sort of agreement with us."
"I do not agree with the people who think that this ought to be a mixture of development cooperation and a commercial deal."
"It is a bit futile for us to go to an independent state, make a deal with them, offer them a price and then tell them what they must do with the money."
"It is fairly futile because unless we go in and manage their economies for them, we do not have the capacity to be absolutely sure that what we want them to do with that money is best for them, or indeed that they will actually do it."
"My concern is the whole question of a cost-benefit analysis in this area."
"I believe that all the money we spend on this ought to go to the regions in need, those areas who have spare capacity, who want to utilize that capacity through these deals."
"On the other hand, if we were to take all the money we could organize some sort of a PESCA programme and devote it to these particular regions - I do not mind if it's Spain, or Portugal, or parts of France - and ask ourselves whether, through the development of aquaculture and the creation of more efficient structures within their industry and processing and marketing, the amount of money we spend on this might in fact do much more to advance the economic welfare of these regions."
"That is the question I would like to raise in this debate."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to look at another aspect of these agreements."
"Both of them, for the first time, are agreements on which we are consulted under the code of conduct."
"The code of conduct was approved in December, together with the budget."
"In that joint declaration, signed by the Council, Parliament and the Commission, the Commission undertakes to provide this House with better, and above all prompter, information on the international fisheries agreements."
"Furthermore, all three institutions undertake to expedite the legislative process as far as possible so as to prevent the Commission making - yet again - payments to third states without Parliament, as the budgetary authority, having been able to give its opinion."
"The unfortunate facts, however, are as follows: although this agreement exists, we were not consulted on the agreement with Senegal until three and a half months after it had been initialled, while in the case of Mauritius we were not consulted until four and a half months later."
"In other words, the first payment date for Mauritius has already been overrun by six weeks, while theoretically we have just a fortnight in which to give our opinion on the agreement with Senegal before the first instalment falls due in July."
"This was certainly not what we pictured when the code of conduct was signed!"
"And I would say this to the Council: if we are able to discuss Senegal today, we owe that entirely to the fact that the Commission has at least passed us the text of the agreement and, eventually, the finance sheet as well, though not until a month ago."
"I really do think that, here again, the Commission should work faster."
"But my main criticism is directed at the Council."
"Incidentally, the Commission's advance information on the renegotiation of the agreement with Senegal was totally inadequate, especially as far as the financial aspects were concerned."
"The Committee on Budgets has now accepted three amendments to the agreement, which I would ask you to support."
"As always, they relate to classification."
"The funds for international fisheries agreements are, of course, non-compulsory expenditure."
"As far as information is concerned, two amendments are designed to ensure that the failings that have been mentioned do not recur in future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall not reiterate the main points of the fisheries agreement, which your rapporteur, Mrs Pery, has in any case explained to you quite admirably."
"I shall confine myself instead to making one or two observations of a more general nature on the various questions that have been raised."
"Firstly, to remove any risk of ambiguity, unless I did not quite understand the translation, the agreement does in fact involve a total of 48 million ECU, or in other words 12 million ECU per annum."
"Having said that, I should like to seize this opportunity to lay to rest, once and for all, some of the prejudices and commonplaces I have heard here today concerning the fisheries agreements and which, quite frankly, are beginning to drive me to despair, because I do not know what more I can do to separate fact from myth."
"First of all, Mr Gallagher, I am sorry, but this agreement has nothing whatever to do with the Spanish fleet."
"It is an agreement that concerns mainly the French."
"It has to do with a request for access on the part of the northern States, in particular Germany and Holland."
"So, before people say anything they should check their facts."
"Secondly, I wish to raise the subject of poverty."
"I am indeed sorry not to see Mr Morris here, because I keep being asked the same questions over and over again. I try to answer them, but then we are back where we started from."
"Mr Crampton, we had a debate here on non-industrial fishing back in May, which stirred the same feelings of frustration, what with Members asking me questions and then departing before I have had a chance to reply to them."
"I know everyone is terribly busy, but that is the reason for my having to repeat myself."
"Non-industrial fishing in Senegal is all about a fish called the djaboÃ¯ and the agreement in question allows for catches totalling 25 000 tonnes."
"Let me remind you that Senegalese non-industrial fishermen, without any control or resource-management measures, are landing 400 000 tonnes of this fish."
"Let us stop pretending therefore that the additional 25 000 tonnes of djaboÃ¯ are going to destroy this particular resource or reduce to starvation the Senegalese non-industrial fishermen who themselves, without any controls or management, are catching 400 000 tonnes of them."
"Personally, I wish the local fishermen would observe the principles of control and good management that are being imposed on European vessels."
"Moving on to another matter, I do deplore, and I have myself written a letter on the subject, the very long and heavily slanted RTBF report, which I found insulting if for no other reason than that it ignored the truth."
"In my experience it is normal, when doing a report in which an institution stands accused, for the institution in question to have the right of reply."
"The representative of the non-industrial fishermen does of course have every right to go to Brussels to state his case, but I do feel that the other negotiating partner - in this instance the Commission - should have been allowed to give its own version."
"I come back again to the question of poverty."
"In view of my track record so far, I find it disgusting that I should be accused of exploiting the developing countries."
"Let us remind ourselves of what is in the agreement."
"It provides for 33 % of crews to be Senegalese."
"The agreement states that at least 10 000 tonnes of tuna must be landed to supply local fish processing industries, which otherwise would have no work to do as, apparently, the non-industrial fishing boats do not fish for tuna."
"Instead they fish for djaboÃ¯, which does not need processing."
"The agreement also provides for a scientific observer to be on board."
"This agreement provides for 50 % of the total compensation to be used in the fisheries sector by the Senegalese government."
"But, Mrs JÃ¶ns, we are negotiating agreements with sovereign States."
"Well, we can negotiate and discuss with them what is best for their country's development, but obviously we are not going to tell them what to do, about aquaculture or anything else."
"Talks are in progress and, as I say, these negotiations are with sovereign States."
"My second point is that it is up to every State to carry out its own evaluation of fish stocks in its own waters."
"We can do that together if the State wants it, but ultimately it is for them to decide."
"We cannot go demanding that they leave the evaluation of stocks to us."
"If they do not want that because the waters in question are theirs, they are within their rights to deny us access to them."
"Thirdly, if the fleets, the Member State or the Partner State want it, it is possible with FIFG to sell boats from our fleet to non-industrial fishermen at absolutely special prices."
"All these things are possible; all it needs is for the fleets and shipbuilders to want it too."
"Mrs McKenna, as regards the mid-term review, an annual assessment of the agreement, of the kind we have already undertaken to perform is one thing, a mid-term review is quite another."
"This was never part of our negotiating mandate and it is not in the agreement that we have made with the Senegalese authorities who, moreover, never even required it."
"So when you ask me to review the agreement in two years time in order, if necessary, to renegotiate it, my answer is no, precisely because the agreement has already been negotiated and because it is an important guarantee of stability for the two partners."
"Frankly I find it quite astonishing that anyone should insist on a mid-term review, which does not form part of the agreement, when no-one else, not even the Senegalese, has asked for it."
"And another thing. I have heard it said here that the Senegalese authorities were opposed to this agreement."
"I am absolutely amazed, because in all my contacts with the Senegalese authorities, from Prime Minister to Fisheries Minister and on downwards through all the other ministries - and Mrs Pery knows this very well - I found the exact opposite to be the case."
"As for those who have expressed concerns, they all seemed to have non-industrial fishing on their minds."
"Let me repeat: our catch will be 25 000 tonnes of djaboÃ¯, while non-industrial fishing accounts for 400 000 tonnes."
"If this sector were to apply certain measures aimed at the proper management of non-industrial fishing, that would help."
"We shall only be landing 25 000 tonnes of djaboÃ¯ as a by-catch, so as not to discard it."
"It is djaboÃ¯ that feeds the Senegalese - the only fish they eat - and it is fished by fishermen in their dugout canoes, at the rate of 400 000 tonnes, with no management of stocks."
"I am telling you this to make things very clear."
"I believe I have been able to give some kind of an answer to everyone, having to explain myself once more."
"I am not proposing to go over the Mauritius agreement again, because everything that there was to say has been said."
"I am pleased to see the beginnings of improved cooperation with Parliament."
"There are always bound to be difficult moments in relations with other institutions, and even sometimes between different committees of Parliament, but I believe that the positive progress we have made together until now hopefully means that we can move on and look back on the positive, rather than the negative, side of what we have done."
"The fact that this is a new agreement, which has been concluded in accordance with Article 130 of the Treaty, is proof that even between Commission departments, between DG XIV and DG VIII, close collaboration and close cooperation has been established in our pursuit of an objective that is common to us all, namely to conclude, jointly, evenly-balanced agreements, rather than agreements that are to the detriment of either of the parties."
"Mrs Bonino misunderstood something I said."
"The Committee on Development and Cooperation received a visit from a delegation representing the fishermen themselves, and it was they who asked us to vote against the trade agreement, because they are concerned at the fact that access has been given to their fishery within the twelve-mile zone."
"That is also why we are asking for a mid-term review, if it should turn out that their concern has a basis in reality."
"Mr President, it is very important that the Commissioner should confirm to this House the implication that the information in my report, which I spent many weeks preparing, was not factual."
"I challenge the Commissioner in her criticism of me when she said that it had nothing to do with Spain and when she suggested that I should not have referred to it."
"I would suggest to her that she should acquaint herself with the reports on both Mauritius and Senegal."
"I want to put the record straight in this House."
"I was not being contentious."
"I was merely stating a fact."
"I was not giving my own personal views but those of the Committee on Fisheries."
"The report states that the increase in the number of tuna seiners has made it possible for Spanish vessels to benefit."
"So I challenge the Commissioner to put the record straight here and now and not to besmirch my integrity in this House."
"Mr President, that ties in with Mr Gallagher's point."
"I asked the Commissioner a direct question."
"I thank her for her reply but she omitted to mention this rather critical point about how people get access to these agreements."
"Is there a procedure that she could outline?"
"I did not want to create a discussion about integrity."
"There has been a misunderstanding."
"I was just referring to the Senegal agreement."
"I know very well that the Mauritius agreement is about tuna etc. I did not want to call into question the integrity of anyone."
"When I took the floor I said that the particular sentence referred to the Senegal agreement and underlines that the Senegal agreement is mostly for the French and the opening to the pelagic was at the request of Germany, the Netherlands and the French."
"Regarding your request, Mr Macartney, these are open agreements."
"New Member States can come in."
"The procedure is as follows: normally Member States are informed of the new possibilities and then they inform their own sector."
"So it is the Member States, or the COREPER, or the ambassadors, who inform their own governments which are supposed to inform their own sector."
"This is the normal procedure."
"Of course we could also provide information through the European Parliamentarians."
"But the procedure operates in this way."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Bonino."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Green Paper on commercial communications"
"The next item is the report (A4-0219/97) by Mrs Larive, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the Commission Green Paper on commercial communications in the internal market (COM(96)0192 - C4-0365/96) Draftsmen() Mr Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection Mr Arroni, on behalf of the Committee on Culture; Youth, Education and the Media Mr AÃ±overos Trias de Bes, on behalf of the Committee eon Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights (' Hughes' procedure)"
"The removal of unnecessary barriers to cross-border advertising, direct marketing, sponsorship and much commercial communication is a national issue, and as such is subject only to national legislation."
"Europe's wealth lies in its cultural diversity, and this is why we are right not to concern ourselves with discrepancies between national rules and regulations - provided, Mr Blokland, that they are proportionate and that cross-border commercial communication is not obstructed or discriminated against."
"Under the Hughes procedure, our resolution has taken account of the opinions from the Legal Affairs Committee, the Committee on Culture and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"Together we have sought to rectify a serious shortcoming in the Green Paper in that greater protection is needed for consumers, and a quarter of the text of the resolution by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is now devoted to this."
"A vital element here is our proposal regarding the constitution of the complaints committee, which should not just be a group of officials arranging things behind closed doors, as the Commission proposes, but instead a tripartite committee in which representatives of government, industry and consumer organizations deal with complaints together on an equal footing."
"The resolution forms a triptych."
"First, the indents give details of all the European legislation on consumer protection and the protection of minors with which commercial communication must comply, including the Internet, because what is illegal off-line is just as illegal on-line."
"Secondly, the recitals set out the basic principles of the internal market."
"Finally, the main body of the text contains specific proposals to reinforce and supplement the Green Paper, a document which we nevertheless regard as a sound basis for action."
"In addition to the tripartite committee, we also want the proposed mechanism for assessing proportionality to be safeguarded."
"We want there to be a data bank, a European contact point and a SLIM analysis of the sector, and as the guardian of the Treaties, the Commission should apply Article 169 much more firmly and consistently."
"Our resolution is systematic and well-balanced, trying to secure the internal market on the one hand, while making allowance for cultural differences on the other."
"Industry too should be made to accept its own responsibilities and ensure that there are effective national self-regulatory codes in all the Member States, leading eventually to a single European code if possible."
"It must also do more to improve cross-border complaints procedures for consumers."
"You can therefore imagine my astonishment when a whole pile of amendments appeared last Thursday which to my mind completely undermine the internal market."
"I was also very surprised to see that the Greens, the Europe of Nations Group and the Socialists all submitted amendments with precisely the same wording, and I wonder whether it is just a coincidence that it is also the exact wording proposed by the BEUC, the European Consumers Organization, in its letter of 8 July."
"We reject any such attempt by the multinationals to influence us, particularly remembering how this has angered the House before."
"I reject any such attempt to influence us by any interest groups whatsoever."
"Finally, there is the controversy over country of origin and country of destination, which comes up several times in the amendments."
"Article 59 of the Treaty says that restrictions on freedom to provide services within the Community are to be progressively abolished."
"If a service complies with the rules of the country of origin and is still subject to other rules in the country of destination, then that constitutes a restriction to freedom of movement."
"Article 59 aims to remove barriers so that controls by the country of origin become the norm."
"Does this mean that controls by the country of destination are always contrary to the Treaty?"
"No, because a restriction can be consistent with the Treaty if it is proportionate, which means that the particular measure must be proportionate with the intended objective and the objective cannot be achieved using less restrictive measures."
"Under these circumstances, controls by the country of destination are permitted, and harmonization is the only way to achieve freedom of movement."
"If people refuse to accept this, then there is no internal market for that particular service."
"However, if the measure is found to be disproportionate, because it is designed to protect only the local industry, say, then it is incompatible with the Treaty and the country-of-origin controls must apply."
"If necessary, Article 169 must be invoked."
"The Court of Justice confirmed the country-of-origin principle just last week in the Agostino case."
"The European Parliament did the same with the 'Television without frontiers' directive."
"It is the axis around which the internal market revolves."
"And let us not forget that the country-of-origin principle gives consumers greater access to efficient complaints procedures, because it is only then that the legal system of the country of establishment of media and advertisers accused of infringements can be directly applied."
"In conclusion, we hope to achieve a balanced approach which takes account both of the completion of the internal market and also of cultural differences."
"Mr President, deputizing for my colleague, Mr AÃ±overos, and on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I would firstly like to point out the timeliness of this Green Paper and the necessity, indeed, urgency, for the Commission to address the matter of the intervention of Community law in this particular area."
"Generally speaking, the Committee on Legal Affairs supports the criteria on which the Green Paper is based and, also in general terms, subscribes to the line taken by the report by the Committee on Economic Affairs."
"There is one aspect which Mrs Larive emphasized but which I would also like to stress, albeit a repetition."
"Mrs Larive rightly states that the control measures - i.e. restrictive measures - adopted by the host country are, in principle, contrary to free movement."
"They are therefore contrary to the principle of mutual trust established by the very nature of the internal market and are consequently contrary to the Treaty."
"These measures, therefore, are only exceptionally in accordance with the Treaty."
"Since the landmark 1986 Legia ruling, case law has actually been consistent on this subject and establishes two requirements: firstly, proportionality, as already stated, and, secondly, that it should not be possible to achieve this same end via other measures which restrict free movement to a lesser extent - i.e. which are more in keeping with the internal market."
"We have to stress both aspects."
"Again, as Mrs Larive has quite rightly stated, we should not be told that such measures are justified on grounds of consumer protection, since, let us be clear on this, Mr President, if we truly believe in consumer protection, if we truly wish to build a genuinely integrated Europe, if a specific measure in a Member State is justified on the grounds of consumer protection, what is logical?"
"The national regulations of the other fourteen Member States should be harmonized so that such consumer protection extends right across the internal market. We cannot have exemptions relating to individual Member States."
"We should therefore understand that such control measures - established by the host country - are exceptional measures and are temporary until such time as harmonization is achieved."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start with an aspect that struck me from the outset, the first time I set eyes on this Commission Green Paper."
"The title 'Commercial communications' seems to me misleading, because in fact no one reading or hearing that phrase would correctly guess what it actually means - and certainly not the consumer."
"I would propose, then, that for comparable Green Papers in future the terminology chosen might be more to the point."
"Because what the term 'commercial communication' really refers to, in principle, is that the European Commission has tackled the issue of advertising law in the European single market."
"Quite specifically, it deals with this question: in what circumstances, where, in what country and for what product am I allowed to indulge in advertising - sales promotion, in other words."
"This is actually an area which is dealt with very differently by different Member States."
"In Germany, for example, and admittedly in many other States too - very thoroughly listed by the Commission in the Green Paper - there are a whole range of highly exotic regulations."
"In German law, for example, we have the Discount Act and the Bonus Regulations, and it is certainly fair to say that nothing of the kind exists anywhere else."
"One effect of this is that there are constant obstacles to the free movement of services where advertising is concerned."
"So the consumer, if he receives different advertising messages, cannot always judge accurately how those messages are to be interpreted, because there are widely differing legal regulations, some of which are allowed and some of which are not."
"I therefore especially support the efforts the Commission is making, at last, to bring a holistic approach to this subject, and perhaps to use the Green Paper as a basis for developing additional proposals on the harmonization of advertising law."
"The patchwork mechanism adopted in the past, picking out individual aspects such as comparative advertising, is an unsatisfactory one."
"I think it is far better, as this Green Paper considers, to adopt a holistic approach to the subject, to approach the issue of advertising law as a whole."
"I wish the Commission every success in the further course of its work."
"It can rely upon the support of Parliament in this matter - that much is apparent from the opinions of the Committee on Economic Affairs and the other committees."
"Mr President, opinions can of course differ regarding the degree of balance achieved by Mrs Larive's motion for a resolution."
"It all depends how you look at it."
"However, I would not go so far as to imply that, if we undertake something here from the standpoint of consumer protection, it can be the subject of negative lobbying somewhere or other."
"You approach things from a particular point of awareness, just as I do - I, too, was once a representative of consumer protection."
"There are of course various things that could be said about terminology. The term 'commercial communication' encompasses all forms of advertising, direct marketing, sponsorship, public relations and sales promotion, and it embraces the use of commercial communication services by the consumer goods industry and service sectors of all kinds."
"That is exactly why commercial communication has become such an exceptionally important social factor today."
"In principle, I am receptive to all liberalization movements that allow new forms of economic activity but - the crucial point - consumer protection cannot be disregarded at this particular time."
"Indeed, the author of the report herself refers to the need to involve the consumer at every stage of the process."
"That is a demand that I naturally support in principle, particularly because consumer protection, in the liberalistic system of the defence of interests based on individual responsibility, is not just a question of fair competition and equality of opportunity in the single market, as industry demands every time something is done to boost liberalization."
"In reality, of course, consumer protection is something more."
"The amendments tabled by my group relate to a question of principle. They relate to the involvement of and respect for the consumer, and especially to the right of our children not to be subjected to total brainwashing by advertisers."
"That is the issue of consumer protection!"
"Even within our system of values, this is a question of democratic minimum standards, despite, and indeed because of, the great economic potential involved."
"The citizen of the European Union must not have the feeling that, within the liberalized European Union, he has been delivered up helplessly into the hands of various lobbies and their interests, because otherwise he might eventually transfer that very feeling onto the European Union, which is something we do not want."
"Consumer protection is a question of confidence and the creation of confidence."
"It is clear to me, on the one hand, that every enterprise and every industry wants to see its own house rules transferred to the marketplace."
"But we must not lose sight of the fact that the consumer, the purchaser, the user has a right to have the standards or provisions of the law applied in his home country."
"The amendments tabled by the Socialist Group are designed to ensure better communication, better access to the law and a closer watch on commercial communication for the consumer, and to build his confidence."
"The issue is the protection of the weak, not some new form of protectionism."
"So it is important, when we come to vote, that due account is also taken of this entitlement."
"Mr President, I would point out to Mr Ettl that that is what protectionists through the ages have always said."
"In today's society, commercial communication is practically what makes or breaks a product, and the considerable differences which exist in national legislation need to be eliminated if we wish to make the largest market with the greatest spending power in the world - our own European internal market - accessible to firms."
"That is why this Green Paper, which finally spells things out clearly, has been welcomed with such enthusiasm."
"The plethora of existing national rules and regulations urgently need reviewing in the light of European legislation and the broader aims of the Treaty."
"Besides cultural differences, differences in national legislation are the greatest obstacles to the smooth operation of the internal market."
"Cultural differences may well also represent a major obstacle, but if so, it is one which we hope will always remain."
"If consumers cannot identify with a product because the way in which it is marketed does not take account of their specific cultural background, the product is bound to fail on that market."
"In my view, it is the consumer who determines whether a manufacturer has taken sufficient account of his cultural background, and we do not need special legislation for that."
"As Christian Democrats, we feel that the new spirit shown in the Amsterdam Treaty concerning the European Union's respect for religious beliefs and the principle of non-discrimination should also be fully reflected in future directives in this field, and we will support any amendments to that effect."
"My group feels that regulations in this area simply have to be based on the country-of-origin principle, as this is the only way to eliminate or prevent the barriers to trade created by discrepancies in national legislation."
"As soon as you combine the country of origin and the country of destination, the situation becomes unworkable, in that businesses have to seek authorization from all 15 Member States."
"Having said that, I would point out that although the internal market is important, the interests of consumers and particularly children also need to be protected against excessively aggressive advertising."
"We are therefore 100 % in favour of the rapporteur's proposal for a tripartite committee to deal with complaints to the Commission."
"Parliament cannot be involved in this committee: we shall be calling the Commission to account, but our job is purely to monitor."
"To sum up, my group supports all the basic principles set out by the rapporteur in her excellent report: the countryof-origin principle, the proportionality principle, and the tripartite committee without the EP but with representatives of industry, and chaired by the Commission."
"We shall therefore be voting against any amendments which undermine these principles."
"Mr President, if by definition 'commercial communication' includes every form used to promote products, services and company, group or organization images, among distributors and/or consumers, it could be said that it covers everything, from serious and scientific information to the deceptive advertising and brain washing mentioned by Mr Ettl."
"The Larive report does deal with the defence of consumer rights and that is welcome."
"But we should like to use the very short time we have been given to emphasize a more relevant point: we must regulate commercial communications so that they cannot be used perversely so that, by using means only available to large groups, they distort or eliminate competition, by smashing opponents unable to resort to the same means."
"The question is to know whether, when we hear so much about competitiveness, fair competition and protecting the weakest, there are or can be real objectives that can be put into practice, in the face of the polarization of means, even or especially those of commercial communications."
"Mr President, cross-border commercial communication is a difficult phenomenon, and the rapporteur has mentioned the obstacles which service providers in this sector face in trying to cover the whole of the internal market."
"Every Member State has its own rules and regulations on admissibility for commercial communication."
"Are these national laws the culprits?"
"Research would indicate otherwise: it is actually the differences in culture and market structure that lie behind the legislative diversity which are to blame, but this is something which Mrs Larive's report does not take up adequately."
"Moreover, the rigorous application of the country-of-origin principle tends to mean a particularly low level of protection for consumers and children."
"The right to freedom of expression is something else to be considered."
"This freedom involves duties and responsibilities, as specified in Article 10(2) of the European Convention on Human Rights: it has to be protected, but it must also not cause harm to others."
"In my Amendments Nos 19 and 26, I have given a far from exhaustive list of the limits which commercial communication service providers should observe."
"I sincerely hope that the rapporteur will support these proposals."
"Mr President, the report which we are discussing forms a constructive and well balanced contribution to the evaluation of the Green Paper."
"Mrs Larive has raised the important role played by advertisements, marketing, sponsorship, sales support and public relations in the internal market in a manner which deserves our praise. This applies both to the internal market and to activities in markets outside Europe."
"The rapid development of electronic trading makes commercial communication all the more important."
"Effective commercial communication enables the private purchaser to make purchases abroad more easily but, of course, this should only be on condition that illegal marketing is actively discouraged."
"This is also underlined in the report."
"T he report comes with a number of addenda to the Commission's proposal."
"This reflects the valuable work carried out by the rapporteur and the four committees involved."
"We welcome the proposals put forward by Parliament and will, of course, take heed of them in the communication that the Commission has planned for the Autumn."
"The regulations governing this area differ in the various Member States."
"At this stage, complete harmonisation is scarcely an appropriate method of resolving all the different problems which can arise."
"This is made clear in the Green Paper as well."
"Instead, we prefer a gradual approach, where solutions are sought case by case."
"This will take place as part of a structured dialogue with the interested parties and with the Member Countries."
"This is dependent, in its turn, on close contact between all the parties involved and a common view of the methods to be used in tackling individual problems."
"I am pleased that Mrs Larive's report agrees with this approach."
"The report supports and reinforces the key proposal in the Green Paper concerning how to assess proportionality in national actions which appear to be obstacles to the internal market."
"This also applies to the proposal on targeted community harmonisation which we will be studying more closely."
"The Commission also welcomes Parliament's support and their proposals for the proposed committee on commercial communication, which will consist of a member from each Member Country with the Commission taking the presidency."
"We will be studying closely those proposals relating not only to giving interested parties access to this forum but also allowing them to participate in it."
"Parliament's proposal that the committee should operate using open procedures and with clear deadlines is both logical and constructive."
"Let me conclude by assuring the House that the Commission will study carefully what has been approved by the four committees involved."
"We will not hesitate to table a proposal on targeted harmonisation where this proves to be necessary."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Gradin."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.05 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"Yesterday's Minutes have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I just wish to mention that my name does not appear in the attendance register in yesterday's Minutes."
"This is probably my fault because I cannot remember whether I signed or not, but I was indeed present."
"Mr President, this is just to inform the House that I was here yesterday but was not recorded in the Minutes."
"I would be grateful if that could be changed."
"Very well. The necessary corrections will be made."
"Mr President, may I draw attention to the fact that yesterday one of our National Front colleagues was encouraging us to celebrate the 14th of July and to dance the carmagnole, while at the same time the mayor of Toulon was banning the festival arranged by the anti-racist organization SOS Racisme, on this French day of freedom?"
"This is clear evidence of double standards at Toulon and at Strasbourg."
"Mr President, yesterday we placed on Wednesday's agenda the vote without debate on an interinstitutional agreement on the financing of the common foreign and security policy."
"Our aim in doing this was to apply Rule 143 of the Rules of Procedure, which requires the Committee on Budgets to have first adopted the report that it is putting before this House."
"Well, the Committee on Budgets met yesterday evening and was unable, for lack of time, to examine the text in question."
"And even had it been able to do so, if Rule 104 of the Rules of Procedure is applied this can only lead to it being put down for the next part-session."
"I should like to add that what we are dealing with here is an interinstitutional agreement, one that is going to apply to all the institutions, that has not been the subject of any debate in any national parliament, that has not been discussed at all by the Foreign Affairs Committee, and which we are being asked to adopt here without debate!"
"Moreover, at a time when people are quite rightly accusing the European Union of being insufficiently democratic, this procedure shows a flagrant disregard for the citizens of the European Union as a whole."
"I am therefore asking you not to approve the part of the Minutes that deals with adopting this item and including it in the agenda; otherwise we shall be forced to resort to one of the other options available to us under Rule 143 to ensure that the opportunity to hold this debate is not spirited away from us."
"And in any case, we need to wait for the Amsterdam Treaty to be adopted by the various Member States."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr FabreAubrespry's intervention comes as no surprise, since he informed the Committee on Budgets yesterday evening that he would be making it."
"The text in question is an interinstitutional agreement concluded with the Council and the Commission in connection with the second pillar of the Maastricht Treaty and concerning the funding of foreign-policy measures."
"The document in its present wording has been on the table since the conclusion of the negotiations in Amsterdam."
"The fact that 4 July is the date given on the cover page is simply due to the document having become a report."
"The document, however, has been on the table since Amsterdam; in other words, the countdown to the amendment deadline has been running since 30 June."
"We in the Committee on Budgets have arranged another extraordinary meeting of our own for this afternoon to discuss the details of this report, because a motion has been tabled for a decision to be taken without debate tomorrow on the basis of Rule 143."
"I assume, Mr President, that this fulfils the formal requirements and would therefore ask you to reject Mr Fabre-Aubrespy's request."
"Thank you very much, Mr Samland."
"Since the Committee on Budgets is meeting this afternoon or tonight, I think that this debate can be kept on tomorrow's agenda, as scheduled."
"Are there any other comments?"
"Mr President, the Minutes do not record my presence yesterday."
"I would like that corrected."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Ahern. That has been noted."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Decision on urgency"
"I call on Mr Colino Salamanca, the representative of the Committee on Agriculture, to speak on the basis of the item."
"Mr President, yesterday the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development decided to approve the urgent nature of the Commission's proposal and to submit it to the part-session for consideration as part of Friday's agenda, without a report."
"I would, however, request that Mr Funck, whom our committee has appointed to present a report, be allowed to give the House an informal oral report, under paragraph 5 of Rule 97 of the Rules of Procedure."
"(The request was approved)"
"Legal protection of biotechnological inventions"
"The next item is the report (A4-0222/97) by Mr Rothley, on behalf of the Committee on legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions (COM(95)0661 - C4-0063/96-95/0350(COD))."
"Mr President, a journalist from the Wall Street Journal recently asked me if I was a patent attorney."
"I told her I was not and that I had no particular interest in patents."
"But people with genetic diseases becoming curable does interest me, and people finding work interests me too!"
"And that Europe should not fall any further behind in biotechnology and genetic engineering, that interests me!"
"(Applause) By adopting this Directive we are not opening any floodgates."
"We are meeting our obligations under the international convention, in which all Member States of the European Union and the Union itself have pledged themselves to grant patent protection for products and processes in all areas of technology."
"This patent legislation has been created in the United States and it has been created in Japan."
"It is only a matter of the European Union upgrading its patent law to this international standard."
"That is all."
"The European Patent Office does issue patents in this area."
"These patents, however, can be challenged by national courts, and there is therefore a real danger of legal fragmentation in Europe, a fragmentation that would be poison for investment in Europe."
"That is why we need this Directive."
"By the way, I said that this patent protection already exists in the United States and in Japan."
"I do not believe that the Americans or Japanese are morally corrupt."
"How absurdly presumptuous of us to think we are morally superior to the others!"
"It will no doubt be asserted in the course of this debate that this Directive will obstruct research."
"That, of course, is untrue."
"Patent protection is a prerequisite of research."
"How can any research be conducted at all if inventions are not made public?"
"We know from experience that effective patent protection and research go hand in hand."
"Or has research in the United States perhaps hit rock-bottom, or has research in Japan hit rock-bottom?"
"Nothing could be further from the truth!"
"If we do not create this patent protection, research will, of course, continue."
"But it will continue behind close doors."
"We shall not have the opportunity to follow and discuss the development of biotechnology and genetic engineering."
"We shall also, incidentally, destroy the small university research establishments and the small and medium-sized businesses that live from selling their patents to pharmaceutical companies."
"Those who want to do that should vote against the Directive!"
"But they should not subscribe to any more resolutions against unemployment."
"(Applause) It is asserted that discoveries would be patented under the Directive."
"That, of course, is untrue."
"Nobody in the world who knows anything of patent law would make that claim, with the exception of Greenpeace's legal experts."
"It is asserted that treatments will be patented in the future."
"That, of course, is untrue."
"Diagnostic and therapeutic processes will be no more eligible for patenting than they have been in the past."
"That is expressly stated in the recitals of this Directive."
"It is asserted that parts of the human body would be patented."
"That, of course, is untrue."
"We have made that crystal-clear in the text of this Directive."
"Parts of the human body will not be patented."
"What will be patented are products made by human hand and nothing else!"
"We have made that crystal-clear in Article 3."
"Paragraph 1 describes what discoveries are, and paragraph 2 describes what inventions are."
"There are some forms of dyslexia for which I cannot be held responsible!"
"(Laughter) The European Parliament has been under considerable pressure over the last few days, not only here in the House."
"The Protestant Church in Germany, my own church, allowed Greenpeace to stage a children's crusade against this Directive at its General Assembly."
"(Heckling) I assume that, for the youngsters who took part in it, this was the first time they had heard the word 'patent' ."
"Enough of this nonsense!"
"(Applause) Let us have done with this nonsense and come back to the subject of patent law."
"This law will not be able to solve the ethical questions that arise in connection with biotechnology and genetic engineering."
"That is beyond the power of patent law; it is a constant task of society and its legislatures."
"It cannot be done by patent law alone."
"Patent law seeks only to prohibit the unauthorized use of someone else's invention for commercial purposes."
"That is all."
"It is, if you like, part of the law governing competition."
"And for that reason we need this Directive to strengthen competition within the European Union."
"We need it urgently."
"That is why I ask for your support."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a serious matter."
"This is the first time in the history of humanity that patents are to be issued in respect of living material."
"And when Mr Rothley says it is a matter of protecting products made by human hand, we cannot fail to observe that what is to be made patentable today has indeed been produced by human hand."
"Generations of human hands, Mr Rothley, have contributed to a colossal cultivation effort to create what we live on today, the basis of our subsistence."
"And along come interested parties now and look at this creation, at the way in which the farming community has been able, as a matter of course, to develop and sow seed, to breed and rear animals and to feed us with the fruits of its labour, and these interested parties decide they would like a slice of the cake."
"They certainly do provide a genetic boost to the process of livestock development and land cultivation, but the purpose of this genetic boost, which they subsequently patent, is to give them rights over the entire stock of seed and animals."
"It is a question, Mr Rothley, of coining in on something that has always been a matter of course."
"That is what the Agriculture Committee wanted to prevent at all costs."
"We have emphasized the so-called farmer's privilege."
"This is nothing more than the right of farmers to raise their livestock and to sow their seed."
"We were unable to have this view adopted in its entirety, but we did manage to enshrine something of this right."
"And, Mr Rothley, the Committee on Agriculture also called for removal from the draft Directive of the clause on reversal of the burden of proof."
"I ask the House to accept the proposal of the Agriculture Committee on this point too, so that those who wish to claim rights under a patent must prove that they are indeed the legitimate holders of the patent."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy voted by a large majority in favour of the proposal for a directive that we are today debating, asking the Legal Affairs Committee to refine it further."
"I cannot but be in complete agreement with what Mr Rothley has said and want only to highlight a couple of points."
"There is substantial demand for the products of biotechnology: demand from citizens, particularly those whose circumstances are rather special - and this mainly involves the pharmaceuticals sector; and demand from sectors, such as agriculture, in which products of this kind could bring substantial benefits from many points of view."
"What we therefore need to determine is whether Europe, whether the European Union, wants merely to be a consumer and, therefore, importer of the results of research into biotechnology, via the products in which biotechnology has been used, or whether it wants also to be a producer and, consequently, a potential exporter."
"The protection of biotechnological inventions, which we also need to enable the single market to function better, is vital in order to provide a favourable framework for the development of European industry in the sector, with obvious advantages: for employment, as Mr Rothley has already said and I can only emphasize further; for the development of research in a rapid growth sector; to generate value added, income, well-being; to - and I venture to stress this - make it possible to retain greater control of the sector, particularly given the ethical and other concerns that many people have."
"Mr President, about 40 % of today's world economy is based on genetic resources from developing countries."
"These so-called developing countries also contain 86 % of the world's plants."
"Every fourth medicinal drug is manufactured from the genetic resources of tropical plants."
"Eighty-three per cent of known genetic diversity and in situ knowledge is held in Africa, Asia and Latin America."
"The German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation writes that, according to estimates by the International Ethnobotanical Society, the indigenous peoples in those three parts of the world possess 99 % of the entire body of knowledge on useful biological diversity."
"In other words, this means that the bulk of the resources we are now discussing, resources for biotechnological inventions and for patents awarded or potentially awardable in respect of such inventions, come from the Third World."
"These biological resources are too often used without the consent, or indeed against the wishes, of the indigenous peoples or local communities in whose country they are found; we might even say they are being stolen."
"The use of these resources for biotechnological inventions depends on traditional wisdom, such as knowledge of their medicinal properties or cultivation methods."
"This means that the multinationals make huge profits from the biodiversity of developing countries and from the traditional knowledge of their inhabitants without a decision-making process, without consent, without legal protection and participatory rights for the populations concerned and that they even patent human or biological material."
"The best-known examples are perhaps the Guayami Indians in Panama and the Hagahai in Papua-New Guinea or on the Solomon Islands."
"That is why it is especially important to strengthen intellectual and cultural property rights in the countries of the Third World and particularly among indigenous peoples."
"When Mr Rothley says jobs are at stake, that is nothing but polemics."
"Multinational corporations are acquiring the property rights of the world's population."
"So what we actually need is a convention on traditional rights."
"That is why our committee has rejected this report."
"We have agreed with Mr Rothley on the inclusion of the principles enshrined in Article 8j of the Convention on Biological Diversity."
"The committee will have a free vote."
"If the recital based on this Article is accepted, the position will have changed."
"As someone involved in Third World policy, I can say from personal experience that no jobs are created by these activities; they only serve to swell the coffers of the multinationals."
"The current system under the European Patent Convention is better."
"The harmonization envisaged in the new Directive will bring us no nearer to a common convention for the people of this world."
"Mr President, the opinion of the Environment Committee seeks to restrain Mr Rothley's report."
"When ordinary people hear that we are debating patents on genes, the immediate reaction is everywhere the same: you cannot take out a patent on that kind of thing, regardless of the fact that a substance can be patented if it is possible to characterize it by its structure."
"This instinctive repugnance is something we should take seriously. We should at least make the patentability of genes as restrictive as possible, so that the patent only covers the industrial application for which it has been sought."
"We should also do that for the sake of the patients."
"Patients suffering from rare diseases or cancer, for which knowledge on a great variety of genes is needed, are gravely concerned that it may not otherwise be possible to pay for the research."
"However, it should not be possible to patent methods of diagnosis."
"Official circles in Denmark have been particularly concerned to ensure that it is not possible to patent procedures for the modification of the genetic identity of human body cells."
"This would, for example, make it impossible to take out patents on cosmetic interventions in human beings."
"I therefore urge you to vote for my amendment to paragraph 2a of Article 9 - not paragraph 2b, as has been incorrectly indicated."
"The amendment excludes the possibility of such a patent."
"Finally measures should be taken to ensure that, in accordance with the Convention on Biological Diversity, agreement has been reached on the equitable sharing of economic benefits before a patent is issued in those cases in which biological material is obtained from a developing country."
"In my Amendment No 65 I am asking, for reasons I do not have time to explain here because unfortunately so very little speaking time has been allowed, that the sentence on publication be dropped."
"Mr President, after eight years we can at last be hopeful of a successful outcome for this important text - Mr Rothley has reminded us of all the issues involved - and for this we have to thank the combined efforts of our rapporteur, to whose work I pay sincere tribute, and the successive chairmen of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, currently Mr De Clercq, and Mr Casini before him."
"I have just three observations, since I have three minutes."
"The first thing I want to say is that the draft directive that has been put before us answers the main objections that had led to the first draft being rejected, as you will recall, in March 1995: the ban on germ-line therapy, the protection of animal rights, the setting up of an ethics committee and, most importantly, the clear commitment to a ban on patenting the human body; and on this point I believe that the wording our committee has come up with, which eliminates the ambiguities in the Commission's initial draft, could not be clearer."
"My second observation concerns the slogan 'No patents on life' , a slogan with which we have been bombarded at enormous expenditure of resources, which I cannot help wondering about, in a flood of letters, cards and press releases, of which we have all been a target."
"As if the directive's opponents had a monopoly on protecting life and its supporters were messengers of death!"
"Let me say quite emphatically that, for me, protecting life means not standing in the way of progress in medical research."
"Protecting life means giving hope to children suffering from cystic fibrosis."
"Protecting life means opening up new prospects in the fight against malaria."
"Protecting life, when all is said and done, means stamping out hunger in the world by increasing the available food resources."
"Protecting life means finding new types of crops that are more economical with our soils and require fewer fertilizers and pesticides."
"The so-called cautious approach that some people advocate is a luxury that only well-off westerners can afford!"
"My third and final observation. I should like to say a word on exceptions to patentability, which has to do with methods of intervention on embryos."
"Let us be clear on this point: there was never any question of patenting the embryo, any more than the human body or its parts."
"Certainly not."
"However, this measure does cause problems, let it be said, between the PPE and ourselves."
"It is a measure that springs from an initiative of one of our PPE colleagues and which, because it involves public order and moral standards, does affect, let's face it, not just patentability, but also research."
"As we know, research on embryos is banned in Germany, and I respect this decision, I respect the conviction behind it, but this very same research is authorized, and strictly controlled by legislative provisions and codes of practice, in the United Kingdom, Spain, Belgium and France."
"It is necessary not only to make progress - it has been done in fields such as in vitro fertilization - but also to open up new prospects in the fight against nervous disorders, or against Alzheimer's disease."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you will understand that my group cannot accept the ban imposed by this paragraph."
"We respect your convictions, which derive from your history, your culture and your religion. I am asking you to respect ours too."
"I have to tell you that we shall be voting against this paragraph. But we shall of course be voting in favour of the Rothley report."
"Mr President, I believe that the anguish that has surrounded this directive is justified. It is justified because what this directive is doing is statutorily regulating the activity of man who having first observed and laid hands on innermost matter, the atom, is now observing and laying hands on the most intimate aspects of living matter."
"There are problems, and they are by no means trivial."
"The task is made all the more difficult because this is a field that is difficult to understand, in both legal and biological terms."
"Patent law is a difficult area, this is a new field and biology is hard to explain to those unfamiliar with the subject."
"Finally, there is a great deal of pressure from European pharmaceutical industries that want to be able to compete with the United States and Japan: they hold out the prospect of more jobs, but they need to make huge investments because, these days, inventions are not the product of a stroke of genius but the result of an effort over a long period by many people."
"Moreover, cultural circles and environmentalists are bring pressure of another kind to bear: they fear that the environment will be polluted and that huge resources will be seized by the few to the detriment of the many."
"How are we to take a view on this?"
"I happen to have today read an interview with New York's former mayor, Mario Cuomo, which, I think, provides the right steer and which I should like you to hear. Former mayor Cuomo said that, in the field of biotechnology, the sole focus should be life which is the most precious thing that man has to protect."
"If we place life, which is the most sacred thing we have, at the centre of our political, philosophical and scientific considerations, then progress will be painless."
"I am therefore in favour of establishing the directive in full because I am thinking of life, of the life of the many sick people who are waiting for it and have written to us."
"Some may perhaps have had some relationship with the industry's lobby which wants the directive at any cost; but it is a fact that there are sick people; it is a fact that pharmaceuticals have already been discovered using the new techniques of genetic manipulation and that other, more important ones may be found."
"But for the very same reason that I am favour of the basic fabric of the directive, I also believe that guidelines and categorical limits have to be established."
"Those limits are the ones established by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights in the amendment to Article 9."
"However much I wish to defend the directive, I believe that its long passage, that it not over today, would be prejudiced if all of the limits provided for in Article 9 were to be changed and abolished."
"I have to say that Mr Rothley is right here when he says that what we want to protect through patenting are the inventions and not genes or genetic sequences."
"But in that case we need to take to follow through principle that it is the invention that is to be protected and not the gene, so that the invention is linked to a specific statement of industrial authorization."
"We have already said this in the Legal Affairs Committee and are repeating it here, and we hope that this is the direction the final text will take."
"Moving in that same direction, I ask you to consider, specifically because of the importance of the directive, the need to retain as it stands the committee's amendment to Article 9."
"Mr Rothley, it is not an old ideology that is at issue; there is no reference to abortion or generally experimenting with embryos."
"It says only that human embryos should not be used for economic gain and that in an article which, rightly, provides that no suffering should be caused to animals."
"That is all it says!"
"It seems to me that the European Parliament, which sees the value of human beings as the basis for seeking investment for the benefit of man, should have the courage to engage in a simple process of reconciliation by accepting this limit along with the others."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the text of Mr Rothley's report has been long and difficult in the making."
"In 1995, as you will all recall, the House rejected the text produced by the Conciliation Committee, taking the view that it did not make plain enough the parameters and limits required in an area as sensitive as the patentability of biotechnological inventions."
"Thanks to the detailed and new work done by Mr Rothley - whom I congratulate on behalf of my group - we now have a substantially clearer text that is able to meet the demands both of those who wish to guarantee European firms a favourable legal framework that does not perpetuate the disadvantage they suffer compared with their US and Japanese competitors and of those who are rightly determined not to abandon the protection of human beings and other living beings."
"The new proposal for a directive, based on Article 100a of the Treaty, contains a number of important points of reference."
"In particular, it makes a distinction between a discovery and an invention; it refers to the principles of existing legislation regarding the conditions of patentability; it rules out patentability for germinal genetic therapies applied to human beings; it establishes that the human body and parts thereof in their natural state cannot be deemed to be patentable inventions; it is designed - and this is a requirement that was stipulated and needs to be borne in mind - to protect the interests of farmers in the livestock sector."
"The amendments adopted by the Legal Affairs Committee are designed to rule out patentability of, among other things, plant varieties and animal species, biological procedures for the production of plants and animals, parts of the human body at its various stages of development; the simple discovery of the sequences contained in genes; the procedures for human cloning or measures to modify the germinal line of human beings; methods which make use of human embryos; and inventions the use and publication of which are incompatible with ordre public and morality."
"The latter, in particular, is an element that will certainly be the source of a great deal of work for the courts and lawyers because we know just how different the concept of ordre public and morality can be, depending on the time and the place."
"Nonetheless, this is part of a general solution arrived at within the Legal Affairs Committee and one which, we believe, should be endorsed in all its aspects because, if it is not, it could again undermine the credibility of this House."
"We believe that at a time when all eyes in Europe - and not just in Europe - are focusing on the work this House is doing, the worst thing would be were we to prove yet again to be incapable of taking a decision."
"Mr President, as others have said before me, this directive is particularly important because it harmonizes patent law in the Member States in the area of biotechnological inventions, in order to clear up the legal uncertainties and to avoid the risk of it all falling apart."
"I should remind you, as does the excellent rapporteur Mr Rothley, whom I do congratulate, the purpose of patents."
"It is to reward inventors for their creative activity, to provide an incentive to invention and to promote technological innovation as an essential factor of economic growth."
"It is through the protection granted to patents that the heavy, even massive, investments - not to mention the return on them - in research and the industrial exploitation of the results can be secured."
"The market in biotechnological products is a fast expanding one."
"It is estimated that this market will be worth 80 billion ecus in the year 2000, a quarter of which will be spent on new drugs."
"At present, unfortunately, Europe is nowhere: in biotechnology, in immunology, we are being beaten on our own continent by American firms."
"The first question then is this: is the European pharmaceuticals industry going to be allowed to catch up and make us less dependent on the United States for new drugs as well as agrochemicals?"
"Are we somehow going to develop the means to take charge of our own health?"
"That is the aim of the directive."
"But, of course, since it involves research and patents on living tissues, the ethical aspects naturally absorbed our attention for many long hours."
"As has already been said, the directive states plainly that the human body is not patentable, that human cloning is banned and as is altering the human gene line."
"All possible precautions to prevent possible abuses have been taken and, consequently, the objections concerning the risks of gene manipulation are unfounded, especially as the directive provides for the setting up of a European ethics committee."
"I would say in conclusion, therefore, that for us the directive as it stands, with the amendments voted through in committee, constitutes the middle ground between the need to pursue scientific progress in biotechnology and the desire to protect human dignity and integrity."
"To those who once again seek to impede - as they tried to do some time ago by calling for a moratorium on research - all advancement of human knowledge, ban all research and inventions to do with biological material, to them I would simply say that they would be bearing a very heavy responsibility if they were to crush all hope of a cure in those for whom gene technology offers the only chance of escaping a life of disability, even of escaping death itself."
"In all human progress it is always possible to discern a dark side, where inventions are put to a perverted use."
"It is for us, for our democratic countries and institutions, to avoid this risk, not through a Luddite approach to scientific discovery, but by ensuring, by means of proper controls, that the ever deeper understanding of the human body is devoted exclusively to combatting physical and mental afflictions."
"That is what the directive, as amended, sets out to do, which is why the ELDR Group will of course be voting for Mr Rothley's report."
"Mr President, presumably, the aim of such a directive and, consequently, of the Rothley report is to attempt to protect the public interest by extending patentability to biological material."
"However, such a claim must be considered cautiously since patents on genes and cells will give private concerns virtually unlimited control over the basic elements of life. Not only is no in-depth thought given to this risk but also the report avoids the issue, maintaining instead that ethical matters are unconnected with patent law."
"Moral issues are, in fact, not discussed - a debatable point if one takes account of the fact that all law, including patent law, is concerned with responsibility, duty and obligation."
"Everything relating to the basic elements of life gives rise to moral considerations."
"Yet, however questionable this exclusion of moral issues may be, it appears more questionable still to claim that - from the standpoint of consistency - the public interest is being defended when, in reality, legal instruments are being created which enable the industry to claim that it has invented natural processes and the circumstances are such that industry might gain a total monopoly of control."
"What guarantees do we have that such control will be exercised to the benefit of the public interest?"
"None, except the good will of whoever is exercising that control."
"It is financial considerations - not public ones - which will shape the decision as to how and when an invention is to be exploited and who is to benefit from it, given that control over whether a patented invention is exploited or not is granted to the proprietor of the patent who will naturally make decisions regarding it on the basis of his or her own interests."
"This is a worrying scenario and, moreover, in Mr Rothley's report, emphasis is given to the need to eliminate legal uncertainties and to ensure that the law on patents is interpreted uniformly in the Member States of the Union."
"However, in practice, this uncertainty continues, given that this directive is in conflict with the principles of the Convention on the granting of European patents, expanding the scope of patents beyond currently established limits."
"I believe that reflection is in order."
"The granting of patents should not depend on exclusively technical considerations - applications should be closely examined in terms of their wider social implications."
"The Commission's new proposal has not attempted to examine such wider social implications or explore alternative forms of intellectual property rights which reward genuine innovation without guaranteeing the monopolistic powers of control conferred by patents."
"All this should mean that we consider the issues calmly and arrive at a political decision which goes beyond the desire to satisfy the demand for biotechnological products."
"Such a political decision should also pay heed to the ethical question."
"My Group calls upon this House to base its deliberations on moral principles."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, whatever is possible is permissible here. Is it right, Mr Rothley, to allow things just because they are possible?"
"We are debating principles today in a debate which transcends boundaries but for which quite new boundaries need to be set."
"At the heart of this debate is nothing less than responsibility."
"It is about morals and ethics."
"It is about the value of life."
"It is about the inviolability of nature."
"It is about human rights."
"Do this call for growth and progress and the illusory promise of more jobs not represent a threat to social welfare and the rule of law? Do they not undermine the principle of respect for nature?"
"The patenting of living organisms and rejection of the inviolability of the individual are the result of an overweening arrogance that no longer knows any bounds."
"Who do we think we are, regarding evolution as private property and claiming ownership rights in respect of a life that has evolved over millions of years into millions of living organisms, our common heritage with its indescribable wealth of biological diversity?"
"Who do we think we are, believing we are entitled to set ourselves above the flora and fauna of this world in order finally to enslave humankind and turn people into exploitable commodities, into mere biological material?"
"Responsibility towards ourselves and our children's children can only mean strict and consistent rejection."
"No patents for genes, plants, animals, people or their constituent parts!"
"We are committed to freedom of research and development."
"But we are opposed to any situation in which this freedom is liable to be restricted by excessive patenting, by the inaccessibility of scientific knowledge, due to its having become the preserve of individual groups of companies and hence of economic interests, and in which the right to acquire and share knowledge is a question of money."
"And we are committed to morality in politics."
"Above all else, morality means independence."
"We are not the caretakers of an unbridled competitive ideology in which policies are subordinated and attuned to these interests."
"I appeal to our social responsibility, which is something other than subjugation to the policies of BASF, Boehringer or whatever they are all called."
"I should have liked to see some of this independence from the rapporteur, because the separation of politics and morality can only result in immoral policies."
"Mr President, colleagues, two years ago the European Parliament rejected at the third reading the initial draft directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions."
"A unique event in the annals of the codecision procedure, this negative vote let it be known that our Assembly was not prepared to adopt illdefined legislation that has such a bearing on what human beings are most sensitive, namely their genetic heritage - gene pool - the opening of the book of life."
"One year ago, at the time of the public hearing organized by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, we witnessed some fascinating and contrasting debates between the experts invited here to express their views on the legitimacy of patenting scientific research and development. That, I hear you say, was yesterday."
"Yes, but unfortunately between yesterday and today the debate has progressed very little and the blurred areas are still with us."
"Commercial interests have been increasingly insistent, the same pressure groups have been vocally advancing the same arguments, and throughout these two years the Commission, confusing speed with haste, has drafted a new fresh text which, while noticeably different, has still not altered the original concept, not one iota."
"What the Commission is actually doing is laying down a basic premise according to which patent law is relegated to a piece of technical legislation which, therefore, would more or less be confined to dealing with ethical questions, even when this law applies to living human material."
"In other words, it is setting the limits on patentability solely on the distinction between invention and discovery, thereby cleverly stifling all philosophical and political debate on the future of mankind."
"One or two questions come to mind."
"How is it that the Commission has never wondered about the pertinence of applying the principles of patent law to living tissue and, in particular, to human living tissue, nor about the pertinence of adapting these principles?"
"It is really quite a fundamental point."
"What are we to make of the report passed by the Legal Affairs Committee?"
"It is in fact an imperfect clone of the Commission's draft."
"A clone, in the sense that the Legal Affairs Committee manifestly takes the same strict legal view as to the manner in which patent law should apply to living human tissue."
"Imperfect, because it is necessary nevertheless to emphasize the considerable improvements introduced by Members to Articles 3 and 9 of the text, which spell out the relevant ethical principles."
"The fact remains that the affirmation of ethical principles is always unsatisfactory."
"No higher principles, such as the preservation of the human body from exploitation or respect for human dignity underpin measures of a legal nature."
"Amendment No 81, tabled by the ARE Group, seeks to re-establish the supremacy of Man and the idea that science should be a tool at the service of the individual, and not the other way round."
"Even when these ethical principles are explicitly written down - I am referring here to Amendment No 11 of the Legal Affairs Committee which establishes the principle of excluding patentability of the human body, its parts and its products - the principle of excluding products of the human body, such as blood, tears, sweat, sperm, is not to be found in Article 3, Amendment No 49, which deals with the non-patentability of the human body."
"This lack of rigour on the part of jurists who are so insistent on the strict application of patent law, I find surprising."
"Another inconsistency is the affirmation, in Article 4, of the principle of excluding from patentability plant species and the animal species, when what is meant by the animal species is not even defined."
"I also find it regrettable that ethical principles are diluted in a heterogeneous whole."
"What is the point of including, in Article 9, a reference to the basic legal principles of high moral standards and public order, in drawing up an exhaustive list of the types of genetic manipulations that are to be strictly prohibited, and therefore non-patentable, and in including a reference to the quantification of pain in laboratory animals?"
"Does not legal rigour justify having a statute dealing specifically with the human body?"
"It is inept and misleading to try to present an ethical principle as being common to animals, plants and human beings."
"The Commission and the Legal Affairs Committee have not done that."
"They are therefore going to be condemned by our Group if our proposals continue to be ignored."
"Mr President, the subject tackled by the Rothley report is a difficult one which, as others have said on occasions, is of direct concern to every delegate in this Parliament and touches upon the deeply-held convictions of each one of us."
"I also cast my mind back to the questions that arose on that difficult day, 1 March 1995, when the time came for us to cast our votes."
"It strikes me that this is a subject on which it is not possible to have a Group vote, as I have heard suggested now and again."
"It is up to each one of us to search his or her own soul and conscience, and in what I have to say I shall be speaking for myself."
"To begin with, let me say that I have some sympathy with the argument that the European Union needs a directive in this area. It is true that we do have patent law at international level; this fact is mentioned in the draft that we have before us."
"There are also the various national laws: in France, for example, there is the Law of 29 July 1994."
"I must admit that I also have some sympathy with the argument that we do need to have treatments for a whole host of diseases."
"Serious diseases, often of genetic origin, affect millions of people."
"But I, like many of my colleagues, am wondering about our very real ethical concerns."
"Have they been taken sufficiently into account?"
"There is of course a need for a directive that will allow biotechnological inventions to be patented when - and only when - such inventions are of real use to society; a directive that offers a meaningful response to suffering."
"The human body is not patentable; only products created by Man can be patentable."
"The work of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights has been useful."
"Have we gone far enough?"
"I am wondering in particular about the patentability of animals."
"The results of the votes on the amendments will give us the answers to these and other questions."
"Even though, a priori , I am for the time being inclined to vote in favour, I shall wait to see the results of the voting before finally making up my mind."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is absolutely no good reason why the European Parliament should cut off its own nose."
"And that is the danger today."
"On 1 March 1995, after difficult and intensive negotiations, we rejected by a clear majority a directive on the patenting of biotechnological inventions."
"Today we are dealing with this matter again."
"The wording is new, the content old."
"I could take the easy option and suggest that we vote 'no' as we did last time."
"That would be wrong."
"Biotechnological inventions help people, not only in medicine but in other areas too."
"So these inventions must be protected, not for the sake of interested companies' bank balances but for the benefit of the women and men of our countries."
"The discovered parts of the human body must not be redefined as inventions, which would make them patentable."
"It is unacceptable that individual organizations should have a sole right of disposal over these."
"Genes and gene sequences must remain the common property of humanity and be freely accessible to researchers for the benefit of all people."
"That is the political decision before us."
"The existing law on patents has nothing to do with this."
"It is capital-centred and does not focus on people."
"Our duty as Members of the European Parliament is to serve 370 million children, women and men."
"This obligation underlies amendments 71 to 76."
"That is why we tabled them."
"Let me repeat that I am not against the patenting of biotechnological inventions."
"I am against any attempt to patent human parts, animals and plants, to declare such discoveries to be inventions, thereby making them patentable."
"Mr President, this is now the tenth year of discussion and consultation concerning the Directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions."
"Part of the reason for this interminable process is the fact that the legal categorization of this Directive as a singlemarket directive designed to harmonize patents law in Europe has repeatedly been lost from view."
"Time and again there have been attempts to limit or even to reduce the scope of patent rights by overloading the Directive with rules which have no basis in patent law."
"Three aspects of the Directive are under discussion: the legal, the economic and the ethical aspects."
"Harmonization of the Member States' legal provisions in this domain has become necessary as a means of countering the divergence between the development of legislation and that of jurisprudence in the Member States."
"The danger of further legal fragmentation must be confronted."
"We need legal consistency."
"In the economic domain, it is a matter of encouraging inventions and innovations, not of promoting imitation."
"The competitiveness of European industry must be fostered, and European researchers must be motivated to remain in Europe, to conduct research in Europe and not to emigrate overseas."
"To that extent the Directive is also a key instrument of European employment policy."
"How and to what extent ethical aspects are to be integrated into the Directive has always been the real powder keg of this Directive."
"This has been demonstrated again by a number of today's speeches."
"Patent law governs the legal relationship between the inventor and third parties."
"It does not govern the actual right of utilization."
"Although patent law lays down that inventions cannot be patented if their publication or exploitation would be contrary to public policy, the fact remains that both research and the use of research findings are governed by other laws, such as the Genetic Engineering Act or the Embryo Protection Act."
"Public policy, or ordre public , is defined by the central provisions of the various national constitutions and the statutes derived from them."
"In other words, patent offices are not responsible for controlling technological development."
"In the form in which it was adopted by the Legal Affairs Committee, the Directive merits our full support."
"The vital thing now is that those who are aware of the importance, and hence also of the limitations, of patent law should prevail and that this Directive can soon be adopted."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when in March 1995 we voted on the first directive on the patentability of biotechnologies, I voted in favour."
"Today, there are at least two reason why I am pleased that that directive has been revived: firstly, because I am convinced that the present directive is better, because the definitions it contains are more precise, as has been stressed by others who have spoken before me."
"These innovations have made it possible to extend the public debate and actually to compare the imaginary with the possible and perceptions with knowledge."
"We may wonder whether during this 18 month delay, research into biotechnology and the biotechnology industry in Europe have suffered a competitive setback compared with their American and Japanese counterparts and whether capital and jobs have been lost."
"I fear the industry will confirm that this has indeed happened."
"The importance of this issue and the new area of life we are penetrating, public suspicion of the progress of science and technology, which is sometimes confused with certain doubtful exploits in the area of human procreation, mean that we have to exercise great caution and be considerate of sensitivities."
"It therefore seems to me to be very important that, moving beyond the directive we are approving, all of those involved in this frontier sector should undertake to enhance the information available in such a way as make it easier to understand and dispel the fear that comes with ignorance."
"I have great confidence in the ethics committee that has been set up and in the debate that we in the Committee on Research and Technology shall be pursuing further in the context of the Fifth Framework Programme."
"Mr President, the European institutions have been discussing the subject of patent protection for biotechnological inventions for over ten years now, and since I have had the honour of being the chairman of the Legal Affairs Committee, we have had no less than 15 meetings on the new Commission proposal between January and June this year, resulting in 250 amendments and 47 compromise amendments."
"So you can see that the institutions in general and Parliament in particular have been treading extremely carefully in dealing with this delicate subject, on which it goes without saying that all views should be heard."
"Have we now reached the limits of what is humanly possible in biotechnological research?"
"Some people would say yes, while scientists think that we have only just begun, so it is up to us as politicians to provide a clear and correct legal framework."
"Looking objectively at the text which is now before us, I think it tries to strike a fair balance between those who wish to go further and those who oppose any research whatsoever, between the technical and the ethical."
"I would call on everyone here to have the courage to face up to this new challenge, and to ensure that we introduce appropriate, clear and fair legislation to control our own inventiveness and our constant urge to push back the limits of our ability."
"Mr President, as everyone here is aware, biotechnology has developed rapidly in many areas."
"The economic and commercial interests involved are enormous and serve to stimulate financial appetites."
"It is undeniably true that in this area Europe has definitely failed to keep up with international competition."
"One of the ways of meeting this scientific, industrial and commercial challenge is to make up the lost ground and to harmonize national legislations."
"This would make it possible to open up research activities and to put an end to market segmentation."
"At the conclusion of the codecision procedure, this directive was rejected by the European Parliament in March 1995 because the ethical dimension had not been taken sufficient account of."
"Since then, the Commission has submitted a new draft directive on the protection of biotechnological inventions by patents, at the same time setting out the conditions and the exceptions to patentability."
"It is true that some of Parliament's proposals have been taken on board, but once again the ethical requirements that the patenting of human tissue makes indispensable have not been adequately taken into account."
"I would draw attention to the fact that my country prohibits the patenting not only of the human body, its parts and its products, but also of the knowledge of the total or partial structure of the human gene."
"These ethical principles should, in my view, be embodied in the draft directive."
"This is vital if serious violations are to be prevented and human dignity is to be safeguarded."
"The argument advanced here is that such restrictions would hinder research."
"I really cannot go along with that, as researchers would be the first to alert us."
"I therefore believe that the directive as it stands would leave the door open to every possible abuse and is still geared to satisfy strictly commercial interests."
"Mr President, genetic resources, patents and their economic control are the key questions of the coming millennium."
"With unlimited patentability, life itself and all living plants and animals would become an industrial product."
"Even human life would be exploited by this directive."
"The genetic resources of our planet must not be monopolized in the private hands of a few companies."
"At the moment the European Patent Convention draws a clear line between inventions and living material."
"First of all, discoveries such as genes are not patentable; plant and animal varieties and procedures for the breeding of plants and animals are excluded from patents."
"To photocopy the genes and then declare that an invention is a travesty of science."
"The pressure that industry has exerted on politicians in order to ensure that the patent system includes living material is intense."
"The way this directive is being pushed through is contrary to acceptable political decision-making."
"This requires open discussion and informed decision by those given a mandate by their citizens."
"If the Commission has sought to prohibit Commission employees from freely disseminating information to the public, this would be an attack going to the heart of our European democracy, and I want an answer from the Commissioner on this point."
"Commissioner Cresson gave this House an assurance on the banning of human cloning, but the directive does not ban patents on the product of human cloning."
"That a proto-human being could be cannibalized for spare parts cannot be contemplated."
"Patients suffering from inherited diseases have been told that patenting is necessary for the development of therapies."
"The reverse is true: the patenting of human genes will create problems for the development of therapies."
"Free and immediate access to information, i.e. in the human genome project, is the prerequisite for the beneficial use of this information."
"Patents on the gene would mean that a single biomedical company could completely control all future research and medical development leading from the isolation of a specific gene."
"This would not foster research but kill it."
"It would also make the possibility of genetic testing for a disorder such as breast cancer so prohibitively expensive that it would be beyond the scope of the public health services."
"While new techniques will soon allow rapid and inexpensive analysis of genes, if a patent has to be paid on each gene analysed, testing for breast cancer predisposition could become prohibitively expensive."
"One of the key issues is the question of whether doctors and medical personnel will be free to diagnose and treat people without a royalty payment to the patent-holder."
"Current law prohibits patents on methods for the treatment of the human body by surgery or therapy and diagnostic methods practised on the human body."
"This is removed by the draft directive."
"I urge colleagues to vote for Amendment No 91 by the Green Group which proposes such a doctor's exemption."
"An example of the problems raised is the case of the breast cancer gene already referred to."
"The US patent-holders, Myriad, have applied for a Euro-patent and are seeking to charge over 2, 000 dollars for its use in screening."
"If the directive is passed, there are serious implications for our access to food and medicine."
"Our gene cells and body parts and our resistance to hereditary disorders would become the monopoly property of the companies that hold the patents on them."
"This would legitimize trade in such items as blood plasma and transplant organs which are now prohibited from sale in many Member States and are the subject of a complex donor network organized by the national health departments for the public good."
"For example, the granting of a patent on umbilical-cord blood could deny access to these blood cells to anyone unable to pay for them."
"Colleagues, the Clinton administration in the US has sought to move US health care towards a European model."
"If we now move our European health service towards an American model, leaving aside the public good, the citizens of these Member States will not forgive us."
"Mr President, colleagues, a debate that presents itself in a purely legal guise may conceal more important questions, and we are seeing today, first of all, just how much is at stake economically, as Mr Monfils recalled a short time ago, and as the barrage of lobbying to which we have all been subjected rather crudely reveals."
"We are also seeing what can only be described as an ideological clash between humanism and liberalism, and on top of that we have some interesting cross-currents muddying the more usual political divisions which have been revealed for example by the speech of our colleague Mr Casini, or the thoughtful speech of Mr FabreAubrespy."
"So, is what we are debating here today really a legal problem?"
"If it is, then we have our various national legislations, we have a European convention, some intimations from the European Observatory, and we have a worldwide agreement reached within the framework of the World Trade Organization."
"Well, I do not believe that this is a purely legal problem but rather - and we need to be on our guard here - it is an extension of the scope of patentability to include living tissue."
"If it is technical or economic problem, the draft directive and the report are based on a prior assumption: it is patents that open the way to technological progress."
"Is that actually true?"
"For my part I believe quite the opposite, that patents, as Mr TelkÃ¤mper said a moment ago, often simply allow the weak to be robbed by the strong."
"One could be cynical and choose, for economic reasons, to side with the strong, but that would not be my personal choice in this matter."
"An another thing: who says that the system of patents necessarily helps progress?"
"I know of a thousand examples which show that patents, because of the possibility of their being bought out, can actually stifle scientific and technical progress."
"I myself believe that we do most certainly have an ethical problem."
"Everyone in their own way, the Commission and the rapporteur, are saying to us: ' listen, let us not talk about morality, let us not talk about ethics, let us not talk about humanism, that is not where the question lies; it is all to do with law, with trade, with business' ."
"Personally I do not go along with that at all and I do not believe that one can accuse of obscurantism people like Mr Monfils and other speakers who feel a kind of medieval terror in the face of technological progress."
"I have listened to the remarks by Mrs Roth, Mrs Ainardi and Mr Scarbonchi: many of us believe that this text should have had a moral and ethical preamble explaining the technical choices we would have to make in retrospect."
"We know that man has acquired the means of total self-destruction and the means of infinite self-replication."
"This progress cannot therefore be limited to its technical and commercial aspects."
"It was not I who said: ' Science without conscience ruins the soul' ."
"Now it is true that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights has improved this text."
"We have been listening attentively to this morning's debate and we shall hear what the Commission has to say in response, any overtures they might make, and we shall see what happens to the tabled amendments before we come to any final decision, but as the directive stands at present our Group is not in favour of its adoption."
"Mr President, the debate on this directive has focused over the last year on technical legal aspects, rather than ethical considerations."
"I have nothing against this as such, since the legal content of the text has been much improved."
"However, I do still have considerable misgivings."
"The Commission and the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, have both chosen to give a broad interpretation to the TRIPS Agreement, to the effect that human genes, once identified and isolated, can be patented."
"They claim that this interpretation is the only proper technical solution, and that all other suggestions are based not on technical considerations, but on sentiment."
"I have two reactions to this."
"The first is ethical, based not on cheap sentiment, but on the conviction that man is God's unique creation and thus cannot, either in whole or in part, be called a human invention."
"Isolating a gene is, in itself, a technical tour de force , but calling genetic material taken from the body an invention is somewhat presumptuous."
"Furthermore, such a patent would inevitably have a very broad scope when it comes to new applications using the gene in question."
"Secondly, I think that adopting a technical legal approach to a problem does not imply that there can only be one correct solution, as Mr Rothley claims."
"There still remains a freedom of choice which politicians have to exercise responsibly."
"In my opinion, the Commission document and the Rothley report both do their best to twist the terms invention, innovation and technical application so that the human gene can be made to fit into the strait-jacket of patent law."
"The interpretation given in the Gebhardt amendment seems much more natural to me."
"I therefore feel that there is a much more valid case for patenting products or production methods based on the discovery of a gene."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the thrust of the Rothley report on the proposal for a directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions has, in my view, been brought well into focus by those who have spoken, including Mr Casini."
"The passage of the report in its final form has been a difficult one, but it seems to me that we have achieved our goal with the confirmation that: life has to be protected, the embryo must not be exploited for financial gain and the industry has to be protected from US and Japanese competition."
"I shall not discuss the merits of the amendments which we shall be debating tomorrow at the vote."
"We in the Alleanza Nazionale shall be voting in favour of the report as a whole and those amendments that are designed to protect life, the embryo and morality - and on this occasion morality and politics will have to work together - but not those which will have the effect, from a legal and biological point of view, of distorting the physiological in the strict sense of the word."
"I should like now to say a few words about patents."
"I agree with the Committee on Development and Cooperation that patentability of living entities has a negative impact, at both an ethical and a practical level, for the human race, the animal kingdom and the environment."
"To conclude, therefore, we need to avoid patents on the following: the human body, parts of the human body, human tissue and all genetic material derived from human sources; animals, parts of animals, animal tissue, genetic modification processes, plants, seeds, vegetable tissue and other reproductive material."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have to safeguard life, protect morality and avoid distorting what the Eternal Father has given us."
"Only in that way will we be able to meet the challenge of the times while at the same time making progress in research."
"Est modus in rebus , as Horace put it!"
"Mr President, I do not feel that the importance of these discussions has to be emphasized any further."
"It suffices to take note of the amount of information - sometimes disinformation - which we Members have received concerning this directive."
"In principle I would like to point out that we should resist all attempts to manipulate this directive - ' manipulation' means saying things that the directive does not say or asserting things which are allegedly necessary and which are already contained in the directive."
"I have been listening to much talk of morals and rights, morals and politics, and I totally support these views, but this has nothing to do with the directive."
"The directive itself upholds moral principles, confirms the need to observe good practices and to maintain public order and a number of assertions are made concerning matters which are intolerable."
"Moreover, the directive is being asked to give more than it is able to."
"In Spain, there is a song which goes 'I went to sea for oranges, something the sea does not have' , quite obviously, and here, too, we are sometimes asking for the impossible."
"What we are dealing with here is a law on patents."
"There are other ethical standards."
"The Commission has a Working Group on ethics, and at these very Council of Europe headquarters, approval has been given to a convention on the protection of human rights vis-Ã -vis manipulation of a medical nature. All this already exists and already forms part of the background against which this directive is being formulated."
"Nor do we have to succumb to slogans."
"I believe that the previous directive collapsed mainly because of the existence of a slogan which ran 'No patents on life' . Fortunately, in these discussions, there has been a different slogan - ' Patents to promote life' ."
"There are also those who desire patents in order that life should continue."
"In conclusion, I feel that I must recommend that everyone should read the directive before voting."
"On a closing note, I would like to congratulate Mr Rothley because not only has he largely captured the feeling behind the amendments but has altered practically the entire directive, has made it more systematic from the outset, and it is my belief that the majority of those of us who are members of the Committee on Legal Affairs feels that we are properly represented by the work he has done."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to begin by thanking the rapporteur."
"The draft directive before us is undoubtedly of huge economic importance to Europe."
"Nine million jobs depend directly or indirectly on the type of basic conditions we create for biotechnology."
"Patent law, however, is but one of these conditions, and I believe that many other things are also important; for example, we also have to remove all bureaucratic obstructions."
"As a doctor, I most strongly warn against making patients into pawns in this primarily economic debate."
"That applies to both sides, so the applause was perhaps premature."
"If some here are suggesting that the adoption of the directive cannot fail to bring about enormous advances in the treatment of genetic diseases, the least I can say is that there are divergent views among medical scientists."
"Those who see potential problems in the absolute protection of DNA material also have sound arguments on their side."
"Let me say this quite clearly to both sides: we do not know!"
"Politicians always want straightforward answers, but science cannot provide straightforward answers to this question at the present time."
"And I must also reiterate that the development of diagnostic resources, better diagnosis, will not necessarily benefit patients if treatments are still twenty or thirty years away."
"To put it simply, caution and prudence are of the essence here."
"It is of decisive importance to our group that certain ethical boundaries are drawn in this directive."
"One of these concerns intervention in the human germ line, while others relate to the patenting of methods that involve the use of human embryos and to animal welfare."
"And it is also especially crucial that the cloning of human embryos is totally banned."
"Cloning violates human dignity."
"All of the political forces in this House agreed with that view when the appearance of Dolly the sheep brought human cloning into the realms of possibility."
"The time has come for us to stop talking and to start taking action."
"In this directive we must therefore unequivocally prohibit the cloning of human embryos."
"It is not enough only to exclude implantation in the womb, in other words reproductive cloning, which is what the Commission's group of advisers would like."
"Firstly, even experimentation with embryos is despicable and offends against public policy and morality."
"But secondly, and I would ask you to listen carefully just before I finish, what exactly is a new invention?"
"Implantation in the womb is already known."
"Birth, fortunately, is still a natural process."
"So surely nobody can seek to patent these things."
"The only step on the way to a cloned human being on which we have any power left to impose limits is the cloning of embryos."
"And the road to Dolly was paved with numerous sheep embryos."
"We do not want a host of human embryos to pave the way to a cloned human being."
"That is why I ask you to support Amendment 55 and especially the last two subparagraphs."
"Mr President, we had a great battle with Mr Langer in 1995 to defeat this directive."
"At the time, Mr Langer was staunch in his defence of plants and animals while I was for the embryo and therefore human beings."
"Combining those two elements, human beings and plants and animals caused a great deal of confusion in people's minds and caused much time to be lost."
"Had they been kept separate, we should long since have entered into competition with the United States and Japan, and we need that for development in Europe and to create jobs."
"The Rothley report is today being submitted to us once again."
"I think that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights has done a great job."
"I personally approve of what they have done."
"I call for Article 9 in particular to be kept as it is and invite the House to adopt it as it stands, without changing anything."
"Mr President, not surprisingly this debate has generated huge public interest and I think that it poses a challenge to this Parliament as a legislature to face maturely our responsibilities."
"The Rothley report, in my opinion, as the product of a prolonged debate, is an effective, balanced and reasonable proposal and I congratulate the rapporteur."
"Mrs Roth, speaking earlier for the Greens, spoke of her belief in the need for morality in politics."
"I share that belief strongly which is why on this occasion I feel at ease in supporting this report and do so in good conscience."
"A clear distinction is drawn between discovery and invention."
"Patents on human bodies, on human cloning, on embryos and on altering the human germ line are all banned in the draft from the Legal Affairs Committee."
"Farmers' privilege is explicitly protected for reseeding and breeding animals on their own land, as is the case today."
"Emphasis is placed by Parliament on the need to respect the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity and to protect against fears of bio-piracy in respect of the underdeveloped world and the environment, and these two are important obligations which cannot be set aside."
"Again today my mailbox is full of letters, not least from groups in my own country representing those who suffer from genetic and other medical disorders currently without a cure, requesting support for this measure because it offers them some hope."
"In conscience I will not vote against offering that hope."
"We have also suggested an ethics committee. For all of these reasons I believe that this is effective but also balanced, and this time round, unlike before, I am happy to give it my support."
"Mr President, may I begin by thanking Sierra Gonzalez for her contribution, which I fully support. I also think that current legislation must be made to satisfy society's new demands, particularly with regard to the ethical and social impact."
"There ought to be, as indeed there are, big differences between technological industrial inventions and those issues under discussion here today."
"Here, the patent holder is being given even greater licence to exercise power and control as a result of the monopoly position in which he may find himself, and I see this as a potential obstacle to development, particularly of small and medium sized companies."
"I think that the discovery of the function of a gene, for example, should be just that, a fantastic discovery which should be available for the service of the global community and not primarily for the interests of private, economic profit."
"I very much regret that politically we have not progressed towards real, practical proposals which promote global co-operation instead of commercial competition, especially as there is such a serious issue at stake here, the health and biological diversity of mankind, not just in the European Union but in the whole world."
"Mr President, Commissioner Monti, the European Parliament would forfeit its credibility if it adopted the Rothley report, which is totally unacceptable in terms of ethics and morality."
"Parliament will be a laughing-stock if it adopts a report to which it was still opposed on 1 March 1995, on the basis that the Commission keeps making it vote until it comes up with the desired result, until Parliament has bowed before the genetic engineering industry."
"The new proposal still provides for the patenting of living organisms."
"Even human genes can be patented; the only proviso is that they must be isolated from the human body."
"If Parliament adopts this report, it will have set its seal on one of the greatest and most scandalous property redistributions in history."
"Life would become a commodity, a product."
"As Klondyke fever sets in, humankind will be reduced to a source of raw materials which can be exploited at will."
"That will violate human dignity."
"The human race will be degraded to mere biological material and the human body to a marketable commodity."
"If Parliament approves this report, the ethical floodgates will come under intense pressure."
"Human dignity and selfdetermination will be bartered away in the marketplace."
"For the first time since the abolition of slavery, it will be possible to claim property rights over human beings."
"Is our life an invention?"
"Life is not an invention of genetic engineers."
"Not even the cloning of body cells, as was done in the case of Dolly the sheep, or the patenting of biological weapons are excluded in the Legal Committee's report."
"For the first time, treatments and diagnoses of patients will become patentable."
"That will restrict treatment options in a life-threatening manner."
"The patenting of living matter will lead to an huge upsurge in the commercialization of medicine."
"Doctors will no longer be free to choose the most effective treatment."
"A two-tier system of health care will be firmly established."
"The directive does not set out a fundamental position on genetic engineering."
"The patenting of a medicinal drug produced by means of genetic engineering will be entirely unimpeachable, despite the fact that the gene in question, which has existed for centuries, could never be called an invention."
"The patenting of genetic material will stifle applied research and impede innovation."
"That emerges clearly from the patenting of umbilical-cord blood cells, which has erected a barrier to applied leukaemia research."
"Patents will establish a monopoly on all uses of genes, including potential future uses."
"We are using this directive to privatize nature."
"I therefore appeal to you to reject the report as it now stands and to adopt the amendments tabled by the Green Group."
"That is the only way to ensure that the moral floodgates are not forced open here in the European Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after eight years of indecision it does seem high time now to change the European legislation on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions."
"The text put forward by the Commission this time does largely take account of the vitally important ethical standards of natural law on the matter, in particular excluding the human body from that which can be patented."
"Even though in this area we should have liked the text to have been a little more precise and, to that extent we would have been in favour of adding to the text as it presently stands Mrs Sandbaek's Amendment No 84, which would impose a total ban on all manipulations involving not just the human body, but embryos as well."
"We do of course need to take into account those patients who are hoping for advances that would enable them to be treated more effectively thanks to these new technologies."
"Lastly, it is worth reminding ourselves of what the purpose of patents is: it is to reward inventors for their creative activities by giving them the exclusive right to do as they wish with their invention for a period of twenty years."
"They are an encouragement to innovation, investment and job creation."
"Well, we know that our legislation as it stands today leaves us powerless in the face of American and Japanese competition."
"According to the rapporteur himself, as he says in his explanatory memorandum, only 24 % of patents accepted by the European Patent Office are of European origin."
"Well, it is my belief that behind the outpourings of moral indignation that we have heard and which, in some cases, I am sure are genuine, I think that quite often there are powerful transatlantic economic interests are behind these attitudes."
"And it would not be for the first time either."
"For these reasons, therefore, I shall be voting for the text, which represents a good compromise between the various constraints under which our legislators have to work, but I would once again stress the need for Mrs Sandbaek's Amendment No 84 to be added to the rapporteur's text."
"Madam President, in recent weeks Members of this Parliament have been subjected to a barrage of misinformation on this subject, which has been orchestrated by the Green movement."
"On BBC Prime Time, at 7 a.m. this morning, the item on this debate was largely inaccurate in relation to the content of the draft directive."
"The key phrase of the Green propaganda machine has been: ' no patents on life' ."
"As Mr Verde i Aldea mentioned a few moments ago, it was the same two years ago."
"One of the very sad things about the current discussion is that the campaign against the directive has ignored fact and ignored the very substantial changes that have been negotiated to allay legitimate concerns and fears that genetic research will involve the reproductive system."
"It is a great pity that the changes that have taken place have not been recognized by the opponents of the directive."
"We have to recognize - it is a very unpalatable thought - that most of the medicine we take does not actually effect a cure: it only relieves the symptoms."
"Vaccination and antibiotics have dealt with many of the life-threatening illnesses of the past."
"As we live longer we are subjected to a different type of disease: cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's."
"These are all diseases which have a genetic element in them and the developments in biotechnology and genetic engineering bring some hope that there might be a cure."
"I am supporting the directive not just on medical grounds but also because biotechnology brings a cleaner world; , it brings a world which is more energy-efficient; and, I believe, it offers us the hope not only of a longer life but of a healthier life in the future."
"The opponents of the directive should ponder what they are trying to prevent."
"Madam President, if we were able to distil the maximum benefit from the DNA technologies and at the same time control the associated dangers, we would have found the best way to support investment in that sector."
"Today, an important tool for the encouragement of biotechnological investment is the patents system, which by rewarding inventors for the time, money and experience they devote, acts as an incentive for investments of that kind."
"In practice, however, legal protection is complicated by social, ethical, scientific and legal factors."
"Since this Parliament's failure to establish an appropriate legislative framework two and a half years ago, the legal protection of biotechnological applications remains an exceptionally sensitive, public and open issue."
"In part, this reflects the fact that by definition biotechnology includes the application of technology to living organisms, including man."
"As is natural, patents related to matters involving life itself generate strong feelings."
"The purpose of today's debate is to clarify some of the doubtful aspects so that legislation can go ahead."
"In the case of DNA technology the debate creates conflicts because it is difficult to define when and which of the elements of a specific technological application constitute inventions and which discoveries - given that patents should in my opinion only be granted for inventions and innovations and not for discoveries - and ones which must also result in a biotechnological application."
"In the case of DNA technology, precisely because the gene or the cell or the human body and its respective parts pre-exist when they are discovered, there is no 'invention' and there can consequently be no protection by patent."
"However, if inventors succeed in perfecting a method for isolating a gene which can be used ex vivo to produce the human protein which it codifies, then that method can be patented."
"It is precisely in this respect that we ask the Commission and the rapporteur to clarify Article 3(2), which does not make it clear whether patents can be granted for genes, which in my opinion are the subject of discovery and not invention."
"Here, it should be stressed that regardless of what can be done with a gene, its structure and the information it contains existed already before its use and consequently the gene, as such, cannot constitute an invention."
"In contrast, its use, which could lead via new techniques to the production of a new substance with biomechanical applications, certainly is an object for legal protection."
"Even a possible modification of the gene, leading to a new structure, is eligible for protection by patent provided that it is associated with a specific biological application."
"We therefore express our serious reservations because, with the present version of the text, patents will also be sought for natural genes that already exist and whose description, I repeat, constitutes a discovery."
"If we accept that patents should be granted for natural genes, this would result in what I would call an oligopolistic exploitation both of the genes themselves and the proteins that they codify."
"Overall, and subject to the reservations expressed by what I have said, which I hope will be taken into account because there are amendments related to it, I am in favour of the motion for a directive, because the legal protection conferred by this directive will contribute to protection for biotechnology, which will encourage its continual expansion into areas with an important impact on health and disease, nutrition, environmental protection, agriculture and other important areas of human life and activity."
"Madam President, it is not my wish today to go back over the technical aspects of patentability, but rather to focus on those aspects that have to do with the patentability of living beings."
"Thanks to the excellent work of the rapporteur and the European Parliament, the new directive now takes account of ethical and social aspects in being based on a coherent approach."
"There is a difference between discovery and invention: a gene is not life - one has to make a distinction between the whole and its parts."
"Genetic engineering is not about the manipulation of embryos: it is important to distinguish between the cellular machinery and the passing on of hereditary traits."
"The compromise amendments ensure respect for the living being from its conception until its ultimate death, the non-commercialization of the human body and of its parts, the banning of any manipulations involving embryos or germ-line cells, the outlawing of cloning for purposes of reproducing the human species."
"For my part, it seems to me ethical to ensure recognition of the added value associated with the intelligence and creativity of human beings, without which there can be no lasting progress."
"The new directive is not only based on the harmonization of patent law, but also takes account of the characteristics that are peculiar to human beings and to the living world; it protects inventors, it safeguards preferential treatment for farmers, allows the development of products resulting from biotechnology to satisfy the need of sick people and their families for treatments for leukaemia and cancer thanks to cell growth factors, treatments for haemophilia, for diabetes, thanks to purified, non-contaminating products - I stress the fact that they are non-contaminating - all of these more effective than the products used at present."
"It makes it possible to treat not only those major genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis and myopathy, but also certain rare diseases, the so-called orphan diseases."
"Finally, let us not forget that a patent is not an exploitation licence."
"Let us not confuse the protection of inventions with the marketing of products derived from biotechnologies, which really owe more to subsidiarity."
"In the preparation of such a directive our Parliament has exercised its responsibility of democratic control with a view to securing recognition for research and researchers and for the economic competitiveness of the European Union in the respect for life, respect for human beings and respect for the rights of the individual."
"Madam President, all that can be said on this issue has really already been said."
"Unfortunately, it has become something of a dialogue of the deaf and there are also a number of inaccuracies involved, which Mr Adam also pointed out earlier."
"The deciding factor for me, when my group and I adopted our position on this, was something which Mr Pompidou has already mentioned, and that is the fact that it is patent legislation which is under consideration. Everything which can be patented does not automatically gain a licence for use, at national level for example."
"All too frequently during the debate we have forgotten that we are in Europe."
"We have a European patent tradition which has meant that traditionally we have set strict standards for patents and required a high level of detail in all applications."
"We have a European Convention to protect human dignity in the application of medicine and biology; this also applies to patents."
"I hope that biotechnological research will help us to make progress in all those medical challenges which the experts have spoken about here in this Assembly."
"The real inequality affects those who would survive only if they were able to afford 200 000 marks for a drug, but do not have the means to do so."
"Ladies and gentlemen, looking at the other side of the coin, we should also be sufficiently humble to say that this is a new form of patent and that, today, we do not know what the consequences of research in this area will be."
"So, if the unacceptable occurs, we must be prepared to review the legislation."
"This is why it is important that the Commission and the ethical committee report back to this Parliament."
"Madam President, speaker after speaker has brilliantly succeeded in showing us what is unacceptable in the report by Mr Rothley."
"For my part I shall concentrate my attention on just one aspect of this report."
"Artcle 52(4) of the European Convention on patents, which serves as the basis for all national legislations, excludes methods of treating human or animal bodies involving surgery or therapy, as well as diagnostic methods."
"This provision does not figure either in the Commission's draft directive or in the report by Mr Rothley and the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, although it had been included in the previous draft."
"Two amendments tabled by the Greens seek to reintroduce this provision."
"Why?"
"Because we for our part believe that there are dangers in patenting such methods - dangers to the rights of patients, dangers to medical progress and dangers to advances in knowledge in general."
"Let me give an example to illustrate this: the American company 'Biocyte' has been granted a patent in respect of the blood cells from the umbilical cord."
"This patent covers not only the cells in question, but also any therapeutic use to which they may be put."
"Numerous clinicians and researchers working in the field of bone marrow transplants are against, both on the ethical grounds that I just mentioned, and also because they say that what we are talking about here is not an invention so much as a technical development - simply isolate the cells and freeze them - which really adds nothing new to the sum total of human knowledge."
"I believe that the current debate about this patent, which is being challenged by numerous researchers and doctors, risks tipping the balance in favour of 'Biocyte' ."
"The Rothley report undoubtedly gives pre-eminence to the economic and technical aspects of the debate. It confuses the interests of sick people suffering from genetic diseases with those of the pharmaceutical industry which holds them hostage."
"To that extent we find the report quite unacceptable."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in view of the present importance of this draft directive, as well as its far greater future importance, I do not intend to deal with the opportunities it offers."
"These have in any case been sufficiently discussed already."
"My purpose is rather to draw attention to the dangers that might lie ahead if we approve this draft, dangers which we should bear in mind when we come to cast our vote."
"What I mean is that the prospect of short-term gains should not induce us to put our future in hock to this extent."
"On the contrary, the reservations expressed by numerous experts should be taken seriously and examined carefully."
"Let me give you an example to illustrate the importance of our decisions. The draft before us lays down that the human genome and the gene sequences it contains are to be patentable."
"That must be firmly rejected, for the human genome in any form is common property to which anyone should have unhindered access."
"Reserving that right for individuals would enable them to monopolize knowledge of the uses and applications of the genome."
"Another argument against the patentability of human DNA sequences is that it would prevent the use of specific sequence variations by anyone other than the patent-holder and would thereby hinder research."
"For these reasons we shall reject the directive, and we know that our position has the support of the 1.2 million fellow Austrians who signed the national petition on this subject."
"Madam President, in the short contribution I am about to make I do not want to enter into the details of many of the passages of this very important directive, nor into the technical and scientific details which this is not the place to describe or explain."
"We in the Italian delegation of the Socialist Group consider that the result achieved by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, particularly through the efforts of the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, is balanced overall and the product of careful and keen study."
"We consider that it should be supported, even though there may, clearly, be amendments designed to improve or clarify it."
"We should remember that we are basically deal here with a very precise element, namely patent law and the fact that this directive makes a clear distinction between discovery and invention."
"A discovery is not and cannot be the subject-matter of a patent."
"Only an invention can be patented: the product then of an intellectual process of research which needs this guarantee if it is to provide a fundamental point of reference for industrial development also."
"We think that the ethics committee that is to be set up has an important role to perform, even though it should not have direct legal function."
"This is not an ideological or teleological debate on life but a lay instrument designed to guarantee, regulate and harmonize a European area for biotechnology - an area that is now more than ever necessary if we think about what is happening at an international level."
"If Europe follows the example of the American system and we work together, by 2005 - according to expert forecasts - biotechnology will really take off and become competitive, providing work for between 1.5 and 3 million people in Europe, while at the same time guaranteeing the right to health and the development of research and industry."
"If this is not done, if the industry, politics, research and the mass media do not work together, then Europe's budding biotechnology industry will never flourish, and, as has already happened with information technology, Europe will become a biotechnological dependency."
"Madam President, any speech made at this stage of the debate enables one to state, quite simply, ' I reject this' and 'I support this' ."
"Well, then, I reject the empty rhetoric we have had to listen to today in this House, I reject the value judgements and totally gratuitous attempts which have been made simply to bring discredit - I would almost describe this as personal discredit - and I support the significant contributions we have also heard."
"The first of the latter came from you, Mr Rothley. You have both my recognition and my admiration."
"I also support the important statements we have heard from my illustrious and admired colleague, Mr Casini, and Mr Cot's clear observations, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy's sharp commentary and the well-informed contribution from Mr Pompidou."
"I could, quite simply, end here, yet I will go one step further."
"I will be voting for the Rothley report and I will be voting in favour despite the fact that, in my opinion, it contains a number of significant technical shortcomings, such as amendments 42 and 43 to recitals 39 and 40, which are incorrect as I see it, or amendment 45 to paragraph 2 of Article 1. I shall also be voting in favour, irrespective of the result, of subparagraph 2d) of Article 9, i.e. the issue of the use or the patentability of inventions in which embryos are used."
"Why am I doing this?"
"I am doing so because the darkest, deepest and most atavistic convictions come together in this Aleph which is current biotechnological research, an industry which, in 2000, will have a turnover estimated at ecu 83, 000 million."
"In addition, this situation affects every single one of us, but still Europe looks to the past. The law, once again, is not only three paces behind social reality - as the German classicist used to say - but way behind social reality."
"Because, let's not forget - by way of illustration - between 1981 and 1995, 1175 DNA patents were granted worldwide."
"We are not legislating for the future, we have to keep in step with a reality which is pressing in on us from all sides, a reality we have to guide towards legal standards."
"I shall also be voting in favour because of the economic reasons which have been set forth, but, above all, Madam President, I shall be voting in favour for a fundamental reason which, in my opinion, constitutes the very basis of the discussions we are currently involved in."
"This directive is not, in effect, a draft measure to regulate biotechnology - its objective is much more restricted and, as stated, an attempt is being made to protect biotechnological inventions, nothing more, nothing less."
"This directive does not aspire, nor can it, to be the law on biotechnology: it only wishes to be - and only should be - a law on patents and, naturally, this obliges us to remember, Mr Casini - I will be at your side in this struggle - that we do not have a general, systematic legal framework of substantive law in which to frame the directive and that the palliatives it offers are few and insufficient."
"In spite of all this - I shall soon be finished - I shall be voting in favour of this directive, in the conviction that it is a step that has to be taken and that we still have a great deal of time left in which to improve it."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there are two industrial sectors that will be providing a great many jobs throughout the world over the next few years: information technology and biotechnology."
"In both fields, the European Parliament has the power to determine where those jobs will be created, in Europe or elsewhere in the world."
"So far, Parliament has failed to recognize the growth in the biotechnology industry by providing it with the proper patent legislation it needs for economic support, and after nine years we have still not achieved harmonization at European level."
"This House suffers from a peculiar syndrome known as the patent-for-life syndrome."
"More than 95 % of all Europe's biotechnology firms are SMEs, the very sector where Europe's potential for innovation and job-creation lies."
"However, their innovation is being stymied by the fact that protection for biotechnological inventions is fragmented and, in comparison with the United States and Japan, very expensive."
"It costs on average ECU 19 000 to submit to the European Patent Office a patent application covering eight countries, a market volume similar to that of the United States."
"In the United States, it costs ECU 1500."
"Europe is at the forefront scientifically, but we do not capitalize on our knowledge, and this is costing us jobs."
"Biotechnology has many very promising applications, such as in the prevention and cure of hereditary diseases in particular."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we do not have the right to choose whether other people should go through life healthy or handicapped."
"That is why my group intends to vote for this excellent report by Mr Rothley and the patents directive."
"Madam President, one of the principles of the Christian faith is that all living beings should be regarded as God's creatures."
"If that is to be more than just a pious saying, it must mean that the physical, genetic and creative integrity of our fellow creatures is a legal right that has to be protected, and protected in every area of the law, including patent law, Mr Rothley."
"The directive in front of us only does that to a limited and unsatisfactory extent, and at certain points it even abolishes such protection, as in Amendment 74."
"It does that because, as the rapporteur himself says on page 32 of his report, the directive concurs with those who demand the industrial exploitation of life."
"That is what we reject!"
"Not freedom of research, not the development of therapies, not the progress of the biotechnological industry, but the fact that the whole thing is being subordinated to very specific economic interests, as has just been very clearly reemphasized."
"Whoever does that must not be surprised if he has to rescind the new cloning ban within a short time for the very same reasons that have been advanced in support of the directive."
"Life does not exist so that it can be industrially exploited; on the contrary, industrial exploitation exists to support life."
"That is why the law is there and for no other reason!"
"Madam President, sometimes in politics, as in life in general, you have to hold your hands up and say: I got it wrong."
"I have to say that the European Parliament got it wrong in 1995 when we rejected the original biotechnology directive and I got it wrong by voting along with the majority in Parliament at that time."
"The test, though, is not whether, from time to time you get things wrong but whether or not you learn from your mistakes."
"I am pleased to say that the European Parliament has learned from its mistake and that Mr Rothley has expertly guided this new proposal through the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights."
"I join with the many other Members who have paid tribute to his work over the last year or so."
"We now have a proposal which, on the one hand, balances the genuine need to protect inventions and the scientists and researchers who work towards creating those inventions and, yes, the companies who put resources into financing the research."
"They deserve a return on their investments."
"The present proposal is also fair to the patients groups."
"The most effective of the hundreds if not thousands of letters I have received on this subject have come from the patients groups."
"It is fair to the patients groups."
"It gives them hope that this relatively new branch of science will help in the treatment of genetic disorders and in cures for diseases such as cancer and AIDS."
"On the other hand and just as importantly, the new proposal provides safeguards for the environment; it provides safeguards for animal welfare; it respects existing international agreements; it ensures that human cloning is outlawed."
"Two years ago we were seduced and panicked by the horror stories of those opposed to biotechnological research."
"I bear in mind the point Mr Liese made earlier that there is only hope but this time we should consider the aspirations of the thousands of Europeans who suffer from currently incurable diseases and illnesses and give them some hope by promoting this directive and bringing some order to the field of biotechnology."
"Madam President, in many respects what Mr Martin has just said echoes my own thoughts on the matter, though, unlike him, I am happy to confess that I actually supported the proposal when we last voted on it two years ago and I do not intend to change my intention this time."
"As Mr Adam pointed out earlier, most Members of the European Parliament have been subjected to a barrage of misinformation on this topic."
"I have here a file of misinformation."
"As many colleagues know, I yield to no-one in regarding the activities of lobbyists as important in helping us to do our job properly; but in the end it is up to us as parliamentarians to make judgments as between one side of the argument and the other."
"I am quite clear on which side of the argument I would come down: the interests of the patients and the interests of the single market."
"Very few speakers today have made the point that this is a single market measure."
"It was first brought to this House by the Commission in 1988."
"It will not be long before we reach 1998."
"In a fast-moving industry the European Community has been lagging behind the very rapid progress made in the United States."
"Indeed, reference has been made to the fact that the chief beneficiaries of biotechnological patents will be large multinationals."
"That is absolute nonsense."
"In my own country we have 165 important small and medium-sized companies which are involved in biotechnology."
"The United States has 1, 300."
"Surely we in Europe ought to be able at least to equal, if not to surpass, what the Americans are doing."
"Another part of the mythology is that currently there is no legislation about the protection of biotechnological patents here in Europe."
"There is!"
"There are 15 different sets of biotechnological patent law which cause confusion and chaos and add enormously to the expense of registering a patent."
"The intention of this proposal is to replace fifteen sets of national regulations with one set of European regulations."
"As for ethics - although I consider that the ethical consideration is not really appropriate in this directive - the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights and its rapporteur have included in Amendment No 56 a new Article 9a setting up an ethics committee."
"As has been pointed out, we have also taken care of the interests of animals and, indeed, the interests of humans, though there seem to be some Members of this Parliament who think that animal rights are more important than human rights."
"In conclusion, I shall be supporting this directive and I hope that the Commission will be able to accept most, if not all, of the amendments of the Legal Affairs Committee."
"Madam President, it seems to me that the only clear argument from the rapporteur is that Europe should approve a provision on patenting in the field of biotechnology because the US and Japan already have similar legislation."
"That, Mr Rothley, is absurd because it means that we are subordinate to decisions already made in other countries."
"There is, however, nothing absurd about questioning the consequences of a decision of this nature, but the rapporteur was careful not to go into this."
"What does it mean to patent a living, albeit genetically modified, organism?"
"It means retaining an organism that is the product of human invention, but, scientifically and logically, this is wrong, in fact it looks suspiciously like the crazed desire for omnipotence of a sorcerer's apprentice."
"In reality, the sole objective is financially to exploit discoveries in the field of biotechnology: and these are discoveries because genes can only be discovered or modified, they cannot be invented."
"No-one benefits from the kind of sophistry proposed by some of the amendments: it is nothing but hypocrisy to exclude the human body or parts of it from being patented because, in biological terms, man is an animal species."
"We ought therefore to conclude that what is not acceptable for human beings should not be acceptable for other animal organisms either."
"In fact, in the name of the economic interests of a few multinationals, we are attempting to establish a criterion that involves new experiments and fresh suffering for animals."
"We are then told that it is necessary to patent genes and gene therapies to meet the needs of the sick."
"I wish to point out that treatments of that kind are also available without being patented; in fact, agreeing that they should be patented means encouraging research only into treatment that makes money for the multinationals. Consequently, those treatments will be available only to rich citizens and nations, but not to the world's poor and, particularly, not to those who have very unusual illnesses which will not provide the multinationals with an adequate return."
"This is not about defending the sick!"
"I should also add that, as has already happened in the US, these genes are stolen from their genuine owners, for although they have them in their bodies, once they are patented they are no longer able to dispose freely of them."
"These are grave implications for the future of humanity, and they cannot be shrugged aside, as our rapporteur seeks to do."
"And so we are opposed to this."
"Madam President, I should like to use my speaking time to refer to some of the misunderstandings that have cropped up time and again in this debate, as on previous occasions."
"Contrary to the perceptions of many Members, the Rothley report certainly does provide for the patentability of human genes and of flora and fauna."
"I ask anyone who believes otherwise to read Articles 3(2) and 1b carefully."
"Article 3(2) refers to a gene isolated from the human body, but it must be said that even an isolated human gene is still a gene."
"Amendments 71 to 75, which Mrs Gebhardt and I have tabled, do not seek to prohibit patents; their purpose is only to exclude those patents that go too far, because medical patients and the treatment of serious diseases, as well as the job situation in Europe, are equally pressing concerns of ours."
"Based on the principle of responsible research, our amendments certainly permit the patenting of processes and applications as well as of proteins, medicinal drugs, vaccines and many other products."
"That should provide the European biotechnological industry with enough incentive and reward, and many of its representatives echo that assessment."
"What we want to exclude is the applicability of product protection to primary genetic matter, both for ethical reasons and for research-policy considerations."
"Knowledge of the ways in which the human body works should remain freely accessible to society."
"It should not be the subject of exclusive property and exploitation rights."
"Product protection of primary genetic matter will provide a few European companies, but chiefly American and Japanese corporations - simply because they will be quicker to react - with a European monopoly for many years to come."
"They will then be able to prevent other enterprises from using the patented genetic material or charge them high licence fees."
"My third point is that the proposed rules will also prove very costly for European farmers, for animal-breeders and plant-growers and consequently for consumers too."
"Costly by European standards, but prohibitively expensive by Third World standards."
"If animals and plants become patentable, and if such patents apply not only to the first generation but to all subsequent generations resulting from natural reproduction, even the envisaged farmer's privilege will be of little help."
"I shall close by asking all Members of the House who are seeking to reconcile the various legitimate interests involved here to support our Amendments 71 to 75."
"Madam President, during this debate on the Patent Directive I have been particularly upset by the fact that certain organisations representing patients, including the Danish Cystic Fibrosis Association, maintain that there is a 'Green Lobby' which does not care a jot for the needs of seriously ill people."
"This is, of course, wrong!"
"The most sensational claim is that, without the Patent Directive, large companies would keep their research results secret."
"But it goes without saying that, in a democratic society where there is freedom of research, the results of that research should be freely available to all researchers without the need to pay a licence fee."
"What the Patent Directive means, as the Scandinavian Association against Painful Animal Tests has pointed out, is that a company can gain a monopoly over important genes which could create difficulties for the discovery of new drugs."
"The Rothley report also opens the way for the patenting of methods of treatment, as the term known as the doctor's exemption is missing in the report."
"According to Sweden's Christian Council this would mean that research would be blocked and that groups with few resources would be excluded from receiving the best possible treatment."
"Mr Adam said previously that there is a 'Green Propaganda Machine' which has mounted a pressure campaign before this debate."
"This is absolutely ridiculous when you consider the enormous propaganda campaign carried out by the biotechnological industry to try to get a few Members of this Parliament to change their position from that which we adopted two years ago."
"So I must say that if this directive is adopted it will not only be a defeat for democracy but also a disgrace for the European Parliament."
"Madam President, I have no doubt at all that biotechnology is going to represent the very future of science."
"Having said that, I think it presents ultimate ethical dilemmas, and the ethical dilemma which I face can be summarized as: What do I say to the parents and family of a child suffering from cystic fibrosis if no hope is held out for serious scientific research in that area."
"On the other hand, what happens when we hear talk - and it can be serious talk - of people who want to design their offspring? Who want to say 'My child shall have yellow hair and a smaller nose'?"
"How do we face that dilemma? It is an ethical dilemma, Mr Cassidy, and ethics do come into this."
"When in March 1995 I was one of those who proudly voted against the last directive, it was because I did not feel that it contained sufficient ethical safeguards."
"That was the clear reasoning behind it."
"And I must say I was surprised, when we received the draft directive in the Environment Committee, to see that there was no reference to the ethical dimension; it was an Environment Committee amendment which Mr Rothley as rapporteur took on board in the Legal Affairs Committee and which has subsequently been added to by Mr Cot and myself."
"When it comes to the ethical committee, we have not said in that second amendment what it shall comprise, merely that the Commission shall come forward with a proposal."
"When it comes forward with that proposal we can consider what the ethical committee's terms of reference shall be and who shall be on it."
"Let us make it a precondition for this directive coming into effect that an ethical committee shall be established and shall be a central part of our decision-making process."
"Madam President, whenever biotechnology is debated, industry repeats the mantra of competitiveness in a manner reminiscent of the medieval church."
"In my view, we political decision-makers ought to be far more critical of the promises which are made regarding the millions of jobs which will be created in this field."
"The plain fact is that there is no clear evidence that improving the parameters within which enterprises operate by means of this Directive would increase the number of jobs."
"In today's newspaper an Austrian agronomist says that small plant-breeding businesses could actually shed jobs because larger enterprises will compete them out of existence."
"A patent entails a kind of monopoly."
"The Commission could also have adopted different approaches to the issue of legal protection."
"It could have considered separately, for example, microbiological processes and transgenic animals, but now provisions concerning all these very disparate life forms have been incorporated into the same proposal for a Directive although they really deserve far more differentiated treatment."
"For example, a plant-breeder's right is a traditional form of legal protection for plants which have been improved, and it would have been possible to introduce legal protection for animals on the same basis."
"Madam President, after this long debate, I should like to dot some 'i's' and cross some 't's' , and in particular two of them."
"The first relates to the concept of patents."
"Patents, in case it needs saying again, are a vital element which offer both legal and economic security, without which there would not be any inventions."
"Every time we raise these problems here we always make a point of emphasizing Europe's weakness in the area of innovation."
"Now, the process of innovation is directly linked with the process of invention and, therefore, with protection."
"Six months ago now, we voted through a report of which I was the author and in which we drew attention to this European paradox of a Europe putting itself forward as a champion of discovery but a Europe poor in inventions."
"This report was passed unanimously."
"Well, I have to say that while some people here may be suffering, as Mr Rothley was saying earlier, from 'Legasthenia' , they are also, curiously, suffering from amnesia; and I am very much afraid that genetic engineering is not going to be of much help to them."
"The second thing I should like to highlight is the fact that a great deal has been said about humanism and morality."
"Humanism is clearly that which ensures that Man is the measure of everything, and especially those men and women who suffer in their bodies and in their minds those diseases for which no-one has yet come up with a cure and for whom genetic engineering offers considerable hope."
"This form of humanism has nothing whatever to do with the naturalism that we hear people talk about today, which regards idolized nature as a yardstick of I know not what judgement."
"I would say to Mrs Roth that if, indeed, morality invigorates politics, then just as surely moralism kills it."
"I fear that had we been called upon today to discuss Pasteur and his inventions, a part of this House would have condemned him, just as others condemned Galileo a few centuries ago!"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur and I reached a fair compromise on Amendments 16 and 49 after lengthy discussions."
"They concern recitals 16a and 16e and Article 3."
"One of their chief aims is to prevent abuses."
"Such abuses, which have in fact been tried already, could consist in patenting gene sequences without having any specific scientifically demonstrable application in mind."
"The formulation 'an industrial application must be disclosed' draws a clear line. DNA sequences are not patentable just because they have been discovered."
"They can become patentable on the basis of explicitly described applications, such as the production of active substances."
"Anyone who has ever looked into the enormous expenditure that the development of such active substances entails will surely understand and recognize the moral justification, and indeed the necessity, of stimulating research and development by holding out the prospect of a patent."
"These are not, as the demagogues have claimed, patents on life but rather patents for life."
"Genetically engineered human hormones, for example, will be a monumental step forward for haemophiliacs, for anaemia sufferers and for patients with genetic metabolic disorders."
"In 1995, when this Parliament rejected the proposal for a so-called biopatent directive, many Members saw it as a moment of glory for the European Parliament."
"But it caused consternation among Europe's biotechnologists, because outright rejection naturally deprived them of the upsurge in motivation which the draft directive was meant to provide."
"That, ladies and gentlemen, is why we are contributing now to a genuine red-letter day in the life of this Parliament."
"After nine long years, let us finally adopt this legislation."
"Madam President, Mr Rothley, you have argued very, very eloquently today in favour of employment, and you have undoubtedly imparted a sense of vision with regard to this entire issue."
"But there are still some small discrepancies between your oral presentation and your written report."
"Allow me to highlight a few."
"The issue at stake here, of course, remains the monopoly of the pharmaceutical companies, which arises partly from the long lifespan of patents."
"We are precluding research by small undertakings."
"Holders of licences and patents will focus their research first and foremost on areas where, for example, there are large patient groups."
"That has always been a reality which no-one, ourselves included, can ignore."
"Discoverers of genes, according to your report, should still equate to patent-holders."
"The patent-holder is given virtually exclusive rights to exploit and market the new research findings; given the near-oligopoly that exists in this domain, there is a particular danger that the SMEs and small research units will be trampled underfoot."
"The reverse of your line of argument is true, which is why I see the Gebhardt and Berger amendments as an opportunity to redress the balance in some respects and to make the report approvable."
"Madam President, I do not think there is any doubt at all that this debate has been shrouded in misinformation and quite deliberate sensationalist claims about patenting body-parts and the like."
"We have to set that aside and look at the reality of it."
"Biotechnology is an important industry in the European Union; it is a tremendously important sector, and we have to be very careful in the way we deal with it."
"If we were to reject this, of course, patenting would still continue."
"It would not continue in the European Union but it would continue somewhere else and we would have less control over it."
"Patents are effectively an award for taking a risk and investing in the development of new medicines, and we should reward our companies for taking such risks."
"However, it does not stop there."
"If we are to patent biotech inventions, then we must take into account ethical considerations."
"It is not enough simply to adopt what I would describe as the 'gee whiz school of technology' ."
"One has to recognize that ethical questions have to be asked and solutions must be found."
"That is why Ian White's amendment introducing an ethical committee will give us the kind of directive that we want and need."
"We need this because there is a question, not just about the right of companies, but also about the right of patients to have their suffering from genetic diseases alleviated."
"That is tremendously important, and we must recognize that there are these ethical questions."
"It is not possible to have an ethical assessment of every patent application, because I understand that there are some 10, 000 applications every year in the European Union, and there are not that number of philosophers to go round."
"However, we need to have a framework within which such decisions can be made."
"This is the first reading, and it is important that we show the Commission, the Council and the wider public that we are quite serious about this and that we recognize the need for a directive, but one with an ethical dimension."
"That is a sine qua non of progress."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is about to conclude this first reading of the new proposal for a directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions: this was no easy task!"
"We all remember - and some of you actually mentioned - the vote of 1 March 1995."
"On that occasion and, generally, throughout the whole process of considering the earlier proposal, the European Parliament had voiced its own concern about the consequences that adopting the proposal might have had and raised important issues."
"Through that vote of 1 March 1995 and despite the efforts made on all sides during the conciliation procedure, the European Parliament said one thing clearly: that it remained unpersuaded by the reasons and explanations provided."
"Straightforward ethical and political questions had not, plainly, received equally straightforward and clear answers."
"In this new proposal for a directive, the Commission, basically, set itself one principal objective: to respond to the concerns that had been expressed and to mark out those areas which had previously been insufficiently clear."
"That had, naturally, to be done within the scope of a sectoral directive on patents. What then is the central question?"
"To provide an absolute guarantee that the reasons behind the research, the industry and competitiveness were set within clear limits that prevent any form of appropriation of the human body, including the smallest elements thereof."
"The Amsterdam European Council also clearly affirmed in its conclusions the absolute principle of respect for the integrity of human beings."
"It is a question of establishing whether biological material can be patented."
"We need therefore to establish clearly the distinction between the discovery of something that exists in nature and an invention that is the product of human activity with a well-defined objective."
"The ethical aspect of biotechnological inventions, and particularly those concerning isolated elements of the human body, was therefore the Commission's starting-point for a thorough review to identify the most appropriate solution in this extremely sensitive area."
"The Commission talked to the group of consultants on the ethics of biotechnology about the ethical aspects of patenting inventions involving elements of human origin."
"Its opinion was given on 25 September 1996."
"That positive opinion confirmed the Commission in its approach and provided further pointers."
"I note, moreover, that Amendment No 1 specifically refers to this."
"During the preparatory work for this plenary sitting, no less than six committees of the European Parliament worked on the proposal for a directive and held many lengthy meetings."
"The debate was frank, open and far-reaching, and the arguments were entered into fully."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights was therefore in full possession of the facts when it adopted its report on 18 June last, and I should like to extend my special thanks here to the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, for his exceptional work which is much to be admired."
"I should also like to thank everyone, including those whose opinions have been less positive because this has been an important and civilized debate."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights adopted 64 amendments."
"The Commission is prepared to accept all of those amendments because they provide suitable clarification..."
"... of the sensitive matters currently under discussion."
"The main points are as follows: a formula that very clearly defines the difference between discovery and invention as regards isolated elements of the human body; nonpatentability of animal or plant species; an explicit ban on patenting human reproductive cloning procedures and procedures for modifying the germinal genetic identity of human beings; the need never to forget the ethical dimension and the possibility of that being the subject of appropriate preventive assessment; the achievement of a balance between the suffering that some inventions could cause to animals and the considerable usefulness of such inventions in medicine; and improved presentation of breeders' privileges."
"On all of those points - as well, of course, as many others - the Commission believes that the contribution of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights has been crucial to achieving the main aim, namely striking a balance between economic requirements and the absolute need to respect ethics."
"The Commission is therefore, I repeat, prepared to accept all of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights and to incorporate them into its amended proposal."
"Some redrafting will be needed: this will not in any way change the substance of the amendments but simply improve the form to meet legal and institutional requirements."
"The Commission considers that Amendment No 1, for instance, which I have already quoted, would be better inserted into a recital."
"And as regards Amendment No 56 which calls for an ethics committee to be set up, the Commission will be referring to the group of consultants on the ethics of biotechnology which has already been set up."
"Moreover, the House recently adopted a resolution renewing the mandate of that group of consultants."
"As part of the effort to achieve a balance, the Commission is also prepared to consider a number of amendments that were tabled subsequently: Amendments Nos 67, 69, 77, 79 and 99, for example."
"The proposal, as amended, will be submitted to the Council so that it can establish its common position."
"The proposal for a directive is of crucial importance to the Council because it is one of the four initiatives under the action plan for the single market that the Member States have been called upon by the European Council to adopt as rapidly as possible and, at any event, by 1 January 1999."
"We may therefore hope that the Luxembourg presidency, which is extremely sensitive to the problem, will be able to arrive at the common position at the meeting of the 'Internal Market' Council on 27 November next."
"The European Parliament can count on the Commission to see that its contribution is respected and retained on that occasion."
"Let me thank the House on behalf of the Commission for its contribution, and add my own personal thanks."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"I believe we have witnessed an example today - just as we would wish to see, in fact - of excellent cooperation between the Commission and Parliament."
"It really does work!"
"I should like to express my special thanks for your contribution, Commissioner."
"Madam President, I have a question for Mr Monti on Amendment 49."
"We have already gone well beyond the scheduled finishing time for this debate."
"Perhaps you can have a private word with Mr Monti."
"Mr Monti should declare whether he accepts that amendment, because it is basically about the patentability of life."
"I shall not allow any more questions, because this has been a very comprehensive discussion."
"Perhaps you can sit down again with Mr Monti."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Biotechnology and the White Paper"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A4-0239/97) by Mr Bowe, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the Commission report (COM(96)0630 - C4-0008/97) on the review of Directive 90/220/EEC in the context of the Commission's communication on biotechnology and the White Paper."
"Madam President, we have already heard considerable debate this morning on a biotechnologically related issue of considerable importance."
"We now have in front of us a report on another biotechnological issue of equal importance."
"In this case, before the Commission presents a legislative text to Parliament, we have been given the opportunity to comment on the Commission's ideas in the form of a report on the review of Directive 92/20, which regulates the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms."
"Parliament welcomes this possibility and looks forward to the early publication of a revised proposal by the Commission."
"As I have already said, Directive 92/20 is intended to secure human and environmental safety for releases and marketing of genetically modified products (GMOs) and introduces a single entry point to the Community market for GMO products."
"Parliament would unquestionably agree with the Commission that, in the light of recent problems with the operation of the Directive, a review is needed, and we would offer the following comments on the Commission's proposals, together with a number of additional suggestions for change."
"It seems clear that we must continue to establish and use the precautionary principle as the basis on which the Directive is constructed."
"It is, after all, better to be safe than sorry."
"Nevertheless, there is a clear role within the Directive for a risk assessment of the proposed products, with a centralized definition of the objectives and methodology of the risk assessment that would ensure that all potential risks to human health and the total environment are considered."
"We recognize and accept that in the light of experience it is possible to establish a classification commensurate with the identified risks involved for each release of GMOs."
"However, we cannot yet find any convincing arguments from the Commission in support of proposals for multi-state releases and we consider that more experience should be gained with the simplified procedure provided for in the Directive before we can consider any reductions in the requirements."
"We firmly believe that the Directive would be further improved if there were more consistent and thorough information and data collection during the course of experimental releases."
"This would allow proper evaluation of the risks of full commercial releases and would provide a useful addition to a database that the Commission must establish in order to facilitate the exchange of information between Member States and better cooperation on the basis of that information."
"We consider also that the Directive would function much better if decision-making procedures inside the Commission were made speedier, more transparent and more democratically accountable."
"We therefore think it is important to ensure that the Scientific Technical Committee and the Technical Committee procedures are in line with the agreement known as the modus vivendi , and that these committees should meet in public and publish their minutes."
"Citizens should have proper access to this information on the proposed releases, and be consulted."
"Further, we are increasingly recognizing that some releases will raise ethical questions."
"We ask the Commission to recognize this also and to seek a means by which social and ethical questions can be considered in the decisionmaking procedure."
"We must recognize the right of the public to be informed and of consumers to be aware of the origin of products they are offered."
"So we welcome the recent reinforcement of the labelling provisions of the Directive by the Commission."
"We consider that the producers of GMO products must be ultimately responsible for their products."
"We therefore ask the Commission to introduce a special liability provision into the Directive to guarantee that those producers are made responsible and suffer penalties when accidents or problems arise."
"In conclusion, whilst there are many serious and important concerns associated with the use of biotechnology, particularly in the areas of food production and pharmaceuticals, the European Parliament believes that policy makers should take a very serious and thoughtful approach to the use of biotechnology in these areas, basing their decisions on sound science and not simply dismissing out of hand this technology which has many obvious benefits if used in a safe and sensible manner."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, First of all, we should like to thank Mr Bowe for having incorporated into his report practically all the amendments adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"That sort of cooperation between farmers and environmentalists does not occur too often, which is why I find it particularly encouraging."
"I believe we have to recognize that the agricultural use of genetically altered plants and livestock is an area in which, naturally enough, advantages and risks are especially closely bound together."
"Mr Bowe has made it clear that the consumer of the end product is entitled to an unbroken information chain and a fully transparent production process."
"The thin line between favourable and unfavourable assessments by both farmers and consumers is illustrated by the example of maize."
"When we think about it, very few of us would really object to maize plants being made more resistant by means of genetic engineering if that were to deter insects which might otherwise ruin the plants."
"There would then be no need to spray insecticides - good news for the environment!"
"If, however, the same genetic engineering process also bred herbicide tolerance which maize could transfer to related wild plants, making them resistant to a particularly powerful weedkiller, I should then have reservations."
"This also leads us to urge industry to strive for general acceptance of its products and processes, so that people can distinguish between what is useful and what is less useful."
"Up to the present time, the exact opposite has been achieved, namely minimal consumer acceptance or even consumer resistance."
"The issues addressed by Mr Bowe, such as the liability question, must be resolved."
"We cannot take refuge in the argument that general liability law will automatically cover any occurrences in this domain."
"This area is too new for that and must be minutely examined for potential liability problems."
"I believe our work would ultimately have been easier if the preparation of this paper had included a clearer choice of alternative options."
"During the next stages of this process we should make a point of ensuring that the proposals are expressed in legally precise terms and that their substance can be grasped by those who have to deal with them."
"Madam President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his difficult work, in which he has sought at least partially to take into account the views of the Committee on Research."
"Directive 220 must be amended in such a way as to simplify unnecessarily complicated procedures."
"Provision should also be made for a more effective and open exchange of information between national authorities and the Commission."
"One cannot overemphasize the importance of openness at all stages of the regulation of genetically modified organisms."
"Consumers ought themselves to be able to choose what products they wish to consume."
"Therefore if genetically modified organisms constitute part of a product or if they are used to produce it, this information absolutely must be included in product labelling, and clear, comprehensible and uniform labelling must be introduced."
"A method of labelling must be worked out."
"I call upon the Commission to respect this view of Parliament's."
"The Commission should also take into account the environmental impact assessment and the findings of social and behavioural research concerning perceptions of risk."
"Knowledge is constantly advancing, and further information being acquired."
"It is important that assessments should be based on scientific information and that these findings should be used to clarify and broaden the basis for assessing the risks of the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms and their environmental impact."
"New characteristics which are considered desirable can be imparted to foodstuffs more rapidly and more precisely by means of genetic engineering than by means of traditional breeding."
"For example, the quality and yield of crops can be improved by developing varieties resistant to bacterial, viral and fungal diseases."
"The use of pesticides and at the same time residues of them in foodstuffs and the environment can be reduced by combating plant diseases by means of genetic engineering."
"On the other hand, genetic engineering may result in more pesticide use."
"The first commercial applications of genetic engineering involved imparting above-average pesticide resistance to soya and maize varieties."
"Besides giving a plant a characteristic which is considered desirable, transferring a gene may also produce an undesirable characteristic."
"Modified plants may contain higher levels of natural toxins."
"Products of genetically modified organisms absolutely must comply with the precautionary principle."
"As experience and scientific knowledge advance, it must of course be possible to amend the provisions of the Directive."
"Madam President, I am going to treat this almost as a continuation of the previous debate, because in his explanatory statement Mr Bowe states: ' As more advances take place in this sector it seems certain further questions of ethical acceptability will be raised."
"Therefore, the Commission must examine how an ethical dimension can be introduced into the decision-making process related to the Directive.' That is quite right and yet, in response to the debate a few minutes ago, Commissioner Monti seemed to be saying that the Commission would refer Parliament's demand for an ethical committee to the advisory group."
"That, frankly, is not, and will not be, good enough."
"If you look at the amendment to the Rothley report tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights you will see that we have asked the Commission to come forward with proposals."
"Referring it to an advisory group, which is a body outside Parliament, is not sufficient."
"Let me make that clear."
"I would very much like a response from the Commissioner present, because I know she was also present when Commissioner Monti was giving what I regard as an inadequate reply."
"The release of GMOs into the wider world is certainly a question which raises wider ethical issues."
"This is exactly the kind of question that ought to be put to such an ethical committee."
"Again, when we talk about this in terms of the Bowe report, there is no specific reference to such an ethical committee, because it has yet to be established."
"We should be thinking now , in advance of the second reading of the Rothley report and of further developments in biotechnology, how we are to treat this whole question."
"It is not going to be enough simply to refer it to an advisory committee which already exists."
"That is a sensible first step, but it does not take us any further forward in terms of the structure of a proper ethics committee which will sooner or later have to treat the matter on a wider world stage on behalf of the European Union."
"Madam President, the report we are debating on the review of Directive 90/220 on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms falls within the scope of the updating of Community law in the field of biotechnology."
"This will make it possible to take advantage of the experience and knowledge gained both from the development and progress of science, and from the application of the directive during the past seven years."
"One of the main aspects of this review is risk assessment, of course with the related classification, so that parallelism can be achieved with the corresponding administrative procedures for granting permits for the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment."
"Of course, simplification and flexibility of the directive's procedures must pose no threat to safety, and that is why mainly cases of demonstrated low risk should be involved."
"Consequently, when the Commission produces the amended version of Directive 90/220, it must be sure to include clear indications on risk assessment."
"In fulfilling the aims of building public confidence, enhancing the competitiveness of European industry and protecting public health and the environment, aims which, be it noted, the Commission itself has stressed in the context of the White Paper, it must take into account a number of factors such as: firstly, the type of genetic modification and in particular whether this relates to a simple property of the colour or texture of a fruit or, in contrast, the acquisition by a plant of resistance to an insecticide."
"That, because in the latter case the balance of the ecosystem could be affected, as also could competitiveness, granted that farmers depend on certain companies which hold patents on the genetically modified plant but also on the insecticide to which it is resistant."
"Secondly, whether along with the transfer of one or more genes, resistance to one or more antibiotics is also transferred."
"Here, it is certainly necessary to take account of the possible transfer of resistance to micro-organisms."
"Thirdly, if the genetically modified organism is a plant being cultivated experimentally and commercially, similar but unmodified plants should be protected."
"This, because transfers of pollen may take place, when as is quite natural, new varieties of the same plant will emerge which, however, may have different and perhaps undesirable properties."
"Here, I would like to stress that the existing Annexes 2, 3 and 4 of the Directive were commendably complete in respect of various important factors, and of course the fault was that those factors were not translated into a specific assessment of risk."
"I will now advance a few more ideas and would like an answer from the Commission."
"First, upon what does it base its risk assessment and how does it classify it?"
"Secondly, how does it relate the classification of risk with administrative procedures?"
"Where the question of insurance is concerned I am in general agreement with the rapporteur. Concerning the labelling of foods, I think that all foods should be labelled so that consumers can always know what they are buying."
"Besides, almost all consumers want full information about the foods they buy."
"Only in that way can their confidence be gained."
"Consumer information should also be improved, to help them choose between products."
"I want to stress that this whole area needs monitoring, both by the Member States and by the Commission."
"Madam President, this is a subject which - as other speakers have pointed out - follows on directly from that we were discussing earlier in the day."
"One might say that they are preconditions for eachother."
"I will start by thanking the rapporteur for his work and say that I agree with the main lines of the report."
"What I would like to focus on therefore are one or two more specific points, the first one being to ask the Commission whether it is still logical for this subject to be covered by a single directive."
"We are talking about, on the one hand, an experimental release and, on the other hand, the marketing of something which has already been subjected to trials."
"But, when we get down to it, we cannot say that the same rules apply and I think that, in view of the fact that other directives have been put into effect, one might wonder whether it is still logical to have only one directive, or might it not be easier to deal with if there were two different directives?"
"I will also say that, along with others, of course I agree with the Commission's wish to simplify matters and hence possibly also to introduce a classification of risks."
"GMOs are not all equally risky and, as that is what we have also done, for example in connection with the contained use of GMOs, it would be logical to do that."
"I also think the Commission is right to propose that we try to establish some procedures so that direct comparisons can be made. I think that is the way we can get the individual countries to accept other countries' results, rather than saying in blanket fashion that, if a product has been thoroughly tested in one country, the results must also apply in other countries."
"It is at least necessary at the present stage to secure some harmonization."
"When I put it that way, it is because, regardless of what we may think about the matter, this is still a very sensitive subject in public opinion. That is why it is important to take public concerns in this area into account when we discuss simplification procedures."
"Madam President, the Commission has been very good about keeping its promise in the White Paper to produce a report reviewing Directive 90/220/EEC."
"It is a pity that in looking at the directive, nothing has been done about the limited use made of it, which would have been helpful."
"The subject is too complex and too important to be rushed through quickly."
"It seems likely that quite a number of new plants will be coming onto the market in Europe over the next few years."
"More than 3600 have been introduced in the United States in recent years, and Europe can expect roughly the same."
"However, this should not make us feel any more relaxed about the introduction of new products."
"We must still adopt a cautious approach, which means being as careful as possible in both the field trial and marketing phases."
"As far as the review is concerned, I think that the Commission has produced a good report."
"But it forgot one thing: to include itself."
"While the Member States are required to meet specific deadlines, the Commission itself does not have any fixed time limit for reaching a final decision on authorization."
"The detailed internal consultation procedure sometimes means that files can spend months circulating around the Commission's offices."
"I entirely agree with the Commission's proposal that the new directive should also require the benefits and risks of introducing new products to be spelt out."
"The public has a right to this information, since they are the ones who are going to have to eat the new foodstuffs."
"I do not think the motion for a resolution is entirely clear on all points."
"The first few paragraphs, for example, do not make it clear that they apply only to field trials, and other paragraphs too are rather obscurely worded."
"Paragraph 12 also does not take account of the recently adopted amendment to Annex III."
"I am anxious to see the new proposal from the Commission, but this review has at least made me feel more confident about it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 20th century has seen the emergence and development of two types of high-risk technology."
"The first was nuclear power, and the second is genetic manipulation."
"Nobody can say today which of the two will ultimately prove the more dangerous."
"Mr Bowe's report shows quite clearly that those selfsame mistakes which a previous generation of politicians made are about to be repeated."
"There was no risk assessment on the use of nuclear power."
"The decision to develop nuclear energy was taken on the basis of misinformation about its potential effects."
"We only know a tiny fraction today of all there is to learn about the actual consequences of genetic manipulation."
"Nevertheless, it is to be pushed through with totally unnecessary haste."
"What we must ask ourselves here is this: who needs such technology?"
"Who needs it immediately, and for what purpose?"
"There are a few industrial groups seeking to maximize their profits without incurring any of the attendant risks."
"The Commission report is an attempt to lend them a helping hand."
"In my opinion, Mr Bowe has made a very valiant effort to engage in damage limitation here."
"One thing is perfectly clear: there is good reason for the haste with which genetically manipulated organisms are being released, because the more information people have about the possible consequences and risks, the harder it will be to legalize this technology."
"Our duty as representatives of the people can only be to ensure that any type of danger to human beings is kept to an absolute minimum."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this Directive must guarantee human and environmental safety whenever genetically modified organisms are released, otherwise products containing them cannot be admitted into the Community market."
"But if Community research is to be equipped to play its part in making biotechnological products more competitive, uniformly applicable rules and comprehensive, Communitywide data collections and information regarding the results of experimental releases, especially in terms of their environmental impact, must be guaranteed and acted upon."
"In so far as the Commission's intentions reflect these aims, its report is to be emphatically welcomed."
"But it is unacceptable, Mrs Bjerregaard, that the Commission should intend to alter the scope of the Directive, in other words its annex, without consulting Parliament, as is implied in the Commission's report."
"I can only warn the Commission against that; it is not only democracy that would suffer."
"In biotechnological research, experimental releases are indispensable as final tests of the harmlessness of GMOs to people and the biosphere."
"However, the revised Directive is expected to define clear risk categories for released GMOs and equally unambiguous administrative requirements for releases in each category."
"That should reveal whether a so-called simplified procedure is needed at all."
"Such a procedure does not seem logical to me, for the lowest risk category should logically have the simplest procedure assigned to it, making any further simplification unnecessary."
"So I shall finish with this appeal to the Commission: abolish the simplified procedure, make the Directive clearer and ensure that it is rigorously implemented."
"Madam President, I will start by thanking the rapporteurs, Mr David Bowe, Mrs Matikainen-KallstrÃ¶m and Mr Willi GÃ¶rlach, for Parliament's response to the report from the Commission on the review of Directive 90/220 covering the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment."
"This is a procedural directive aimed at maintaining a high level of safeguards for health and the environment, so as to ensure the orderly development of GMO technology."
"The directive is of great practical significance and, in the report we are debating today, the Commission undertakes an analysis of how the directive has worked since it came into force."
"Let me go through some of the problem areas which have been mentioned here today and which we draw attention to in the report."
"There is, for example, insufficient guidance on risk assessment, to which the rapporteur also drew attention in his speech."
"We lack a system for the classification of releases, we lack a system for the adjustment of administrative procedures to the release category and we do not have access to the deliberations of a scientific committee on matters relating to health and the environment."
"There is also the problem of administratively cumbersome procedures and approval systems for the marketing of products."
"There is a need for greater transparency and - as we all know, since it is a matter we have had occasion to discuss before now - there is a pressing need for labelling."
"As Parliament knows, the Commission at my instigation adopted a provisional technical amendment of Annex 3 to Directive 90/220/EEC, according to which labelling would be required for all products released."
"This amendment has now been finally adopted so that, from 1 August this year, labelling will be compulsory for all products covered by this Directive."
"The Commission considers this to be a very important step in the right direction, and we think that in this way we have given the guidance to consumers that Parliament, in particular, has called for on several occasions."
"I am very pleased to see that the report has been the subject of very thorough discussion in the European Parliament."
"The debate in Parliament has come up just in time for me to incorporate Parliament's wishes into the proposal for a review which is underway in the Commission."
"I just have a few comments to make on Parliament's motion for a resolution."
