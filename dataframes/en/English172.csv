"When one speaks of harsh measures, for instance doing away with all kinds of subsidies which raises the price level for primary goods although a lot of them are being temporarily excepted from this liberalization process, that certainly means that there is hardship."
"At the same time, in many of these countries you can see that because of the economic measures that have been taken, the purchasing power and living standard is slowly but surely rising."
"Where there are serious problems and bottlenecks, for example the past six months in Bulgaria, it has been the European Union. while recognizing the repercussions of certain necessary economic measures, that has provided two ECU 20 million social programmes to try to alleviate the hardship for the most needy."
"So it is a matter of solidarity with those countries on the one hand to encourage them to maintain their reform policies - and we have seen that in a number of the candidate countries - without which the future looks even gloomier, and on the other where we can give a helping hand to alleviate temporary bottlenecks, we will try to assist in that respect."
"Thank you for that reply and for the whole debate, Commissioner Van den Broek. The debate is closed."
"I welcome Commissioner Kinnock, and I thank him very warmly for having been kind enough to agree, on the hoof as it were, to respond to Parliament's invitation."
"Road blocks set up by lorry drivers in France"
"I am grateful for the opportunity to report to the House on the French road haulage strike and related issues."
"Last Thursday before the current strike started, I wrote to Mr Gayssot, the Transport Minister and Mr Chevènement, the Interior Minister urging them to take all possible measures to avert a strike and also asking them to make arrangements that would facilitate international road traffic within the single market if the strike took place."
"In addition, I asked Mr Gayssot to implement a suggestion which he had made in our previous correspondence for an information system to be set up in order to assist hauliers to travel through France."
"Late last Friday I received a reply from the two ministers setting out the various efforts they were making to try to avert a strike and also reporting that they were examining the most appropriate measures in the circumstances to prevent, through all possible means, inconveniences resulting for international hauliers from a strike."
"In addition to these and other contacts, my colleague Mr Monti has been in correspondence with Mr Moscovici, the French European Affairs Minister, to communicate a similar view about the essential need to maintain freedom of movement."
"When the strike started, the French Government responded by deploying police forces to clear several important border crossings."
"The government also established an information system in keeping with the previous undertakings and they made sustained efforts to ensure that talks between employers and Unions continue."
"Yesterday, the second day of the strike, I wrote again to Mr Gayssot and Mr Chevènement and the relevant trade union leaders."
"In my letters to the Ministers, I acknowledged the efforts the government has made to remove blockades at international crossings but I also urged them to achieve the removal of remaining blockades."
"I am awaiting a response to that most recent letter."
"In my letter to the trade union leaders, I drew attention to the very serious concern of drivers, employers and Member States about the impediments to free circulation."
"I also emphasized the fact that workers and businesses from outside France were being badly damaged by a dispute in which they had no part and over which they had absolutely no influence."
"Accordingly, I urged the trade unionists to remove the barriers to international haulage without delay."
"Yesterday evening I was informed by the French authorities that at that stage the only international crossing being blockaded was at Calais."
"I was also told that the Channel Tunnel blockade had been withdrawn after the strikers had been advised that if the blockade was not lifted, the authorities were prepared to use appropriate force."
"As Members of the House will know, it appears that several blockades are still being maintained at a variety of places and some are being moved to different locations at intervals."
"The disruption of traffic therefore continues to a considerable extent."
"Against this background, the Commission has naturally again examined the issues of Member States' legal responsibilities to maintain freedom of movement under the treaty and of Commission powers to intervene in our role as guardians of the treaty."
"I report to the House that as on previous occasions we conclude on the basis of legal advice first that Member States must make all possible efforts to facilitate the freedom of movement of international traffic in the single market and secondly that any effective legal power that the Commission has to intervene relates directly to the strength of those efforts by Member State governments."
"With the present French strike now in its third day, it is evident that the French authorities have undertaken serious and sustained efforts to uphold their treaty responsibilities through their use of police forces, through the efforts they have made to sustain negotiations and through the provision of information to hauliers."
"Naturally we will maintain close contact with the French Government and continue to monitor events."
"The government and the Commission work in the knowledge that if a Member State neglected its obligations to strive to maintain the freedom of movement, the Commission would certainly exercise its power to initiate legal proceedings."
"Meanwhile, whilst we naturally respect the civil right of people to withdraw their labour, the impediment to freedom of international movement is to be condemned, as is any physical violence, whether by strikers or by others affected by the strike."
"In the course of recent days, there have been calls for legal changes which would bring rules establishing a requirement of minimum services and formal arrangements for compensation to be paid to interests damaged by disputes which prevent or inhibit the freedom of movement."
"My colleagues and I are prepared to consider whether there are practical possibilities of compiling enforceable proposals on such matters, whilst at the same time being conscious of the reality that support for such initiatives may not be readily given in practice in any Council of Member State ministers."
"When further assessment has been given to the legal and practical implications of pursuing the course that is being suggested from some quarters, I will gladly report to this House."
"Commissioner, it is perhaps appropriate to recall that in November 1996, French farmers in the south of France repeated their attacks on Spanish and other lorry drivers transporting agricultural products."
"Compensation was promised, but everything has since been quietly forgotten."
"Now a new conflict has arisen, which, because of France's geographical position, has acquired a European dimension."
"This is indeed a ""Eurostrike' , which is affecting countries such as Spain which have nothing to do with its causes but which are suffering considerable damage."
"In the case of Spain, losses are calculated at almost 3, 000 million pesetas per day, with the Spanish Levante region being one of the most affected."
"As well as pointing out that compensation for past attacks should have been paid by now, this is the moment to call on the Commission, in view of this new conflict, to adopt immediately the necessary measures to guarantee the free movement of goods and examine the question of the payment of fair compensation to production sectors which have suffered losses."
"The Commissioner described to us a series of measures."
"Consequently, my words are designed to encourage him to continue taking action along these lines."
"It is therefore also the moment to call on the competent authorities to adopt the appropriate measures to guarantee, throughout this conflict, freedom of movement and the creation of specific corridors to ensure the free passage of vehicles and compliance with this basic Community principle."
"In conclusion, Mr Commissioner, I should like to..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"No, Mr Camisón Asensio, that is not possible, that is more of a statement than a question, and unfortunately you have already exceeded your speaking time by one minute."
"I recognize the concern and the passion which engenders the question from Mr Camisón."
"I would say to him firstly that everyone in this House, as well as in the Commission, will understand the particular impact on countries like Spain and Portugal, as well as those in the north of the Community, of a dispute that seriously impedes the free passage of goods through the single market."
"Secondly, as he probably already knows, in previous incidents which have resulted in physical attacks on Spanish drivers hauling fruit and similar produce, there is a case before the Court of Justice and before too long there should be conclusions reached with particular relevance to that case."
"It is, however, evident that those attacks on those occasions are considerably different from those being experienced in the current dispute."
"I am sure the House will want to keep clear in its own mind the distinction between these two sets of circumstances."
"The honourable Member asks that the Commission adopts the necessary measures with relation to the freedom of movement and so far as compensation is concerned."
"I have to say that the situation relating to the Commission's legal powers is precisely as I set it out in my initial statement."
"It is a fact that unless and until a Member State shows that it is negligent in its duty to uphold the freedom of movement, there is no effective power for the Commission to act."
"Secondly, there is no Community law and therefore no power so far as the Commission is concerned, to require the establishment or the provision of compensation."
"I have, however, over many months past made repeated appeals to both the last and current French Governments that the undertakings given to make provision of compensation to hauliers from throughout the Community be upheld."
"I regret to have to say that thus far the number of compensation claims met is extremely tiny and there are well in excess of a thousand still needing treatment and effective compensation."
"Madam President, may I begin by complimenting the Commission which this time has acted more rapidly, shouldered its responsibilities more effectively and intervened with the French government."
"But, acknowledging the fact that a year ago in this House we discussed exactly the same issue and the Commissioner then said that efforts were being made to provide compensation, it is clear that fewer than 1 % of the claims have been met."
"Does the Commissioner not feel that the time has now come for the Council of Ministers to tackle this matter and reach a compensation ruling that is placed in the hands of the European Commission which can have a fund at its disposal in order to make direct payments quickly so that in an industry that is already in difficulties there are no more petitions for bankruptcy?"
"Madam President, it is impossible to speak while all my colleagues are chatting among themselves."
"Thank you, Mr Wijsenbeek, but I did not see any Members talking - for once!"
"I am grateful to Mr Wijsenbeek for his question though I might point out that on this occasion we are acting in a completely consistent fashion with what we did last time."
"I sought to intervene before the strike took place last year."
"We were in constant touch with the French authorities and brought what pressure we could to bear on events."
"Exactly that course is being followed this time and I would invite the honourable Member to reflect upon that."
"I gave an undertaking this time last year to work on compensation."
"I have kept that promise as I indicated earlier with repeated oral and written appeals to successive French ministers to ensure that the system established for compensation worked effectively and speedily."
"I report my great disappointment - as I have to the French Government - that this has not taken place."
"So far as future developments are concerned, I understand there is some enthusiasm in some quarters for establishing some form of Community fund and getting the agreement of the Council of Ministers to that end."
"When there is further reflection account may be taken of the fact that not all Member States would be agreeable to such a collective approach."
"Secondly, it is worth reflecting too on the possibility that the existence of a fund, rather than lowering the possibility of strikes, could actually contribute to the encouragement of disputes."
"These matters are to be assessed and analyzed in the manner which I suggested earlier."
"Nothing is excluded but at the same time a measured approach is advisable in all the circumstances."
"Mr Commissioner, you have been honest enough to say that the present government of France is handling, with manifest tact, a conflict born of earlier commitments which were not kept, and trying to work for a genuine long term social agreement."
"You have mentioned that, even before this conflict broke, the French Government was in touch with your office, and with leading officials in Member States, to pass on information, to take stock of the road blocks, and all the road block points were known."
"The actiont taken by the French government also kept the main road links open."
"I am grateful to you for having mentioned that, Mr Commissioner."
"But all the same, there is clearly a European dimension in this conflict."
"Free movement of goods goes with harmonization of working conditions."
"If we deny that we will have all the citizens of Europe on our backs."
"Today we are seeing that in this conflict; tomorrow we will see it in another conflict which will affect another Member State."
"Mr Commissioner, one last question: do you think this conflict calls free movement of goods into question in the exact terms of the treaties, that is, a voluntary distortion of competition?"
"It seems to me that it does not."
"It is more a conflict arising from an absence of social harmonization."
"I will have to resist the temptation the honourable lady offers me to take a view about the policy of the French Government."
"That is most certainly not a matter for comment by the Commission."
"So far as harmonization of working conditions is concerned, maybe I can assist the House by simply quoting from the letter I sent yesterday to all the trade union leaders drawing their attention to a fact of which they are already aware that with my colleagues in the Commission I have been compiling and promoting possible improvements to Community legislation relating to road transport that would directly address several issues which cause discontent in many parts of the Union."
"I draw attention to the work going on in the Council of Ministers of the Union which will result in the introduction of a new generation of electronic tachographs, to the development of proposals for tougher rules on access to the road haulage profession and to the White Paper on working time which proposed that the relevant principles of Community legislation be extended to all the sectors currently excluded, including road haulage."
"I believe that a general application of decent working conditions can obviously make its contribution to good industrial relations."
"However, that issue is something to be continually attended to and so far as the Commission is concerned does not have direct relevance to the conduct or origins of the current dispute which is primarily a matter for the parties to the dispute and the French Government."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner for clarification of a point in his statement which I believe to be an inaccurate representation of the law as it stands today."
"The Treaty of Maastricht introduced for the first time the power for the Commission to impose penalties in the form of fines on a Member State which, as in this case, is clearly in breach of the free movement provisions."
"I do not know how much more evidence the Commission needs."
"These disruptions have been going on since 1984 and last year's disruption ran into millions of pounds."
"Would the Commissioner therefore please apply the rules as introduced by the Maastricht Treaty and withhold funds from the European taxpayers' budget from which French farmers, French fishermen and French trainees would otherwise benefit."
"Would he use these provisions and confirm that no change to the law is required."
"He must simply implement the Maastricht Treaty provisions."
"I know that the honourable Member is a lawyer and if she sat in any form of judgment and it was contended before her that there was an automatic means under the Maastricht Treaty to implement the law in the way she suggests, she would treat it with complete derision."
"So, I would say to her that whilst I am aware of the provisions of article 30 and article 5 of the Treaty on Union, the fact is - and it is an undisputable fact of law - that if a Member State is striving by all practical means to uphold its duty to maintain the freedom of movement within the single market, there is a very constrained power on the Commission to intervene."
"In this case the French Government has deployed police forces."
"The French Government is providing information and the French Government has made a variety of attempts to ensure that negotiations continue."
"In those circumstances, I am sure any lawyer or parliamentarian would acknowledge that there would be extreme difficulty in trying to demonstrate that a Member State government was not upholding its duty under the terms of the Treaty."
"Mr Commissioner, our group has always supported a reduction in working hours, the reorganization of transport along socially and environmentally sound lines, and guaranteeing to all citizens the basic right to freedom of demonstration."
"Now and again - and increasingly often - this House has followed our lead."
"Today, therefore, we in the Greens wish to express our solidarity with the striking French lorry drivers."
"We congratulate the striking lorry drivers on their courage and initiative."
"It is a strike for Europe, not against Europe!"
"Surely we are not still living in the days of Peterloo, Mr Commissioner, when the state took it upon itself to shoot at workers who went on strike."
"The state today is a conciliator, and I congratulate the French Government on the felicitous way in which they have found solutions so far."
"I cannot understand why you only address your remarks to the union leaders and not the scandalous behaviour of the employers' associations, who have only been persuaded back to the negotiating table with the greatest difficulty!"
"Mr President, Working Time Directive 104/93 does not include the transport sector and the resulting social dumping is only too clear."
"Why is the Commission only proposing a White Paper again and not a Directive?"
"It makes one wonder what the political aims of the Commission really are!"
"I am grateful to Mr Wolf for his question."
"The White Paper on excluded sectors has been published and there will be draft legislation available by the end of this year."
"I would share the hope of Members right across the House in just about every political section that we can make progress on this legislation and on the inclusion not only of road transport but of other transport sectors in the existing legislation of the Community."
"The honourable Member is entitled to declare his solidarity for the French drivers."
"I was brought up to believe, however, that solidarity is indivisible and I am sure he would want to extend his solidarity to those drivers from several nationalities now stranded in France and enduring very difficult conditions."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, we should not be blinkered about this dossier."
"Beyond the legal aspect, and I quite agree with you in saying how essential it is to defend freedom of movement at all times and in all places, I understand the pressure you have to put on the French government."
"But the real problem does not relate to the cases first and foremost."
"Mr Commissioner, listen to the French lorry drivers' cries of anguish, listen to the same cry of anguish from their company directors, many of whom are on a tightrope, or just surviving."
"The bottom line is that in this domain as in many others, Europe is not there."
"We cannot talk about a serious single market with such distortions of competition."
"Do not make us laugh with the tachograph of the future which will make it possible to verify that there has been no fraud, when people will work 45 hours in some countries and 65 hours in others."
"Mr Commissioner, it is very important to take the essential European initiatives at company and fiscal level now."
"I must say, not for the first time, that I agree wholeheartedly with the chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism in the strong emphasis he puts on the connection between fair competition and decent working conditions."
"That is partly the reason that inspires the enthusiasm of the Commission together with many Members of this House for getting a change in the law that will enable many transport sectors including road haulage to be included in the provisions of the working time directive."
"In addition, the replacement of the current tachograph with an electronic device which will be a much stronger safeguard against abuse or fraud will, I am sure, prove to be a significant advance both in ensuring fair competition within the sector in the Union and ensuring that drivers' social conditions are properly and humanely protected in the way that some do not have effective protection now."
"Madam President, the debate on the paralys of French roads is almost an annual ritual."
"Previous speakers have referred to a number of issues relating to freedom of movement."
"I think it is a good thing we have Commissioner Kinnock in this post at this time."
"Of course, I do not imagine Commissioner Kinnock leading a Commission cavalry charge to liberate the Lille-Brussels road."
"That is not his job."
"I do not see him as an agent of the repression of French workers in a latter-day ""Germinal' . However, I know him well enough to expect him to bring forward an ambitious initiative to ensure that a major Community social policy in the transport field can be implemented."
"Commissioner Kinnock can take this opportunity to launch such an ambitious policy."
"I am grateful to the honourable Member."
"As he says we are well acquainted with each other and I hope share mutual respect."
"I would simply use the opportunity of his question to emphasize strongly yet again that as an increasing number of people, including employers, come to understand the strong link between fair competition and efficient operation and decent social conditions, the environment in which the Commission is seeking to secure support for its initiatives in this sector is growing all the time."
"I hope, therefore, that we can look forward in the not-too-distant future not only to the publication of draft legislation but to its ready endorsement by the Member States and its application and effective enforcement everywhere."
"In my opinion the discussion is slowly taking the wrong direction."
"In fact we have to distinguish between two separate issues: rates disputes between employers and employees in France may be justified, but these regional strike negotiations cannot be allowed to lead to lorry drivers throughout Europe being taken hostage by an internal French conflict."
"This is quite unacceptable and the Commissioner has said as much."
"Mr Commissioner, you said you had been in contact with the French Government. You also said that the strike barricades were always changing and that time and again, despite the promises of the French Government, lorry drivers from Portugal, Spain, Germany or other Community countries were being held up."
"Hence my first question: when, Mr Commissioner, will you recognize the emergency - preferably within a few hours - and apply to the European Court for a temporary injunction against the French Government, to make them lift the blockade and allow free movement."
"My second question is this: according to article 5 of the Community law, every country is obliged to ensure the free movement of persons - this is what we are talking about here - and goods, and in my opinion when a country fails to do that it should be required to pay compensation."
"What are you going to do to protect the legitimate interests of employees and contractors?"
"I am grateful to the honourable Member for his question though not necessarily grateful for some of his conclusions."
"And this is for the very simple reason that I hear demands from a variety of quarters for instantaneous and forceful action by the Commission without a similar call for changes in the law that would provide the Commission with power to take such action."
"I must say too - and this does not necessarily include Mr Jarzembowski - that amongst those making the most intense calls for Commission intervention are many who would be the first to demonstrate outrage if the Commission were given powers to supersede the decisions and conduct of national governments when those governments were striving to uphold Community law."
"I must say that I hope there is no Member of this House who will try to give an exaggerated view or an inaccurate view of what the realities relating to the law are."
"The law says in plain terms that Member States have the responsibility of upholding the freedom of movement and unless and until it can be shown that they are negligent in that duty, the effective power of the Commission to intervene or to undertake proceedings against that government is very small, if it exists at all."
"I hope that is clearly understood."
"If there is a demand for change in the law then certainly people can make that demand."
"I ask them to test it against the political realities and the attitude of Member State governments and not simply against the atmosphere in this House."
"At the outset, like my colleagues, I want to thank Commissioner Kinnock for bringing us up to date."
"We appreciate it."
"The public perception is that the Commission has acted more expeditiously this time than it did the last time."
"That is the perception though it may not be the fact."
"Hopefully that will result in an early resolution of the problem."
"This dispute is costing the Irish economy £10 million per day in loss of trade."
"Each truck is losing £1, 000 per day."
"There are 400 Irish trucks caught up in this and you will appreciate that the vast majority of our goods are exported to continental Europe and the majority of those through France."
"It could have - and if it goes on much longer will have - a crippling effect on the Irish economy."
"It will put many truckers out of business and many companies also."
"We cannot afford that."
"We are proud of our record and we do not want to dent it as a result of this."
"The Commission has no legal power to intervene in such disputes unless there is neglect."
"I believe there is neglect as far as the last one is concerned for which none of the Irish truckers have been paid yet."
"The Commission said to me in the plenary session in September that he was doing his utmost to ensure an early payment."
"But nothing has happened."
"Cash flow is affected and I want to ask the Commissioner what he is doing in relation to the Irish truckers who have not yet been paid and what he is doing to help the Irish truckers in relation to this dispute?"
"I know of Mr Gallagher's close and continual attention to these matters."
"I am acutely aware - as, indeed, everyone must be - of the damage inflicted, not just upon the Irish economy but because of its particular situation and size maybe to a greater extent the Irish economy, by a dispute of this kind."
"One can only express regret at that and hope, as I do in every respect, that this dispute can be swiftly and satisfactorily brought to a conclusion."
"So far as compensation is concerned, I take the opportunity of this question to repeat points I have made before."
"There is no Community law of any description relating to the requirement to pay compensation for losses and damages incurred as the consequence of a dispute of the kind now going on in France."
"I am not in a position, therefore, to do more than I have repeatedly done which is to write to and speak to successive French transport ministers emphasizing the extremely strong feelings that exist throughout the Community and the justifiable demand that people have to be paid fair compensation in a manner originally promised for damages incurred in previous disputes."
"I hope the experience of this dispute will give further emphasis to the need to fulfil original promises."
"As recently as my letter to the French ministers last Tuesday, I took the opportunity of again repeating the need to ensure that an effective system was immediately employed for the payment of compensation in respect of losses in the last dispute."
"Madam President, free movement of goods cannot take place by crushing human rights."
"The road hauliers bear the entire responsibility for the current conflict because they did not respect the agreements reached in 1996, because they slammed the door on the negotiations launched by the government."
"The French lorry drivers refuse to be road slaves any longer."
"They are standing up for their wages and working conditions, but also for those of the other countries."
"I am delighted the Commission recognizes the efforts made by the French Government and its transport minister to reach an agreement acceptable to the wage-earners in the shortest possible time."
"I want to say here that any sanctions procedure, any vindictive intervention by the Commission could only inflame the conflict and compromise the efforts of the French Government to end it."
"Broadly speaking, it would be unacceptable for the Commission to seek to become, as some colleagues are regrettably demanding, the policeman of social movements."
"Instead of opposing the wage-earners of the population in a fierce competitive struggle, it is necessary to promote social harmonization at the highest level, to which the reduction in working time without loss of earnings in the excluded sectors could effectively contribute. This is an issue which should be urgently placed on Parliament's agenda."
"I would like an assurance that the Commission will give top priority to social measures, and indeed fiscal ones, rather than to social dumping as has been the case up to now."
"I am grateful to Mrs Moreau for the points she makes. As she will I am sure accept, whilst I have my own personal views as a citizen on the origins of this dispute, the Commission cannot, and indeed should not, offer a view upon the circumstances which produced this dispute."
"I am sure she understands that."
"My emphasis, as indeed the honourable Member's emphasis was, is on getting the speediest possible satisfactory conclusion to this dispute, both in the interests of international haulage throughout the Community and, indeed, in the interests of France and the French people."
"Everything I can do that will contribute towards that outcome, I will do and so will my colleagues."
"I trust that Parliament takes the same view and puts the same emphasis on getting a quick and satisfactory result rather than simply on the exchange of political views which, whilst interesting, are not necessarily a contribution to a productive outcome."
"On behalf of you all, I thank Commissioner Kinnock and all the speakers."
"I am infinitely sorry that I could not give the floor to all those who wanted to speak."
"There were a great many."
"But unfortunately, as you will have appreciated, we did not have the time."
"Child sex abuse"
"The next item is the report (A4-0306/97) by Mr Schulz, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on the communication from the Commission on combating child sex tourism (COM(96)0547 - C.0021/97) and the aide-mémoire on the European Union's contribution to reinforcing the prevention of the sexual abuse and exploitation of children (C.-0556/96)."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing a report which is complex and whose contents I believe are of significance for this Parliament, for the Commission, the Council of Ministers, the European Union and its citizens."
"They are of significance because we shall be discussing two matters today that will no doubt be controversial."
"Firstly, what measures has the Commission proposed, what can I add as rapporteur for this Parliament and what critical or positive contributions can I bring together?"
"Secondly, we have to discuss how we are going to deal with the phenomenon of child sex abuse, whether it is happening in domestic circumstances, within a personal context, or whether it is happening against a background of organized criminal activity."
"How are we going to deal with this phenomenon?"
"What can we as a society in Europe do about it that goes beyond the level of legal, penal and policing measures."
"How are we going to come to terms with the fact that a society is developing in the European Union which is increasingly and appallingly devoid of respect for life and in particular for children?"
"In its communication on how to combat sex tourism and child abuse the Commission analyzed the problems involved and proposed various actions and steps which it can take itself or take in association with the authorities of Member States and - as far as sex tourism is concerned - in association with travel companies."
"These measures - I should say straightaway - were very well thought out."
"The Commission has done some very thorough work."
"It has made some useful, interesting and balanced suggestions."
"The Commission has - Commissioner Papoutsis, many thanks to you and your colleagues - in a difficult period under difficult conditions, taken a very serious and well-balanced approach."
"You have undertaken - and I find this very admirable - to make the fight against child sex abuse a central concern of the Commission."
"I trust this will not be a case of mere words!"
"We have heard in the last few days that there may even have been incidents of sexual abuse in one of the Commission crèches, and I trust the Commission has been in a position, and will be in a position in future, to help throw some light on the mysterious goingson we have been reading about in the press recently."
"Our first concern in the debate about child sex abuse must be the protection and care of victims."
"In the many cases we have been seeing - and the number of cases is rising both in the domestic and criminal areas - we are dealing with two phenomena."
"First, there are perverted and abnormal people who will stop at nothing, at no foulness, to satisfy their basest instincts."
"These despicable people cause damage which can be summed up in one sentence: you can destroy a person without killing them!"
"What happens to children who are abused is difficult to repair in later life."
"Victims therefore need the full backing of society and that is why help for victims must be at the forefront of our efforts."
"Individual personal help is required for victims, in other words they must be given psychological and medical care so that a reasonably tolerable life is possible despite their traumatic experiences."
"This will need a great deal of work, the Commission has some good ideas for action and the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council should not hesitate to make funds available, generous funds."
"Apart from direct protection for victims, however, other protective action is needed."
"Society must be protected from further disintegration of their moral fibre, and this cannot be achieved through the criminal courts alone, although that is also necessary."
"I believe we need to do a number of things."
"We need national legal regulations fully defined for the classification and criminalization of specific acts of child sex abuse."
"We have to be clear what child pornography is."
"We need clear, precise rulings on what age is referred to, and we need clear precise regulations to make the production, sale and - let me say clearly, though I know it is a matter of dispute - possession of child pornography a punishable offence.."
"Why do I talk about possession, ladies and gentleman?"
"If there is a market for child pornography - and there is one - it can only be because there are consumers."
"I can only sell something if I have a buyer."
"If there is a booming market, then there must be people, carrying on veiled activities but in the midst of our society, who buy and use this kind of thing, and I would be so bold as to say the consumer in this case is as shameful as the producer. That is why I believe possession should also be an offence!"
"As far as sex tourism is concerned, and after all this is a modern form of slavery, the principle of extraterritorial criminal prosecution must be possible."
"Anyone going from here to a country in Asia, Africa, eastern Europe or wherever with the purpose of satisfying perverted needs by abusing children on the cheap and exploiting the poverty of families there, should be aware that he will also be brought to book at home, in the European Union, for this deed if it can be proved against him."
"So as far as I am concerned, criminal prosecution for offences committed outside the EU is vital."
"We should also consider prosecution of organizations which provide these travel facilities."
"At the same time we should be clear that the overwhelming majority of tourist organizations are serious-minded respectable companies, who take good care that they are not polluted by the type of custom I have described."
"To take steps against travel agencies, airlines and hotel chains which earn their money with sex tourism is as vital as cooperation with those who are keen to prevent it."
"Both channels must be pursued simultaneously by the Commission and Member State authorities."
"It is suggested that a European information system to combat child sex abuse be set up."
"We have also made a unanimous request to Commission, Council and Member States to press for the creation of a European centre for missing children."
"I consider this essential!"
"If it really is the case - and there seems to be considerable evidence - that the phenomenon is growing, that children are being traded commercially, that children are kidnapped not only in order to abuse them but to coerce them into prostitution and export them - we know from the debates on human trade that it includes children -, then we must take all possible steps from the use of EUROPOL to the founding of a European centre for missing children."
"The United States of America have shown a possible way ahead with their centre even if their example is not fully applicable to European circumstances."
"I have looked into many individual cases in working on this report."
"No one doing such work can be happy to see what human beings are capable of."
"In this connection I have also had to consider what responsibility must be taken by those acting in the public domain to protect society from such regrettable developments."
"I came to the conclusion that we cannot keep silent if we know that certain persons or institutions of the European Union are not fulfilling their responsibilities."
"I do not want to reopen the debate about the judge at the European Court of Justice, Melchior Wathelet, which was aired in public and also discussed by us in committee."
"It is not my business to interfere in internal Belgian affairs, but I am firmly convinced that in pardonning Marc Dutroux, now suspected of multiple child murders, the judge presiding at the European Court, Melchior Wathelet, was not meeting his responsibilities as Justice Minister in Belgium when he set Dutroux free."
"What is worse, he has not yet shown the remorse he ought to have for that action."
"Hence my remarks in the report: if we want the European Union to make it clear that there is no room in its institutions for those who fail in their duty, then we must act accordingly and say he should go!"
"It is not the European Court which should go, but one member of the Court who in my opinion is not fit to work there."
"This view is clearly shared by my colleague Raphaël Chanterie, who in his amendment to my point 29 largely accepted the text and content of my views, for which I am grateful."
"I think this amendment is extremely helpful, because it demonstrates that we are united in this Parliament in our refusal to accept irresponsibility."
"There are three sentences missing in this amendment which I shall add tomorrow in an oral amendment and that is the request to Mr Wathelet to step down."
"A society which loses respect for the most vulnerable in its midst, which is indifferent to the fate of its children, which looks on while children are turned into merchandise, which allows these sinister creatures, the scum and the dross of society, to assault its children before its very eyes; a society which starts to rot so that it is not even appalled when in some dark corner, in its shadowy underbelly things go on which defy belief, and then quickly turns back to the day's business - because that is happening at the moment in the European Union although the facts are known; a society which takes the easy way out by saying Dutroux is a Belgian affair, we do not have that kind of thing; a society which will not face the fact that it has signaled its own demise if it cannot protect its children from perverts; a society like that has got to take its courage in both hands and say that the fight against child abuse, the protection of children and the chance of a decent life from the day of their birth must be the common aim of all those in authority."
"If we can achieve that, my report will have made a contribution to a decent future for children in the European Union!"
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I believe the resolution before us deserves our assent because of the contempt it shows for paedophile acts and child sex abuse in general and for everything directly or indirectly connected with them."
"It deserves assent because it calls for severe punishment in terms of criminal law, court proceedings and police enquiries."
"Above all it deserves assent for its invitation to the Commission and the Member States to initiate a publicity and information campaign aimed at preventing and curbing sex tourism at key points such as airports, hotels and places where tourist trips are organized."
"Finally, its severe judgement on child pornography deserves assent."
"There is a problem of definition with child pornography and there is a more general problem than the one indicated in the resolution. If we do not wish to be thought hypocritical we should take into consideration the entire modern phenomenon of pornography as an industry which is capable of inuring people to it, leading them to seek ever more extreme expressions until they arrive at the terrible aberration of paedophilia."
"On the other hand, some aspects of the resolution are less persuasive from the point of view of the technical legal language used."
"I am sorry - and I am saying this as the representative of the Committee on Legal Affairs - that a number of technical formulations which could have been used to make it possible to prosecute offences committed abroad have not been taken into account in the text, but at the end of the day this is a secondary point."
"Perhaps excessive zeal and contempt have taken charge. For example, in paragraph 2, you cannot say, as it does in the Italian version, that paedophilia must be established as a criminal offence. it is not paedophilia that is to be punished but, obviously, paedophile acts."
"Paedophilia can also be an illness, so much so that again in paragraph 2, mention is made of psychiatric hospital for those who need treatment."
"There may be some overzealousness in paragraph 26 which states that persons who fail to fulfil their responsibilities to protect children satisfactorily should be removed from public and private office."
"Certainly, it is right to remove those who have committed paedophile acts and even paedophiles, but to apply the same measures to those who have not been sufficiently sensitive when attending to children's needs seems to me to be somewhat excessive."
"However, I have to say that my dissent as a lawyer mainly stems from paragraph 29, in other words the reference to the Wathelet case."
"In my opinion, it is not proper in terms of the law to use references to a particular case, such as the Wathelet case, in a resolution as important as this one and of such general relevance."
"In my opinion the principle of the separation of powers also comes into play here because, at the end of the day, the President-in-Office was acting as a judge of what happened."
"I do not think this is right either as it is impossible not to make a judgement ex ante , in other words at the moment at which the decisions were taken and not on what happened afterwards."
"Having been a judge myself and knowing how difficult it is to take account of the checks and balances which have to be used when the judge is looking into the future, I do not feel I can assent to paragraph 29, which I hope will be deleted or suitably amended."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proliferation of abuse and violence against young adolescents, the international trade in children and the increase in paedophilia are a cause of great concern and worry."
"All of this must therefore prompt the European Union to intervene in a practical way, above all by starting a campaign to make public opinion and tour operators aware of this issue, with the aid of the mass media."
"I agree with the Commission that it should be possible to give national courts jurisdiction outside their borders to deal with offences and criminal acts committed abroad, but Member States would also have to introduce provisions into their legal systems to combat sex tourism involving the abuse of children and ease their application by harmonizing specific cases in their criminal legislation, by recognizing them as offences and by imposing comparable penalties in their respective penal codes."
"The European institutions, with the agreement and collaboration of the Member States, must be adapted to ensure that the commercial exploitation of pornographic pictures of children, the incitement to indulge in sex tourism and child sex abuse are curbed within the territory of the European Union and to ensure that the range of sanctions also includes penalties which deprive offenders of their freedom, as has happened in France in the last few days."
"It is essential to stem the flow of this type of sex tourism from the Member States with the cooperation of all the countries in the European Union by seeking to create a common barrier against those groups and companies who are interested in providing child sex tourism."
"It is a serious omission that the communication from the Commission does not place any emphasis on the coordination of available community social and financial resources for the protection of the child victims of sexual abuse, identifying and promoting programmes to reintegrate them into society and provide them with special care, as rightly pointed out by Mr Schulz."
"Although praiseworthy, the new budget heading proposed by Parliament - B3-4109 N, for ECU 3 million - to promote programmes to combat violence against children, adolescents and women does however have a peculiar structure which does not correspond exactly with the action plan agreed in Stockholm."
"The institutions must therefore give some serious thought to this issue."
"I also think it is essential to create an ad hoc task force responsible for coordinating the Union's programme to combat child sex abuse in all the areas where it occurs."
"It is vital that as part of the fight against sex tourism the Commission should first and foremost take on the role of promoter in terms of pressing for and coordinating specific measures to dissuade and punish sex tourism of any kind, either in the tourists' countries of origin or in the countries which are tourist destinations, cooperating closely with the ONGs whose action in the field is indisputably effective."
"It is vital that tour operators and travel agencies are encouraged to adopt codes of conduct or self-regulation and distribute and publicize them, with the Community providing every assistance and contribution to ensure that these codes are adopted."
"In conclusion, the necessary measures must be taken with regard to those countries that still continue to promote what amounts to child abuse by establishing the coordination at European level which is currently lacking."
"European action with regard to the fight against child abuse must therefore be coordinated and painstaking but it should also be concentrated, otherwise this scourge will never end."
"Mr President, on 20 November 1989, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the first Convention on the Rights of the Child, which obliges the signatory countries to implement measures to protect children at national level."
"But, eight years on, children are not only still unprotected, but some are kidnapped, raped and murdered, and others are sold like common sexual goods for the use and enjoyment of unscrupulous and amoral customers."
"Are these children the victims of incompetence or lack of protection?"
"A large number of questions remain unanswered, and this issue concerns the fundamental values of morality and democracy."
"Today we are examining the report by Mr Schulz - whom I thank for his work and efforts - on the aide-mémoire on the European Union's contribution to reinforcing the prevention of the sexual abuse and exploitation of children and on the Commission communication on combating child sex tourism."
"We must deal with these two documents together, since they both reveal an undeniable truth: children are no longer legal persons, but commodities in the hands of paedophile abusers and sex and pornography merchants, about whom society knows little: they are masters of deception; their faces do not betray them; they are wolves in sheep's clothing."
"We want these degenerate and unscrupulous criminals and traders in child abuse to be identified, punished and obliged to undergo specific treatment which prevents them from reoffending."
"The Committee on Women's Rights is aware that a large part of the violence against, and sexual abuse of, women and children is committed within the victim's own family, and both our committee and Parliament's intergroup on the family and children, which I have the honour of chairing, call for and support the establishment of the Daphne budget line, which will promote cooperation with NGOs working in this field."
"We call on the Commission to take account of the importance of the family, since we know that, sadly, people first commit acts of cruelty against their own children."
"And if we fail to help them, those children who survive will in turn commit acts of cruelty in a cycle of abuse."
"Another form of sexual exploitation is so-called sex tourism."
"This is a misleading term, since it portrays as exotic holidays what are really trips abroad to abuse children. The organizers of these trips frequently have links with international criminal networks, and their customers hide behind the pretext that children in Thailand, Cuba or Brazil are more sexually mature than European children."
"But children are children - and need protection - wherever they are in the world."
"We must therefore apply the principle of extraterritoriality."
"We call on the tourist and advertising industries to adopt selfregulation."
"Not everything is acceptable in tourism and advertising."
"There is a trade worth billions of pounds, which is a scourge and a disgrace."
"Irrespective of the ECTAA's statement condemning this activity, it is essential for a register of companies and agencies which sell this product to be established, as well as for a binding code of conduct to be applied to advertising companies which use ambiguous pictures of children."
"In conclusion, I call on Parliament to condemn the hypocrisy in our society, and especially in certain countries which denounce pornography, paedophilia, violence and sex tourism, but do virtually nothing to eradicate them."
"We need the means to coordinate police action, registers of missing children and of convicted offenders, free telephone helplines, counseling for the victims, and education in schools and above all in the family."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Schulz most warmly on his excellent report, which I would like to support not only on behalf of the European Socialist Group, but also most particularly on behalf of the Flemish socialist delegation in all its aspects."
"This report has already caused a great deal of controversy in various countries, and particularly in Belgium even before being voted on."
"And it should not be any other way."
"First and foremost, the European train only really got going with regard to measures against child abuse following the Dutroux affair which unfortunately occurred in Belgium."
"But the fact that the tragedy of An, Eefje, Julie and Melissa and the other missing children happened in Belgium, does not mean that child abuse does not occur elsewhere in Europe."
"In the meantime it has emerged that the opposite is abundantly clear."
"Therefore measures must be taken in all European countries and in countries where it does not yet happen."
"There must, nevertheless, be coordination and European cooperation, particularly where international networks are operating."
"Secondly, it is clear that Belgium has also led the discussion in the Council on measures against child abuse - measures which can coordinate a standard approach to child abuse in all countries as the most scandalous violation of children's rights."
"The Belgian government did not obtain satisfaction in respect of all its requests in February in the Council."
"For example, it is most regrettable that a point that Martin Schulz just mentioned, that is, the possession of child pornography for personal use, was not considered by the Council."
"Nor was Belgium able to convince the Council at that time as regards the principle of territoriality and the abolition of double incrimination."
"But I am glad this European Parliament is able to support those proposals and place on the table a very strong package of measures on which the European Commission, the Member States and the European Council must all now get to work."
"Finally, ladies and gentlemen, there is the call for Melchior Wathelet to resign as a judge from the European Court of Justice."
"A call that we most certainly wish to support."
"It is correct that the former Minister of Justice is not personally guilty in the tragedy."
"It is also true that he acted within the then limits of Belgian legislation, which has fortunately been changed in the meantime."
"But it remains a fact that Melchior Wathelet bears the political and moral responsibility for signing the decision to release Diedres at that time."
"I note that the Group of the European People's Party shares this view."
"We are convinced that Melchior Wathelet does not have the moral authority that a European judge must possess."
"Anyone who maintains, as Mr Casini just did, that the European Parliament does not have the authority to judge the European judges, is perhaps right in the formal sense, but on the other hand, is refusing to acknowledge that the European Parliament must let its voice be heard when we are dealing with the authority of the European institutions."
"So we cannot do anything other than call on Mr Wathelet to resign, but I feel that only when everyone assumes their respective responsibility will there finally be room for respect for the rights of children."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it took an unspeakable tragedy in our country for the grim phenomenon of child abuse, which many of us dared not discuss a few years ago, to become not only a recognized problem, a monster to be combated, but a priority for the European Union."
"And even though it took that horror, I am glad to say that in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs we achieved - as I hope we will do in this House - unanimous agreement on all the measures designed to combat this scourge."
"I congratulate Mr Schulz, because his report contains a number of proposals which I and my group consider fundamental, and which, if presented a few years ago in some political groups, would not have had the slightest chance of being accepted."
"Having said that, I want to express one great regret. In this report, paragraph 15 of the resolution states that the European Parliament is going to call for, and this will happen tomorrow, an adequate increase in appropriations for the budget line concerning measures to combat violence against children, adolescents and women."
"Are you aware, ladies and gentlemen, that in the last part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, the request for additional appropriations made by the Committee on Civil Liberties and the Committee on Women's Rights, on a proposal from the Committee on Budgets, was not accepted?"
"So we, who will soon be giving lessons in morals to others, began by not applying our own resolutions."
"And when I asked why it was not possible to increase the appropriations for this line, I was told that all the appropriations had to be mobilized for employment policy."
"And that is true."
"But do you think unemployed people also lose the right to have their children looked after?"
"Do you think those who are not working now are not wondering if their children are at risk of being tomorrow's victims of paedophiles?"
"Before we give lessons in morals, we should start by applying the principles we seek to impose on others."
"My last point concerns the issue of Mr Wathelet."
"For myself, like the majority of my group, I believe, the question is not whether it is appropriate or even legitimate for Mr Wathelet to be a European judge."
"He is a European judge."
"As to whether he should stay, that is a question we can all ask ourselves, and we can all ask it of Mr Wathelet as well."
"The real issue is whether or not the European Parliament, which has legislative power in the European Union can ask for a judge's resignation."
"Mr President, my answer is no, even if that is hard to say, because democratic states are founded on certain basic principles, one of which is the separation of powers."
"Breaking this principle and allowing a parliament to set itself up as a moral authority to judge the judges represents a danger to democracy."
"We can all think what we like of Mr Wathelet, but Parliament calling for his resignation, Mr President, constitutes a political mistake and a sin against democracy."
"Mr President, we are all agreed that Mr Schulz has produced an excellent and comprehensive report on the measures which need to be taken to combat child sex tourism and to reinforce the prevention of the sexual abuse and exploitation of children."
"The assessment of the main problems and the measures proposed have been somewhat overshadowed by the substantial interest in paragraph 29 of the resolution."
"This paragraph calls on a judge at the European Court of Justice to resign his European post due to his earlier personal decision when he was Minister for Justice to permit the early release of Marc Diedres who is suspected of multiple child murders."
"I understand and respect the arguments of those who say that the European Parliament has no competence or right to make such a demand."
"Indeed, we are all being drawn into an internal political debate but as the rapporteur says, the consequences of the decision were indeed dreadful."
"There is a moral and political responsibility which cannot be swept under the carpet."
"It is very clear that the European Parliament does not have the power to dismiss a judge at the Court of Justice."
"However, we have a moral obligation to draw attention to this situation and we have to stand up and be counted on an issue as important as this."
"Many other important arguments and proposals are put forward in this resolution and my group is particularly pleased that at the outset of the report Mr Schulz stresses the decisive role of the family in ensuring the balanced development of children."
"The family should represent the safe haven for the child."
"In certain cases it is also where child abuse takes place and we know that children have been abused in schools and institutions."
"The veil of secrecy on abuse is now lifting and no country can take pride in what all too often children have been subjected to."
"The ultimate crime is to do nothing, to neglect our duty to protect children everywhere including those who are forced into child prostitution."
"We need a range of services to protect our children and an early-warning system to alert us to potential dangers."
"We are fifteen Member States with different traditions but working together we can help to close the door on child abuse and ensure there is no hiding place in the EU for child offenders."
"It is the least we can do for the parents and families of all the children who have been abducted, including Julie, Melissa and Lubna."
"We must break down legal barriers to harmonize those concepts of criminal legislation in the Member States which reduce our capacity to protect our children."
"We should try to harmonize the criminal offence of paedophile activities, the criminal offence of child sex tourism and child pornography and there should be comparable penalties for such crimes throughout the Member States."
"It is appropriate that data banks be set up at national level concerning persons found guilty of paedophile activities and everything possible must be done to make it easier for children to provide evidence to the court without fear."
"We must also support the setting up of the European Centre for missing children."
"The Centre for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington is an example."
"Every country should support the telephone helpline for children."
"I am highly critical of the way in which children can be abused for advertising purposes and I strongly hold the view that the rights of children must be respected."
"The case of the young British au pair who was found guilty in the United States of fatally injuring a child in her care has raised other concerns."
"There is a Council of Europe Convention on au pairs but very few countries have signed."
"Therefore, I call on the Council now to ask the Commission to draw up a European Union regulation on the role and duties of au pairs but, more importantly, on the duties and responsibility of the families who invite them into their homes."
"In conclusion, I want to emphasize what is said in paragraph 30 of the resolution: all those who have to take decisions which may affect the safety or well-being of children must exercise the greatest possible care and take the maximum precautions to safeguard and protect the interests of children."
"The blanket of secrecy has been lifted."
"We may not like what is underneath but we cannot fail our children."
"Mr President, I want to congratulate Mr Schulz on the report he has just presented."
"In it he proposes a position for the European Parliament to take on the struggle against one of the most odious forms of crime."
"What used to appear, even quite recently, in the ""news in brief' column of the papers, is today at the very heart of a crisis of confidence which has not been defused merely by charging the perpetrators of the crimes of which Julie, Melissa, An and Eefje are the best known victims."
"This crisis also contributes to awakening our consciences and highlighting all our responsibilities."
"That obvious statement is indispensable to progress the study of this report."
"That is why the Committee on Civil Liberties invites the European Union to come out in favour of a range of instruments for fighting sex tourism, which should be called, as the draftsman for the Committee on Women's Rights specifies in her opinion ""traveling abroad to abuse children sexually' ."
"Prevention, suppression, cooperation at all levels, and I would add, shouldering responsibility at all levels, form part of the range of methods for combating this scourge."
"The turn taken by this debate, well before its presentation in this House, means that the discussion revolves around a single point, point 29 of our resolution, which is a great pity, because all the points merit close attention."
"Point 29 calls on Mr Wathelet, judge at the European Court of Justice, ""to resign his post' in order to ""accept moral and political responsibility' for ""his personal decision, as the then Belgian Minister of Justice, to permit the early release of Marc Diedres' . The quotation is from the Schulz report."
"The amendment by Mr Nassauer and Mr Chanterie targets exactly the same result, but without explicitly specifying the word ""resignation' ."
"We should also remember that, in a report voted for by all the Members of the Belgian Parliament, the then Minister of Justice was held responsible."
"The decision to be taken is no small matter."
"Those who vote for the Schulz report are bound to be confronted with the duty to respect the principle of the separation of powers in all circumstances, and that is a weighty argument."
"Those who support the Schulz report are bound to be reproached with having created a dangerous precedent, to the extent that Parliament would thus have taken on the obligation to give its opinion on any future nomination that might be criticized in any way."
"That argument also weighs heavy on this debate."
"Nevertheless, both the argument on the separation of powers and that on the risk of creating a precedent which would mortgage the future action of the European Parliament, with all the consideration they merit, have just one weakness: taken in isolation, and even together, they do not facilitate the search for the attitude to adopt in the face of the crisis of confidence unleashed by the Diedres case."
"It is a crisis of confidence which spares nothing and nobody, and it is shaking a Member State of the European Union to its very foundations."
"This crisis also threatens to drag on needlessly if nobody will take the political responsibility."
"The majority of members of my group, on whose behalf I am speaking, and who support point 29 of the Schulz report, are doing so after mature reflection."
"They stress the fact that their position is rooted in the extremely serious and exceptional crisis of confidence unleashed in Belgium by the Diedres case."
"If they consider themselves bound to shoulder their responsibilities by voting yes, it is because others, in other circumstances, have not had the courage to shoulder theirs."
"First, Mr Wathelet, whom no-one is accusing of being guilty, but who is unanimously regarded as responsible by the parliament of the Member State of which he is a national."
"Next, the government of that Member State, which nominated him, could have relieved us of this painful debate by choosing a less controversial personality for the post."
"And finally, the Member States which ratified that decision."
"In fact, at the heart of the real debate lies the question of how we intend to contribute to the maintenance, indeed the re-establishment of the credibility of the institutions."
"This difficult response is not made without a high sense of moral necessity, and unfortunately it is impossible for us to make it without the risk that I have just mentioned."
"Mr President, the issue that we are addressing today represents one of the greatest scourges that modern society - and above all, of course, the public authorities, including the European Union - must tackle."
"No society today can maintain its dignity if it is unable to protect children from crimes such as child prostitution, sex tourism and child pornography."
"I should like to refer to the conclusions of the Stockholm World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children in 1996 and recall that the fight against this new form of slavery must embrace a number of fields: strengthened international cooperation, prevention, protection and the reintegration of the victims."
"In this sense, the European Union must contribute to combating the sexual exploitation of children, not only by applying the instruments at its disposal within the Community framework, but also by carrying out joint actions under the third pillar."
"The European Union must demonstrate its support for the enactment of national laws providing that citizens of the Member States who commit sexual crimes against children abroad must face the courts of their home country."
"We must also support the ban on the production and possession of child pornography and the establishment of measures to prevent new technologies being used for illicit purposes."
"Furthermore, prevention is essential."
"We must not forget that - although this problem has multiple causes - poverty and social inequality are undoubtedly determining factors, especially as regards child prostitution."
"Along with the specific promotion of information campaigns aimed at families and professionals in the education, health, legal and tourism sectors, therefore, we must not neglect the introduction of measures of a general social nature which reduce the possibility of criminals finding their perfect prey in conditions of poverty and social marginalization."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Schulz's report on child sex tourism and on combating sexual abuse and the sexual exploitation of children is a very detailed report."
"A whole series of measures are put forward."
"Measures that are aimed both at things that must happen within the European Union and things that must happen outside the European Union."
"In that regard, my group considers it very important to focus attention on the point that a strong argument is put forward for setting up a European Centre for missing children."
"This is something that has happened in Belgium in the meantime and it is important that initiatives are also taken at European level."
"We also feel with regard to internal measures for the European Union that it is important to focus adequate attention and support on the NGOs working to trace children and prevent sexual abuse of children."
"Because prevention beforehand is obviously better than cure afterwards."
"We believe it is particularly important to legislate for measures outside the Union, geared to double incrimination."
"Belgium has already adapted its legislation in that respect and I hope that other countries will follow."
"The battle against poverty is also very important here."
"I think Mr Deprez is absolutely right when he refers to the budget deficit that this Parliament must take responsibility for with regard to paragraph 15."
"I actually find it incomprehensible that there was no majority in this Parliament to accept it."
"My group voted in favour and we still hope that, thanks to the presence of this paragraph, it will be pursued in the future."
"With regard to the Wathelet affair, it is clear that the main responsibility lies with the Belgian government that nominated him again for this function."
"That is the main problem."
"But the fact remains that the European Parliament is not just a legislature, it is also a body that expresses political opinions and speaks out on what is politically desirable."
"We do that for the whole world, but we should not have to do it for Belgium."
"I find it quite natural for the European Parliament to grant itself the freedom to invite Mr Wathelet to tender his resignation, because that is the only logical conclusion."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully support the many excellent recommendations in this report."
"Our group fully supports this report, but as a group we do not agree with everything."
"I wish to refer to the paragraph that argues for the resignation of Mr Wathelet."
"Personally I support this request for his dismissal, that is to say, the rapporteur's view, although I do not believe the concept of moral responsibility to be relevant."
"I believe it would be far better to speak of political responsibility and only that. I mean political responsibility in the fullest and broadest sense."
"Opponents of the Schulz position argue about the separation of powers."
"This separation of powers is clear, but the separation of powers has nothing to do with the appointment itself, but with the integrity, objectivity and independence of acting as a judge after the appointment and during the execution of the mandate."
"Moreover, the Treaty states that judges of the Court must be chosen from persons whose independence is beyond doubt and who possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest judicial offices and in this specific case I have considerable doubts."
"You have to look for expert judicial qualifications with a magnifying glass here."
"And in other cases, for example purchases of weapons and environmental fraud, the same person is mentioned."
"The Belgian Parliament's committee of inquiry had the task of examining magistrate and stated in the Diedres case that the responsibility of the then Minister of Justice, Mr Wathelet, must be taken into account."
"The Belgian government said that because of this statement Mr Wathelet had been punished enough and he could therefore be a European judge."
"A top European post apparently in order to be rid of the man, perhaps even a sign of contempt for the Court of Justice which is thus regarded as some kind of political recycling machine."
"An argument against this paragraph states that Parliament should not have any authority with regard to European judges."
"May I refer you to the United States where judges of the Supreme Court are subject to hearings of Congress and the appointment of the chairman may or may not then be confirmed."
"In other words, can we, as it were, not go a step further and request further powers for the European Parliament."
"This affair could perhaps be a test case."
"Mr President, the level of civilization of a society is measured by the way it treats its children."
"Our century, which has swung between the red plague and the black plague, has not experienced too much of the brown plague, or of massacred childhoods."
"Today we are experiencing another form of baseness and contempt for childhood, its sexual exploitation."
"Yet should we be surprised, in an age of moral relativism, when the dictatorship of the politically correct prohibits talk of good and evil?"
"And in an age when money is king?"
"The Schulz report has the merit of dealing with this tragic issue realistically, as regards both criminal charges, notably for possession of paedophile pornographic material, and preventative measures."
"We have noted with satisfaction that the rapporteur has emphasized the vital role of the family and stability for the balanced development of the child and that he has drawn the attention of the Member States to the need to ensure protection of the family, given that it constitutes the most appropriate environment in which the natural aptitudes of children can flourish."
"The rapporteur congratulated the Commission on its action."
"I hope that, as a result, the latter will adopt the strictest measures against those responsible for the deplorable facts which have come to light in a crèche under its authority."
"We regretted the explicit mention of the case of Mr Wathelet, who, in our opinion, is not really relevant here."
"But nevertheless we will not hesitate to vote for the report by Mr Schulz, whom I congratulate wholeheartedly on the quality of his work."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by saying that this report on the Commission communication is a good document, which proposes appropriate measures."
"I believe that it sets out calmly and responsibly - as it should - the problems which we must tackle in order to protect children effectively from the scourge of sexual abuse."
"It contains another important achievement, in my view: it addresses the fight against the sexual abuse of children and the fight against child sex tourism in a single text."
"Clearly, we have a duty to protect the children of our own countries, our fellow citizens."
"But we also have a duty to protect children elsewhere in the world who are victims of the worst excesses of certain individuals, of things which we would not want to happen in our own societies."
"The report begins by rightly pointing out that the majority of cases of sexual abuse occur in the private sphere."
"And I wish to say, as an aside, that we must work harder and with greater imagination to prevent such cases, to protect children in the private sphere."
"However, the report also warns that certain taboos are being broken, and points out how the boom of sex tourism and child pornography in our society as something more or less tolerated, or at least widespread and more open than abuses in the private sphere, may have an effect on this."
"Children in other countries, who are supposedly different, whose cultures supposedly make them less victims, are being abused by citizens from our countries; and it seems that this may become increasingly tolerated."
"We must take stringent measures in this regard."
"I therefore wish to express my support for the measures proposed in this report, especially the appeals for the European Union to use the means that it can contribute: combating organized crime, setting up a centre for missing children, etc., as well as harmonizing Member States' legislation with a view to combating child pornography effectively."
"We must not forget that whoever sells or buys this material is abusing a child - a child who is not just a picture, but a real person who exists and has been violated."
"We must cooperate with the countries in which this trade takes place, requiring them to act appropriately, but also assuming our own responsibilities and acknowledging that the majority of abusers - of ""customers' , so to speak - are citizens of the developed countries."
"We must therefore be able to put them on trial in our own territory."
"This report seeks to step up the measures to ensure that children can live without fear and develop freely, with their rights and freedoms being respected."
"Finally, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur."
"Mr President, it took the tragedy of young girls raped, tortured and murdered in Belgium, for our society to wake up at last, for get rid of the taboo on talking about this at last, for us to recognize at last our responsibility towards children, downgraded to merchandise, and exposed defencelessly to the unbridled appetites of certain adults."
"A society incapable of protecting its children against such crimes cannot preserve its dignity."
"So we must say yes to the definition as a crime, in all national criminal legislation, of the sexual exploitation of children, both in Europe and worldwide."
"Yes to an effective European fight against these transfrontier criminal networks which sexually exploit minors."
"Yes to the creation of the European centre for missing children, help for victims and their parents, the establishment of appropriate databases."
"Yes to the strict medical and social monitoring of perpetrators of sexual crimes and the prolonged detention or permanent internment of recidivists."
"Yes to the condemnation not just of production but also of possession for personal use of pornographic material using children."
"Protecting our children must become the first responsibility of national and European politicians."
"I hope we will finally be up to the task."
"So it is wrong, if we consider all the positive elements, to reduce the Schulz report to its Wathelet paragraph, which has received so much media attention."
"The European Parliament has no power to remove a European judge."
"That is a fact."
"But it is also true that politicians must accept moral and political responsibility for their actions and not hide behind legal screens."
"Personally I find it quite incompatible for someone to reject this principle and sit on the bench of the Court of Justice."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Schulz on his proposal of a legal system for the protection of children from child prostitution, child sex tourism and exploitation."
"I would also like to congratulate the Commissioner, Mr Papoutsis, who, in spite of the restrictions in section six of the Treaty on European Union, is trying to construct specific proposals within the framework of the communication on the fight against child sex tourism."
"I would like to shed some light on one particular aspect of the problem, which concerns girls of 15, 16, 17, and 18 years of age who originate from the countries of central and eastern Europe and who we find today in all the pink networks that are flourishing in Greece, in Turkey, in Southern Europe, and in central and northern Europe."
"Whatever we may say about these countries at least we know that there used to be a network of creches, schools, athletic and cultural activities."
"Things have changed."
"Is this the world that we are going to bequeath to our children?"
"Poverty engenders exploitation and for that reason it is very important, firstly, that the problem is contained; secondly, that networks are broken up; thirdly, that we make use of the legislative mechanisms that Mr Schulz is proposing; and, fourthly, that we use programmes such as Phare and Tacis and other community programmes to get at the root causes of this problem."
"Mr President, as my colleague Jaak Vandemeulebroucke has just said, our group shares the determination expressed by the rapporteur to strengthen the resources of the Union and those of the Member States to prevent violence and, if it should unfortunately occur, to punish the perpetrators of violence against children, in particular sexual violence."
"The report, inspired by respect for children, contains important, firm and courageous proposals."
"Nevertheless, our group is divided on one point."
"This is point 29, implicating the former Belgian Minister of Justice, Mr Wathelet."
"Mr Casini and other speakers have also raised point 29."
"For my part, and here I am expressing the opinion of several colleagues in my group, this implication, designed to put pressure on Mr Wathelet to resign from his present position as judge at the European Court of Justice, is unacceptable."
"In the first place, point 29 expressly recognizes that Mr Wathelet did not commit any unlawful act under Belgian law in authorizing the release from prison of Marc Diedres."
"So we are outwith the field of criminal responsibility and criminal law."
"In the circumstances, the European Parliament is intervening in the area of Mr Wathelet's political and moral responsibility."
"As regards his political responsibility, it is difficult to see what the European Parliament bases itself on to implicate a Belgian minister."
"We are not the Belgian Parliament."
"As to our powers in relation to the Court of Justice and the choice of its members, we are forced to recognize that we have none."
"Certainly a reform of the texts on this issue can be proposed."
"Perhaps that would be desirable."
"But today there is nothing."
"Furthermore, we cannot transgress the principle of the separation of powers."
"There remains the moral responsibility of Mr Wathelet."
"This is the most delicate aspect."
"Ladies and gentlemen, are we a moral authority which can call anyone to account on moral grounds?"
"You will appreciate the extreme reticence I feel about stepping on to that highly dangerous ground."
"The law is solid ground, or at least more solid than morality, where subjectivity and passions are to be feared."
"The European Parliament, a political body par excellence, should beware of turning itself into an authority that judges a man as a function of a morality defined case by case."
"While we approve the Schulz report as a whole, you will understand why, in all conscience, some of us will not vote for point 29."
"Mr President, allow me as an Austrian to start by pointing out that the Commission's communication on which the report is based is incomplete in that, as well as the countries it names, Austria has also established the legal base making child abuse and child pornography committed abroad a crime with its Criminal Law Amendment Act 1996."
"I have already indicated how very concerned we are too about protecting adolescents in the context of the discussion about setting the age of consent in Austria."
"I am glad that at least in this instance protection of children is to be guaranteed up to the age of 18."
"Apart from some confusion about the terms child, youth, minor and junior, the steps proposed in the report are wholly to be welcomed."
"However, I feel insufficient emphasis has been given to the suggestion that this is not simply a phenomenon that can be dealt with by the machinery of criminal justice."
"There is no doubt that demand is also driven by the sexual freedom promoted for decades now and whose fruits have found their way via pornography-laden newspaper kiosks into Europe's criminal courts."
"Urgent changes are needed in this respect; but on the whole we agree with Mr Schulz's report."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the Commissioner, Mr Papoutsis, on the sensitivity and speed with which he responded to the desire of all of us to have a document so that we could begin debating this burning issue, which is of concern to thousands of citizens in the countries of Europe and across the globe alike."
"I would also like to congratulate Mr Schulz on his excellent report, because he analyses the problem with great political honesty and then, with political daring, he proposes measures to resolve this complex issue."
"Citizens are alarmed at the rapid increase in the number of victims of child sexual abuse and violence."
"But while citizens are alarmed, it is up to us to accept our political responsibilities and exert enormous pressure on the governments of the fifteen Member States to take appropriate measures, measures which will confront, I dare not say eradicate, but which will confront this problem."
"The poverty which blights many regions of our planet is the prime cause of the promotion of child sex abuse and child sex tourism."
"On the other hand, the economic development of our own countries and of certain categories of citizens within our countries, gives them the right to exploit, in the shape of these children, the poverty and want of these regions."
"For that reason I believe that the report of Mr Schulz is right to state that the consumers and viewers of pornographic material using children should be regarded as complicit in the act and should in fact be punished in the same way as the actual perpetrators."
"Moreover, I believe that, above and beyond the criminal punishment provided for by the criminal code, in the case of these economically motivated forces within this den of vice, there should also be punishment in society. This punishment in society will come about through revealing the acts of men who wish to be regarded as honourable in their own countries, in their families, and in their own surroundings."
"I agree with the proposals for changes in the criminal legislation of our Member States, such as severely punishing the use of minors in public or private entertainment of a pornographic nature and such as the severe punishment of the production, sale and distribution of pornographic material."
"However, and I insist on this point, the viewers and those in possession of this material should likewise be punished."
"I would like to finish by saying that this is a complex economic, political and social problem."
"As a precondition to our beginning to resolve the issue, there must be the political will of citizens both here and in our own countries to grapple with this den of vice, which is extremely powerful both economically, socially and politically."
"At some point or another we politicians will have to accept our responsibilities, and these responsibilities are not merely criminal."
"As politicians, we also have moral responsibilities above and beyond our criminal responsibilities."
"For that reason I believe that the Commission, without interfering in the internal affairs of Belgian society and of the Belgian system, quite rightly requests the resignation of the former Minister, not because he has a criminal responsibility, but because he has a moral responsibility towards those children who will never be able to grow up and take pleasure in life."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a year ago, barely two weeks after the horrific events that took place in Belgium became known, I spoke here in the part-session as the spokeswoman of the Group of the European People's Party to urge for measures to combat child abuse to be given priority at European level as well."
"I and my whole group are pleased that the Schulz report makes a vital contribution here and I wish to congratulate Mr Schulz."
"More specifically, I should like to make four points."
"First, the inclusion of the rights of the child in the Treaty has occurred indirectly by the mentioning in the Treaty of Amsterdam of the basic social rights and the provision in policy measures against discrimination on the basis of age, social exclusion, trading in people and offences against children."
"Secondly, our proposal to include funds in the budget for the prevention and combating of child abuse has been accommodated by the European Parliament in the 1997 budget."
"But we have heard from Gérard Deprez that for the 1998 budget a greater effort is expected."
"The third matter, that of curbing child pornography, child prostitution, child sex tourism and child sex advertising has been covered by a number of proposals in the Schulz report as well."
"Fourthly, a request to the Member States to ratify the Europol Convention quickly is gaining support both from politicians and from NGOs."
"Child abuse will of course not disappear in this way and it will not be possible to prevent it completely."
"However, others must also play their part here and assume their responsibility in sectors such as advertising, telecommunications, culture and tourism and from parents, educators and teachers to investigating judges, church leaders and members of governments."
"Because the concern for the welfare of the child is a task to be shared jointly by society."
"It is an ethical imperative."
"I should also like to refer to the amendment that I have submitted on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party together with my colleague Mr Nassauer on the former Belgian Minister of Justice, Mr Wathelet."
"Our opinions may differ about his political or moral responsibility."
"But Melchior Wathelet is a judge at the Court and therefore cannot be removed, except by unanimous decision of the other judges of the Court."
"So the amendment is not directed at Judge Wathelet, but at former Minister Wathelet, and invites former Minister Wathelet to draw the appropriate conclusion from his fatal decision to release Dutroux early."
"I would also ask those responsible for this excellent report: what are we actually dealing with today?"
"What is there to be done?"
"Do you want a framework against a certain kind of offence or do you want a sensational one man show trial against a former minister?"
"I am asking you how you envisage the situation?"
"Dutroux, Nihoul, Derochette and company or are you targeting Wathelet?"
"I regret that such a delicate case and such an interesting report is going to serve as a lever to play a personal or political game."
"Anyone who knows that the European Parliament cannot concern itself with his resignation and nevertheless urge his resignation is deceiving either himself or public opinion as well as the parents of the murdered and missing children."
"Anyone who sows this kind of political nonsense will reap a democratic disaster when it comes to the crunch."
"Even the leader of the Flemish Socialist Party, Louis Tobback, stands by the nomination of Wathelet as judge at the Court of Justice."
"He has said that he refuses to take part in what he himself considers to be a kangaroo court or lynch mob and opposes a ban on Wathelet pursuing his profession."
"Le Soir of Tuesday, 21 October has the headline: ""Tobback to Wathelet's rescue' ."
"So we can rightly wonder about and ask what the attitude of the Socialist Party and its members in the European Parliament actually is."
"To be perfectly clear, Mr President, I was also annoyed about what some people have called Wathelet's flight."
"Along with many other people I was absolutely against this highly political appointment."
"But this does not justify the European Parliament behaving like a kangaroo court without any hearing or any further investigation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, fortunately there are 33 other paragraphs that are worth taking the trouble to read and translate into policy measures and we support them."
"Mr President, the travel industry and tourism as growth sectors of the 21st century bear a heavy moral burden in this phenomenon of travel with the aim of sexually abusing children."
"Airlines, travel companies and travel agencies thus have an obligation to provide preventive information for potential offenders."
"The offenders are often men who have children themselves or who in their local community are good with children."
"It is possible to develop a conscience in these people and thereby restrain them."
"In addition to legal measures, therefore, all possible channels of preventive information should be explored by the public sector and commercial interests together."
"Male passengers traveling in aircraft to certain destinations should be given not condoms but informative leaflets explaining that young girls in Thailand or Africa are just children and helpless children at that!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentleman, it is almost exactly a year ago that we had a conference in Stockholm on the commercialized sexual abuse of children."
"It is good to see the Commission has followed this up with these proposals and that our Parliament is discussing the matter today."
"This excellent report is warmly to be welcomed so we can see how we are going to combat this abuse and what we can do to protect our children from it."
"I read in the Süddeutsche Zeitung this week that sexual violence among young people is widespread and that it is not only in the developing countries that young men go for drugs and alcohol or exert psychological and physical pressure to pursue their sexual interests."
"I believe it is not only a phenomenon in those countries, it happens here too."
"It is the fertile ground on which sex tourism and child abuse flourishes."
"The report we are discussing is now taking up those calls which have been made for so many years by associations like ECPAT and other women's groups for better protection of victims and the appropriately severe punishment of offenders."
"But the important thing is prevention."
"First, we must do everything in our power to ensure that victims do not become offenders in their turn."
"Secondly, sexual violence among youth must not turn into a taboo."
"Thirdly, the families of offenders should not be herded into a sort of clan. They need appropriate social and psychological attention."
"Indeed the Committee on Women's Rights has given this careful consideration and urged us not to concentrate only on sex tourism and paedophilia."
"That way we are shifting the problem onto abnormal and sick minorities."
"It is more important to face the issue of the power balance between the sexes in our society today fairly and squarely."
"We are all affected and we would urge everyone to address this problem for themselves and personally commit themselves to ensuring that children are no longer abused."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I also wish to congratulate Mr Schulz on his report."
"A large number of aspects of this report deserve to be underlined, so I shall not go into the Wathelet affair."
"I therefore wish to highlight only a small number of issues, especially the need for the European Union to establish increased coordination of the Member States' measures to combat the sexual exploitation of children."
"In this sense, the Member States must modify and revise their legislation in order to define more precisely crimes against sexual freedom, taking into account the age of the victims."
"In this task, we must not forget the importance of protecting the rights inherent to a person's dignity, especially the right to the free development of the personality, and the right of children to sexual integrity; for, lacking the necessary character formation, children can be manipulated and - frequently irreparably - harmed."
"I am able to inform the House that Spain has already begun to modify its penal code along these lines."
"This modification is currently being debated in the Spanish Parliament and will probably enter into force in January of next year."
"I also believe that it is enormously important to point out that, in order for legislative measures to achieve the desired effect, there is, in most cases, a need to improve child care, coordinating the implementation of human and material resources to a greater degree."
"We must be aware that when a child needs help, that help must be urgently provided, without the effective resolution of each and every one of his or her problems being held up by red tape."
"I also wish to draw attention to the amendment which we tabled on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, concerning the identification of minors at border crossings."
"As a Member of Parliament, I have received a considerable number of complaints concerning the violation of minors' rights in the form of the abduction of children and adolescents and their illegal transport across international borders - actions which frequently end in the trafficking or sexual exploitation of minors in one form or another."
"In view of this situation, I believe that it is necessary - as I stipulate in the amendment - to step up the guarantees of legal protection by including new physical means of identifying minors in public documents, as well as in the model Community passport."
"For all these reasons, Mr Schulz, I hope that you will support this amendment."
"Mr President, the rapporteur did not have the easiest of tasks. He had to respond with practical measures to an international issue like that dealt with at the Stockholm Conference, to a series of common actions by the Council and to timely communications from the Commission."
"Above all he had to respond to the shock we have all felt at the Dutroux case which has given rise to a series of distressing reports and has pointed up a certain underestimation of the problem in our countries as well."
"It is always difficult to respond to distress and frustration with reasoned policies and rational proposals."
"The rapporteur has chosen a method I can agree with."
"He has made use of this tension to confront the most pressing and risky issues. Mr Deprez is right."
"At another time we would not have reached such a full consensus on identifying the offence of committing paedophile acts, the possession of pornographic material which exploits children, the age of consent for sexual maturity or the problem of extraterritoriality."
"A certain type of pseudo-culture which was stirring even among ourselves would perhaps have prevented us from taking courageous decisions."
"Today, however, we have achieved a consensus which is even more marked than that achieved in the Council of Ministers."
"In our respective countries we are taking part in changes to legislation in this very area."
"However, in the report I also read of attention to the value of children in themselves, in their rights, and it is in light of this value that I interpret paragraph 27, which as far as I am concerned deals with political responsibility, as being much better than paragraph 29."
"I believe that this political responsibility - let us be frank - does not just apply in the case of children but in this aspect finds an example which due to the sensitivity of its contents is certainly a practical one."
"I have heard from Belgian friends and friends in the European People's Party that there is an amendment. I believe that we must reach total agreement on this subject, as well as on the rest of the report."
"I would remind the House of one fact: in 1993 under the Belgian Presidency, it was Belgium that put forward five recommendations to combat the trade in sexual exploitation, five recommendations that were rejected, not by Belgium, but by the entire European Union."
"Let us hope that we do not need any more victims!"
"Mr President, I will help you and tear up my speech - I know that you want us to get on with this."
"I agree with the main thrust of the report;"
"I know that there have been particular problems in Belgium but we all know this is a problem that is not confined to one country and cuts across national boundaries."
"There is a question of what should we do, and what we can do, at a European level."
"I certainly believe that the report sadly does not give enough emphasis to what needs to be done to control the Internet."
"There was a good report last month; we want to see that report by Mr Whitehead put into effect as quickly as possible."
"There is a problem of missing children across Europe so the missing children bureau is an extremely good idea."
"I take Mr Collins' point that we need some regulation of control on au pairs."
"There are humorous stories in Britain of Swedish au pairs; no doubt there are humorous stories in other parts of Europe about British au pairs; there needs to be regulation."
"Finally, I am one of those Members who believes in the separation of powers, Mr President."
"I do not intend to allow my political mandate to be used to interfere with the judges' judicial mandate."
"In English we say 'two wrongs do not make a right' ."
"Mr President, I am glad the last speakers have brought the discussion back to the point that really concerns us, one of the saddest aspects of our society, the abuse and exploitation of children for sexual purposes."
"And now we learn that an industry has grown up around it, an international business, a pornographic industry in which large sums of money are made illegally by exploiting the weakest members of society."
"It is almost a bigger business than the drugs industry."
"We must move with all the forces of the law against this international trade in our weakest brethren."
"So I welcome the discussion on these points relating to the fight against child abuse."
"I am delighted that a package has been worked out which involves international cooperation, for only international cooperation will be successful in this case."
"I should just like to take up a few points which seem to me important."
"The first essential is harmonization of the law."
"If this doesn't happen, we cannot deal with these matters internationally as criminal offences."
"In particular I feel it is very important to introduce the principle of extraterritorial application."
"We have already introduced it in our country, in Austria, and I would like to see it introduced as a possible solution throughout Europe."
"I welcome the fact that other steps are to be taken as well, such as the safe custody of repeat offenders and international searches through the Schengen information system."
"I am particularly glad that it is intended to apply the profits from this business to the care of victims."
"All in all, this is a package of measures which I hope will find the support of the whole Parliament in the interests of the weakest members of society, in the interests of our children!"
"Mr President, I know you will be bringing the hammer down in exactly 60 seconds, but just another 10 seconds please."
"Four things."
"First, I would like to thank all those who have taken part in this debate, especially my co-rapporteurs, for their valuable contributions."
"Secondly, I forgot to add that my colleague Laura Esteban Martín has tabled an excellent Amendment, No 3, which I support, although the voting list states otherwise."
"I shall make that clear before the vote tomorrow."
"Thirdly, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr Deprez, whose cooperation over many months has been superb."
"Much of what is contained in this resolution is a combined effort."
"That he had to defend Mr Wathelet so vehemently throughout these months, and again today, is understandable in view of his personal circumstances."
"Fourthly, if there was still any doubt that Mr Chanterie was only concerned with internal Belgian politics, then this speech has put paid to that."
"Personally I am not interested in the internal politics of Belgium, what interests me is the judge at the European Court."
"So I will close with remarks along the same lines as Mr Chanterie."
"The place where Julie and Melissa came from is 40 kilometers from the place where my children live and the border between Germany and Belgium is open."
"They might easily have been my children."
"So it certainly does affect me, Mr Chanterie!"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11a.m."
"Common fisheries policy after 2002"
"The next item is the report (A4-0298/97) by Mrs Fraga Estévez, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the common fisheries policy after the year 2002."
"The rapporteur, Mrs Fraga Estévez, has the floor."
"Madam President, of all the issues that will affect the fisheries sector in the very near future, the reform of the common fisheries policy after 2002 is undoubtedly the most important."
"The significance and implications of this reform were apparent throughout the intense debate which occupied the Committee on Fisheries for many months, the fruit of which is the compromise text which I am now submitting to the House for adoption."
"Clearly, this compromise text could not include each and every aspect that certain Members wished to be incorporated, nor, of course, the most extreme and hostile positions."
"Compromises are the result of a search for consensus on the most important issues, and, from the very beginning, it was my intention in drafting this report to avoid dogmatic positions and identify the inconsistencies, shortcomings and obsolete aspects of the current CFP, in order to be able, on that basis and with the help of all my colleagues, to present the Commission and the fisheries sector with an overview of what is not working in the current CFP and to suggest possible ways of making it more realistic and effective."
"As I said, not everyone agreed on either what is wrong or what are the most appropriate solutions."
"Nevertheless, I should like to express my thanks to the members of the committee, who, despite the disagreements and different political views, worked together to try to reach agreement on what should be the guiding principles of the future CFP."
"The fruit of that work is this compromise text, which - although it does not fully incorporate everyone's views - reflects, I believe, the main concerns of the majority."
"Amongst these I would mention:"
"the consensus that the current CFP has serious fundamental defects which impede the sector's development; -the recognition that the Community fleet is oversized and that its capacity needs to be matched to resources, a large proportion of which, moreover, are under serious threat; -the need for the new CFP to be based on an integrated approach which considers the industry and its needs as a whole, with clear and consistent rules for the protection of resources and an overall view of the implications of the measures for the marine ecosystem as a whole.The compromise text also reflects the Committee on Fisheries particular concern for the social repercussions of the measures taken; the need to safeguard economies most dependent on coastal fishing, maintaining the 12-mile limit; the need to consult the sector and involve it in decisions affecting it; and the need to provide the CFP with a genuinely decentralized management system."
"Furthermore, the report proposes the establishment of a genuine Community control policy, calls for urgent rules for harmonizing the system of offences and penalties throughout the Member States, and considers the future possibilities of aquaculture and the processing industry, whose ability to give value added to fisheries products must be taken into account, but whose viability depends on an in-depth reform of the common organization of markets."
"With a view to ensuring the future competitiveness of the Community fisheries sector, the report puts forward a number of proposals which must be studied and examined, such as the possible ownership and transferability of fishing rights, the application of the principles of efficiency and profitability to the fisheries sector in the same way as to every other sector, and the full incorporation of the industry into the single market system."
"Some of these proposals may be more feasible than others, but they are all the product of serious and in-depth deliberations."
"However, Mr President, the real political importance and the greatest merit of this report lies in the fact that Parliament has taken the initiative of considering what the European fishing industry should expect from the 2002 reform, has taken the first step towards discussing with the sectors concerned what they expect from the reform, and has made clear to the Commission the need to start immediate in-depth negotiations with all the parties involved with a view to tackling the current CFP and everything that forms part of it, with all its inconsistencies and defects."
"In this respect, and with regard to the Commission, I cannot but regret the absence of the Fisheries Commissioner, Mrs Bonino, who only let it be known at the last minute that she would not be attending - which says a lot for the concern and interest that she has been showing in fisheries issues recently - in a debate of this importance."
"In any event, everyone must fulfil their responsibilities."
"The future common fisheries policy must be the product of a debate between all the parties concerned - a debate which must take us into the year 2002, in order to ensure that the European fishing industry has a future, and whose results may be very different to the proposals put forward today."
"Be that as it may, if those proposals are realistic and effective, then the European Parliament will have accomplished its task with this first, courageous step."
"Mr President, I think it is very important that Parliament is discussing this report initiated by the Committee on Fisheries in the part-session, a report that takes account of the debate now taking place at international level on the reform of the common fisheries policy."
"The protagonist in this debate is Parliament which is the first of the Community institutions to bring forward proposals and forecast the prospects for reforming the fishing industry."
"This detailed and serious forecast by Parliament takes account of some important principles which were emphasized in the document: first, the principle of relative stability which was established when two important countries, Spain and Portugal, joined the Union; secondly, the principle of maintaining fish stocks at an environmentally compatible level, bearing in mind that in this regard it is not only up to the European Union, that is, the Community institutions - Parliament, Commission and Council - to intervene but it is also up to all the international organizations to order the structures and efforts of the fisheries sector."
"Resources are under severe strain."
"They are being over-exposed: we have to make sure they are conserved but we also have to make sure that the European Union maintains its resources within countries and above all performs a key role in the field of international agreements as well."
"In this connection, environmental compatibility is very important, just as the role of the European Union is important as a party to international agreements, agreements that provide for the development of an equal relationship with third countries which will permit the growth of manual activities and will not subject these countries to virtual acts of plunder by the European Union or other, more developed, countries."
"Undoubtedly, therefore, the environment and international relations are important but there is also another aspect within the common fisheries policy which we consider relevant: the social aspect."
"It is true that this sector is in crisis and has problems."
"It is a sector which counts for little in terms of gross national product but it is still very important and we are perfectly well aware of the fact that fishing does not just have an economic value but also a social and cultural value."
"Fishing involves artisans, it involves industry and it involves cooperatives."
"So, when we talk about common fisheries policy we should also be thinking about economic activities which are based on the observance of working hours, on non-exploitation, on the possibility of workers having safe conditions in which to use the tools of their trade, since, as we know, fishing is one of the industries which presents the greatest amount of hazards at work compared with other activities."
"For this reason, the guidelines we have established take account of the great social option, an option in which we want to uphold the European model against other models - the United States, south east Asia, etc."
"In the fishing industry the European social model must be fully upheld also because fishing is one of the sectors in which regional and local agreements have a historical, ancient tradition, have implications which are in some respects anthropological and therefore maintain a very direct relationship between the management of resources, their exploitation and the ability to find a place in the market."
"I believe this is the first report to take account of all these factors. I therefore congratulate the rapporteur and I can state unequivocally that the Socialist Group will support it."
"Mr President, this is an own-initiative report of the Committee on Fisheries on the fisheries policy after the year 2000."
"The so-called blue Europe was created in 1983 for a period of twenty years and it therefore expires in 2002."
"The idea of this report was to present some suggestions as an initial basis for discussion on reformulating a fisheries policy."
"In fact we have to conclude that so far no one has really given much thought to a future fisheries policy."
"That is why this report is particularly important."
"It is not of course the last word of the European Parliament on this subject."
"The central problem of the fisheries policy is the catastrophic stocks situation along with the fact that the fishing fleet is too large."
"Almost all the points in the own-initiative report are concerned with this fact."
"So what does the report suggest?"
"As regards the problem of excess fleet capacity, it demands that fleet strength is adjusted to existing stocks with a view to creating a more balanced situation."
"The social aspects of this must of course be taken into consideration at the same time."
"Secondly, in order to maintain stocks, it asks for a system that must be simple and efficient."
"The annual total catch must be agreed on the basis of biological, economic and social factors, and fishermen themselves must be more involved in these considerations."
"In allocating the total catch weights, the principle of relative stability must continue to apply."
"That is exceptionally important."
"Thirdly, restructuring of the fisheries policy must continue to be supported to ensure a socially acceptable solution."
"Fourthly, a control policy is an indispensable part of the fisheries policy if we are going to have a useful stocks policy."
"So we considered it enormously important that the report was clear on this and that minimum standards in Member States, an increase in control resources and the extension of existing controls on the production of third countries had to be demanded."
"Fifthly, as regards the policy on external resources, the report draws attention to the principles already agreed by the European Parliament."
"I would, however, have liked to see a clearer statement in the report that the European Commission will continue to be solely responsible for negotiating agreements with non-EU countries."
"In my opinion it is absolutely essential that the European Union acts in unison in its foreign and foreign trade policy."
"We realize that this report represents a compromise, but one which we as a section within the European People's Party are happy to accept."
"We would like to express warm thanks to the rapporteur Carmen Fraga Estévez, who has tackled a very difficult job extremely well!"
"Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur on the considerable work that has been done and the conciliatory spirit Mrs Fraga Estévez has shown in reaching a compromise."
"But I would like to put the debate a little in context."
"What is involved?"
"By 21 December 2003, the Commission has to present a report on the general situation in fisheries, with the Council able to decide on any necessary adjustment, notably on two points: restrictions on fishing in the zone known as the ""Shetland box' , and renewal or otherwise of the derogations system for non-Community twelve-mile zones."
"The Committee on Fisheries has studied the matter and two totally different points of view have emerged."
"One advocates liberalization of conditions of access to Community waters, with individual allocation of fishing rights, transferable on the market; the other proposes renationalization of certain Community waters, reserving them to the bordering states."
"We support neither of these two points of view, because it seems to us essential to preserve the principle of relative stability, by which each country has a fixed percentage of total annual catches, and by which each country itself distributes the fishing rights to the fishermen."
"We also think it is necessary to maintain the current system, which reserves the twelve-mile zone to small-scale local fishermen."
"Because what are the most ardent reformers basing themselves on?"
"On a peremptory and unsubtle assessment, according to which the CFP has been nothing but a failure."
"Of course everything is far from perfect in the organization of European fisheries, but that does not mean it can be declared a complete failure."
"In any case the efforts and modifications which need to be introduced should bear, in our opinion, on the market sphere and the controls, as the shortcomings currently observed in these domains are certainly the main source of the difficulties in the common fisheries policies."
"Mr President, I also think it is very sad that the Commissioner is not here today for what is probably the most important debate in the fishing sector over the next few years."
"As far as the Fisheries Committee was concerned, one of the most important things was that Parliament as an institution should be ahead of the other institutions in the debate within the European Union to lay down its own views of what the Common Fisheries policy should be like after the year 2002 and what form it should take."
"Here we have a comprehensive report."
"I would say to other parliamentarians that we must not think of fishing as being marginal; what we are talking about here is the wider marine ecology."
"The oceans cover some two thirds of the earth's surface and European fleets cover most of that area at some point."
"One of the most important things that comes out when studying the CFP is that on the whole it has consistently failed."
"It has failed in its conservation goals, it has failed to maintain jobs and it has also failed largely in the area of international agreements in defending third countries and their stocks and developing their industries."
"That has been partly because of the over-centralization and the politicization of the common fisheries policy."
"The result is that the policy itself is not respected by the industry;"
"I think that is true throughout the European Union."
"As we have seen on many other reports in the Fisheries Committee there has not been the political will among Member States to enforce it."
"We have tried to solve that by putting more regulations on existing regulations, with little additional affect."
"What does that tell us?"
"I believe that there is a simple message here."
"First of all that we cannot, under any circumstances, carry on as we are now."
"That means that a fundamental reform of fisheries policy is essential."
"So how have we to move ahead?"
"I would say that there are two keys to finding a way forward."
"First of all, it is to have clear objectives - I do not believe we have those at the moment."
"They are: a sustainable exploitation of fish stock; long term prosperity for the fishing industry and those communities that are dependent on it; supply to the consumer with good quality fish at acceptable prices - we often forget the consumer side of this industry - and the long term protection of the broader marine environment."
"More importantly, we must have a policy that will actually work and there we can learn from experience elsewhere."
"First of all we can only successfully manage fish stocks by having a coincidence of the areas in which they are managed with the management regime itself and the range of those fish stocks."
"The answer to that is regionalization."
"We also have to involve the stakeholders' bottom-up process and really give them power over their own industry."
"And we have to give fishermen the right over their stocks to some degree."
"That means the end of common access and common resource."
"In this respect I believe this report is not short enough, is not concentrated enough and although it is worthy in many areas, it has compromised too far and fails to deliver fully in these key areas."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately I am unable to address Commissioner Bonino, so I shall address the Commissioner present."
"In adopting this report, we shall be defining the main policy guidelines that - in the view of Parliament, at least - the future common fisheries policy must follow."
"The fishing industry is especially important in social and employment terms in a large number of European regions, although it has been increasingly neglected - notably in the Community budget - in comparison with other economic and financial interests, which are given preference, but which do not have the social relevance and importance that this sector has, and will continue to have, in our society."
"The general policy guidelines set out in this report are positive and will help to modify certain profoundly negative aspects of the current common fisheries policy."
"The text submitted for adoption by the House includes many of the amendments which our group tabled, and takes account of a large number of other ideas which we upheld throughout the long months of debate."
"In this regard, I should like to highlight the following."
"The report recommends that the waters within the 12-mile territorial limit should continue to be for the exclusive use and management of the coastal Member State concerned. This is a proposal which we put forward, and of which we are proud.-The report stresses the need for a clear distinction to be made between small-scale local fishing and large-scale commercial fishing."
"Furthermore, it calls for the improvement and harmonization of occupational safety standards, the reduction in the amount of time spent at sea, and the improvement of social security and protection for fishermen."
"Also in line with our proposals, the report stresses the need for the active participation of fishermen and their organizations in the definition, implementation and decentralized management of all policies relating to the fishing industry, from the decisions concerning closed seasons or the use of new fishing gear and techniques, to the establishment of TACs and quotas and the formulation of market policies aimed at guaranteeing sustained incomes for producers.-As our group proposed, the report calls for the introduction of an active policy to conserve resources and protect marine habitats, with adequate budget appropriations for scientific research and the transparent and generalized control of decision-making.-Finally, and also in line with our proposals, the report recognizes that the rebalancing of fishing capacity and resources must not be carried out at the sole cost of a general cutback in vessels.This is a positive report, which creates justifiable expectations in the sector."
"Nevertheless, we must not celebrate too soon: it is only a first step."
"From now on, it is necessary for fishermen, their organizations and the industry in general to exert influence at national and Community level to ensure that these guidelines are approved by the Council and the Commission."
"In conclusion, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Fraga Estévez, on her work over the last few months, and on her efforts to achieve consensus on the report that we shall be voting on tomorrow."
"Mr President, I have listened carefully to what the rapporteur has said but I have to confirm that as far as the Greens are concerned the content of the resolution, albeit the result of compromise, is not yet acceptable."
"The issue of the common fisheries policy after 2002 is a highly significant subject for the European Union and therefore also very controversial."
"There is no doubt that it is appropriate to maintain a common fisheries policy after 2002, but the main objective for us Greens is to ensure that fish stocks are preserved and I believe this is a common sense objective because if there are no fish in future there will be no fishing either."
"Currently the fishing industry does not allow the fish to complete their normal reproductive cycle which reduces fish stocks and brings about a crisis for the industry itself."
"It is therefore beneficial not only for the environment but for the fishing industry as well to question fishing methods that affect the actual survival of fish in order to guarantee an acceptable future livelihood for the fishermen."
"Even if it is more difficult, what is needed is a genuine reform of fishing which has as its objective the sustainability and the maintenance of fish stocks."
"However, the resolution under discussion does not significantly change the way the current common fisheries policy is imposed even though important innovations have been announced."
"For example, the precautionary principle is rightly being upheld but in the absence of an adequate definition this can be interpreted differently in different countries."
"For this reason we have presented amendments in an attempt to clarify the part of the report that refers to the environment and the preservation of fish stocks."
"We also think that the fisheries agreements with the ACP countries in particular should be revised so as to provide sufficient scientific and technical cooperation in the monitoring and control of resources to guarantee their conservation."
"There are, however, other aspects of the report that merit detailed discussion."
"A large part of the debate held in committee concerned the possibility of the common fisheries policy continuing to be an exception to the principle of free access to Community waters."
"We believe that the problem of access is a major problem but one which should take second place to issues such as conservation, actual control over fishing, the adoption of suitable technical measures and a significant reduction in fleet size consistent with the maintenance of fish stocks."
"Mr President, I was a little bit surprised to hear the rapporteur introduce the report by saying that the most radical ideas were not included, quite the opposite."
"It is, in fact, my group the radical group who are trying the conserve what we have of our common fisheries policy and her ideas are not only radical but to my view reckless and dangerous."
"I can think of nothing more destabilizing for Europe than the prospect of fish wars right across the European waters, not just in the waters that are currently covered by this CFP but in the Baltic and the Mediterranean."
"I have a very real concern that in the pursuit of this obsession about the free market and economic efficiency, we could be faced with a very destabilizing situation indeed."
"It is quite significant that the common fisheries policy recognized quite the opposite of what Mrs Fraga said, namely that fisheries is not any old economic activity but, quite the contrary, it is a very specific and unique form of economic activity and it has to remain so."
"It is too important to be thrown to the mercy of the free market."
"The common fisheries policy is not a temporary derogation from the principle of freedom of access which will automatically lapse at the end of 2002."
"That is a vital point of disagreement between the two sides in this debate."
"Those of us who want to conserve and build on the CFP, with all its faults, are confronted with the ultimatum that it will all lapse and there will be a free-for-all after 2002."
"That is highly alarming to the fishing industries, not just of Scotland which I represent, but right across the European Union from the Baltic to the Mediterranean."
"Relative stability, which I was glad to see a number of colleagues stressing, is not really made a centre and cornerstone of this report in the way that it is of the common fisheries policy."
"Relative stability is, of course, the only thing that makes the CFP semi-acceptable to the fishing industry at the moment."
"I took careful notes here that colleagues Baldarelli, Langenhagen, and d'Aboville all stressed the importance of relative stability."
"I totally concur but that is not the thrust of the report, it is very much a secondary stress."
"I, therefore, want the House to oppose this report for the following three reasons."
"First of all, it undermines conservation."
"Conservation is incompatible with economic efficiency and the operation of the free market."
"Secondly, it will undermine the coastal communities which depend on the fish offshore, their way of life and their viability."
"Finally, and this should concern everyone in this House, even if they are far from the sea, it will undermine support for the European Union and give added fuel to those who say there is only one way out of this desperate Common Fisheries Policy and that is to leave the European Union."
"We must resist those siren voices and we must resist this report."
"Mr President, but in the absence of Madam Commissioner, it was a good idea to prepare an own-initiative report on the future of the CFP after 2002 based on an uncompromising balance sheet of the successes and failures of twenty years of blue Europe."
"A first draft was presented by Mrs Fraga Estévez at the Committee on Fisheries. It gave rise to very lively debate."
"It was unacceptable."
"Why?"
"Because its ultra-liberal approach may have suited one Member State, Spain, but not the others, whose national fisheries would have been fatally demolished by it."
"The first proposals in fact challenged the principle of relative stability by which each country has a fixed percentage of the annual catches which it distributes itself, to the benefit of a system of individual transferable allocations of fishing rights, opening the door to a generalization of the perverse practice of quota-hopping and, in the end, to a possible disappearance of whole national fleets to the benefit of the coastal power which already has the most overmanned fleet."
"To this challenging of national quotas was added absolute priority for the processing sector, wrongly regarded as a replacement activity for the decrease in the number of fishermen, and the absence of any effective measure of support for the market in fresh fish, essential however to the life and business, including tourism, of our coastal regions."
"Finally, the palliative character of the present CFP was further reinforced by an appeal to new and generalized drastic reductions of fleets - always adjustment by scrapping."
"Mrs Fraga Estévez accepted the fundamental undermining of her initial report with a good grace."
"A number of improvements were made to it."
"But the final result remains unsatisfactory as some of our amendments were not taken into account."
"Three points seem absolutely essential to us."
"The first point is that it is necessary to maintain, without equivocation, the principle of the relative stability of the national quotas, and assure equitable and effective control of the TACs and quotas."
"Secondly, it is indispensable to maintain the non-communitarization of territorial waters, within the twelve-mile limit, which must remain reserved for small-scale coastal fishermen."
"Thirdly, it is essential for the CFP to become a policy of encouragement and protection, to the benefit of a sector which plays, in all our coastal countries, a capital role in terms of land management."
"This means strengthening aid to small-scale fishing, giving it the means of developing instead of holding it back, and strengthening the market sphere, in particular in the essential area of fresh fish and the quality of the products."
"Our group, Mr President, cannot but regret that the report on the future of the CFP has not been articulated with enough clarity around these three fundamental objectives, whose pursuit alone can justify the maintenance and acceptance of blue Europe in the future."
"Mr President, the fishing industry of Northern Ireland must be defended and maintained after 2002."
"Those who make their livelihood from fishing and the fruit of fishing in Northern Ireland must have their work sustained by proper safeguards and structural process and policies."
"Our fishing industry is in the process of being entirely eliminated."
"Those without fishing waters or enough fishing waters of their own, must not be allowed to plunder those whose fishing grounds have already suffered at the hands of the so-called expert conservationists, who have been proved wrong on many occasions."
"For example, certain fish stocks, EU experts told us, would become extinct in the Irish Sea unless their proposals were carried through."
"The opposite happened but fishermen suffered drastically because of a wrong decision from Brussels."
"Regional diversities must be recognized in all policy-making."
"One of the great weaknesses of the past has been a lack of efficient enforcement and member countries aiding and abetting that."
"There must be fair fishing grounds with all parties committed and forced to comply with the rules."
"Quota hopping must be dealt with, and in the Irish Sea the Hague preference, which totally distorts fishing quotas, should be abolished."
"Fishing communities which have seen their fleets cut must now be supported to be able to retain what is left and encouraged to break in with new developments."
"Mr President, after long and difficult discussions on the key question of how to work out a common fisheries policy after the year 2000, the Committee on Fisheries has come up with a compromise which was accepted by the overwhelming majority of the Committee and has now been presented in plenary session."
"But the way in which this report was eventually produced really was not ideal and the Committee on Fisheries must take care that it does not deal too often with such important and weighty matters with a series of compromises which then have to be rushed through the vote for lack of time."
"I would therefore call on future rapporteurs to take account of the opinions of other committee members at an early stage in the reporting procedure, so that we do not have 420 amendments in committee as happened in this case."
"If the report has nevertheless found majority acceptance, this is primarily thanks to the rapporteur's readiness to compromise, and I would like to express my personal appreciation of this."
"A compromise cannot of course satisfy all interests entirely and certain matters of detail had to be excluded."
"But I am glad to see that the principle of relative stability continues to be recognized and that access to coastal waters of Member States will continue to be restricted after 2002."
"I also think the report gives sufficient emphasis to the fact that for socioeconomic and bio-ecological reasons fisheries cannot be treated like any other economic sector, even if I would have liked a clearer statement here and there."
"I cannot therefore share the view of some of my colleagues who feel they see in the report an attack on community rights."
"We should also not forget that this is an initial approach to the subject and no doubt this is not the last time Parliament will be debating the fisheries policy after 2002."
"Mr President, I do not think I need to repeat the remarks that I made earlier about the way the rapporteur went about her work."
"By accepting many amendments, and I am glad that she accepted many of my own, she has made her own position rather more uncomfortable because the report that she is delivering today is a very different report to her original draft."
"But this shows that she has done her work properly and I think Parliament recognizes that fact."
"The common fisheries policy is a bit of a mess at the moment."
"We have a mismatch between resources and catch capacity; we need fleet reconstruction."
"Discards far over quota are a matter of fact on a daily basis and the sale of fish which are not registered in the market place are ruining the respect that many people have for the common fisheries policy."
"We, of course, need a policy that looks after the people who live in some of the more peripheral and poorer areas of the Community and the general philosophy of this report I believe to be correct."
"It stresses relative stability, whatever some colleagues might say, and it stresses that the sensitive areas of the Community must be respected."
"I am delighted that the first paragraph of this report calls for a twelve-mile exclusion zone for the coastal countries and the coastal communities so that the fishermen in those areas can manage their own resource under Community rules."
"It is vital that the fishermen feel involved in the policy in a way they do not at the present time."
"Eighty per cent of the fishermen fish close to their own shores and eighty per cent, therefore, of the fishermen will be involved in the policy."
"The larger boats which go a further distance will require much more Community control than there has been in the past."
"I believe all that is delivered in this report and I give it my full support."
"Mr President, while I do not agree with many aspects of the rapporteur's report, I want to congratulate her on bringing her report this far."
"I have listened to the opinions of the fishermen's representatives, many of whom believe that this motion for a resolution has been compiled simply to demolish the concept of national quota fisheries and treat the industry as no more than any other business."
"All of us know that fisheries is not the same as any other business."
"The importance of viable coastal fishing communities seems to have been totally ignored or treated with disdain."
"The motion does not adequately take into consideration the resource allocation needs of coastal communities situated proximate to fish stocks."
"The report does not accurately reflect the considered views and the needs of all Community fisheries interests."
"This motion is basically attempting to assert that national quotas are incompatible with the principles of the single market and free movement of capital as if there were no other criteria whatsoever to be considered."
"Some concessions have been made to the retention of the six to twelve-mile limit."
"At the same time, the motion sets out to ensure that ultimately, following a period of study - and that is important - the allocation of tax should be rationalized by allocating fishing rights amongst fishermen, in other words, ITQs."
"ITQs have been tried elsewhere, they have been controversial and were not successful in achieving economic objectives."
"They have been used as tradable commodities, they have been sold outside Member states and I believe that they will be a recipe for disaster."
"Quotas should not be nationalized."
"This notion that relative stability and quota share-out was introduced to facilitate adaptation to the single market is incorrect and the requirement of the single market must not be allowed to be confused with unrestricted access to resources."
"I take issue with the reference to fisheries being a sector in decline."
"I believe that is too gloomy a prediction."
"There have been and still are many successful fishermen and the support industries have been successful."
"Fleet reductions are not necessarily the key to conservation."
"Management is the key to the future."
"Why do we not consider pesc-aside for the fishing industry?"
"Set aside is good for the agricultural industry, so we should take on board a pesc-aside for the fishing industry."
"In conclusion, I can only say that this motion should be rejected in its present form."
"Its adoption could exacerbate the very considerable risk that some national fleets could be reduced below a critical mass, rendering the provision of infrastructural and support facilities uneconomic to many of our Member States."
"Mr President, the reform of the common fisheries policy after 2002 is aimed at strengthening and supporting this many-faceted, useful and valuable sector."
"For this to happen this reform must look at all aspects and all the characteristic features of the sector."
"In spite of significant improvements that she herself has made to the original report and even with the acceptance of the modifications, I am afraid that the report of Mrs Fraga Estévez does not go far enough in addressing the main problems that beset the sector."
"More specifically, while it is true that it makes a clear distinction between small fishing communities and large commercial and industrial activity and while it is also true that it asks for positive measures to be targeted at small coastal fishing fleets, it contains an enormous discrepancy: the common fisheries policy for the Atlantic, the North Sea and the Mediterranean."
"In the first two cases it establishes territorial waters of 200 miles; in the third case, the Mediterranean, of between 6 and 12 miles."
"All too evidently, this is unfair and dangerous treatment."
"Secondly, it offers some positive incentives for those involved to withdraw from fishing."
"But, however powerful the incentives may be, they do not solve the problem."
"It is like an aspirin. At some point or other they run out."
"Where will these people find work?"
"Will they just go to swell the ranks of the millions of people already out of work?"
"This report offers no solution, at no point is there an indication, a paragraph on preventive measures to help all those who have withdrawn from fishing to find work."
"Mr President, I am speaking as a Member of Parliament from one of the main ports of the Mediterranean, the town of Sète."
"Mrs Fraga Estévez, as a good Galician, is obviously defending the 80, 000 Galician fishermen, four times as many as their French counterparts, who have 18, 000 or more ships out of the 100, 000 European ships, a fishing fleet three times larger that the French one - it is a real armada - and their 660, 000 tons of catches, four times as much as French catches."
"Mrs Fraga Estévez is right; the sector is in crisis."
"After the depopulation of the countryside, comes the depopulation of the fishing ports, a sector which, as we know, is difficult, tough, used to conflict, with its ""Gulf War' - the Gulf of Gascony, also known as the Bay of Biscay - tuna war and indeed cod war, with very important legal constraints linked with the freedom of the high seas, and biological constraints."
"We cannot do what we want with the fish stocks, that is clear."
"We are still asking the fishermen to make sacrifices and the solutions are always Malthusian."
"There was talk earlier of freezing the seas."
"In MGP4, France will, for example, have to reduce its fishing capacity by 10 %, while in the previous MGP, in 1991, it had already destroyed nearly a thousand French ships out of a total fleet of eight thousand."
"What is curious is that Mrs Fraga Estévez reverses the traditional Spanish position."
"The British become protectionist and the Spaniards become ultra-liberal, wanting individual allocations of fishing rights, even a stock exchange for transferable individual quotas."
"We know the solutions, oxygen sought through our 26 agreements with third countries, particularly Morocco or Mauritania."
"Mrs Fraga Estévez proposes well-known solutions: sanitary inspections, crisis prevention systems, landing inspections, the fight against fraud by third parties."
"We might add social security, stabilization funds, a favourable taxation system, protection of coastal fishing, avoidance of social dumping, aquaculture, maintenance of the twelve-mile exclusion zone, and so on, and the maintenance of Community preference, of course, for us Europeans, who are net importers."
"In reality, Mrs Fraga Estévez, we certainly regulate intra-Community fishing, but there is also an extra-Community problem."
"We have no hold over the Japanese or the others."
"There lies the demonstration that legal rules only operate when a territory is circumscribed, when there are frontiers."
"If Europe fails in terms of immigration, or insecurity in employment, that is because there are no frontiers, as in fishing."
"The truth is fish, even Spanish fish, know no frontiers!"
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I believe that, despite everything, international relations are not always a jungle."
"I recognize that this report is still an initial report, but I wish to express my overall satisfaction with Mrs Fraga Estévez's text, even if I do not agree with some of the views that she puts forward."
"It represents an initial contribution, and the European Parliament has done well to get down to work, to take a lead in this debate, and to endeavour to set out a position in the future discussion of the common fisheries policy after 2002."
"I should like to address three specific points."
"First, the question of international fisheries agreements."
"I wish to express my reservations in principle concerning the renationalization of the common fisheries policy."
"Indeed, returning responsibility for the funding of international fisheries agreements to the various Member States, making them dependent on national budgets - although, in the short term, it would provide a solution to the restrictions, problems and concerns raised by those who question these agreements - would, in my view, undermine the Commission's authority in a key area of the common fisheries policy."
"Consequently, application of the subsidiarity principle must be restricted to the private domain, to dealings with producers' organizations, to the dialogue with vessel owners - possibly with the support of the regions, but without renationalizing the overall negotiation of international fisheries agreements."
"My second point concerns structural policy - and it is not possible to disconnect this issue from the question of Agenda 2000. I wish to condemn the fact that fisheries are inadequately taken into account in Agenda 2000, and that the separation of objectives 1 and 2, in the present framework, is excessively rigid, with greater importance being attached to strictly development objectives."
"Thirdly, the question of rebalancing fleet capacity and resources."
"I do not believe that rebalancing fleet capacity and resources is the only way to reduce catches, although I am in favour of the establishment of, and compliance with - and, I stress, compliance with - the multiannual guidance programmes."
"It is important to stress that the reduction of the fishing effort can also be achieved by reducing the number of fishing days, controlling landings and implementing technical measures for the conservation and protection of fisheries resources."
"Finally, our group supports the attachment of increased importance to environmental aspects, notably as regards the adoption of a precautionary approach, referred to in the draft report, and the upholding of the principle of relative stability."
"Indeed, if we fail to preserve the fisheries sector, there will be no fishermen to discuss the common fisheries policy after 2002."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first, like previous speakers, I wish to express my regret at the absence of Commissioner Bonino from a debate of such importance to the fisheries sector."
"The committee's work was long and arduous, but it bore fruit."
"The report which bears the name of the Chairman of the European Parliament's Committee on Fisheries is the first document drawn up by a Community institution which addresses, rigorously and as a whole, the reform of the common fisheries policy after 2002."
"Parliament and its Fisheries Committee must be congratulated on this initiative; and the rapporteur, Mrs Fraga Estévez, must especially be heartily congratulated on her persistence, rigour and capacity for compromise, which made it possible to achieve a good document, a good starting point for the very difficult task that is now beginning."
"I wish to highlight the fact that the report puts its finger on the main problems of the current common fisheries policy and proposes solutions and alternatives; stresses that fisheries must be treated like any other sector of economic activity, fostering the capacity and competitiveness of private enterprise in a more rationalized industry; calls for greater clarity, simplicity and transparency in the norms and management of the sector, with the increased involvement of the social partners concerned, in particular fishermen and their associations; recommends the adoption of an integrated environmental, economic, social and industrial approach to fisheries; underlines the crisis that the sector is facing and its effect on employment in entire regions that are economically backward and highly dependent on this activity, requiring the increase of funds and the maintenance of specific structural instruments; asks that the industry be treated equally with other economic sectors when it comes to negotiating requirements and compensations in international fisheries agreements; stresses the need for the effective reform of the current COM, as well as for the strengthening and rationalization of the current control system, with its extension to include transport and marketing."
"I trust, Mr President, that the Commission will take note of these proposals. In any event, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, once again, on her excellent work."
"Mr President, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur."
"We have a compromise here and in any compromise we do not all get what we want."
"We have not got what we wanted, she has not got what she wanted, a lot of other people have not got what they wanted."
"This is a first attempt, as many people have said, at talking about the reform of the common fisheries policy in 2002."
"We should congratulate her."
"It has most of the elements that we can build on."
"Relative stability is there."
"The six/twelvemile zone preservation for local fishermen is there."
"Regional management is there: I would stress that I am talking, when I talk about regional management, of areas like the countries around the North Sea managing the fisheries in the North Sea and similarly with the Mediterranean, the Irish Sea and so on."
"That seems sensible."
"Conservation is there: unless we conserve our fish stocks we will not have any fishing industry to have a fishing policy about."
"Evaluation monitoring and enforcement are there."
"If we do not do something about the catching of black fish, the catching of juveniles, the discard rate, we will not have a fishing industry."
"There will be no fishermen, there will be no fishing ports and we will be faced with a crisis."
"We have to do something about enforcement Europe-wide."
"The Commission said they were going to produce a document in 1997 about enforcement for the whole of the European Union waters."
"It is not coming in 1997 I fear."
"Let it come in early 1998."
"Finally, I am very pleased about what the rapporteur says about international fishing agreements."
"It follows on from my report last May and I am also very pleased that the Council have adopted most of the guidelines that I put down in my report."
"So we are all happy on that and let us go forward on that for international agreements."
"Congratulations again to the rapporteur, let us support this report."
"Mr President, the report by our colleague, Mrs Fraga Estévez, aims to establish a long term strategy for the development of the common fisheries policy."
"The rapporteur has produced a notable and systematic piece of work, which essentially reflects what the common fisheries policy has been in the past and what can be expected from it in the future."
"I, for my part, should like to underline four issues which I believe are important."
"The first concerns the application of the single market rules."
"We are all familiar with the frequent conflicts in the fisheries sector, and experience has shown that enthusiasm for the technically correct principle of freedom of access to fisheries resources for all Member States must be tempered by concern for relative stability. This leads to the conclusion that the present derogation allowing the Member States to retain exclusive fishing rights within their respective twelve-mile territorial limits must be continued."
"My second point is that the European Union must ensure that its fisheries products processing industries enjoy the same conditions of supply of raw materials as their main competitors."
"Besides continuing to negotiate international fisheries agreements which guarantee a minimum internal supply, therefore, it must ensure that the market concessions granted in trade agreements with third countries do not jeopardize the survival of our own industries."
"The type of mass relocation to other fisheries sectors that can currently be observed in the canning industry must be avoided at all costs, on pain of causing mass unemployment in a large number of coastal areas."
"Thirdly, I should like to stress the importance of sound medium-term programming in the framework of the multi-annual guidance programmes, or MGPs, for the fishing industry."
"However, in order to ensure that the MGPs are effective and prevent what is currently happening, a legal basis for imposing penalties for non-compliance must be established."
"Finally, I wish to underline the need for us to move quickly towards introducing a joint and relatively uniform system of monitoring and control - lest the foundations of the entire policy for the sector collapse - since this will be a decisive element in the quantitative and qualitative management of fisheries resources in the future."
"Dührkop (PSE). (ES) Mr President, I should first like to congratulate Mrs Fraga Estévez on her magnificent work in producing this report."
"The working documents drawn up by the rapporteur set out clearly both what the common fisheries policy is - or should be - as a result of the derogations that will be in force until the year 2002, and the challenges facing the European Union in the fisheries domain."
"The report that we are discussing was adopted, after long debates, by a very large majority of the Committee on Fisheries."
"We must thank the rapporteur for her good offices in providing a compromise solution that everyone could accept, even those of us who thought that her original report expressed the different aspects of the common fisheries policy more successfully."
"The Committee on Fisheries made a virtue of necessity, despite the regrettable and repeated filibustering manoeuvres of the kind which lead to nothing except the discredit of those who carry them out."
"It is also curious that it is those who complain most about the current common fisheries policy and its results who are most opposed to reforming it and taking it forward to the year 2002."
"Nevertheless, I am pleased to affirm that we have established as priorities the conservation of resources and the maintenance of employment in the fisheries sector."
"Fishing is an economic activity that is mainly concentrated in peripheral regions of the European Union characterized by a high level of unemployment and per capita income below the Community average."
"In 2002, the common fisheries policy will come of age and will be provided with a new regime in keeping with the single market similar to those that exist for all other economic sectors."
"Freedom of access to markets will therefore be matched by freedom of access to resources."
"Mr President, I want to thank the rapporteur for her work on the report and for the fact that she has rewritten the report to take account of so many amendments that were submitted including amendments from myself."
"I appreciate her call for an increased role for fishermen in the decision-making process and the emphasis that she has put on conservation of fish stocks and environmental considerations."
"I support her call that agriculture be made a major priority of the Common fisheries policy."
"I believe that coastal areas can gain enormous benefit from a carefully established policy."
"I was extremely impressed recently on visiting the rapporteur's own constituency, Galicia, to see the contribution that mussel farming has made to their local economy."
"I believe that a supply of fresh, cheap seafood can be a tremendous tourist attraction in peripheral regions, particularly for areas like Galicia, the west of Ireland and Scotland."
"This is an important factor in her report."
"I am disappointed that my amendment to extend the thirty-mile exclusive zone has not been accepted."
"I believe there is still a lot of support for that idea and I hope that the Commission will consider this idea as part of a strategy to give greater control to the local communities."
"I am sorry to have to say again and again that I cannot accept the principle of relative stability without one reservation."
"Fishermen on the west coast of Ireland recognize that they are allowed to catch only twenty per cent of the rich fishing resources which are adjacent to their region."
"These are the natural resources of a natural region in the Community."
"If the fisher people of Spain, Portugal or Denmark were told they could only catch twenty per cent of the stocks in the waters adjacent to them, they would not accept the Common fisheries policy."
"I have to say we must continue to make this point."
"Mr President, I should first like to congratulate Mrs Fraga Estévez on her report and her will to achieve a balanced compromise - even if it is not the compromise that many of us would have perhaps desired."
"I preferred Mrs Fraga Estévez's original report, but the final report must be regarded as a positive step, as a reflection on what the future main lines of the common fisheries policy should be."
"It strikes a balance in favour of the promotion of a competitive and responsible fishing industry which can survive in the market place."
"It is important that the report states that fisheries must be treated as simply another sector of economic activity."
"I should like to underline the proposals concerning the distribution of fishing rights between companies and the possible transferability of those rights. These are necessary mechanisms for providing companies in the sector with a certain amount of flexibility as regards their rights, as well as for enhancing their profitability."
"If companies are not competitive, the industry will have no future, jobs will be lost and the economic opportunities of areas dependent on fishing will be destroyed."
"Furthermore, the report calls for responsible fishing: responsible from the environmental point of view, because, in the long term, competitiveness also requires the conservation of resources."
"The report proposes that TACs should be established on the basis of biological and socioeconomic factors, and calls for the reduction of discards and the use of selective fishing gear."
"The report also calls for social responsibility."
"It underlines the need for compliance with the MGPs, so that fishing capacity can be matched to resources. It calls for alternatives to be found to the restructuring of the fleet, as well as for economic support to alleviate the latter's socioeconomic consequences, which may seriously harm local communities."
"The report also refers to the fact that not all fishing is industrial fishing, but that there is also local, non-industrial fishing. The measures to restructure this sector must be different to those adopted for the competitive, industrial fishing sector."
"The only thing that I would say is that local fishing must be analyzed only in the framework of its own socioeconomic context, and must be defined not only in terms of the size of vessels, but in other terms such as the provision of services to local communities, the use of selective fishing gear, and so on."
"I wish to end, Mr President, by welcoming the fact that this report also calls for the fishing agreements concluded with third countries to be adapted to the specific circumstances of each of those countries."
"I therefore urge the Members to vote in favour of Mrs Fraga Estévez's report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate Mrs Fraga Estevez on her excellent report and on her contribution to the debate on the common fisheries policy after 2002."
"The motion for a resolution that we have just examined is indeed an extremely significant contribution, which we will take into serious consideration during the debates that are going to be held over the coming years."
"At this point I would like to express the regret of our colleague, Mrs Bonino, for her absence from the debate today, due to the fact that she had prior engagements outside Brussels from which she could not extricate herself."
"However, I believe that nobody in this Chamber is in any doubt as to the special respect in which Mrs Bonino is held in the European Parliament."
"At this stage, the European Commission does not wish to express any substantive opinion, so as not to influence the final outcome of the debate that has only just begun."
"But, as has been announced on many occasions, both in the European Parliament and in other forums, the European Commission is intending to move towards a re-examination of the common fisheries policy."
"We will do this by organizing an open and constructive debate in close consultation naturally with all the concerned bodies of the sector."
"The participation of all the bodies of the sector, especially of professional bodies, is the essential ingredient in the method that the European Union is intending to follow."
"Our services are going to draw up a questionnaire on the common fisheries policy and send it to all the parties concerned at the beginning of 1998."
"The answers to this questionnaire will allow us to pin-point the main themes on which the study of the common fisheries policy after 2002 will concentrate, in order to give the debate a better focus and direction."
"During a second phase, in close collaboration with the Member States, the services of the Commission will organize decentralized meetings which will allow the Commission and the parties concerned to analyze and debate the results of this first investigation on the base of the questionnaire."
"Finally, I would like to make a comment on the content of the investigation of the common fisheries policy after 2002."
"From a strictly legal viewpoint 2002 can be directly characterized by three elements which stem from laws currently in force."
"First, by access to waters within the 12 or 6 nautical mile zone, in accordance with article 6 of the 3760/92 Regulation."
"Secondly, by the implementation details that are enforced by CETATOX, in accordance with article 7 of the 3760/92 Regulation."
"Thirdly, by the conditions of access to the North Sea for Spanish and Portuguese vessels in accordance with the 1985 Act of Accession, and for Swedish and Finnish vessels in accordance with the 1994 Act of Accession."
"However, the Commission aspires not to limit itself to this clearly legal framework, as provided for by the basic Regulation and the Acts of Accession."
"2002 gives us the opportunity to move towards an evaluation of all the different aspects of the common fisheries policy, to see its successes and to confront its failures."
"We should also evaluate the extent to which the common fisheries policy has contributed to the preservation of fish stocks, to employment and to the other objectives of the treaty, such as the protection of the environment."
"It is an inspired plan, which obliges us to begin forthwith the appropriate investigative process, always in collaboration, as I said, with all the bodies concerned and, of course, working closely with Parliament."
"In this context, the European Parliament resolution on the common fisheries policy after 2002 and the Commission report on the implementation of the Community fisheries and fish-farming regime are the first phases in this process."
"They will be the broad outlines as regards both the short term and the medium term planning of the European Commission."
"Thank you, Commissioner Papoutsis."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Sexual Discrimination"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0326/97), on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights, on the common position established by the Council (C.-0441/97-96/0196(SYN)) with a view to the adoption of a Council Directive on the burden of proof in cases of discrimination based on sex (Rapporteur: Mrs Ghilardotti)."
"Mr President, we are talking about the second reading on the common position adopted by the Council with regard to the directive on the burden of proof."
"I should first like to report, also on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights, that the Council has included the United Kingdom in this directive."
"The United Kingdom has stated its intention to abide by the social provisions of the new treaty and to accept the directives already adopted or to be adopted before the treaty comes into effect."
"I believe that this is an extremely positive fact which must be greeted with approval."
"Having said that, it should be noted that as a whole the common position adopted by the Council is unfortunately a long way from the European Parliament's position, and the Commission's position, as amended, after the vote on this directive at first reading in this House, mainly because there were many essential points where it did not even accept the Commission's original position."
"The Committee on Women's Rights and I, as the rapporteur, would like to retable a series of amendments for the second reading, selecting the fundamental issues which have to do with precisely the essential elements of this directive; in particular those that have to do with article 2 which relates to the definition of indirect discrimination, article 3 which relates to the definition of the scope of the directive, article 4 which defines the conditions for the burden of proof and article 5 which defines the procedures."
"We confine ourselves to retabling these amendments, leaving aside a whole series of other amendments which, although we consider them important, are not essential for the purposes of the decision on the directive."
"It is for this reason that I should like to concentrate on a few points only and ask the Commissioner - whom I thank for being present in the Chamber - what the Commission intends to do with these amendments that we are retabling, with particular regard to article 2. We want to retable, albeit with slight modifications to our first reading, the definition of indirect discrimination which explicitly includes the essential elements, also from a terminological point of view, that the Court of Justice has expressed on many occasions when defining indirect discrimination, and that is the reason that we are retabling the amendment."
"With regard to the scope, I have to say that we thought the Council's explanatory statement very reductive as it excludes from the scope the directives on social protection, professional employment and self-employment."
"This exclusion has no legal basis and we therefore intend to retable a motion, as far as the scope is concerned, to apply this directive to the directives already in force."
"With regard to article 4 which relates to the conditions for the burden of proof, we believe that the Council's decision to reject the last sentence which refers to residual doubt on the grounds that it only relates to criminal proceedings is unfounded in the sense that with this sentence the directive is leaving it to judges to decide on prima facie cases but where doubt persists, it determines that the burden of proof should be borne by the employer since he has all the information at his disposal. It does not represent any interference in the legal system because it is only a pointer to the way people should behave."
"The same applies to the procedures. As far as the procedures are concerned reference is also made to the fact that the maximum transparency is required and that all the necessary information should be placed at the disposal of the plaintiff as it could be used in court."
"These are the reasons why Parliament is retabling the amendments we previously tabled."
"I should therefore like to ask Commissioner Flynn what the Commission intends to do and whether it intends to support the positions adopted by Parliament as it did at the first reading."
"I would remind you that we are not retabling all the amendments but are concentrating on the essential elements of this directive."
"I should also like to remind you that people started talking about a first draft of this directive in 1988."
"We have therefore been waiting ten years for a directive along these lines."
"In the meantime there has been considerable legal precedent, which this directive, by its nature, should take into account."
"Mr President, I congratulate the honourable Member, Mrs Ghilardotti, on her work."
"With her recommendation for a directive on shifting the burden of proof in cases of discrimination on grounds of sex, she sums up admirably the resolutions of the Committee on Women's Rights."
"The amendments constitute an important element in achieving a social Europe."
"We Social Democrats want to see a clear directive that assists women in asserting their rights."
"I trust the Commission, which has been so far very cooperative with Parliament, will continue to take this line."
"We would like to see the position of female employees in cases of job discrimination, promotion and remuneration improved."
"The draft under discussion for the last 15 years must, in our view, include the three key elements which Mrs Ghilardotti has already presented and which were not fully accepted by the Council after first reading."
"The shifting of the burden of proof from plaintiff to employer as in Amendment No 8 must definitely be insisted on, and the burden of residual doubt must lie with the accused."
"We regard this as an essential requirement."
"The second clear definition of indirect discrimination, which the European Court has already embarked on in its judgement, must be clarified."
"Indeed the draft Amsterdam Treaty takes the same approach."
"Thirdly, we want to see the directive extended to the protection of expectant and nursing mothers and social security provisions, so as to avoid loopholes in Member States which may prevent female plaintiffs from asserting their rights to equality of treatment in the civil courts."
"So on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would ask all colleagues to accept the proposed amendments including the key contents of Amendment No 8, and I trust we will get a majority and that the Commissioner will accept these amendments."
"Mr President, this is a directive which means and shows that the EU can bring advances for men and women in Europe."
"We must unite on a long term policy in this area. This directive is part of such a policy."
"I represent several countries which have equivalent legislation."
"I would like to help this directive to be adopted here."
"I would also like to say that this directive is going to involve demands for change there."
"Our group is going to support the committee's proposal as we did at the first reading."
"I would, however, like to point out that this is not a directive about a reversed burden of proof, but a directive about a shared burden of proof."
"I think article 4 is technically better in this proposal than last time."
"For a directive with a shared burden of proof to work we need provisions, as Amendment No 9 says, on the right to receive information."
"This right is indispensable if the directive is to have meaning."
"I understand that Parliament has striven for a wording which guarantees the personal integrity of all the parties involved."
"Documents which may contain sensitive information about someone's state of health and so on should not be released."
"I also hope that we will approve Amendment No 3."
"If part 15 of the preamble were to remain, it would give the Member States a virtually free hand to do something or to do nothing."
"To a large extent the proposal still stresses both proportionality and subsidiarity."
"It can therefore be accepted and approved, while the debate about Amendment No 3 also shows that the boundaries between the first and third pillars of the structure of our Union are very difficult to maintain."
"If we are too rigid in this regard, we will not be able to carry out effective policies in various areas."
"Mr President, unfortunately, due to the successive deadlocks that have occurred since the Commission submitted its first proposal in 1988, a satisfactory outcome for this draft directive has not be achieved."
"Are they afraid that women might use legal instruments to demand equality and defend themselves from discrimination?"
"What better reason for bringing forward this directive than that of defending ourselves from discrimination - before other technical considerations?"
"The directive must contain clear provisions which do not lend themselves to misinterpretation when it comes to implementation, as well as a clear definition of direct and indirect discrimination. The scope of this equal treatment directive must be determined, and an unambiguous legal framework must be established for the Member States, with exceptions being limited as far as possible."
"All this is important to women, and will serve to enhance the credibility of the equality and mainstreaming policies which form part of the Commission's programmes and the foundations of the treaty."
"It is discouraging that, after this long process, the Commission has accepted only 50 %, and the Council a mere 10 %, of Parliament's amendments."
"Naturally, my group will be supporting the amendments by Mrs Ghilardotti and the Committee on Women's Rights."
"Mr President, I would first like to ask Commissioner Flynn whether he can explain to us what the value of this directive still is if the Council is only prepared to adopt its own proposal."
"Because, quite honestly, the Council is surely removing the core of this directive and what is more, legal precedent has moved on and the Commission's first proposal and Parliament's amendments are much closer to it than what the Council eventually cobbled together up at first reading."
"To tell the truth, I am a bit worried that at second reading too, the Council will disregard the view of both Parliament and the Commission, is already unanimimous and it will be a straightforward decision."
"So I really wonder what value the directive can add to existing precedent."
"Perhaps it makes more sense to try to enforce the existing precedent in the Member States, and to enforce its observance in the Member States."
"We do badly need this directive, but of course it must be a good directive because we must realize that women are still very much discriminated against on the labour market and that applies to all directives that we deal with concerning equal treatment in Europe and not just to half of them or a few of them."
"We must realize that women still earn 30 % less than men for work of equal value."
"We must realize that women are still not in a position, for example, to build up the same pension rights as men on average."
"We must therefore note that at the end of their lives women will still be poorer."
"We desperately need this directive, but it must be a directive of quality and I should very much like to hear the Commissioner's opinion on this matter."
"Mr President, when we debated this proposal at first reading, I congratulated the Commission on its initiative and thanked Mrs Ghilardotti for her excellent report and the opportune and important amendments she proposed at the time."
"Today, I wish to extend those thanks, since, in the meantime, and on the basis of the proposals drawn up by the European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights, the Portuguese Parliament has adopted a new law - which has just entered into force - which goes far beyond the draft directive that we are discussing today."
"Indeed, this new law, which guarantees the right to equal treatment between men and women in the workplace, enshrines the concept, not of shifting, but of reversing the burden of proof. Now it is incumbent upon employers to prove that no form of discrimination exists."
"Furthermore, this law clearly defines the concept of indirect discrimination - something Mrs Ghilardotti and others of us have been fighting for."
"As was said during the debate in Portugal, this law was based on a large number of the principles which we uphold - a reason for Portuguese women to be grateful to the Commission, the European Parliament and especially its Committee on Women's Rights."
"This is an excellent example of how the European Union can help to enhance the rights of citizens - in this particular case, Portuguese citizens."
"Unfortunately, the Council removed at first reading a number of the aspects which we consider to be essential."
"We therefore hope, Commissioner Flynn, that the amendments tabled today at second reading - especially Amendment No 5 on indirect discrimination, Amendment No 8 on the benefit of the doubt, and Amendment No 12 - will be adopted by the necessary majority and forcefully upheld by the Commission, since these are essential to defending women's rights in the fields of employment and social security."
"It will ill become the European Parliament and the European Union to lag behind one of the southern Member States in this area."
"Mr President, the proposal that we are discussing today on the reversal of the burden of proof as it is called in normal human language, is of course not really a reversal of the burden of proof."
"An attempt is made to translate the judgments made by the Court in Luxembourg."
"I am not as negative as Mrs van Dijk."
"I believe, and I can say with some pride, Mrs van Dijk, that Europe has done a great deal for the position of women."
"I feel that this proposal is a step on the way to a rather better position for women."
"If I compare the Council's position to the original proposal submitted by the Commission, it has unfortunately been greatly weakened under the Dutch presidency."
"I have now understood and you have also just heard that in the Group of the European People's Party there are people who are afraid of this proposal and who think that we may possibly go too far on certain points."
"That is the really the reason why I would ask the Commissioner to pay special attention to a few amendments."
"Is it true, Commissioner, that the Commission is still sticking to including the position of self-employed women in this directive? Are you still sticking to that?"
"I would say it is worth sticking to it."
"I would also like to know the opinion of the European Commission on Amendment No 9."
"Amendment No 9 is the exact text of the original Commission proposal."
"I am in full agreement with that text."
"It does not impose anything on the Member States but it simply asks them to ensure that information is available to parties who wish to represent themselves."
"Are you sticking to this?"
"The Group of the European People's Party would be willing to support that."
"One more point, and I can deal with it very quickly, is Amendment No 8."
"I have the feeling that this text is not very clear from the legal point of view."
"I should like to ask your opinion on it."
"But apart from that I hope the Commission will continue to do what it is doing, supporting the position of women."
"Mr President, the common position represents a step forward in the elimination of discriminatory practices in so far as it recognizes the difficulty of proving the many subtle forms of indirect discrimination in judicial or extrajudicial terms."
"Whilst acknowledging this positive aspect, however, it should be stressed that this explicit recognition in a legislative text represents an advance which will not be realized in practice, because the orchestration of the legal measures to be adopted in order to eliminate discriminatory practices goes only half way and is floundering in ambiguity."
"The weight of the legal traditions of the majority of Member States, whereby the burden of proof falls on the plaintiff not the respondent, is evident in issues such as the scope of the directive, the definition of indirect discrimination and the reversal of the burden of proof itself, obstructing the solutions achieved."
"In conclusion, all this leads us to support the amendments proposed by the Committee on Women's Rights, which will remove the ambiguities and guarantee the prevention of discrimination by judicial and extrajudicial means."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I should like to congratulate my fellow group member, Mrs Ghilardotti, underline her arguments and refer briefly to the extraordinary way the Council has handled this."
"It was odd from the start that the Council hastily adopted its common position on 27 July 1997, although the report from Parliament was not submitted until 15 September."
"So it made its decision almost two months before time."
"Then of the 11 amendments which the Commission approved, it only accepted two."
"On the other hand the Council was 11 and 18 years out of date respectively when, with Amendment No 8, it deleted three of its own directives for achieving the principle of sexual equality from the years 1979 and 1986 and only referred to two legal provisions from 1975 and 1976, which was a case of back to square one!"
"But that really does not suit Members of the European Parliament, far less the Committee on Women's Rights and especially after Amsterdam!"
"We therefore request, Commissioner Flynn, first that account is taken of the other directives on equality, that is, clear definition of areas of application."
"Secondly, the definition of indirect discrimination must reflect the ten years of rulings of the European Court, in which reference is made to the disadvantage of the relative imbalance of the sexes and which make no mention of the needs of the organization and politics of a Member State."
"Thirdly, the key element in the Ghilardotti report, shifting of the burden of proof, which Parliament and the Commission have approved, must be retained."
"Fourthly, adoption of the Directive must be ensured."
"This requires positive steps and a report to Parliament every three years, which the Council inexplicably deleted, and the withdrawal of the extenuating provisions of proposals 15 and 16."
"Because, Commissioner Flynn, if we take the position that special features of the legal provisions of some Member States must be allowed for and make that a common position, we might as well forget about all EU directives and save ourselves the work!"
"Mr President, the road to equality between women and men is a hard one."
"It has a lot of potholes."
"In businesses and organizations discrimination on grounds of sex is far too often the reality."
"Women - and not only women - await concrete changes and approximation of procedures in all Member States."
"The European Parliament has shown the way in this respect."
"With its new common position, the Council has taken the reservations of our group into account."
"Some of my female colleagues have omitted to mention this."
"For example, the principle of investigation has gone."
"The right to information for all parties has also been dropped."
"It would have led to investigations which are not compatible with the civil law of Member States."
"All the suggestions of our Parliament were accepted by the European Commission - thanks to Commissioner Flynn."
"Three examples: first, the now redrafted definition of indirect discrimination; secondly, the incorporation of directives into social security law; thirdly, the obligation of Member States to report after at least two years."
"There are a number of amendments tabled by the, as usual, extremely precise rapporteur, Mrs Ghilardotti, which we will not be able to accept, such as the deletion of proposals 15 and 16."
"We believe that specific aspects of the legal provisions of Member States certainly must be considered, especially if there is clearly discrimination taking place."
"All in all, a middle way has been found."
"The accused must prove that they have adhered to the principle of equality, an important corrective in all Member States, for common legal instruments will include both direct and indirect discrimination."
"The burden of proof directive has, I believe, taken us a valuable step forward on the stony road I referred to at the start!"
"Mr President, I should briefly like to express my support for the rapporteur and her proposals in this to-and-fro process in which the common position adopted by the Council represents a step backward."
"This step backward is especially unacceptable because it makes the draft directive less progressive than certain national legislation adopted in the meantime, creating a disincentive to those tackling and attempting to resolve clear instances of discrimination, such as in the scandalous case of the Commercial Bank of Portugal, which denies women equal access to employment - a case which has been dragging on for years."
"Such instances can only be dealt with at judicial level if there is provision for the reversal of the burden of proof - for which Portuguese legislation has provided an example - for the possibility of the action being brought by a trade union and the plaintiff benefitting from any residual doubt, as well as for a number of other factors present in the report in second reading amendments."
"I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, and - along with my group and, I hope, the whole of Parliament - I shall endeavour to uphold her proposals vis-à-vis the common position."
"Mr President, let me first thank all for completing the examination of the common position so quickly."
"In that respect, my thanks first to you Mrs Ghilardotti and all the Members of the Committee on Women's Rights."
"The Commission's revised proposals were largely based on the amendments that you had adopted in the first reading and the Council's common position departs from the revised proposal in two essential issues: the definition of the concept of indirect discrimination, that is article 2(2), and the scope of the directive article 3(1)(a)."
"The Commission has expressed strong reservations on both of these issues and as regards the concept of indirect discrimination the Commission in its original proposal contained the four elements which have consistently recurred in the judgments of the Court."
"The Commission regards it as difficult to accept only some of these elements, since each of them is justified by the inclusion of the others."
"It is precisely the way in which they tie in with each other that gives the definition its coherence."
"As regards the scope of the directive, the Commission has also expressed its difficulties with the approach taken in the common position."
"It considers that the principle laid down by the Court as regards the shift in the burden of proof is a general one which should be applied in all directives aimed at upholding the principle of equal treatment between the sexes."
"I would like to turn to your amendments and like your rapporteur, Mrs Ghilardotti, the Commission believes that it is now important to concentrate on the key issues."
"In the re-examined proposal, the Commission wishes to focus attention on these issues."
"It is in order to achieve these that the Commission cannot accept the following amendments. That is Amendments Nos 3, 4, 7, 9 and 10."
"In addition, Amendments Nos 11 and 12 are in conflict with Amendments Nos 1 and 6 and in accepting the latter two, I must also reject 11 and 12."
"As I have already mentioned, the Commission is willing to accept the proposed amendments which are intended to strengthen the central provisions of the common position: Amendment No 2, which reinserts recital 12 of the Commission's amended proposal of May 1997, underlying the need to take additional measures to ensure effective implementation of the principle of equal treatment;"
"Thus, as you can see, the Commission accepts your proposed amendments on the three central provisions of the Commission text."
"Mrs van Dijk asked a specific question, of whether there was added value here."
"I think the answer is yes but the common position could do with a lot of strengthening and hopefully we will be able to convince the Council to do as the amendments suggest."
"I have to say to you that the Commission's proposal aims at increasing the legal certainty and at ensuring that the principle of equal treatment as interpreted by the Court of Justice is complied with scrupulously in all the Member States."
"Further, it is a clear step forward in respect of the compromise text on which eleven Member States were prepared to agree in 1993, in particular, the wider scope and greater clarity of articles 3 and 4(1)."
"Madam Oomen-Ruijten asked about Amendment No 9, which suggests reinserting a new article 4(a) on procedure."
"It is not accepted because of the need to focus on the key issues today."
"The deletion of the provision in the common position does not really do any harm, as in fact it provided for something which already exists in one way or another in all of the Member States legal systems."
"In conclusion, I would like to renew my thanks to all those concerned and I hope that we will be able to convince the Council to strengthen their common position as suggested by the House."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Flynn."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 8.25 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Phare"
"Mr President, let me start by thanking all who have contributed to the work involved in producing this report."
"That applies both to the Court of Auditors and the Commission, which of course has voluntarily made itself available for discussions and providing further information."
"I am also pleased at the honesty which the Commission showed about the difficulties, but what really matters now is that we can improve matters so that the Phare programme will work better in future."
"So far, I have to say that some of the problems which the European Parliament has raised over the years, particularly with the adoption ruling, still exist."
"It has always been widely agreed that the Phare programme should exist, but at the same time it has not been too clear what the programme should do and what it should actually lead to."
"So I am in no doubt that revising the programme now is a good idea so that the aim is now clearly membership-related."
"But I feel it is important to emphasize that changing the goals will not produce any results in itself."
"Only if there are real improvements in the management of the programme will we achieve clearer and more visible results, and let me mention on this point that the same applies to the Commission's decision to establish a special unit to coordinate the external activities."
"Unless the procedures are rationalized and simplified at the same time, there is of course on the other hand a risk that the division of responsibilities and tasks will continue to be blurred."
"The question of decentralization is a core problem."
"Of course, it is said that no real decentralization has occurred, only a deconcentration."
"And given that the Phare countries will soon be members of the EU, it is essential in terms of the admission strategy to implement a truly decentralized management system."
"I would therefore urge the Commission to implement the concept of decentralization by letting at least one country take over responsibility for implementing its national Phare project entirely in accordance with the finance regulations and also to let at least one Commission delegation in a country assume responsibility correspondingly, and lastly to have the financial administration of specific sectors of the Phare programme passed over to national administrations."
"If we can expect to enlarge in the near future, there can be no doubt that the countries concerned should take over the running of the Phare programme."
"One persistent problem is the staff problem at the Commission."
"I fail to understand why there is an enormous turnover of staff even at the highest levels of Phare management."
"This rapid turnover at all levels does of course mean a loss of continuity, experience and knowhow."
"The position in the delegations is completely wrong, and I find it totally unacceptable that the Commission cannot be bothered to set up an external service to get around the lack of qualified people at the delegations."
"So there are a number of areas where the Commission has announced initiatives aimed at reducing the period for ratifying treaties to six months, that contracts not implemented will be concluded, that surplus programme management units will be closed, that the approvals procedure will be simplified, that evaluation reports will be followed by actual action and that unused Phare resources will be redistributed."
"It is very good that the Commission has agreed to improvements in these areas."
"I look forward to their being implemented, and I hope that the Commission will present a report on progress here by the end of the year as announced."
"As far as the amendments to the report are concerned, I must say that I am amazed at what interests some of my colleagues here want to consider."
"We at the European Parliament have constantly complained about the grotesque situation in which less than half of the assets committed under the Phare programme are actually converted to actual payments."
"So it is vital that the administrative procedures be changed and tightened up, so that a six month time limit is introduced from when funds are committed to when the relevant contract is signed."
"This is a well-known problem, and the six-month period is realistic, which the Commission's own representatives have proposed."
"Amendment No 2 runs contrary to the idea of decentralization, as the individual components are all covered, directly or indirectly, by the original text."
"So I can only urge my colleagues in the Chamber to vote against these amendments."
"Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues for their assistance and some good discussions about the Phare programme and its future."
"If only the Commission will implement the measures proposed here, I am in no doubt that the Phare programme will work as intended, produce visible results in the recipient countries and help their entrance into the EU."
"Mr President, I should first like to congratulate the rapporteur, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on her excellent report."
"I believe that it sets out clearly the difficulties of the Phare programme, as well as laying down a number of guidelines for the future."
"The third Special Report of the Court of Auditors, which is the subject of this report, highlights the programme's inadequacies for the umpteenth time."
"The main problem is that commitments are not a good indicator of the percentage of implementation, since payments only amount to 44 % of commitments, and less than half the funds allocated to the Phare programme since its inception have reached their final recipient."
"I am sure that nobody in this House questions the purpose of the programme, for simple political reasons. In the seven years of its existence, however, its poor implementation has frequently been criticized, without - until now - the Commission having proposed effective remedies."
"It is unfair, in my view, simply to blame the poor implementation of the programme on the bad management or inadequate functioning of the recipient countries."
"Year after year, the budget has been adopted, without a reserve being created for this budget line more than once - and that was ineffective."
"And I am deliberately not addressing the issue of value for money now - an issue which must be a priority subject in the debate on the programme's future."
"I do not believe that the Commission's proposed improvement of adopting a more accession-driven approach will be a cure-all either."
"It is also necessary to define the objectives clearly, improve procedures and, above all, accelerate decision-making."
"The demand made in Mrs Kjer Hansen's report for a six-month deadline between the commitment of funds and the signature of the relevant contract could be one way of ensuring transparency and preventing the abuses that are currently observed."
"When we evaluate the results, moreover, we see that they have so far been highly inadequate."
"By the end of 1995, monitoring and assessment reports on only 30 % of programmes had been submitted."
"I believe that, as an instrument of reform, independent evaluation every six months would be extremely useful."
"Lastly, as Mrs Kjer Hansen has already stressed, it is essential to improve the staff situation in both Brussels and the delegations of the recipient countries."
"The high staff turnover must be rectified."
"Finally, Mr President, I wish to say that the Socialist Group fully supports this report."
"Mr President, everyone is aware that the Phare programme is the principal instrument of financial support for the pre-accession strategy."
"Hence the importance of this report and the effects that it will generate when it is adopted."
"I also wish to congratulate Mrs Hansen on her excellent report and thank her for her goodwill in accepting our amendments."
"However, this motion for a resolution and these amendments are only possible because, once again, the Court of Auditors has scrupulously fulfilled its duty by drawing up an objective critical analysis of the decentralized system for the implementation of the Phare programme."
"But if having a decentralized system should have meant the smooth implementation of programmes and the rapid mobilization of financial resources, that has not always been the case."
"The reality has been inefficiencies, limited staff with insufficient experience, a poor take-up capacity on the part of the recipient countries, the dispersal of appropriations across a broad range of projects, and so on."
"These inefficiencies can explain a certain amount of slowness in the implementation of the programme."
"But the fact that, since its inception, the Phare programme has left more than 50 % of its funds unused, indicates that it is suffering from bigger and more serious problems."
"I welcome the fact that the Commission is talking about concrete reforms to tighten up programming and financial management."
"I am convinced that the Commission is right to create an independent evaluation unit within DGIA, since, if it ensures its independence and endows it with sufficient resources, this will be not only a constructive innovation but the best possible tool for improving the programme."
"Mr Commissioner, when the Commission talks about reallocating funds to more fruitful activities, or reallocating unused Phare funding, it means within the programme."
"If the end result does not improve, however, it will unfortunately have talk about reallocating those funds to another programme."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I think when we look at this excellent report by Mrs Kjer Hansen we really have here a damning indictment of the work of the Commission as regards the management of the Phare programme."
"I have had a look at how our Committee on External Economic Relations summed up the matter."
"It says that decentralization was introduced without the Commission really understanding the procedures introduced by national administrative authorities to implement it."
"The volume of funds provided for Phare exceeded the Commission's ability to administer them."
"What does this mean?"
"The Court of Auditors is worried about transparency and fairness in the awarding of contracts and the compilation of shorter candidate lists."
"This is a demonstration of ineptitude in a central function of Agenda 2000."
"I have already made this point here: how are we going to explain to our citizens how a Commission which cannot even cope with allocating ECU 1 billion to countries which desperately need the money, is going to be able to implement the far more comprehensive, expensive and complex enlargement process facing us?"
"I certainly couldn't tell you!"
"So I think Agenda 2000 must in the end have another point added, and it is this: the Commission has got to get itself into a position where it is capable of implementing the Phare programme, one enlargement programme, properly."
"For, Mr Commissioner, neither the Member States nor Parliament nor anyone else is responsible for your staff problems which Mrs Dührkop Dührkop has mentioned and which this report refers to."
"This is your responsibility and you will have to rectify it!"
"That, I believe, is the message of this report."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, today's discussion is in a sense a rehearsal for the debate we shall be having in exactly a month on Agenda 2000 and thus on the enlargement of the European Union."
"Talking about the Phare programme means the countries of central Europe, all of which - sooner or later - are waiting to be admitted into the European Union."
"The basis of today's debate is a special report of the Court of Auditors."
"It is in the nature of such reports that it deals with difficulties and problems, so one might be tempted to be pessimistic and there are signs of that already."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Kjer Hansen, expressly for not succumbing to this temptation."
"That does not mean that we should not take the Court's report seriously, on the contrary!"
"We all know that the candidate countries have a long way to go."
"This is nothing new, but the Court makes it clear that the Commission, too, will have to change its ways considerably if the enlargement process is not to be a disaster."
"I know how difficult the task of the Commission is and can understand, Mr Commissioner, if you sometimes feel like a whipping boy."
"On the one hand we regret here in Parliament that the funds we have provided as budgetary authorities have in fact only been partially disbursed, and will remain so."
"In the next breath we come along and complain about everything that has gone awry with the funds that have been spent."
"But both are part of our responsibility as Parliament and I hope you will take the adverse remarks made here as constructive criticism, as a spur to further efforts."
"A key word in this connection is concentration of forces."
"In fact we have had the impression all too often in the past that both the Commission and the Phare countries themselves were wasting their time trying to identify worthwhile projects to support."
"It was apparent that the system for implementing the programme was unwieldy and incurred considerable unnecessary costs."
"So it is right that the duties of all those involved need to be clearly defined, the number of programmes reduced and the Commission delegations on the ground must have their staffs and their powers reinforced so they can ensure effective programme supervision."
"That is what we want to see, and the Court of Auditors has made the same point."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, shutting our eyes is not going to achieve anything."
"We have here a serious structural problem in the administration of the programme by the Commission."
"The background, or rather the nub, of the report, as has been said, is that the Commission has never really succeeded in producing an assessment system for Phare, which allows the political effects of the programme to be evaluated."
"There is no reliable system for supervising individual activities and no clear responsibilities for evaluation, which, as we know, has always been done partly by the Commission and lies partly with subordinate bodies."
"Lack of transparency has naturally given rise to the suspicion that not all has been well with the award of contracts, and it was clearly the case, at least in the early stages, that certain institutions in the west managed to line their nests with a certain amount of support or, shall we say, credulity in the recipient countries."
"Whether the results of the services always met the expectations of the countries concerned I would doubt."
"Many of the appraisals landed up in the drawer with the costs borne by the taxpayer."
"Despite the criticism though, we need the programme more than ever before to support the entry of the central and eastern European countries."
"This doesn't mean we should cast doubt on decentralization of implementation if we want our partners in central and eastern Europe to have equal rights."
"Decentralization must go hand in hand with proper supervision, closer financial involvement of recipient countries and better administrative preparation in these countries for their responsibilities, and I believe this was not properly appreciated."
"But we also need a new method of assessing the results on the basis of clearly defined political goals."
"As far as suspicion of nepotism is concerned, I can think of a number of specific ways of involving new institutions and ensuring wide participation."
"Why is this not done by means of regular general calls for interest so as to broaden the applicant chain?"
"Why does the project management not call more often on new providers instead of the same ones every time?"
"It would also be important for the Member States themselves, who sit on the Phare management committee, to publicize the programme at home."
"I hope this shot across the bows may help to ensure a better start for implementation of the Meda programme and that we shall avoid problems like this in future."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Relocation and foreign direct investments in third countries"
"The next item is the report (A4-0294) by Mr Sainjon, on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, on relocation and foreign direct investment in third countries."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it would be unjust, and indeed quite untrue, to say that globalization and international movements of companies do not have negative effects."
"The movement of people, ideas, goods, the end of certain great totalitarian empires, the crumbling of walls and iron curtains represent real progress overall."
"One can even say that sometimes certain relocations give work to poor countries and by reducing the price of products consumed in rich countries they promote growth there."
"All the same, Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when one looks at the construction of Europe, relocation always seems to take first place amongst phenomena regarded as negative."
"European citizens no longer tolerate them and many, often wrongly, also blame the European Union."
"André Sainjon has done excellent work."
"He has my support and that of the socialists, just as I support, and we support, the political and union initiatives geared to the struggle against destructive ultra-liberalism."
"In fact, two areas need to be distinguished as regards relocations, those taking place within the Union and those taking place in the rest of the world."
"Of course, the first, within the Union, cannot be banned, but fiscal and social harmonization, from the top down, can, should and must be accelerated."
"It is impossible to accept a single market where the rules of the game, and hence the costs, remain fundamentally different."
"This would be disastrous for all, particularly the wage-earners, and hence for the very idea of the construction of Europe."
"Harmonization, certainly, but above all, and I insist on this, relocations which benefit from direct or indirect European Union aid can, should and must be banned."
"There are many well-known cases of this."
"It is intolerable and legislative measures must be taken."
"It is quite possible to do this, it is quite simple."
"All that is needed is the political will."
"But alongside internal relocations, there are also, of course, relocations outside the Union."
"André Sainjon makes some interesting proposals, which I support, in particular that of a code of conduct for European multinationals, as well as the proposal to modify the OECD investment code."
"Without going into detail either, we too affirm that we must fight against forced labour, against child slavery, against discrimination of all kinds, but also for the promotion of union freedom, for the generalization of collective negotiations, and as regards labour law, for a minimum code in all the countries."
"In conclusion, Mr President, while free movement of people, ideas and goods in Europe and in the world is an excellent thing and progress in commercial, economic and industrial does matter, free movement must be organized and regulated, excesses prevented, and a minimum of common rules established, so as not to favour exploiters of all kinds. While it is always good to grasp freedom, it must not lead to the law of the strongest."
"That is why we do not oppose movement, but everything that resembles the generalization of the law of the strongest."
"Mr President, the world gets smaller every day, and this is now so obviously the case that the globalization of the economy is something which everyone accepts as normal."
"By the same token, what may start as minor monetary turbulence in south east Asian markets in the morning can turn into a crash on the New York stock exchange by the afternoon."
"This is what we have been witnessing recently."
"Although this may shock us adults, because when we were born there was still such a thing as distances, borders, and so on, young people today regard it as normal and part of the world we live in."
"Mr Sainjon's motion for a resolution on relocation is excellent. It is well-reasoned and well- founded, although perhaps somewhat self-willed."
"Thus, it states in recital A, ""whereas globalization of trade, production and investment is an opportunity which should be turned to good account while limiting its adverse effects' , and adds, quite rightly, in recital C that ""relocation is a logical economic development, which should not be approached from an ideological point of view' ."
"Naturally, amongst the economic issues, we must consider everything relating to areas, products, costs, markets and the exchange rates for the euro, the dollar and other weaker currencies."
"That is something that must always be taken into account."
"The report deals extensively with the relationship between foreign direct investment, usually capital investment, and relocation - which, as everyone knows, consists of the transfer of the means of production to another country or the establishment of those means through direct investment."
"It focuses on a set of concepts consisting of everything relating to aid, promotional measures, incentives and strategies which countries outside the European Union directly or indirectly employ."
"Lastly, Mr Sainjon asks a question which is perhaps the key to understanding relocation: are globalization of trade and relocation of production in the developing countries responsible for the rise of unemployment in Europe?"
"I sincerely believe that they are not."
"The United States, for example, has an unemployment rate lower than the Community average and its citizens generally have higher incomes."
"I do not believe that that is the reason, therefore."
"The reason for unemployment must be sought elsewhere."
"I would like to end by saying that it will be difficult to stem the tide."
"In any event, I think this is an interesting report, and I shall be voting for it."
"Mr President, Mr Sainjon's report is interesting and rich in original ideas, pragmatic and not too ideological."
"The rapporteur was not for one minute tempted to restate the benefits of the free market and had the courage to dismiss some false theories about unemployment and relocation."
"For example, technology does not inevitably result in unemployment. It actually stimulates relocation as most manufacturers prefer the option of flexible production, even if mostly automated, to a poorly qualified workforce, even if costs are extremely low."
"The free market places the consumer at the centre of things, putting a premium on product specialization and innovation rather than low prices, pure and simple, so that planning and production again feel the need to stay close to the market."
"In the Sainjon report, therefore, the multinationals are re-evaluated as the driving force for prosperity through job-creating investment as well as promoters of the modern job culture, acting as ambassadors and almost de facto social operators in developing countries through their voluntary codes of self-regulation."
"It seems clear from the rapporteur's analysis, as many people have come to recognize, that the conditions in an area that attract investment and hence the creation of quality jobs are always more associated with high-profile technical facilities, or in other words the quality of education and training."
"They are associated with communication and transport infrastructures, networks that link into the world market."
"To these conditions I would add, as does Mr Sainjon to some extent, certainty and clarity in legislation."
"I also say this as a message to our country, Mr President, Italy, which has a reputation for paying scant attention to the rules governing intellectual property and has excessively complex tax and employment laws which discourage entrepreneurial activity and may even encourage relocation out of the country."
"I endorse the rapporteur's suggestion that structural funds should be increasingly directed towards providing support for research and technology programmes for businesses."
"I am less convinced by the proposal to ask for the repayment of finance granted to businesses that then relocate. I think it would be more realistic to suspend payments and put these businesses on a black list."
"To round off quickly, I congratulate the rapporteur on the work he has done."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Liberal Group has problems with the Sainjon report, for three reasons."
"First of all, the title does not cover the subject."
"The report is supposed to deal with relocation and foreign direct investment in third countries."
"Well, a large part of the resolution relates to socio-economic policy within the European Union or concerns recommendations on the introduction of the euro."
"These matters are outside the scope of this report and the competence of the Committee on External Economic Relations."
"The second reason why my group has problems with this report concerns its basic assumptions."
"Mr Sainjon bases his conclusions and resolution on an industrial society which no longer exists."
"In this context, I am glad that at least my amendment to recital B of the report has been included, referring to the new economic and social force of the information society and all the consequences that will have on world trade and further globalization."
"I have also referred to the MIA, the OECD multilateral investment agreement, which needs to be established as soon as possible."
"But other essential amendments that I submitted have not been included."
"This is the third reason why the report as it now stands is not acceptable to my group."
"We have therefore tabled another twelve amendments again."
"In fact, the Sainjon report is not a well-considered project."
"Tomorrow, before the vote, my group will submit a request for the report to be referred back to the Committee on External Economic Relations so that a more balanced report can be achieved within that Committee."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are debating hundreds of thousands of jobs sacrificed or threatened in the European Union by relocations carried out by firms in the name of competitiveness and lower costs."
"Labour-intensive industries are the most affected. But services are increasingly involved."
"The firms which are relocating, from Hoover to Renault, are obeying the liberal creed of the European Commission which Jacques Delors expressed in his day by the formula that in the large market, everyone sets up where the conditions are best."
"Now, where conditions are best is where profit is highest."
"This relocation therefore sets peoples and territories against each other in competition, playing on social and wage differentials, and subjecting state aid to blackmail."
"Relocation often takes place without warning or consultation of unions and local councillors, regardless of the interests of employees and their families, regardless of the economic future of the regions."
"Measures must effectively be taken at national and Community level to prevent social dumping."
"I am afraid the code of conduct for multinational companies, proposed in the committee report, and which is not even compulsory, constitutes only a feeble barrage against the multinationals, who do not include morality in their strategy."
"So what impact can the rapporteur's recommendation to the European multinationals about the moral duty to ""be in the vanguard of social progress' have?"
"Is it naivety?"
"That is why our group is putting forward other measures, on the one hand to call into question the current process of liberalization and deregulation launched by Brussels, on the other hand to establish new rights for wage-earners so that they can safeguard their social gains, defend their jobs and control the use of state aid to companies."
"To fight against social dumping, we also propose including social and environmental clauses in all trade agreements and taxing capital movements to divert them towards productive, job-creating investment."
"I am also disturbed by paragraph 5 of the resolution which calls for a speedy conclusion to the OECD Multilateral investment Agreement."
"This position corresponds to the American strategy to accelerate unconditional liberalization of the world market."
"That is why our group has tabled an amendment so that culture and audio-visual are excluded from these negotiations."
"Mr President, we Greens are by no means against relocation, on the contrary!"
"In the right circumstances it can make an important contribution to regional development as long as it is done with regard for the political environment in the developing country, and along humane and socially positive lines."
"Mercedes should by all means manufacture in Brazil."
"But a worker in a subsidiary there must have the same rights to trade union membership there as his colleague here."
"A French firm should certainly be able to manufacture radios in south-east Asia, but the health of the female employees there is just as important as that of a female employee in the first world."
"The trouble is the neo-liberal project of free movement of free capital forces third world and threshold countries in particular into a horrendous competition to attract the investment with maximum tax exemption, the worst job protection and the lowest wages."
"We have long since known that low wage costs are not the critical factor for the majority of industrial relocations."
"But some people clearly think they can not only conquer new markets, but profit unobtrusively from disgraceful conditions and cover up the operation."
"This is precisely why global players need binding rules ."
"Voluntary codes of conduct will not do."
"It is our responsibility to get our firms to make a commitment."
"European companies which duck European standards abroad must be excluded from all EU grants."
"Bonuses for starvation wages and environmental pollution?"
"That is ironic to say the least!"
"In view of this we would also ask for support for our amendments. The Sainjon report is long since overdue, because the OECD negotiated a multilateral investment agreement ages ago which tackles national agreements and political influence."
"Tomorrow we shall of course vote for agreement on this report."
"We have had a very good hearing and a thorough discussion."
"To Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel can only quote a saying from football: a miss is as good as mile!"
"Mr President, it appears from Mr Sainjon's report that the relocation of activity is not a massive phenomenon."
"It is also not so much the result of differences in labour costs, but of newly discovered markets."
"So governments find it difficult to get a grip on the situation."
"Against that background analysis, it is rather odd that the rest of the rapporteur's report is rather ""dirigiste' ."
"He proposes a Community strategy with harmonization, codes of conduct and a European social identity."
"He even wishes to set up a multinational social ""mission' ."
"Does Mr Sainjon consider such a concept to be realistic?"
"Although we appreciate his work, we do not wish to take the route the rapporteur indicates."
"Too much complex government interference gives rise to high costs."
"These undermine the competitiveness of European companies and their ability to create jobs."
"The business climate is served by decentralization and by the reduction in and improvement of legislation."
"Unfortunately not enough attention is paid to that in the report."
"I do agree with Mr Sainjon's argument in favour of greater priority being given to development and innovation."
"The basic assumption here is that this is mainly a task for the Member States."
"European cooperation has a supplementary role of creating favourable preconditions."
"Mr President, we did not expect to find Mr Sainjon subscribing to remarks Sir Leon Brittan might have made, because after reading this report, what is left of relocation?"
"Very little."
"It is not so widespread, it is not due to differences in wage costs, or hardly at all, and it has virtually no link with the growth in unemployment in our countries."
"Better still, it is usually beneficial and should therefore be encouraged."
"And the few negative effects it might have at the margin just need to be corrected by using optional mechanisms, voluntary codes of conduct, hypothetical confidence contracts."
"Those of us who are local councillors living in the day-to-day world of relocation, and the uprooting, the collapse of the structure of areas, the massive job losses, the economic and social destabilization it causes, will not recognize it in this simplistic and naively idyllic report."
"Of course, no company has the right to eternal survival, but why refuse to ask questions about the regulatory provisions which would make it possible to discipline globalization, to check the perversity of a mechanism which does away with jobs in Europe without creating a multiplier effect of development in the recipient countries?"
"Why not try an objective balance sheet of these free zones, which are multiplying in the developing countries?"
"Why not analyze the perverse effects of European subsidies which become causal factors, at the origin of numerous relocation decisions, like the ECIIP programme and even certain projects supported by Phare and Tacis."
"The rapporteur has lost sight of his objective on the way, overcome by the dominant expertise."
"That is a great pity."
"It will be necessary to take up this important subject again quickly, but in a different way, on a more realistic basis."
"Mr President, this report is comprehensive and ambitious and I generally welcome its tone."
"I congratulate Mr Sainjon on the report and on his speech introducing it at the session."
"I would say to Mr Souchet that if there is common ground between what Mr Sainjon says and what I think and am about to say that is because we have both seen the facts of life which do not correspond to some of the more ideological statements that are made about this subject."
"I will not go into the more peripheral issues which Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel complained were not covered in the debate and still less will I go into the question of what should or should not be in the resolution."
"But I believe that the report is right to take the view that outward foreign direct investment brings considerable benefits, both to the source of the investment and the country that receives it."
"That was well recognized by Mr Caudron."
"Moreover, it must be seen in the context of investment liberalization as a whole because you have to look not only at investment from European countries overseas but also investment by overseas companies into the European Union and I have no doubt at all that the Union benefits greatly from inward foreign direct investment."
"I am heartened to see that the report does not get swept up in the rhetoric which sometimes surrounds this subject and in particular the idea that outward foreign direct investment comes about as a result of unfair competition from low wage countries."
"That is a very limited phenomenon and most foreign direct investment in fact takes place for market access reasons."
"That was explained very well, both by Mr Malerba and Mr Valdivielso de Cué who explained the complexity of the factors that are really responsible for unemployment in the European Union."
"Even if the problems caused by relocation are much less great than are sometimes presented, nonetheless it is obviously a matter of concern for specific sectors and it is certainly a matter of concern to the public at large."
"We should, therefore, all be looking for ways to reduce such negative impact as relocation has."
"I am glad, therefore, that the report has addressed this issue head on and looked into ways in which European firms could improve their competitiveness and thereby make it possible for them to continue production in Europe."
"The ideas put forward in the report on technological innovation are very welcome."
"I am pleased to note the approach which has been taken with regard to a code of conduct relating to social standards for firms investing in third countries."
"It is a sensible and pragmatic approach which recognizes the balance between maximizing the benefits which inward investment brings a country, while not acting as a disincentive to investors."
"It has long been clear, in fact, that in overall terms the employees of multi-nationals in developing countries are paid more, receive more training and work in better conditions than workers in equivalent domestic firms."
"That really is contrary to the implication of some of the things said by Mr Querbes."
"Furthermore, largely as a result of increased consumer awareness, there has been a recent trend towards the elaboration of codes of conduct by businesses themselves, most notably in the United States, as Mr Malerba pointed out."
"For those who decry the value of codes of conduct, let me point out that they are really, for those who create them, a rod for their own back because they certainly provide a benchmark against which they can be judged and are judged and therefore are something that has to be taken seriously."
"I believe that it is on the role that the Commission has to play in the process of creating codes of conduct as set out in paragraph 1 of the resolution that our thinking to some extent diverges and virtually only there."
"I would see the best role for the Commission as one of supporting businesses in the elaboration of their own codes, where such report is requested, rather than in seeking to impose a code."
"At the political level, the Commission has been active in seeking to improve both international labour standards and environmental standards."
"It was the Commission that proposed to the Council an initiative on trade and labour standards prior to the Singapore WTO Ministerial Meeting but that approach was not taken up."
"Nevertheless, the Commission continues to support the work of the IMO in this field and to look at means to improve standards, for example through the generalized system of preferences."
"I therefore conclude by saying that this report has been salutary in sweeping aside some of the misconceptions, pointing out some of the realities and making some practical proposals, many of which we can agree with, for a realistic approach towards this complex problem."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Denominations and specifications of Euro coins"
"The next item is the report (A4-0334/97) by Mrs Soltwedel-Schäfer, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy on the proposal for a Council Regulation on denominations and specifications of euro coins (COM(97)0247 - C.-0304/97-97/0154(SYN))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to present a technical report on monetary union today, but make it clear at the same time that monetary union will find its physical expression coin by coin."
"The report is about the type of coins which, in the opinion of the European Parliament and now the Commission, European consumers will be using for their daily purchases from 2002."
"In my opinion four points are important for this report and for the decisions of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy."
"The number of denominations of European coins should be restricted to four - not the eight recommended by the Commission."
"I would propose eliminating the 2 cent and 20 cent coins."
"I would argue emphatically that fewer coins are easier for the user to manage and the increasing use of electronic payment systems for small amounts will further reduce the number of cash transactions like this."
"The second point is important."
"This is the diameter of coins."
"To make them easier to distinguish, especially for blind and low-vision users, I would like to see these increase in size according to their value."
"The plan we have from the Commission for this is a bit of a muddle, not a clear system."
"Contrary to the Commission's suggestion that there should be several series of coins varying in thickness but of more or less the same diameter, the suggestion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy would have the advantage that the weight of new coins could be considerably reduced."
"My third point is that, for reasons of forgery prevention and user friendliness the new coins in all Member States should be the same on both sides."
"This is not so much a technical point as a national and emotional consideration."
"At least this is what has aroused most interest in the media."
"I have been working on this suggestion, which has the approval of the Committee on Economics and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, that an individual national face could indeed symbolize the variety of Member States in the EU, but this would mean - and the Commission also proposes this - that the user, believe it or not, would be dealing with up to 120 different coins."
"How do we get that figure?"
"This is what we would have if there were 8 national denominations of different design in each of 15 Member States."
"In that case we could hardly ensure fast and reliable recognition of individual coins."
"Health aspects of euro coins also play an important role."
"So I was particularly concerned that the 1 euro and 2 euro coins were to use alloys containing nickel, as the Commission proposed."
"Nickel can cause allergic reactions when it comes into contact with human skin."
"This is also emphasized in the Swedish government report."
"Indeed Sweden does not use any nickel in its coins at all."
"As it can cause allergies, we request that no nickel is used in the coins - and this goes for all other products like earrings, chains and watch cases."
"That was the original proposal."
"A majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy rejected it, however, so I myself have gone for the compromise amendment which now proposes a compound of nickelfree stainless steel and nickel bronze for the coins in question."
"This would not only reduce the nickel content of the coins, but more importantly release the nickel when coins were used."
"At the same time it would satisfy another requirement of the report, that the new coins should if possible use recyclable materials."
"This is not without importance, on the contrary it is very important."
"The question has often come up in Committee to what extent our work is relevant at all."
"Have the nations not already decided for themselves what they want to do?"
"What is our role here as a Parliament?"
"Irrespective of what fellow members think, for example, about the national face of the coin - and this may well be controversial - we are certainly agreed on one point, that the Committee takes it for granted - likewise the House tomorrow - that this report, as presented and agreed on, will be taken seriously, although the German Finance Ministry for one has already said that what this European parliament decides does not interest them, they are making their own coins, they are going to have their national face."
"They do not care what we say!"
"I cannot imagine this kind of thing being possible under the new Amsterdam resolutions."
"I also believe there is considerable unanimity among Members that Parliament does work, makes decisions and thus creates a platform for action and is not just wasting its time!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for thousands of years coins have been our conventional means of payment."
"They are made of widely differing alloys, all sorts of different metals have been used."
"This tradition will no doubt continue, even if competition from electronic money will have some influence on the volume required."
"The Group of the European People's Party has submitted a number of proposals amending the SoltwedelSchäfer report."
"As regards denominations, Mrs Soltwedel-Schäfer, you said not four, but six different coins would be manufactured."
"We also believe that increasing size, diameter and weight, and of course the edges too, are primarily important for identifying these coins."
"Short and tall, young and old, but also eleven million sight-impaired people will have to handle these coins in future."
"So this is of vital importance."
"We are also particularly concerned about forgery prevention, especially for the larger denomination coins, but also as regards recognition by coin-operated machines."
"We know, and have taken account of this in our amendments, that is why a compound including nickel and copper is needed."
"And we support that."
"We are familiar with the reports and aware that we also have to differentiate between various allergenic elements in assessing the matter."
"We feel it is important and the Group of the European People's Party has therefore proposed the national face, because the national symbol will give citizens a degree of confidence when it comes to the change."
"In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy we were very sorry that we were in a minority and the majority voted against the national face."
"I am delighted that Alan Donnelly has now taken the lead here, has nailed these colours to his group mast and is introducing this."
"We have said we would like to see six denominations."
"But I think later on in the next phase we shall also have to think about a larger denomination, probably a 5-Euro piece, because the automated machinery industry, and especially industry that makes profits from slot-machine sales, will be entitled to enter the market with the possibility of larger denominations, to offer these and operate them with coins."
"We are also keen on the idea of gold."
"The 100 euro coin should in future - and Mr Stevens and Mrs Randzio-Plath have consistently repeated this - be made of gold."
"I just feel that this follows an old tradition which might well be considered in future and also help to reduce high gold reserves."
"I believe this has real value."
"I trust our amendments will receive positive approval tomorrow and then we can look forward to the future with our new coins!"
"Mr President, for some inexplicable reason the proposal for a Council regulation on materials to be used in euro coins seems to be centered solely on the copper system, neglecting the use of stainless steel which can also be defined as the European silver symbolizing world leadership as represented by the member countries of the Union as a whole, in terms of both quality and quantity."
"As well as reminding you of the role of this material, which more than any other is identified with our technological age and at the same time meets the expectations of the public in terms of hygiene, recyclability, permanence and availability at reasonable cost, I should like to stress that, in the specific sector of coin minting, stainless steel covers 20 per cent of world requirements as it is present in dozens of countries on the five continents and it has always been present in the European Union."
"This product of Europe cannot fail to be used in the largest coin minting operation in human history, to be replaced for example by solutions such as Nordic Gold as imposed by Sweden which will not even be joining in the single currency, or copper-plated iron, an extremely high-cost, high-tech solution, which results in a non-recyclable product which is affected by corrosion and wear over a short period and cannot be disposed of in the rubbish as it is ecotoxic."
"We have estimated that some 250 million euros would be saved in the supply of coin blanks due to the lower cost of stainless steel alloys compared with copper-based ones."
"Any controversy linked to scientific terrorism raised by the issue of nickel would be completely smoothed out by a selection inclined towards stainless steel as, both in the types without nickel and those containing it, scientific research has recently shown that these steels are non-allergenic."
"Finally, what is there to say about recyclability which affects 50 per cent of the rolled section from which the coins will be made?"
"Whereas stainless steel will be recycled into consumer goods and investment for the everyday life of the citizen, what is to be done with the other materials which have no other use except as new coins, like copper-plated iron which, once discarded, is no use for working iron or copper, as it is contaminated?"
"Mr President, please do not think that I have taken up a new career as a representative of stainless steel."
"However, from a reading of the Council's report, which was the result of three or four years' work by the mints of the fifteen member countries, what clearly emerges is the offence caused to many European citizens who see a metal they are already used to, stainless steel, being kept out of their pockets for no valid reason."
"In other words copper has had it all its own way, not to mention the offence caused to us European parliamentarians who now find ourselves having to decide and give an opinion at short notice."
"New production capacity will have to be devised and new solutions found to dispose of the copper used in the process."
"I personally believe that this House should reject what the Council has come up with."
"The number of coins seems well-balanced but, as far as the symbols of the Member States are concerned, I wonder what blind people will have to do to tell one state from the other."
"I have presented two amendments with which I wished to improve on Mrs Soltwedel's amendments."
"However, I do not think the report has been analyzed in sufficient depth and the amendments have been discussed in vain."
"Mr President, as long as small coins exist they should be nickel-free."
"In certain alloys the nickel can come out."
"The risk of nickel allergies are then obvious for people who regularly handle coins."
"Such continuous handling affects significant groups in various sectors, such as cashiers in the retail sector, in restaurants, in the postal service and in public transport."
"The Swedish system using coins which are nickel-free should be taken as an example."
"The interests of the nickel industry should not be set up against people's health."
"The future of the euro is to say the least uncertain, but it should at least not be harmful to our physical health."
"Mr President, we are debating these national symbols as if this were a discussion on whether the nations' currencies should still be preserved."
"This is obviously an emotionally delicate issue, but, nevertheless, I would like to stress the practicalities of the matter."
"You cannot have a hundred and twenty different coins circulating in the EU area."
"It would be awfully confusing."
"And the visually impaired, of whom there are more than ten million, would certainly come off the worst as a result."
"Apart from that, coins bearing the symbols of the, let us say, smaller nations will not be so readily accepted in other countries, while the smaller economies will certainly be swamped with coins bearing the legends of the bigger countries."
"I therefore consider this enthusiasm for national symbols to be going a bit too far."
"The report is otherwise excellent."
"We should also make the Commission appreciate the real danger of nickel to health."
"Mr President, this report on the specification of euro coins has become extremely dubious because of action by the Socialist and Green Groups."
"What strikes me most here, is that the proposed amendments run counter to the arguments used."
"First of all, eight coins would be too many."
"Six would be enough."
"So the two and the twenty cent euro coins should be scrapped."
"The logic escapes me completely."
"Because in this way on average you will need more coins per transaction!"
"And the consumer will more quickly get tired of having a purse that is too heavy."
"That certainly does not contribute to the euro being more readily accepted."
"Secondly, national symbols on the coins would be undesirable, because they would create confusion and facilitate fraud."
"However, coins with a full European character offer the average citizen no additional means of identifying them."
"The degree of acceptance therefore greatly decreases."
"The European Parliament should be more realistic on this point."
"In the Commission's proposal, the coins have sufficient Community characteristics in order to be able to distinguish counterfeit ones from real ones."
"Thirdly, it would be wrong to use nickel in coins."
"Coins are, however, not jewellery that comes into contact with the skin throughout the day."
"In the Netherlands we do not have any problems with nickel in coins."
"It is an excellent, durable material."
"You do not have to melt coins down so often and mint new ones."
"The fuss that is made about it is completely unwarranted and not in the interests of public health and the environment."
"If the European Parliament does not step back, there is a considerable risk that it will become more remote from the ordinary citizen than the Council and the Commission put together."
"Mr President, the feeling of European nations about their money is a part of their common culture."
"This applies especially to their usage of it, their sayings about money and the names they call it."
"The argument about the names euro and cent to replace ECU is one indication of this."
"But let us take comfort from an old European proverb: ""Money talks the same language everywhere' ."
"I would welcome it if in future the European Parliament would express an opinion not only on coins, but banknotes too."
"I consider it quite inadequate, although it has sound historical precedent but this is not applicable to the future, that we as a European Parliament do not have a legal role as regards all types of money."
"But back to coins."
"They should be convenient to use, counterfeit-proof, attractive, solid and good value."
"They will come, but I think there are still several problems."
"I would like to support my colleagues; we need six coins, not eight."
"This really is in the interests of users, forgery prevention and greater legal security."
"I, in fact, would rather not abandon the smallest coin, because in all European countries the so-called lucky penny is important, so it is right that the European Parliament only proposes eliminating the 2 and 20 cent denominations."
"I would also like to deal with the subject of European money ""on both sides of the coin' ."
"In the end it is no doubt important that we have a European coin."
"But I also know that it is important at the moment for acceptance of the euro and in view of people's uncertainty about it that we give them a feeling of security and allow for the sentimental importance of this coin."
"In the longer term retailers in the Bavarian Forest, in Nîmes in France or Mons in Belgium cannot all be expected to accept different reverse sides, but for a transition period it will be absolutely essential for the people themselves. We want to be clear about one thing."
"We want a euro we can get a grip of, something that can really can be grasped in the hand and gives everybody the feeling that it really is their euro."
"The discussion on the use of nickel, from the point of view of user safety and the health considerations is a step forward."
"Let me just end with another point."
"I think the Sub-committee on Currency has made a constructive suggestion to compensate for the lack of judicial competence with regard to bank notes."
"We really do want a 100 Euro gold coin."
"It's not just a question of payment transactions, but to encourage the investment idea at the same time and for economic reasons to help - as my colleague has already suggested - to run down gold reserves in a profitable way."
"Mr President, Christa Randzio-Plath does not have to worry that everyone in Mons and in Germany will pay with other coins."
"After the summer, everyone in the Netherlands will pay with coins with German reverse sides."
"I am sure of that."
"This report has unexpectedly become very important for the man in the street."
"Parliament must take important decisions."
"First, on the number of coins."
"I think it is no bad thing to have scrapped two of the coins."
"Unlike Christa Randzio-Plath, I think it is a pity that we have not scrapped the one cent coin."
"In the Netherlands we have done without a one cent coin for years and everyone is quite happy about it."
"Secondly, there is the matter of whether or not we can use nickel."
"In my group it is a very sensitive subject and there is even the possibility that the whole group will vote against the report if the defence against nickel remains in it."
"It is just nonsense."
"In the Netherlands we have all kinds of nickel coins and it is simply nonsense that it would lead to problems."
"There has not been a single complaint about it."
"The third decision is the national face of the euro."
"I am absolutely opposed to Mr Metten's amendment to design the coins with two European sides."
"I am in favour, and my group will agree with my amendment on this, of keeping a national face on the new coins."
"I am convinced that it will make it easier for people to accept the new coin."
"The coins can happily circulate in the European Union."
"They do not have to be brought back to the country of origin."
"They are valid everywhere and the arguments that it will not be possible use them in slot machines, that they will be easier to forge, are complete rubbish."
"Slot machines do not react to the flat surface of the coin."
"Slot machines react to the diameter, to the material and to the milled edge or whatever kind of edge it is."
"So it is all rubbish."
"One of the reasons I am in favour of a national face for the euro stems from the fact that there has been a policy of lack of information."
"I must say that I find it particularly unfortunate that Mr de Silguy is not here, because I do not readily speak about someone who is not here."
"Up to now the information has been purely passive."
"There seems to be some disagreement between Mr de Silguy and the Dutch Minister of Finance as a result of which the man in the street in the Netherlands is completely in the dark about the European currency."
"There has evidently not been any accord about an agreement and I would call upon both gentlemen to ensure that the Dutch citizen obtains what he is entitled to: information about the euro."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission presented its proposal for a regulation on 29 May."
"We have to bear in mind that this proposal only concerns the denominations and technical specifications of metal coins intended for circulation."
"Other aspects raised in the rapporteur's report such as the existence of a national face or the issuing of gold coins for collectors are not mentioned at all in the Commission's proposed regulation."
"The vote taken at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy welcomes the position expressed in the rapporteur's report which rejects the principle of having a national face on euro coins, reduces the number of coins from eight to six, attempts to alter the dimensions completely and finally calls for the elimination of nickel from the metal composition of the coins."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I think it is really necessary and urgent to get down to basics."
"First of all, allow me to remind you that the Commission's proposal is based on a thorough technical appraisal carried out by directors of the various national mints."
"This proposal is therefore the result of a lengthy consultation process involving the business sector, consumers' organizations and associations for blind people."
"These consultations, conducted in a serious and thorough manner, enabled a series of specifications to be produced which were acceptable to all the users."
"That is not all. The Commission's proposals were unanimously approved by the Ecofin Council and three Member States have already chosen and publicized their national faces while other countries are in the process of doing the same."
"Now it is extremely clear that any re-examination in this House of the points raised in Mrs Soltwedel-Schäfer's report will make it impossible to meet the deadline of 1 January 2002 for putting the new coins and banknotes into circulation."
"This date, which already represents a very tight deadline, is to be postponed by at least one year, maybe even two."
"This constitutes a very real risk of damaging the image of the Community institutions in the eyes of Europe's citizens and creating a feeling of confusion."
"After an information campaign which has already been launched in various states, how do we explain to the public that the new coins will not arrive in their pockets in 2002 as they had been told but one or two years later?"
"And for what reason?"
"Because in Brussels they could not agree whether the coins should or should not have a national face."
"Frankly, I do not think that the citizens of Europe would understand a postponement of the date of introduction for this reason."
"From a formal point of view, the Council of Europe in Madrid in 1995 and the Ecofin Council have already taken the decisions, in due time and fully within the framework of their powers, which are disputed in the report: the principle of national faces, the colour, number and size of the coins and the composition and technical characteristics of the coins."
"Certainly, eight coins may seem too many but there is an important reason for this."
"I now address myself to the rapporteur in particular: you have to take into account the fact that each state has completely different custom and practice with regard to the use of metal coins and only with a full range of denominations will it be possible to establish naturally the correct relationship between the currency in circulation and the denomination of the coins concerned."
"In substance, we are not in agreement with the various objections raised in Mrs Soltwedel-Schäfer's report."
"Mr President, several speakers have mentioned the nickel problem."
"I entirely agree that nickel should obviously not be present in euro coins."
"Prudence alone dictates that nickel should not be present."
"Nickel is, moreover, the most common cause of contact allergies in Europe and in the industrialized countries."
"There is, however, another problem which people perhaps have not thought of. It is the issue of equality and class."
"Who handles coins with their own hands especially often?"
"Not the powers that be, nor the business leaders, but young women."
"20 % of young women suffer from nickel allergy."
"They are, for example, supermarket cashiers and shop assistants."
"So it is young, defenceless women who are affected by nickel allergy."
"It would therefore be quite scandalous if an assembly like this, which is ever so slightly dominated by middle-aged and older men, should decide over the heads of Europe's young women that there will be nickel in the coins."
"I therefore really hope that we insist that there shall be no nickel in the coins."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we want to encourage acceptance, I do not think it is enough just to say we are going to have a national face."
"That is just a sop!"
"If people are anxious about what is coming to them with the euro, it is because the part this euro is going to play in creating an economic, social and employment policy which is in their own interests has not been convincingly explained to them."
"To try and respond to this by offering a sentimental little sweetener, is surely not good enough!"
"Either we must succeed in making the euro a political project of which people can say, this is a good thing, this is valuable, this is worth going for, or we shall have nationalist reactions."
"We shall have reactions of political apathy and people will say goodbye to their hopes for the future."
"We shall not be able to confront this by finding a good powerful national symbol!"
"I certainly do not know what symbol would have this unifying force in Germany!"
"I would have to think hard for Italy too, and Spain and Portugal, which I know a bit about, and I get gooseflesh at the very thought of what national symbols they might come up with!"
"This is not the right way."
"We really must all make up our minds to go ahead with the euro as a project which is valuable and worth supporting for the broad masses of Europe, and not seek acceptance by encouraging emotional reactions and nationalist feelings."
"That is surely the wrong way!"
"Mr President, I fail to understand why it gives the previous speaker gooseflesh to think of the symbols that Spain and Portugal might put on their currencies."
"Mr President, my colleague Yves de Silguy has asked me to convey to the House his apologies for not being able to be present this evening."
"He has to attend the Ecofin Council which is making preparations for the Employment Summit."
"Naturally that was a very important call on his time."
"I am certain that when I tell him that he has been the subject of criticism by Mrs Peijs he will be devastated, not least because he recognized her concern for the understanding that is needed for the man-in-the-street and I presume the woman-in-thestreet in the Netherlands and elsewhere."
"He will probably want to remind her that the Commission has actually, with this very problem in mind, offered a financial contribution to the Netherlands Government of ECU 1.5 million to assist in the programme of encouraging understanding of the implications of the introduction of the euro."
"Consequently, it may be that Mrs Peijs will want to add to her view of my colleague another campaign to get the government to take up the ECU 1.5 million offer."
"On 29 May the Commission, acting in accordance with article 105(a) of the Treaty presented its proposal for a regulation on denominations and technical specifications of euro coins."
"Between now and 1 January 2002, 70 billion coins will have to be produced for distribution to the population in the Member States participating in the euro."
"Obviously the task is challenging, although the Finance Ministers will be able to take a formal decision on the matter only after the Heads of State and of Government have decided on the list of countries that will participate from 1 January 1999 in the third stage of the euro."
"It is imperative that a decision be taken by the end of the year if this challenge is to be met in good time."
"The House will recall that the Commission therefore asked that this issue be treated as a matter of urgency and my colleagues and I regret that Parliament did not accept that request."
"The rapporteur, Mrs Soltwedel-Schäfer, raised four main points of disagreement with the Commission's proposal and I should like to take each point in turn after a brief description of the process by which the proposal was drawn up."
"And I would like to give some brief attention to the substance of the proposal."
"First, on the formulation of the proposal, that was the subject of thorough preparation by the Member States mint directors and this has guaranteed the project's industrial feasibility in accordance with the timetable laid down by the Madrid European Council in December 1995."
"It is the culmination of a lengthy consultation process with all the business sectors concerned, with consumer associations and with organizations representing blind people."
"In the course of the consultation, successive changes were made to the planned characteristics of euro coins."
"We now have a set of specifications that is acceptable to all users or at least to those authentic representative organizations that were assessing the matter on behalf of users."
"The proposal is therefore based on criteria of public acceptability, technical feasibility and public health."
"It is a balanced proposal that is consistent with industrial constraints and with the requirements of users."
"Secondly, the proposal provides for eight denominations as is clear from everything that has been said in the House."
"One, two, five, ten, twenty and fifty cents and one and two euro coins."
"That provision reflects the experience gained in all the Member States and it ensures consistency with the planned denominations for euro notes."
"The number and sequence of coins have been decided in response to the needs of all consumers and take account of differing national circumstances."
"In some Member States the value of the smallest coin in circulation is roughly one cent."
"In others, such as Belgium, it is nearer to two cents."
"The technical specifications relating to diameter, weight, thickness, shape, colour, composition, edge-milling and edge-lettering have been drawn up so as to guarantee easy identification of the coins and to meet the needs of the main user groups, in particular since I know this is of considerable interest to Members of the House, the blind and visually impaired people."
"The specifications also provide guarantees against counterfeiting, in particular in the case of the higher denomination coins."
"Lastly, they accommodate the public health concerns that have been voiced here in this House and elsewhere and they provide the necessary guarantees in this respect."
"I would like to refer now to the four main points of divergence between the Commission and the rapporteur."
"First, the question of the national face."
"The Commission would point out that the decision in principle to have a national symbol on euro coins was taken in April 1996 by the Finance Ministers and confirmed in June of that year by the Florence European Council."
"Since then all the preparatory work has been based on that decision, with the result that if it was called into question, the entire programme for introducing the euro would be disrupted."
"It is essential to note that the European design competition which was launched in the spring of 1996 and ratified by the Amsterdam European Council relates to only one of the faces and three Member States have already unveiled their design for the national face: France, Germany and Belgium."
"The other Member States concerned are about to do so."
"Secondly the issue of the abandonment of the two euro coins and the 20 cent coin has been postulated in the course of this debate."
"The number of coins planned was obviously not chosen at random."
"The system of eight coins was adopted in order to be consistent with the euro notes and in the light of national practices."
"It is designed to facilitate, as much as is humanly possible, rounding up and accounting operations throughout the euro zone."
"That is essential obviously in order to safeguard consumers against covert increases in prices."
"Thirdly, on the issue of the simplification of the size of the coins, the system proposed by the Commission centers on a consensus amongst users which involves the Spanish flower shape for the 20 cent coin."
"(Interruption by Mr Jarzembowski) I knew that would get Mr Jarzembowski going."
"Three groups of coins with three different colours - red coins, yellow coins and coins in two colours - a difference of at least 2 mms between each coin in the same group and the different definitions of the edge, whether it is smooth or has a groove."
"If the Commission's proposal on the size and form of coins was called into question, it would run counter to the very terms of the consensus reached and it would hardly foster the acceptability of the euro for the general public which I know is a matter which generates enthusiasm amongst Members of the European Parliament."
"Fourthly, the divergence about the elimination of nickel is obviously a matter of importance."
"The public health requirements were of major concern to the Commission when it drew up its proposal."
"Thus the proposal restricts the use of nickel to the one and two euro coins."
"The volume of coins containing nickel will fall to 8 % compared with 75 % at the moment."
"The Commission would also remind Parliament that the Scientific Committee for Toxicity and Ecotoxicity, which was consulted at Parliament's request, concluded that the risks associated with the use of nickel in existing coins are infinitesimally small."
"The situation will improve further in future thanks to the Commission's proposal, in particular as contact with nickel will be significantly reduced."
"Finally, the Commission is at pains to emphasize that no technological validation or examination of existing production capacities has been carried out in respect of the alloys proposed by the rapporteur."
"I hope that the House will take serious note of the fact that if the amendments I have referred to were carried, it would mean that production of euro coins could not reliably start next year and would therefore jeopardize the deadline of 2002 and the introduction of notes and coins."
"In conclusion, for the reasons I have indicated, the Commission is unable to accept the rapporteur's amendments concerning the technical characteristics of euro coins."
"The Commission, however, shares Parliament's concerns about the need for a reliable and effective system and about the acceptability of the system to everyone in the Union."
"These principles have certainly guided the work of the Commission at all times."
"Therefore, the Commission is prepared to take up four amendments in its proposal."
"These are Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3 in part and the first paragraph of Amendment No 8."
"It will defend its new position before the Council and will do its utmost to ensure that a definitive decision can be taken before the end of the year since it is the responsibility of the Community institutions to adhere to the timetable for the introduction of the euro that was laid down two years ago by the Heads of State and of Government."
"I am most grateful for the attention of the House at this late hour."
"I feared that there was some possibility of this debate being taken before 8 p.m., thus denying me this immense pleasure."
"I am very glad that following the customary practices of the European Parliament, I need not have worried because the debate got going at about 10.30 p.m."
"Mr President, I must say that I do not like to be misinformed."
"Yesterday the information that I have just given about the Dutch campaign came from Mr de Silguy's office and was confirmed by the Commission's information office in the Hague."
"It is a practical proposal that is being obstructed by Brussels."
"I think that is very tedious."
"One of the items of information is not correct, either what we have been told this evening or what I was told yesterday."
"In both cases I find it unacceptable."
"Mr Peijs, I think this is another subject which we shall have to debate at a later date."
"We shall have to draw up a balance sheet for the information campaign on the Euro - ""Citizens First - Let's build Europe together' - because I believe it would be appropriate to see in one year's time how our money has been spent, in consistent figures, which are even higher than those stated by Commissioner Kinnock."
"But it is a debate we must have in due course."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Passenger ship safety"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-332/97), on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Council Directive on safety rules and standards for passenger ships (C4-0359/97-96/0041(SYN)) (Rapporteur: Mr Stenmarck)."
"Mr President, many people are critical of the European Parliament, perhaps often with some justification."
"However, one thing that no-one can criticize is that few people, if any, demand increased safety in shipping, aircraft or on our roads as successfully and as effectively as this Parliament."
"On numerous occasions the Members have stood as one and demanded action and measures from the Commission and have also made the Commission return with far-reaching proposals, all aimed at preventing new tragedies from occurring."
"That also happened after the Estonia disaster in September 1994."
"Following a number of initiatives in Parliament, that accident, in which more than 900 people lost their lives, has led to several decisions to increase safety levels in various ways."
"The matter which we now have to decide on is another example of this."
"Allow me in this context to take the opportunity to thank Commissioner Kinnock for his great commitment, not least on questions of safety."
"With the decision which we are going to make through this report, we are setting higher safety standards than before on ferries on purely national routes."
"This is important."
"There has never been any common legislation in the past."
"The national legislation has varied greatly from one country to the next."
"That also means that today's decision will have a very varied impact."
"Some of the Member States have for a long time given high priority to safety on this type of vessel."
"For the ferry companies in those countries, today's decision will have no far-reaching consequences."
"On the other hand, safety has lagged behind in other countries."
"We shall now make strong demands that a substantially higher level of safety is reached there than has so far been the case."
"What we are doing is taking the SOLAS Convention (Safety of Life at Sea), which has long been a convention on safety in international ferry traffic, and extending it to cover purely national ferry services too."
"The change which has taken place between the first and second reading of this report, and which is also the reason why the Council of Ministers has taken an unreasonably long time to deal with the question, has to do with rapid technical developments."
"The fast ferries which are now becoming more common on our seaways are therefore also going to be fully covered by the directive."
"That is, of course, a good thing."
"Let me point out that during the whole progress of this report, that is, for a period of two years, we have only really come up against one negative point of view."
"It comes from those who say this is going to cost money."
"That is certainly true, at least for those who have not previously invested in safety."
"My answer to those people is, and has always been, that there will probably be some things that will have to cost money."
"Safety at sea is one such example, if that makes it possible to avoid the kind of tragedy which has been far too common in recent decades."
"It is important that work on increasing safety is continued."
"A lot has been done in recent years, but there is probably a lot that remains to be done in the future too."
"Let me finally say thank you to all our colleagues on the Committee on Transport and Tourism for all their constructive points of view with regard to increasing safety on ferries around Europe."
"Mr President, safety at sea is a priority for us all in the European Parliament, in particular for the Socialist Group."
"Tonight we are pleased to be able to offer our full support to the rapporteur, Mr Stenmarck, who has, as ever, worked on this proposal for a directive with great skill and has steered the proposal through the committee with great speed."
"I am happy to endorse what he has just said and thank him, our staff and the Commission staff for producing a proposal which will significantly enhance safety at sea."
"Our argument is simply that millions of EU citizens travel by some form of maritime vehicle."
"They already believe they are protected by the EU."
"In some cases, alas, that is not so."
"Passenger ships involved in domestic voyages and international passenger ships engaged in voyages where they do not venture further than 20 miles from the nearest land are not covered at the moment by sufficient safeguards for safety and we are glad that the Commissioner has brought forward proposals to close these loopholes."
"Moreover, in the context of the single market, we think it is important - bearing in mind in 1993 maritime domestic trade was liberalized - that this measure will further consolidate the single market."
"We welcome it for that reason as well."
"It represents a single, simple, safe, harmonized regime that all sides of this House can support."
"However, I should like to focus the Commission's mind on another issue."
"This is one of many measures the Commissioner has been proudly associated with to enhance safety at sea."
"But the issue that now comes before Parliament is how we can best ensure that this measure and all the measures for safety at sea are swiftly implemented by Member States rigorously and fairly."
"Many of us on the committee are concerned that the good work of the Commissioner and of Parliament will come to very little unless Member States abide by the letter of the laws we agree in the European Union."
"Perhaps the Commissioner could comment briefly on how we can best work together in the coming year to ensure proposals such as this and the many others on port state control are effectively implemented by Member States."
"I would like to see a time when this Parliament could spend more time focusing on and reviewing the legislation that has already been agreed rather than commenting on and contemplating future legislation."
"We now have the ammunition and the tools we need to achieve safety at sea at a much higher and more acceptable level."
"We need to work with the Commissioner to ensure the good work he does and the good work we do with him can be implemented for the safety of the traveling public."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Commissioner, first of all I would like to thank my colleague Per Stenmarck for his excellent report."
"As usual, he has taken painstaking care with the question of shipping safety and passenger ships in particular."
"I think it is most important that we are at last tackling common European safety standards for passenger ships including those on inland waterways."
"It is important that we have common safety requirements for the construction of ships, fire prevention and the rescue equipment carried on board."
"I also consider it very important that we have useful common standards regardless of the class of passenger ship."
"I believe passenger confidence suffered a heavy blow, as Per Stenmarck rightly said, with the particularly severe and tragic accident in the Baltic Sea, and we have to regain their confidence in passenger ships."
"One small cause for complaint, Mr Commissioner, is that we still have no free marine cabotage; we are still using transitional regulations."
"Free competition is still not with us, but it is important that we agree on common safety regulations in preparation for liberalization."
"I am also pleased that Council, the Commission and Parliament have taken a common position on a number of aspects, for example, that states with superior regulations have a say on the use of ships from other countries."
"I consider it important that additional safety regulations can be applied internally for the safety of citizens, because hazardous situations vary greatly within the European Union."
"Allow me finally a particularly important practical query which my college Mr Watts has already mentioned."
"How do we ensure that the regular inspection of ships by the flag nations, as laid down in article 10 of the directive, is actually carried out?"
"I know we poor things are always the ones left talking between 11 p.m. and midnight, but we have almost got to enjoy it now."
"Perhaps, Mr Commissioner, you could describe again how the Commission, as part of its responsibility for controlling marine nations, will ensure here too in six or twelve months' time that the obligatory inspection of ships by the flag nations is actually carried out, so as to ensure safety standards are met in each case."
"How is the Commission going to organize this?"
"The question of control of Member States by the Commission is after all something we should all support."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen and Mr Commissioner, it is extremely important that we have clear, tough rules on safety at sea."
"As far as possible the rules should be international, global."
"They should therefore be largely consistent with the rules of the International Maritime Organization, of which all EU Member States are members."
"However, in practice the actual formulation of the rules varies greatly from country to country."
"In that context, the EU has an important complementary role to play in ensuring that the international conventions, in this case the SOLAS Convention, are implemented."
"It is good that the safety rules also apply to domestic trips, passengers and high-speed vessels."
"It is also good that, as well as safety of human life, which is the most important thing, and property, the directive also takes up the question of protecting the environment ."
"However, I have a point to make in connection with that."
"I think this formulation is far too superficial."
"It must therefore be reworded and made more definite to make it clearer what is intended by these three words so as to give the report a really definite meaning."
"The proposal for implementation is also good, as are the exemptions from the safety requirements."
"It appears well thought out through having an advisory committee on which both the Commission and representatives of the individual Member States are included. That bodes well for a better implementation."
"Since accidents in recent years have been shown to occur because of inadequate supervision of the rules, it is particularly important that these rules are supervised."
"Finally, I would like to say that no effort which can save human lives, property and the environment at sea should be spared."
"This directive should be seen as a part of that work."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the Committee on Transport and Tourism and, in particular, the rapporteur Mr Stenmarck for the work that has been done on the Council's common position on this measure."
"I am grateful for the constructive work which is clearly demonstrated by a number of amendments which are not only supportive but which considerably enhance the new provisions introduced by the Council."
"For that reason I will gladly accept the incorporation of all but one of the amendments in the Commission's reexamined proposal."
"Many of the amendments are intended to further improve the new provisions which the Council introduced in its common position in order to distinguish between high-speed passenger craft constructed after 1 January 1996 and those built before that date."
"I am pleased to see that the committee supports the Council and the Commission in its approach by also accommodating the new principle in the provision on surveys and certification."
"I therefore look forward to rapid progress with this legislation and I am also glad to accept Amendments Nos 6 and 7."
"Amendment No 3 proposes a full equivalence between the requirements for high-speed passenger craft engaged in domestic voyages and those on international voyages."
"Obviously it is entirely consistent with the main objective of this proposal and it will ensure that an equivalent level of safety will be achieved for all high-speed passenger craft operating in European Union waters, irrespective of whether they are engaged in domestic or international voyages."
"I am grateful to the committee for offering a pragmatic solution for small passenger ships of lightweight design operating at conventional speeds in sea areas of Class B, C and D. Subject to editorial improvements, Amendment No 2 will ensure that these designs will not be wrongly considered as high-speed passenger craft which might have been the case if the formula in the safety of life at sea definition for high-speed craft had been applied to them."
"I am pleased to advise the House that I am able to accept the proposal that protection of the environment should be included as one of the objectives of this measure as requested in Amendment No 1."
"Honourable Members may recall that at first reading, I referred to the International Convention for the prevention of marine pollution by ships, the Marpol Convention, as the main instrument for protection of the marine environment."
"However, since the Council has now included new provisions on safeguard clauses which can be taken in case of danger to the maritime environment, protection of the environment has become a specific part of the objectives of this proposal."
"It makes sense therefore to take up the wise suggestion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"Amendment No 4 should also be supported. It strengthens the main thrust of the common position by using the same terminology as in the new provisions introduced by the Council in article 7.5."
"In using this same wording it has made unequivocally clear that if the committee decides that measures proposed by a Member State are not justified, the Member State concerned will be required to amend or not to propose such measures."
"As far as the proposed change of the type of committee is concerned, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 5 and that is because a regulatory committee is the most appropriate because the directive allows for adaptation of its provisions to take account of developments in international fora such as the International Maritime Organization."
"Summing up, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7."
"I regret that because of the lateness of the hour, I am not able to respond to the many interesting points that have been made by Mr Watts and Mr Lindqvist and others but I am sure we will have a chance to return to them and the further production of legislation that will effectively enhance the safety of life and vessels at sea and safeguard the maritime environment."
"I conclude by thanking the House for facilitating the speedy adoption of this directive."
"It will have a direct impact on safety on board ships and craft."
"Once again I express my appreciation to the Committee on Transport and in particular Mr Stenmarck for continued support and effective work which actually adds to the development of legislation by the Commission and the Council."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Fishing vessel safety"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-336/97), on behalf of the Committee for Transport and Tourism, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Council Directive setting up a harmonized safety regime for fishing vessels of 24 metres in length and over (C.-0360/97-96/0168(SYN)) (Rapporteur: Mr Le Rachinel)."
"Mr President, in its common position the Council has made several changes to the Commission's proposal for a directive on the safety of fishing vessels of 24 metres in length and over."
"The Commission has approved these changes for reasons of general consistency and clarity."
"The same applies to the rapporteur and the Committee on Transport, who do not see anything in these modifications except changes of a technical and legal order without great consequence either for the actual content of the proposal for a directive or for its general philosophy."
"The main points of the proposal for a directive which have been modified by the common position of the Council are the following. First there is the matter of excluding pleasure craft used for fishing activities without commercial purposes."
"There is a series of terminological improvements and modifications of an editorial nature aimed at simplifying and making explicit certain terms and provisions in the Commission texts, considered too vague or imprecise, in order to strengthen coherence with the Torremolinos Protocol and the definitions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea."
"The Council is proposing to distinguish between existing and new fishing vessels for the purposes of conformity to design, construction and maintenance standards."
"Only new vessels will have to comply with article 14 of Directive 94/57/EC."
"Existing vessels already meet the standards in force at the time of their construction."
"So there will be no new costs for these entrepreneurs in the fisheries sector, known to be fragile and in difficulties."
"It is a question of adapting the dates of entry into force of the general prescriptions for new and existing fishing vessels."
"There is also the addition of a new annex IV to the directive."
"It relates to the construction, watertight integrity, equipment, stability, navigability, electrical machines and installations and fire extinguishers."
"These have been accepted by the Commission, because they correspond perfectly to the aim of harmonizing safety standards at the highest possible level."
"Safety standards on these vessels will be all the higher as a result."
"There is clarification about the conditions under which vessels flying the flag of a third country can be subject to inspection by the port country."
"It is further added that this control also applies, once the protocol comes into force, to fishing vessels flying the flag of a state which is not party to the protocol."
"The Commission has accepted these modifications, which strengthen, here too, provisions concerning the conformity of fishing vessels flying the flag of a third country to the prescriptions of the Torremolinos Protocol."
"The straight line at latitude 60 degrees north, north of which the special measures can be imposed has been slightly modified to take account of the territorial waters of the Member States."
"Finally, the type I advisory committee proposed by the Commission has been replaced by a type IIIA committee, which gives the national authorities more powers."
"The Commission has accepted these modifications."
"However, your rapporteur would like to insist on two things."
"First, on the fact that the European Parliament wishes to be informed of the activities of this regulatory committee set up under article 8."
"In fact, even if this committee may only make adaptations, the European Parliament wishes to be informed of the topics for discussion well before they appear on the agenda."
"And on the fact, finally, that it is necessary for the Member States to fix coordinated penalties for infringements."
"In the end, we can be satisfied with this common position of the Council, which respects the fundamental principles of the initial proposal and represents added value, because the clarifications and especially the supplementary provisions strengthen the harmonized level of safety."
"As no amendments have been tabled, Mr President, I think it will be appropriate to adopt this report as it stands."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall be very brief, for which I am sure Members will be grateful at this late hour."
"I simply wish to say, as I did in my speech before the Plenary at first reading, that the high level of accidents at sea makes fishing one of the most risky and most dangerous activities of all."
"This draft directive is the result of a long and difficult process geared to improving the safety of fishing vessels."
"Let us therefore steer it to a safe haven, so to speak, and let us do so rapidly and surely."
"This directive, which has been necessary for a long time, will enable us to take the first step of harmonizing the Member States' laws in this field, allowing them to deal with specific situations, but on the basis of common principles."
"As the Commission and Council have pointed out, it has to be taken into account that we are talking about a sector in crisis, and that compliance with certain of the proposed measures would be too onerous for owners of existing vessels already facing all sorts of serious difficulties."
"Our group agrees with the rapporteur that Parliament must be punctually informed of the activities of the regulatory committee to be set up."
"In conclusion, Mr President, as I have already said, and because this is only a first step, the directive must be adopted as soon as possible."
"Mr President, I am grateful for the full support given to the common position which will obviously expedite the adoption of this directive by the Council."
"I am sure we all share the view that when implemented this measure will provide further support for our joint efforts, Commission, Parliament and Council, to achieve a high quality of shipping in European waters by ensuring a uniform level of safety for ships and the highest degree of protection for the people sailing those ships."
"That, of course, is the primary aim of our proposal and in addition it will help to combat the distortion of competition by operators who, tragically, deliberately neglect adequate provisions for safety."
"I would like to respond briefly to the two specific comments raised by the rapporteur in his recommendation."
"The Commission will, of course, readily respond to the specific request that the House be informed well in advance of the agenda items for the committee meetings dealing with adaptations in accordance with the provisions of article 8 of the directive."
"The Commission also shares the concern that different levels of penalties in the Member States could lead to the distortion of competition and hamper the proper functioning of the internal market."
"It is precisely to avoid such a situation that article 11 of the common position requires that the penalties shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive."
"Furthermore, in order to ensure full transparency, Member States must in accordance with article 13 notify their system of penalties for breaching the national provisions that are adopted on the basis of the directive."
"I believe, Mr President, that the rapporteur was seeking to underline the need to ensure respect for these provisions in the interests of transparency and fair competition."
"The Commission will, naturally, honour its obligations in this respect and in all aspects of the directive."
"I am sure that the House would not expect anything less and I am grateful, once again, for its cooperation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Promotion of renewable energy sources"
"The next item is the report (A4-0288/97) by Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the proposal for a Council Decision concerning a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community - Altener II (COM(97)0087 - C.-0308/97-97/0106(SYN))."
"Mr President, Altener II is the continuation of the Altener I programme, in other words a programme running over several years for the development of renewable energies."
"For the first two budget years ECU 30 million have been allocated."
"The sum is of course absolutely ridiculous, less than the proverbial drop in a bucket!"
"It is all the more inexplicable in view of the urgent necessity of reducing greenhouse gases, to which Member States have already committed themselves in Rio, Berlin and now Kyoto, coming up with the aim of a 15 % reduction."
"It is quite absurd that we are refusing to encourage a real breakthrough in the market penetration of renewable energies such as biomass, biogas, solar energy in thermal and photovoltaic applications, wind and geothermal energy with all the means in our power."
"It is all the more extraordinary since it is indisputable that this kind of energy production does not only support our aims of reducing greenhouse gases, but would also release enormous resources on the jobs front, quite apart from which it would relieve us to a great extent from our dependence on energy imports from other countries."
"If it were consistently pursued - and not just with these showcase events - by 2010 the equivalent of 30 % of the demand for primary energy in the EU could be met from renewable energy sources."
"It is generally accepted that if renewable energies are to succeed, the right conditions must be created by removing administrative obstacles."
"For example, it is high time we had a Europe-wide supply-side price agreement for renewable energies, and fiscal measures must be taken."
"But this won't happen without the political will, which Member States have so far not shown."
"But as long as the conditions are not right, all these programmes like Save, Altener, Thermie and Synergy are no more than a front which hides the reality!"
"In view of the broad spectrum of projects proposed on the one hand and the modest funds on the other, there is little point in squandering resources in dribs and drabs."
"The programme should concentrate on a few strategically sound measures."
"However, there is no way that domestic waste can be regarded as recyclable energy, as planned."
"Domestic waste, as the name implies, is not recyclable."
"There is no question of promoting projects for the incineration of domestic waste with this pathetically small budget."
"If anything, we should try instead to use the biomass content of such waste."
"But if I had my way we would use our limited funds for once really boldly, make up our minds and go for really forwardlooking energy sources that set a new direction for energy policy."
"So I think we should give firm support to photovoltaic and geothermal energy."
"The broad spread of proposals suggested by the Commission is not going to get us anywhere."
"It also has to be said that Altener II will also remain a patch-up if the political will is not there and that it is not there is indisputable."
"The sad fact is that for about ten years now the Commission's various proposals for community-wide control of energy have time and again been talked down and torpedoed by the Council."
"And as further evidence: European governments have spent more than DM 125 billion on subsidizing fossil and nuclear energies since Rio, but only 9 % of that, DM 2.5 billion, on renewable energies."
"This kind of disparity in the support for conventional and sustainable energies is greatest in the UK and Germany."
"In short - preach environmental protection, support conventional consumption."
"The modest Altener II programme can do little against that."
"The Community policies getting major support take the diametrically opposite direction: more traffic, more energy consumption, more waste, more emissions, more environmental problems."
"As long as energy and environmental policies are only pursued as a sideline, I am afraid that even a highly ambitious programme like Altener II will bring no real improvement."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the core of Altener II are the actions to promote private and public investment in renewable energy sources."
"However, in the Commission proposal two thirds of the programme budget are allocated to the continuation of Altener I. What is more, the 30 million proposed by the Commission for the first two years of Altener II are, by common consent and in the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, insufficient for a programme with such ambitious aims."
"With this present report we are asking the Commission to introduce increased financing of the programme in general, and to reconsider the allocation of resources and to boost the sum of money for article 2e, which is the touchstone of the programme."
"The Commission proposal gives greater weight to the study of the anticipated competitiveness of renewable energy sources."
"We believe that more concrete actions must be proposed which would render these sources not only economically viable but also competitive enough to attract the interest of investors."
"The Commission must, in the future, outline a concrete strategy to enable renewable energy sources to penetrate the free market, and elaborate a detailed investment plan with concrete proposals for economic measures to promote these energy sources."
"It would be useful to create an environment conducive to investment at a national and community level, with new loan incentives and support measures, subsidies and tax exemptions to offset the initial start-up costs of renewable energy sources."
"The Community must direct the Member States to modernize their legislative and investment frameworks."
"The cautious stance of financial organizations, inadequate information for investors and the public, and the lack of integrated action plans for renewable energy sources at a national level are chiefly due to the structural and institutional weaknesses of the Member States."
"We are hopeful that these points will be covered by the White Paper on renewable energy sources which is at the present time being prepared by the Commission and on the basis of which the development of a European industry will be encouraged, with fundamental opportunities for the export of know-how and investment to third countries, chiefly in central and eastern Europe, but also to Southern Mediterranean countries."
"Joint implementation plans with the participation of the Community must also be elaborated with third countries."
"It would also be useful to ensure economic support for the actions of the programme by third financial organizations, such as the European Investment Bank."
"The Commission must coordinate its remaining actions regarding small and medium investments in renewable energy sources."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, for presenting such a very good report."
"But we should express our appreciation to the Commission too for this suggestion of an ongoing programme of support for sustainable energy sources in the Community."
"I agree unreservedly with the statement in the Commission proposal that the current combination of energy supplies is not consistent with the long term requirements of sustained development."
"For environmental and climatic considerations, in view of our increasing dependence on energy imports and because it is so important for employment and industrial reasons, we are bound politically to try and ensure the increased use of renewable energies."
"When we look at the low rates of growth in the last few years it is clear too that considerable efforts will be necessary to achieve the very modest goal set in the Green Paper on renewable energy of a doubling of these sources."
"Apart from standard economic measures which - at least we hope, Commissioner Papoutsis - you will be presenting shortly as part of the White Paper, in its response to the Green Paper the European Parliament has demanded a more ambitious and financially stronger Altener II programme."
"The proposed financial appropriation of ECU 30 million for 1998 and 1999 certainly does not meet the demands which will be made on the Union."
"We must therefore agree wholeheartedly with the Commission that the budgets for the remaining three budget years must be considerably boosted, in particular with regard to the welcome proposal that the Altener II programme must put greater emphasis on support for the market penetration of renewable energy sources."
"In the report on the Green Paper, the European Parliament demanded a major Community programme for sustainable energies with a million photovoltaic systems on roofs and facades, 15, 000 megawatt wind farms and 1, 000 megawatt biomass plants."
"When we look at what the USA and Japan are doing, then these are fairly modest demands."
"I trust, Commissioner Papoutsis, that you will shortly be giving us a White Paper which reflects this, so that the first specific steps can be taken in the - as we have said - financially inadequate Altener II programme, which must then be put on a sounder financial footing later."
"Just two further brief remarks."
"The amendments of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy ask for the programme to be extended to the southern Mediterranean nations and countries with cooperative arrangements with the EU."
"My group approves without qualification the support of sustainable energy sources in these countries, but the Altener budget will not cover it."
"Meda, Tacis and Phare could perhaps be used instead."
"Finally, I cannot speak here for my whole group, I know some think otherwise, but to regard and support domestic waste, apart from biomass, as a renewable energy source is really pie in the sky!"
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen - the few of you here - I believe we must first congratulate the Commission, and especially Commissioner Papoutsis, who has shown great sensitivity - Mediterranean sensitivity, I would say - towards these issues, as witnessed by the Green Paper, and as I hope will be witnessed by the forthcoming White Paper, which we are awaiting with expectation."
"I think we can be reasonably optimistic."
"The latest information indicates that the situation is improving."
"In Germany, for example, there is news that the government, and the governments of the federal states, are going to be investing seriously in large-scale factories producing photovoltaic cells."
"A book recently published in the United Kingdom states that it is an objective of my country, Spain, to be generating 800 megawatts in wind power by the beginning of the coming millennium."
"However, it is the aspiration of one region alone, the Autonomous Community of Galicia, which accounts for less than a tenth of the population of Spain, to be generating up to 900 megawatts by the same period."
"We know that the situation is better than average in countries such as Austria, Finland and Sweden; and, in short, I believe that the situation is improving."
"The letter from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection states that it is an official objective of the United Kingdom for as much as 20 % of UK electricity to be windgenerated by the year 2025."
"I also believe that we must praise - and I do so with great pleasure - Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz for admirable work, which, of course, she carried out with all the force and resolution of her convictions."
"The committee responsible, the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, enriched the rapporteur's excellent text with a number of amendments which have provisionally been accepted by the Commission."
"Our group will therefore be voting in favour of her report as amended in committee."
"However, we are unable to agree with the final amendment, Amendment No 28 by Mr Holm, on behalf of the Green Group. Indeed, the committee - and naturally our group - rejected that amendment, which seeks to eliminate the concept of energy production from urban waste, after serious debate."
"We believe that urban waste should be utilized for energy production - as it has been hitherto in the framework of general projects under the Altener programme."
"We believe that our amendments contribute something useful."
"Let us consider what has gone before."
"The Commission and - albeit with little enthusiasm in some cases - the Member States have undoubtedly done a lot."
"But the Commission has had the support of civil society."
"The Altener Conference in Sitges less than a year ago, and the conferences on renewable energy sources in Madrid, Milan and Athens, which would not have been possible without the Commission's backing, have shown that there is broad social support for renewable energies; and this should be remembered."
"We also consider that we have helped to enrich the report by ensuring the inclusion of certain objectives, such as the replacement of at least the equivalent of 15 % of primary energy demand with renewable energies by the year 2010, and the reduction of CO2 emissions by 15 % by the same year, compared with 1990."
"In short, Mr President, we believe that these and other amendments have helped to enrich Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz's excellent report, and we hope that the Commission will accept them, so that they can form part of the final decision on which the Altener II programme will be based. Because of its inadequate budget, we are expecting only modest results from that programme, but results which are as effective as those of Altener I."
"Mr President, in discussing renewable energy we talk about environmental protection, which is quite right."
"We talk about jobs in discussing renewable energy sources, also quite right."
"But we virtually never talk about the problems involved in acquiring fossil fuels."
"Hundreds of thousands of people die in aid of this every year."
"I am thinking of the Gulf War, the war in Afghanistan, in Chechnya and at the moment in Zaire or the Congo."
"We must be aware of the full dimension of the problem, namely that no peaceful agreements will be possible in the 21st Century on the basis of fossil and nuclear energy."
"So we need renewable energy sources not only for environmental reasons, economic and social reasons, but even more in the interests of peace, because there will be no peace in the 21st Century unless we switch to renewable sources of energy."
"Mr President, the European Parliament welcomes this five-year programme."
"We salute the ongoing commitment of Commissioner Papoutsis to renewable energy."
"Altener I helped to fund the only advice centre in the United Kingdom on renewable energy."
"Altener II is one of the lamentably few measures which will stop our delegates going to conference in Kyoto completely naked."
"It is in the spirit of the age."
"Germany announced today two huge programmes for renewable energy - photovoltaics."
"Both Shell and BP are investing massively in renewable energy technologies."
"The United States is forging ahead, as is Japan."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you will visit the exhibition outside this hemicycle on the Teres II programme."
"May I thank the Commission for that programme and Mrs Perez Latorre in particular for her help in mounting the exhibition."
"I would like to make my main point three times."
"There is not enough money."
"There is not enough money."
"There is not enough money."
"I hope my meaning is clear."
"ECU 250 million would be a realistic and adequate funding for Altener II."
"That sounds like a lot of money."
"We spend that amount of money almost without thought on nuclear fusion."
"Let us get our priorities right, let us look to the future in the way I think Altener II will do."
"I am glad it will be part of an energy framework which is long overdue."
"It will make clear to Members of this Parliament exactly what we do in terms of energy and I hope that a legal base for that will be obtained very soon."
"The Commissioner has the support of the European Parliament in pushing forward Altener II."
"Mr President, I support the Commission's motion to continue with Altener 1."
"There are, however, parts of the report I cannot agree to: for example, the dichotomy of renewable energy sources and research into nuclear fusion."
"We must keep our feet firmly on the ground when we set great store by renewable energy sources, which, after all, only account for a very small percentage of energy production."
"The most obvious ways of reducing carbon dioxide emissions are the increased use of nuclear and hydro-electric power."
"If a one-thousand megawatt coal-powered station were replaced by just one nuclear power plant, the carbon dioxide emissions could be reduced by six million tonnes a year, which is no small amount."
"Total carbon dioxide emissions in Finland were sixty million tonnes in 1996."
"We must also remember that all forms of energy production, including renewable, have an adverse effect on the environment."
"The most promising form of renewable energy is biomass, mainly wood fuel."
"Finland is Europe's leading exploiter of wood fuel, mainly by taking advantage of the energy value of industrial waste."
"Fifteen per cent of electricity produced in Finland comes from fuel with a timber origin."
"Solar energy and wind power will be a very marginal energy source in the near future."
"Some radical breakthrough would have to take place in the exploitation of solar power, for it to become a significant player in the production of energy."
"Wind power, again, works best in localized contexts, where it can produce small amounts of electricity: on islands and in coastal areas."
"Denmark, which has, owing to its geographical position, very favourable wind conditions, produces only about three per cent of its consumption of electricity from wind power."
"The report urges the need to put more into the study of renewable energy sources, for an improvement in results."
"Although I advocate research generally, I cannot give my approval in this case."
"Visions of the future of renewable energy sources do not depend on financial input, as their status in the whole field of energy will never be anything more than marginal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, for her excellent report."
"The first Altener programme has demonstrated its importance in the promotion of renewable energy sources and the initial results of the programme are very promising indeed."
"The new Altener II programme is not simply an extension of the old programme."
"I believe that the Altener II programme, as it evolves in the future, will play a particularly important role."
"I would first of all like to make certain observations concerning the nature of the new programme."
"The first point I would like to make concerns the Green Paper on renewable energy sources, which I had the opportunity of presenting to you a few months ago."
"Your recommendations and the generous support that you gave to the Green Paper allowed us to move forward to the elaboration of the White Paper on a community strategy and a new plan of action on renewable energy sources."
"I would like to say to you that I intend to present this White Paper to the Commission some time during November."
"The Altener II programme has been given a new direction so that it now incorporates new actions within the framework of a more general Community strategy for renewable energy sources and also within a framework for a plan of action that we are going to put forward."
"The second point I would like to make concerns the proposal for an outline programme for energy, which we discussed today in the European Commission."
"The Altener II programme will be part of this future outline programme for energy and will be one of its most basic cornerstones."
"I would like to stress that, in order for the programme to continue without interruption, it is essential that Altener II be approved by the Council."
"This is fully compatible with the outline programme into which it will be incorporated, when this is finally approved, during the coming months and possibly into next year."
"The third point concerns the process of European Union enlargement."
"Indeed, in the context of the actions aimed at facilitating the accession of countries of central and eastern Europe and Cyprus, the new programme provides for the possibility of their participation and also provides for the possibility of the participation of the countries of the European Economic Area."
"As regards the actions and the measures that we are intending to take within the framework of the Altener II programme, our prime objective is to continue and to extend the actions of the programme that have been judged to be positive and effective."
"Our basic concern is to concentrate all our attention on those actions which may improve on the results that we have so far obtained and which may make our efforts more productive."
"The programme also provides for new actions with two specific aims."
"First of all, to encourage public and private investment in the production and utilization of energies from renewable sources."
"Secondly, to provide the necessary means for the implementation and monitoring of the Community strategy and action plan for renewable energy sources by the year 2010."
"Mr President, the Altener II programme is indeed of very special significance."
"It is of special significance because, as many of the speakers have pointed out, it contributes to the achievement of all our Community goals regarding the reduction of gas emissions which cause the greenhouse effect."
"It will also play a significant role in creating the necessary conditions for increasing the share of renewable sources in our energy balance and in the reduction of the dependence of the Union on imported energy."
"We must not forget that the development of renewable energy sources looks to greater penetration of the market."
"In this way it makes a positive contribution to the promotion of the overall policy priorities of the Union in the sectors of economic and social cohesion, for local and regional development, for economic development more generally and, of course, for the creation of new jobs."
"Mr President, I would now like to make specific mention of the amendments that have been tabled."
"First, a general observation: the majority of the amendments allow us to improve the proposal and for this reason we can adopt them."
"We believe, however, that certain of the amendments concern the White Paper on the Community strategy for renewable energy sources rather than the Altener programme itself."
"Nevertheless the Commission is able to accept Amendments Nos 2, 6, 8, 9, 10, 19, 21, 23 and 25, as they have been tabled."
"The Commission also accepts in principle certain of Parliament's amendments."
"We could include these within the body of the text after making changes to the wording, or we consider them to be already covered by our proposal."
"In this context therefore we accept Amendments Nos 5 and 7 after slight rewording."
"As regards Amendment No 12, we believe that we can incorporate into the proposal a general reference to the goal of doubling the share of participation of renewable energy sources by 2010 as a result of the debates on the White Paper."
"We believe that the second part of Amendment No 12 can be incorporated into our proposal, with the exception however of the reference to the promotion of technology, simply because this has more to do with the actions that are evolving within the framework of the Thermie programme."
"I believe that the content of Amendment No 13 is covered by article 1 of the programme proposal."
"We are also in agreement over Amendment No 15."
"For this reason we will reformulate the reference to the various sectors that are covered by the studies in article 2, paragraph 1a."
"As regards Amendment No 16, I agree with you that ecological tourism is an integral part of planning at a local and regional level."
"Amendment No 16 could therefore be incorporated into the proposal where mention is made of certain key sectors of the planning programme."
"We can also reformulate and focus the actions for the giving out of information mentioned in article 2, paragraph 1c, so that they reflect Amendments Nos 17 and 18."
"As regards Amendment No 20, the Commission feels that the wording of the first and third cases of article 2, paragraph 1f needs to be global and comprehensive."
"Monitoring the implementation of the strategy and its progress at Community level and at the level of the Member States alike must cover all aspects and all sectors that are developed in the White Paper."
"Moreover, it would not be advisable to refer specifically to just certain sectors."
"For this reason and at this point we prefer to stick to our original text."
"We agree, however, with Amendment No 22 and we will incorporate it with the appropriate reformulation of article 2."
"On the other hand, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 11, 14, 24, 26 and 27."
"As regards Amendment No 1, the Commission expresses its complete satisfaction with the success of the Altener Congress and intends to repeat it as it proved to be useful."
"However, a reference of this type could be made in the explanatory report which accompanies the proposal, but not in the legal part of the resolution."
"The same is true for Amendment No 3."
"Amendment No 4 is an example of an initiative which would be more suitably included in the White Paper on our Community strategy."
"The content of Amendment No 11, on the opening of the Altener programme in the countries of the Mediterranean, cannot possibly be accepted at this moment due to the lack of affiliation agreements with these countries."
"As regards Amendment No 14, the Commission considers that the amount of funding must be decided by the official budgetary authority."
"For this reason, we cannot accept this amendment."
"Nor can Amendment No 24 be accepted because the reports submitted by the Commission to the organizations are the object of article 6."
"As regards Amendments Nos 26 and 27, the Commission cannot properly accept them and, on this occasion, follow the general procedure that is provided for on this issue."
"Mr President, before I finish I wish to inform you that this morning the European Commission debated the outline programme on energy."
"As you are aware, a large part of this programme refers to renewable energy sources and also to energy efficiency."
"Unfortunately, the European Commission, while agreeing with the political objectives of the programme, did not succeed in taking the final decision on this programme due to the fact that there were differing approaches and differing opinions concerning the programme budget."
"In all honesty I do not feel particularly happy about the proposals that are being made."
"However, the main argument that is used is that current financial projections, which naturally also concern the years 1998 to 1999, do not allow for large increases in the renewable energy sources sector, while Parliament did not expect to express its political will, as it is being expressed here today and during the 1998 budget debate."
"The framework of the new financial projections for 2000 and beyond, of which there are at the moment no indications, naturally remains open."
"The only official indication that exists at the moment on the part of the institutional organizations is the proposal of the European Commission concerning Agenda 2000, and in the context of Agenda 2000 energy is not one of the top priorities."
"However, since we are still at the beginning of this process and since we are still at the beginning of the debate in Council and in Parliament, I believe that those of us who wish to continue supporting renewable energy sources, and those of us who believe that this must be an area for which substantial funds must be made available and for which significant sums of money from the community budget must be used, since it has a part to play in all the basic priorities for the protection of the environment, for new technologies, and for the creation of new jobs, we must intensify our efforts throughout the coming years so that renewable energy sources can become a political priority not only in words but in terms of funding and the Community budget."
"For this reason therefore I would like to accept on the one hand your criticism regarding the amount of the budget that we are presenting for the Altener programme, but at the same time I must explain why we are in such a difficult position, which is the same difficult economic climate in which the whole of the European Union finds itself."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to assure you that the European Commission has made every effort to incorporate the largest part of the proposals of Parliament into the text of the proposal for the Altener II programme."
"I would once again like to thank you, to thank all of you, to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, and all the speakers who took part, for your support both in the case of the specific proposal and in our more general joint effort to promote renewable energy sources."
"I have just one question: what about Amendments Nos 28 and 29?"
"Unfortunately we have not heard anything about these and they are very important to us."
"If you do not have them available at the moment, can you perhaps tell us about these tomorrow morning."
"Agreed, we can get the reply to you in another way."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Fisheries agreement with Mauritania"
"The next item is the report (A4-0303/97) by Mr Imaz San Miguel, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council Regulation concerning the conclusion of the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters amending the Agreement on cooperation in the sea fisheries sector between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania (COM(97)0263 - C.-0421/97-97/0158(CNS))."
"Mr President, the report we are debating today was adopted by the Committee on Fisheries on 8 October and concerns four technical changes to the existing fisheries agreement between the European Union and Mauritania."
"The truth is that they are minor changes."
"In any event, I should like to thank the Commissioner for being present in the Chamber at such a late hour, despite the fact that these are minor changes and that she has been traveling today."
"These are changes which do not affect basic aspects of the fisheries agreement, such as its duration, financial compensation or fishing opportunities, but which relate solely to technical matters for which the possibility of changes was already provided for in article 8.5 of the agreement."
"In fact, this change was already applied before 31 July of this year, and consists of the fact that a maximum of three vessels belonging to the quota for the second year has been transferred to the quota for the first year, so that what was formerly a distribution of 25 and 40 vessels has become a distribution of 28 and 37 vessels for the first and second years respectively. Naturally, the 3 % flexibility margin in the authorized tonnage provided for in the agreement has been maintained."
"The second change, which has been made at the request of the Mauritanian authorities with a view to bringing the agreement into line with the country's internal laws, involves the introduction of a ban, in pelagic fishing, on the use of double nets at the cod-end and any doubling of the lines which make up the cod-end."
"The third change makes it possible for pole-and-line tuna vessels and surface longliners to obtain quarterly licences instead of the 12-month licences previously provided for."
"Naturally, the fees will be reduced proportionately."
"And the fourth change involves the imposition of a contribution of ECU 350 per month per vessel towards the cost of scientific observation on the owners of the 22 pelagic vessels."
"These four changes will not affect the substance of the agreement or the budgetary amounts provided for therein. Moreover, they will, to a certain extent, help to improve the opportunities of Community vessel owners; and, in one way or another, they will assist the implementation of the resource conservation measures established under Mauritanian law."
"Logically, therefore, Parliament should approve these four changes to the fisheries agreement with Mauritania, which benefits the Community fleet and will be in force until July 2001."
"As emerged from the report on the common fisheries policy after 2002, which was debated this afternoon in this Chamber, fisheries agreements give a significant boost to the Community fleet at a time of imbalance between capacity and resources, thereby generating economic activity and creating employment in the European Union. We must therefore support these changes, which improve an existing agreement."
"I therefore trust that Parliament will demonstrate a firm commitment to upholding the philosophy of fisheries agreements, which must always be adapted to the specific circumstances of the countries with which they are concluded. The changes that we shall be approving will contribute to this development."
"With regard to the procedure, there is a matter to which I wish to draw attention."
"As the Committee on Legal Affairs explains in its letter to the Committee on Fisheries, the proposal for a regulation amending the agreement does not justify the application of the assent procedure because none of its provisions, taken individually, has ""important budgetary implications' within the meaning of the second subparagraph of article 228(3) of the EC Treaty."
"However, as Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi will no doubt explain later in greater detail, this does not preclude Parliament maintaining the position set out in its resolution of November 1996 that the legal basis for the conclusion of the fisheries agreement between the European Union and Mauritania requires Parliament's assent, pursuant to article 43."
"This is a prerogative of the European Parliament which must never be renounced, and compliance with which means giving greater power and control to the people and, ultimately, guaranteeing the European project."
"We therefore make explicit reference to this position in paragraph 2 of the draft legislative resolution on which we shall be voting."
"I therefore urge the European Parliament to adopt the report on which we shall be voting tomorrow morning, in the form in which it was adopted by the Committee on Fisheries, including the positive mandatory opinions of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights and the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"Once again, Mr President, I wish to thank the Commissioner, who, although she was away today, has had the deference to attend this debate on the report on these technical changes, which, although minor, are undoubtedly important, as are all measures adopted by the European Union."
"Mr President, this late hour is not a suitable time for an in-depth, academic discussion of the agreement with Mauritania."
"The rapporteur explained quite clearly that this is not a full international treaty, but a simple exchange of letters."
"It is an exchange of letters which makes a few technical changes, and the legal basis proposed by the Commission is therefore perfectly correct."
"In view of the lateness of the hour, Mr President, I think that instead of making a full analysis, it would be better, taking advantage of the presence of the Commissioner, to tell a story, like a tale from 1001 Nights. Perhaps it will help us sleep better."
"In our youth, the Commissioner and I - and, I imagine, many others present - were admirers of the thoughts of a certain great Chinese politician."
"I refer to Mao Zedong, who produced a work called the Little Red Book which had a great impact."
"Reading that book in translation - I was unable to read it in Chinese, as I do not have that ability - I came across the famous phrase in which Mao Zedong says that instead of giving a child a fish to eat, it is better to give him a rod to fish with."
"It seems that the Little Red Book had an enormous impact."
"And now the Chinese have increased their fishing capacity to such an extraordinary extent that, whilst we are concerning ourselves with technical changes to the agreement with Mauritania, according to local fisherman - and by coincidence I have a home very close to that country - a Chinese fleet which must consist of dozens of vessels, whereas our fleet fishes in moderation, is decimating Mauritania's fisheries stocks."
"This demonstrates both the effectiveness of Mao Zedong's thoughts, and their danger to fish and fisheries."
"Apparently the Chinese have a technique - I do not know if they learned this from Confucius or Lao Zi - whereby their vessels sweep a given area fishing simultaneously, so that, after a few sweeps, there are no fish left and there is no possibility of fish in the future."
"Since we made the Commissioner come here tonight, and despite the lateness of the hour and the fact that she is obviously tired, I should like to take this opportunity to ask the Commission to explain to the Chinese, in the same teaching spirit as Mao Zedong, that if they extract too many fish they will end up starving."
"We must make clear to our Mauritanian and Chinese friends that in carrying out fishing activity, restrictions are good."
"I believe that the European Community is currently providing a good example in this regard."
"I believe that we are showing concern and that Commissioner Bonino deserves a large part of the credit for these restrictions and for the way in which the European Union is now carrying out its fishing activity."
"Perhaps, in parallel - and I am aware that Commissioner Bonino has a very heavy workload - the European Community could take advantage of this fisheries agreement to explain to our Mauritanian and Chinese friends that, beyond a certain level, efficiency in catching fish leads to the destruction of stocks."
"In conclusion, Mr President, it is not enough for the Community to restrict its fishing capacity and adopt specific measures to reduce catches. Rather, we must also use our position to teach others that fishing is a potentially disastrous activity, that excessive fishing can destroy stocks."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, after that extremely interesting digression by Mr Medina Ortega, returning to the question of the legal basis might seem a little dry."
"I should also say that Mr Imaz San Miguel has already made the most important points."
"I wish to stress, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, that we consider the legal basis proposed by the Commission to be appropriate: that is, as regards substance, article 43; and as regards form, the first subparagraph of article 228(2)."
"This is because, as Mr Imaz San Miguel said, this agreement does not involve substantial changes which have important budgetary implications."
"And it is also because, in this case, and in Community law in general, parallels cannot be established between forms."
"In other words, the same procedure does not necessarily have to be adopted for the amendment of an agreement as for the basic agreement."
"Having said that, we must insist, as Mr Imaz San Miguel has already said, that Parliament firmly maintains its position, as did the Commission in its day, that the appropriate legal basis for the regulation on the fisheries agreement with Mauritania, Regulation 408/97, is the second subparagraph of article 228(3), in conjunction with article 43, which remains valid as regards form."
"And that is because, until, as Parliament has been requesting, an interinstitutional agreement - or in the last instance, if we have no other alternative, the Court of Justice - defines the uncertain legal concept of ""important budgetary implications' , this House must claim the right to interpret that concept, especially when, as in this case, the Council gives no reason for changing the legal basis proposed by the Commission, which was, as Parliament agrees, the second subparagraph of article 228(3)."
"Thus, Mr President, we have lodged an application for annulment with the Court of Justice; and let us hope that the Court determines what is meant by the term ""important budgetary implications' ."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to Mr Imaz San Miguel's report, I do not have much to add, since, as the rapporteur said, it concerns small technical changes that will improve the conservation of resources with the use of more selective fishing gear."
"I should therefore like to use the few minutes available to me to say two things. The first concerns the non-Community fishing fleet in Mauritania."
"A visit was made to Mauritania ten days ago to monitor the fisheries agreement."
"And there are two problems: one is the fact that the Chinese fleet is using the Mauritanian flag in joint ventures, or whatever; and the other is the disorderly development of the non-industrial fleet."
"There are now some three or four thousand canoes fishing for octopus in coastal waters, which are, moreover, the reproduction zone."
"Those are the two problems, therefore."
"And I should like to assure Mr Medina Ortega that we are using all possible arguments to explain them."
"But we cannot impose solutions on Mauritania, since it is a sovereign country acting in its own territorial waters."
"Nevertheless, the discussions that we have had with Mauritanian - not Chinese, but Mauritanian - fishermen may help us to introduce the concept of responsible fishing to a certain extent: a concept that all Member States within the Community fleet are trying to abide by, with such great problems for fishermen."
"A dialogue has begun, therefore, but, for legal reasons, as Mr Medina Ortega will understand, solutions cannot be imposed."
"Nevertheless, I am confident that we can secure a number of positive achievements, such as the compliance of the non-industrial fleet with the closed season in the reproduction zone."
"Moreover, we are helping the Mauritanian authorities - with Member States' funds, but also with part of the funding under this agreement - to improve their control system."
"There is a long road ahead, but I can assure the honourable Member that this is one of our concerns."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take a couple of minutes to clarify a few matters concerning the debate that took place today."
"This afternoon, there was a long debate in this Chamber on the common fisheries policy after 2002."
"I did not attend simply because I do not yet have the ability to be in more than one place at the same time."
"I was neither traveling nor at the cinema, but opposite this building in a meeting of consumers for which dozens of people were mobilized."
"Parliament undoubtedly has the sovereign right to set its own agenda, but as soon as I knew that the debate would be taking place today, I contacted the chairwoman of the Fisheries Committee and the Secretary-General's office to see if the agenda could be changed, so that I could attend, since, as the House can imagine, the reform of the common fisheries policy is a matter of the utmost interest to me."
"They explained that the order of reports is based on their importance, and that, consequently, the debate could not be scheduled for the evening."
"And I do not yet have the ability to be in more than one place at the same time."
"In light of what I have just said, and in light of the fact that the chairwoman of the Fisheries Committee knows that we attempted to change Parliament's agenda ten days ago so that I could attend, I am amazed at some of the criticisms of me made today - which, moreover, I consider to be politically inappropriate."
"Deducing from the absence of a Commissioner from a debate that she is not interested in the subject of that debate is, quite frankly, uncalled-for."
"I would imagine that Mrs Fraga Estévez is also highly interested in fisheries, and that, if she is not here now, it is because she has something else to do."
"That is not a complaint, it is a regret."
"I simply hope that our interinstitutional relations can be more correct in the future; and I trust, Mr President, that they will be."
"Thank you, Madam Commissioner."
"Of course we have to believe that even Mrs Fraga cannot be everywhere at once. I imagine that she is tied up in other meetings."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 12.30 a.m.)"
"Mr President, I seek your assistance on the matter of allowances paid to Members of Parliament and staff of Parliament who do languages courses."
"I did such a course in the Irish language a few months ago and was refused such allowances even though in years past such courses have been sanctioned by Parliament."
"This language is the everyday language of a large number of people in my constituency."
"It is a language into which the treaties are translated."
"It is a language of the Court of Justice and of the European Schools."
"Has there been some change in the status of the language?"
"Courses were sanctioned for other people some years ago."
"If there has been a change in the status, who made the decision and when was it made?"
"Thank you, Mr McCartin."
"I am unable to give you any concrete information at the moment. However, your remarks have been noted and will be forwarded to both the Bureau and the committee responsible for upholding multilingualism."
"We shall get back to you later."
"Social protection"
"The next item is the report (A4-0291/97) by Mrs Weiler, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission on modernizing and improving social protection in the European Union (COM(97)0102 - C4-0143/97)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years, despite the Maastricht Treaty, social policy has been something of a poor relation in European policy."
"The Commission has very tentatively brought forward some initiatives, and these few initiatives have then generally been blocked by the Council of Ministers."
"Nor has the process of social dialogue lived up to our expectations of it as politicians."
"But now the debate has shifted."
"The deadlock has been broken."
"Of course this is partly because of the great hopes we have of the Amsterdam Treaty, which has at least meant that the British have now come on board in terms of social policy, and that the protocol on social policy is part of the treaty."
"Furthermore, Europe's citizens and workers naturally expect that the state should provide solid social protection against major risks at times of economic upheaval, and I believe we politicians also have an obligation in this respect."
"I cannot accept the constant repetition of neo-capitalist slogans to the effect that the answer is more self-provision, because we must not forget that our workers and citizens are already paying very generously for their social protection, through either contributions or taxes from earned income."
"The fact that there has been some movement is undoubtedly a consequence of the implementation of the internal market."
"More and more workers also want take advantage of the freedom of movement that we have guaranteed by treaty and put it into practice."
"On the other hand, when they do make use of freedom of movement, they encounter discrimination in social protection and also discrimination in job opportunities."
"In response to the Commission communication, we have today tabled a second report, following the first report on the future of social protection in Europe which was adopted by a substantial majority in February."
"We now have before us a report which looks at the problems more specifically, under the title 'Modernizing and Improving Social Protection in the European Union' ."
"In this report I have basically welcomed the fact that the Commission has made specific proposals and that it has continued to concern itself with this topic, and I would like to highlight a number of particularly important points from the report, which was adopted in committee by a large majority."
"We regret that despite the outcome of the Amsterdam summit there is still a unanimity requirement in the Council of Ministers regarding social protection and taxation policy."
"Past experience leads us to presume that this will continue to result in proposals being blocked, because we have had very bad experiences in the past with Great Britain and above all with the Federal Republic of Germany, which repeatedly blocked proposals in the Council of Ministers precisely in the field of social protection."
"We do not believe meeting the Maastricht EMU criteria is incompatible with social security, even if Member States sometimes claim that it is and the idea is repeatedly pushed by certain groups."
"But we do the Commission and the Council to respond to the challenges raised by the impact of economic and monetary union on benefit systems and on employment."
"We expect an active employment policy to be implemented, something which I believe is very important for all my colleagues in this House."
"The Luxembourg summit will be the acid test of our credibility, as an active employment policy and a reduction in the unemployment rate are also the best safeguards and guarantees of adequate social protection."
"It is not our intention to reduce benefits for the unemployed and people receiving social assistance. We believe the award of benefit should be linked with a general policy of counselling, training and work experience opportunities."
"We expect the Commission, applying the good practice principle, to bring forward proposals for flexible transition from employment to retirement and for financing new systems."
"We are asking the Commission to present an annual report on trends in poverty and affluence, but here I want to say straight away that I am willing to accept the European People's Party proposal for the report to be presented just every two years."
"For me, the important thing is that this report should genuinely reflect trends in poverty and affluence in the European Union, and provide a reliable analysis."
"As long as that is the case, I would be happy to have the report presented every two years."
"As in the first report, I have once again insisted on the urgent need to shift the tax burden from labour to other resources."
"All Member States are now agreed on this and I think it is high time some action was taken."
"This could mean a CO2 tax, a levy on value added or a tax on speculative capital movements."
"There is an urgent need for an intensive new debate on gender inequality in the labour market, on the scope for equal opportunities, and how equal opportunities can finally be achieved."
"This was embodied in the Treaties of Rome in 1957, but today, decades later, it is still not a reality."
"We need reliable protection for atypical and flexible employment relationships."
"The proposals put to us on part-time work do not meet this requirement, Commissioner!"
"Mr Flynn, in your report you announced that at the end of this year you would be making new facts and analyses available on social security trends in Europe."
"Take it from me: we do not think that is enough!"
"We need to take stock of the Commission's actions following the first report in February of this year, and you can be sure that we will be keenly following up how you implement the demands made in this new report."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we have before us is a sound report on how we can modernize social protection in the European Union."
"As the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, I am very pleased to note that my committee and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs are on the same wavelength on a number of important points."
"First we would stress once again that contrary to what many people think, the achievement of the Maastricht criteria is not at odds with a sound social security policy."
"Healthy government finances relieve the pressure on interest rates, give breathing space to industry and create a favourable entrepreneurial climate."
"The broad fiscal basis in its turn offers possibilities for a better system of social protection."
"EMU is certainly a challenge, but it is not a risk."
"Furthermore, both committees are expressing general public opinion in Europe when they argue in favour of a shift of the tax burden from work to, for example, environmentally unfriendly use of energy."
"A consensus has emerged about the need at the very least to coordinate corporation tax at European level."
"The code of conduct to combat illegal tax competition is a step in the right direction."
"It is very important that social security entitlement should relate to the individual."
"This applies particularly in the case of assisting spouses of self-employed people."
"As far as pension systems are concerned, the Committee on Economic Affairs is not quite as defensive as Mrs Weiler."
"We feel the current assessment method is untenable."
"Capitalization systems can provide a supplement."
"That is why we urge the national governments to investigate whether the two systems can be combined."
"Finally, transferability of social security rights within the Union is seriously lacking."
"Therefore, we call upon the European Commission to revise Regulation 19/71 on the coordination of regulations in the field of social security for people moving to another Member State within the Union."
"The internal market may have been largely achieved in terms of goods and capital, but it is far from a reality for people who earn their living outside their native land."
"In conclusion, I am glad to say that we are very pleased with the points that have been included by the Committee on Economic Affairs in the report, apart from the point on capitalization systems in connection with pensions."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Weiler on her report, which I fully endorse."
"It takes a positive view of the Commission communication, but emphasizes a number of critical areas which must be taken into account with a view to improving future reports."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights, I presented nine conclusions, which I thank the rapporteur for including and improving."
"They address the issues of equal opportunities for men and women, the vulnerability of women, and the need to create care systems for all dependent persons, while stressing the fact that women start from an unequal position relative to men and that proposals for measures to rectify this situation must be included in the reports of European institutions."
"Any reform of social protection systems must endorse the presence of women in today's society."
"The universal right to social protection must be enshrined in all the Members States of the European Union, and, in order to modernize and improve social protection and consolidate the European model, there is a need, once research into effective systems has been carried out, to draw up binding legislation which, as well as guaranteeing rights, provides the means to exercise those rights."
"Mrs Weiler, I believe this the ultimate aim of your report, and I therefore congratulate you."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Weiler for an excellent report which has taken an astonishingly broad perspective on these issues."
"I will not be able to touch on every aspects in the short time available."
"I shall begin by saying that I share her view that in principle it is not true that the Maastricht criteria conflict with a social welfare system."
"On the contrary, sound government finance and a balanced budget are a long-term precondition for us to be able to maintain and develop our welfare systems."
"We are seeing progress in Europe in this area: finances are beginning to improve."
"In another area which also affects the social security system, we are not seeing the same progress."
"That is employment."
"The high level of unemployment costs our welfare systems a lot of money."
"By having so many people unemployed in Europe, the income for our welfare system is also lower than it would have been if we had been able to reduce unemployment and increase employment."
"So it is a major issue for the future, and for the welfare system too, to reduce unemployment and increase employment."
"A word about pension systems. I think the rapporteur's proposal for a staggered retirement age is an excellent one."
"The other point the rapporteur makes is that we need a state pension system which is good enough to minimize the need for private schemes."
"I share that view because state pension systems have the advantage of being the same for men and women."
"The situation in private pension schemes is that women have to pay more because they live longer."
"I personally prefer a pension system with founded on a basic element which can then be built on with an income-based element."
"I also share her views on harmonization of tax policy and switching the tax burden from labour to environment."
"Mr President, I should also like to thank the rapporteur most warmly for all the work she has put in on her report."
"I think the future of social security is one of the most important subjects for the European Union in the next few years."
"So it is a good thing the European Commission has issued this communication."
"Historically, the social security systems in the Member States have all developed in their own ways."
"This means there are also many differences between the various systems."
"The European People's Party feels Member States must retain responsibility for dealing with their own social security."
"There needs to be better coordination between the different systems in view of the free movement of persons and workers in Europe."
"Now that social security reforms are in progress in many Member States, a common convergence strategy should be worked out in more detail."
"The aim of this social strategy must be to combine the employment policy of the European Union with sound social protection."
"In this connection we do not agree with Mrs Weiler about looking at the idea of a social ""snake' , with minimum social security entitlement."
"This is a disastrous route as long as there is no consensus about how national social security systems can converge."
"There is a world of difference between systems based on the system Count Bismarck designed and systems offering only minimum social protection."
"Bismarck's system is primarily based on the occupational system."
"The other systems try to include everyone."
"Unfortunately, this is a contrast the Commission constantly has to cope with."
"In the Netherlands a compromise has been reached between the two systems."
"But sometimes it seems that occupational risks are in danger of being dropped, because the general system is felt to offer sufficient guarantees."
"Widows in the Netherlands pay a very heavy price for this."
"The Dutch experience does, however, indicate that it is possible to find compromises between both systems."
"But the Commission is concentrating excessively on the sufficiency of the social protection system on its own, and thereby sacrificing the advantages of Bismarck's tried and tested system."
"Fortunately, the rapporteur does not go along with that, because she is too used to the German approach."
"I ask the Commission to waste no time in taking a view on bridging these main differences in European social security systems."
"It is odd that the further north you go, the more social protection comes to the fore and the further south you go, the more prominent is the income-related social security system."
"Much has changed in society since Bismarck set up his first system, but the five main risks that every working person faces are the same: death, illness, invalidity, old age and unemployment."
"It is now up to us, with due regard for subsidiarity, to focus the different social security systems on new developments, but at the same time remember the risks that need to be insured against."
"A number of these risks can also be insured privately."
"Sometimes completely, sometimes partially but others cannot be insured at all or only at much too high a price."
"Subsidiarity creates two problems to which we must pay particular attention."
"First, cross-border workers."
"I would request special attention for them, because of the fact that they cannot take out certain types of insurance; if they work in one country and live just over the border, they often fall between two stools."
"This is an obstacle to the free movement of workers, and contrary to the aims of the European Union."
"I therefore support Mrs Weiler's proposal to update Regulation 148/71 which removes the disadvantages for crossborder workers."
"The second problem arising from subsidiarity is paying for social security."
"The collection of the premium forms the basis of social security in an economic and monetary union."
"So greater cooperation is needed within the Union to combat cross-border social security fraud as well as other forms of tax fraud, amongst other things."
"The Group of the European People's Party will support Mrs Weiler's resolution and requests the Commission to come up with a proposal to bridge the differences between the European social security systems."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our social security systems were designed just after the Second World War. Today the same problems of adequacy and continuity, and the same development difficulties are facing these systems throughout Europe."
"So they need to be adapted and modernized to meet the three major challenges of the 21st Century."
"In my opinion, this is the most serious problem facing social security, because over the next ten to fifteen years the population over 60 years of age in the European Union will increase by 50 %, and whereas there are currently four people of working age to provide for the needs of each retired person, the figure will fall to only two by 2020."
"Another great challenge is the economic challenge because, as we saw in a previous debate, we do indeed have a very serious unemployment problem."
"Finally, it is even more difficult to face up to the social challenge because it involves rebuilding social cohesion in our societies."
"With that in mind, I and my group are delighted to welcome the action plans presented by the Commission in its communication."
"Likewise, I want to congratulate Mrs Weiler on her report and associate myself with her proposals for developing a social convergence strategy as a counterpart to economic and monetary union, with established minimum social criteria."
"I actually think this is indispensable to prevent social dumping within the Union and make the single currency a success."
"But our social security systems must also be natural solidarity systems."
"Natural, human solidarity, essential to human and social balance, is still essential in our societies, and that is why I oppose the rapporteur's proposal on individualizing social security in Europe. I see that as a mistake."
"I think natural solidarity, and in particular a strong family policy, should be actively supported alongside structured social security, to promote a more human, more flexible and less expensive approach."
"Families with children in our Union should be assisted because of the contribution they make to renewing society, investing in the future and keeping our economies dynamic."
"But we will vote for this text, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, remembering our duty to our children and in the hope of leaving them a Europe with more to offer."
"Mr President, the best way of protecting social security systems is to create jobs in Europe."
"This morning I read in paper and saw on Belgian television that the Council made virtually no progress on employment yesterday."
"I would like Commissioner Flynn to tell us what progress has been made on the employment summit and whether issues like modernized taxation and different uses of VAT stand a chance."
"I have already gathered that our suggestion that combatting youth unemployment be included has not been taken up."
"The second point I want to make is on pensions."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this report is called: ""Modernizing and Improving Social Protection' and it is our sincere belief that within the modernization of social protection there is room for a new approach to our pension system."
"Not to diminish the pension system, but to modernize it."
"In addition to the basic pension, the individual can have more control over supplementary pensions, and this is needed in a more flexible labour market."
"Not to give the individual less power, but to give him more power."
"I think it is a great pity our amendment on this seems to have no chance because the Germans in particular have not yet got this far, and even the Christian Democrats will not support it."
"The Committee on Women's Rights raised the issue of day nurseries."
"We are very much in favour of day nurseries."
"But we would prefer them to come through convergence agreements rather than through binding agreements at European level."
"Finally, I would like to stress the point Mr Pronk made on cross-border workers and also congratulate Mrs Weiler on her report in that regard."
"I am sure her report is better than last year's, but if we are talking about modernizing social protection then we really must have the courage to modernize and I think something is missing."
"Mr President, in my opinion Mrs Weiler's report is excellent, in that it very clearly reflects the importance of a high level of social protection for European growth, competitiveness, and welfare."
"However, I would like to concentrate on the importance of the public services in their specific role as agents of public protection."
"I am astonished at the view contained in the Commission's report that only private services operating under market conditions can be economical and of good quality."
"The Nordic experience tells us that public services are often of higher quality as well as more cost-effective from the national point of view than private services."
"For example, a comparison of costs of health care schemes in different countries shows that the fully privatized, personal insurance-based system in the USA is considerably more expensive than the one run by local authorities in the Nordic countries."
"Public social and health services also guarantee accessibility for all, including those in sparsely-populated areas, which do not represent an attractive market to the social services entrepreneur."
"Common services for all the people also guarantee that everyone, rich or poor, gets high-quality service."
"I think that is the cornerstone of social equality."
"With that in mind I hope we are not going to automatically assume that our debates on social justice should be about services that ought to be privatized."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Weiler's report provides an accurate survey of the fundamental aspects of European social security for the future, and also puts them into perspective."
"Now it is up to the Commission to translate these clear guidelines into action."
"I do not intend to go into all the details again now, but I just want to discuss one basic obstacle still hindering social security in Europe."
"What I mean is the idea that we are attempting to create a uniform European social security system."
"The founding fathers and mothers cherished that idea, but I think it is mistaken and we should turn our back on it."
"Even if we have a uniform internal market, we still have living conditions that differ not just in level, but also in customs and expectations, so we also have different social security traditions, different balances of power and arrangements between unions and management - the social partners."
"These all make up historical compromises struck in the Member States, which cannot easily be broken."
"But that does not mean it will be impossible to create a Europe with a common social security."
"We need to revise our thinking, we need to work towards common and binding objectives."
"To put it simply, what is involved is insuring everyone who lives and works in Europe against occupational risks - age, illness, unemployment and deskilling."
"We are also talking about ensuring that no-one who lives and works in Europe is forced into poverty and social exclusion relative to the standard of living in the Member States and regions in question."
"Those are two quite simple objectives."
"By thinking in these simple terms we can begin to identify mechanisms which can be used by various Member States, in various situations and with various different approaches, to work towards protection. By which I do not mean protection at a practical level, but the protection of interests, and working towards convergence in safeguarding against these risks and guaranteeing real citizens' rights for all the citizens of Europe in the internal market - including those with employee status."
"It is high time this was done, given that attempts are repeatedly being made to undermine precisely these achievements in citizens' rights for those in employment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European Radical Alliance associates itself entirely with Mrs Weiler's excellent recommendations."
"I want to congratulate her on this contribution to illuminating the path towards the establishment of a European social security policy."
"The continuing differences between protection systems covering citizens of the various Member States is strongly undermining the operation our internal market, which is assumed to have been unified by mere economic deregulation."
"These differences distort competition and causes ludicrous relocations within Europe."
"It is urgent to make a real start on the public works made way for by the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"In our view, the Commission must resolutely commit itself to negotiating minimum thresholds, resolutely commit itself to establishing common stabilization arrangements - which probably deserve a more attractive name than ""social snake' and I suggest ""social link' - and, quite simply, resolutely commit itself to the definition of an ambitious objective of quality and effectiveness permitting upward convergence in the policies of Member States."
"We must go on the attack, resolutely and everywhere, eliminating discrimination in protection and moving from a security system based on the head of family to one which respects the freedom of every individual."
"Here I want to mention the urgent need to implement the social security directive for spouses of self-employed people."
"Finally, we must pursue greater cost-effectiveness and a fall in the rate of growth of expenditure on health, prioritizing information and prevention, as Mrs Weiler says, but ageing populations and increasingly sophisticated medical techniques make it impossible to reduce the cost of care in absolute terms."
"European quality of life and culture require that we build an original social model together."
"People have a right to a minimum subsistence income."
"People have a right not to see health regarded as a business."
"Each of us understands intuitively that we cannot continue our march towards open markets, free competition and the primacy of the individual if we do not simultaneously ensure the development of the solidarity mechanism that leads to cohesion and balance in our society."
"The Commission must promote the maintenance and development of such systems."
"They must not be trivialized by being subjected to the rules applying to commercial insurance."
"By contrast, the Commission should urgently prepare a directive recognizing their specific social value, their personal social structure, and the non-selectivity of risk, establishing pilot social work services designed to hold down costs and improve information and prevention."
"We hope the European Union will resolutely follow these twin tracks of deepening convergence in Member States' social protection policies and defining rules applicable to solidarity systems, because we are also certain that this will increase the economic strength of its organizations, the social cohesion of its citizens, and the radiant humanism of its culture."
"Mr President, one of the points made in Mrs Weiler's report on modernizing and improving social security in the European Union is that people should be actively seeking work to be entitled to claim social security benefit."
"Something of the sort has been very effective in Member States' policies in this field, including those of Denmark, where there is a constant tightening up of how and when the unemployed are to be regarded as available on the labour market."
"In her introduction to today's debate, Barbara Weiler said that she did not think the EMU convergence criteria were an obstacle to reasonable social security."
"I am not so sure she is right."
"Just think of the massive demonstrations that have taken place in some of the Member States, where welfare cuts in preparation for EMU have been so serious that people have turned out to protest against them."
"I can fully understand that, because EMU is far from enjoying popular support."
"In Denmark we have a relatively large public sector, and most welfare benefits are still a national responsibility."
"But people are uncertain about the future of the social security system, not least because of the preparations for EMU, where the Danish government is of course trying to meet the criteria, even though Denmark will not be joining phase three of EMU."
"As far as the Treaty of Amsterdam is concerned, I am very pleased that the Council still has to achieve unanimity on social security issues, but I would rather it was not just Great Britain and Germany doing the blocking."
"I would like to see Denmark clearly distancing itself from the trend, because there is strong feeling in Denmark that welfare policy should continue to be a matter for Member States."
"Clearly that is not what the Danish negotiators are saying in the Council."
"Mr President, I welcome Mrs Weiler's report on modernizing and improving social protection in the EU because it highlights two important points."
"First, social conditions in the EU have dramatically changed."
"Secondly, Member States' social protection systems can only continue to be financed if they are modernized immediately, with the Member States being responsible for both the financing and the modernization."
"I believe that in a Europe which includes so many differences due to regional diversity, varying historical development and above all different financing systems, a uniform social system is a utopian dream."
"That is why I welcome Amendment No 16 tabled by the European People's Party."
"I mentioned the change in conditions."
"Women have been affected particularly dramatically."
"In many cases poverty is a female condition."
"That is why I agree with the proposals in this report which are aimed at providing a social safety net for women."
"It is particularly important that periods devoted to child care should be treated as pensionable."
"To do anything less would be to penalize women who devote themselves to working for their families, and ultimately that is an attack on the family."
"Mr President, there is clear evidence that Europe's legendary social model and Member States' systems of social protection are failing to meet the new challenges of changing patterns of work, changing economic, social and demographic patterns and the globalization of markets."
"These new challenges have been the subject of several reports to this Parliament: high rates of unemployment, an ageing population, the growth of social exclusion and persistent but changing inequalities between men and women."
"This Commission communication and Barbara Weiler's excellent report address the need to modernize and improve social protection in Europe to meet these challenges and to provide a social model which respects human dignity."
"We must clearly seek new ways of providing an adequate level of social protection which will enable and encourage more men and women of working age to gain employment and earn a proper income to enable them to care for their families and undertake lifelong learning as well as holding down jobs."
"We need a social protection system that recognizes that many people, especially women, face poverty after retirement because they have not had the opportunity to build up occupational pensions and a social protection system that values the children of Europe and is concerned that too many of them, for example one in three in the United Kingdom, are still growing up in households which are below the poverty line."
"Unfortunately the impact of economic and industrial changes have all too often been borne by individuals, families and local communities who are the casualties of the new order without sufficient support."
"I have seen this in my own constituency with the closure of coalmines and the devastating effect that has had."
"These issues need to be addressed in a rigorous and systematic manner in economic planning, employment policies, the development of pension schemes, education and training initiatives and community care provision."
"This report points up crucial areas for action and I hope this Parliament, by supporting the report, will make a major contribution to the modernization of social protection systems that demonstrate our solidarity as Europeans."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate Mrs Weiler on the quality of her work."
"But I have a few comments to make."
"First, switching the sources for funding social protection from labour to environment and energy, a proposal coming from many quarters including this report, threatens to lead to the total collapse of the social security system, at least from the revenue angle."
"Secondly, local employment pacts in the shape of associations between local authorities, private individuals and trade unions, which the report claims will remove regulatory, economic and institutional barriers, have already proved to be, not a driving force for employment, but a particularly effective vehicle for destroying the basic rights achieved by the working class, since most local pacts are not binding under either collective agreements or other labour regulations."
"Thirdly, I want to talk about the strong influence the voice of the European Union should be having on the future of social protection."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European social model is being literally demolished."
"The price of the Union's economic and monetary policy is that unemployment is increasing and social policy is being crushed. Our voice must be raised in protest at the crime that is being committed against the weakest groups in society."
"The report we are debating is not about that. We will not name the people who are really responsible."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Weiler, on her report, her worthy aims and her valuable proposals."
"I strongly support the objective of modernizing the European social model on the basis of solidarity and protecting the citizens against growing social exclusion."
"I strongly support the proposals for progress towards ending discrimination against women."
"But I also want to take this important opportunity to state that the modernization of social protection must not undermine it or turn it into a factor of production and an alternative to employment in the context of a drive for competitiveness which takes no account of the need for minimum social standards."
"Social protection consists of a set of hard-won social rights which progressively evolve."
"It is unacceptable for those social rights to be insidiously reduced to mere individual rights - deferred remuneration for those who can pay today, and who will benefit in the future from actuarial and other calculations serving new and lucrative private businesses."
"Mr President, our communication on modernizing and improving social protection in the European Union builds on the framework for a European debate on the future of social protection that was launched in October 1995."
"The debate has been a real success and the European Parliament has actively taken part in the process of the joint reflection."
"I should like to take the opportunity to thank Parliament and especially its rapporteur Mrs Weiler for their very detailed and inspiring contribution to the debate."
"The debate has demonstrated a clear consensus on a number of points."
"First that social protection is a key element of the European social model and a vital factor in maintaining social cohesion and solidarity."
"Social protection is just as important today as when our systems were established several decades ago."
"Indeed, as the world of work becomes less secure, so the need for effective social protection is reinforced."
"Social protection must adapt to new needs and circumstances and I should emphasize that this does not mean unraveling the welfare state."
"It means modernizing it."
"And finally, while in accordance with subsidiarity, Member States must decide what to spend and how to spend it."
"There is also the European dimension to this adaptation process."
"Member States can learn from one another and the Commission has a key role to play here."
"The communication you are debating today builds on the process and identifies some ways forward on four main challenges."
"First, the need to adapt social protection to new ways of working and to refine our systems so that they are more effective in helping people get into and stay in the labour market."
"This is the key response here this morning."
"In particular, Member States must ensure that tax and benefit systems work together to increase incentives to take up a job."
"There is a close interlinking here with the Commission's draft guidelines for Member States' employment policies in 1998 which place a strong emphasis on boosting individual employability."
"Mrs Boogerd-Quaak raised the point as to how discussions for the Employment Summit were going."
"The Ecofin Council met yesterday and it was a good discussion."
"When all is said and done, the important thing for Ministers of Finance is to get them talking 'jobs' ."
"That in itself is a considerable step forward."
"But yesterday there was a good discussion and a number of Ministers - to different degrees - were quite supportive of the Commission's position."
"Some negative comments were made concerning the targets but the Prime Minister and President-in-Office explained quite clearly that the global targets are the consequence of the guidelines and are not quantitative so far as the Member States are concerned."
"There was very good support for the three European targets of youth unemployment, long-term unemployment and training."
"We are looking forward to the meeting of the Social Affairs and Labour Council today and there will be the jumbo meeting of Ecofin Ministers and Ministers of Labour on 17 November, leading on to the Social Partners Summit and thereon to the summit."
"But yesterday was a start and I am reasonably optimistic as to how things are going."
"The second challenge is the ageing of the population and this was highlighted this morning."
"The rapid growth of the dependent population is creating very new needs as well as forcing the pace of pension reform."
"The third challenge is to promote equal opportunities by adapting social protection systems to reflect and promote the increasing participation of women in the labour market, whether through enhanced care provision or a move towards individualization of rights."
"Here too there is a clear linkage with the guidelines."
"The final challenge is to update the coordination of social security systems for people moving about the Union."
"Here there is a real need to simplify the current rules and to extend the arrangements, for example, to insured employed and self-employed people who are not European Union nationals."
"Just last month the Commission presented a draft directive on protecting the supplementary pension rights of people who move about the Community."
"I see this as a considerable advance."
"In conclusion, this communication sets out an ambitious and progressive agenda."
"I do not disguise the fact that it involves some pretty tough decisions and choices to be made."
"But the underlying message is a very positive one."
"Our social protection systems are not doomed to wither on the vine in the face of international competition and budgetary rigour."
"They have long been a source of Europe's strength, a vector for solidarity and a productive factor and they can remain so in the future."
"But achieving this involves adapting and modernizing our systems."
"Mrs Waddington and the rapporteur Mrs Weiler are right in this regard."
"The debate we launched two years ago has shown its worth."
"The results are already visible in the employment guidelines and I hope the Commission can rely on the continuing support of Parliament in driving this process forward."
"I thank the rapporteur and her colleagues for their support in this regard."
"Thank you, Commissioner Flynn."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"1996 report on competition policy"
"The next item is the report (A4-0316/97) by Mr Areitio Toledo, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the XXVI report by the Commission on competition policy -1996 (SEC(97)0628 - C4-0209/97)."
"Mr President, I should like to give Mr Areitio Toledo's apologies."
"He is unable to present his report personally because he has had to return to Spain by train to have an operation."
"His doctors have told him to rest."
"Mr President, as my group leader has just explained, an unfortunate accident has obliged my good friend and colleague, Mr Areitio Toledo, to return to Spain."
"I shall do my best to deputize for him by explaining in broad terms the reasons underlying his report on the Commission's report."
"First, the report Mr Areitio Toledo is submitting to Parliament stresses that the Commission report is a useful document, which merits detailed analysis - analysis in which the duty of mutual loyalty between Parliament and the Commission must be clear."
"Secondly, in view of the data provided by the Commission, the report requests increased resources for the Commission, whilst calling for more effective coordination between Commission departments and between the Commission and the Member States, with a view to assessing the impact of competition, industrial, trade and internal market policies on employment, consumers, cultural diversity and freedom of expression."
"I repeat, Mr Commissioner: increased coordination within the Commission services responsible for these policies and between the Commission and the Member States,"
"As a practical application of this principle, the report calls for the Commission's approach to concentration to take account of the impact of concentration on the intangible factors to which I have just referred, especially employment, thereby enabling the Commission to make recommendations about the influence of competition policy on job creation - an issue which all the Union's institutions are currently considering."
"The report then analyses in detail the main issues involved in competition policy: first, the application of articles 85 and 86 on collusion to distort competition; secondly, the abuse of a dominant position; thirdly, the role of monopolies in the light of the new provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty; fourthly, State aid; and, lastly, international cooperation in a context of globalization and interdependence of the various economic regions of the world which requires the EU to adopt a new approach."
"I should now like to highlight a number of the recommendations made in the report, following the schema that I have just set out."
"With regard to the application of articles 85 and 86, the report expresses Parliament's agreement with the new regulation on block exemptions relating to technology transfer agreements, but reminds the Commission that this exemption is contingent upon, and orchestrated via, respect for the four economic advantages on which the decision was based: first, clarification of what is and what is not exempted, for the avoidance of legal uncertainty, which is dangerous in any field, and even more so in this."
"Secondly, strict compliance with the specific obligations laid down in the regulation."
"Thirdly, compliance with the notification procedure."
"And last, but not least, compliance with the market share threshold of 40 % for licensees, especially when collaborating with small and medium-sized enterprises."
"As a minor detail, the report deplores the lack of a genuine internal market in motor vehicles."
"It urges the Commission to takes steps to decentralize control of collusion, which will improve the supervision the Commission has to carry out, and calls for new inspection instruments for detecting the secret cartels which do so much to undermine competition."
"Lastly - and I hope the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs will also draw attention to this - it calls for an adequate balance to be struck between the different interests of the parties involved in the processes of notification and granting access to files on companies: there is the general interest of knowing what Commission decisions are based on, and the interests of the company concerned, especially as regards its industrial secrets."
"I have two comments on abuse of a dominant position, the second issue addressed by the report. The first is general, deploring the fact that imperfect competition tends to be the rule rather than the exception; and the second is to call on the Commission to step up its action to detect predatory pricing and other forms of unfair competition."
"Fair competition is one of the basic pillars of the internal market, and we can never do enough to ensure it."
"With regard to monopolies, the third area dealt with, the report requests the Commission to examine the implications of the Amsterdam Treaty for public broadcasting services and credit institutions in Germany."
"In this analysis, in Parliament's view, particular attention must be paid to the following: the definition and meaning of services of general interest, the public obligations which the entities entrusted with the management of those services must fulfil, the characteristics of universal service, equality of treatment, the quality of public services and the principle of common interest."
"These are all relevant issues in the new phase now opening."
"Secondly, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle and the new economic climate, the report recognizes the role of national governments in key sectors such as telecommunications, energy, postal services, transport and broadcasting, and applauds and supports the Commission's efforts to liberalize energy markets and the management of airport and port infrastructure."
"The fourth issue addressed, and one to which I attach particular importance, is that of state aid."
"I attach particular importance to it because, unfortunately, the Commission has proved incapable of providing Parliament and the other Community institutions with information on the amount of state aid granted over the last few years."
"And this lack of information, this omission, is all the more serious because the amount of state aid is growing and its impact on competition is increasing."
"Allow me to remind the House of a few figures."
"The overall volume of aid currently stands at ECU 95 billion a year, which amounts to ECU 713 - I am talking about direct state aid, not tax or credit subsidies - for each person employed."
"45 % of this aid goes to industry, and 55 % to agriculture and services."
"In this connection I would like to highlight an important point: although the report underlines the usefulness of aid in the common interest, in important fields like regional assistance, research and development, small and mediumsized enterprises, training, energy, energy saving and the environment, it deplores the fact that this type of horizontal aid in the general interest is decreasing while aid to individual companies is increasing."
"And it does so, Mr Commissioner, because the latter type of aid has a distorting effect on competition within the internal market and vis-à-vis international markets."
"Another important point, Mr Commissioner, is that a balance must be struck between restricting the type of aid which may prejudice the internal market, and ensuring that European industry is not penalized in relation to nonCommunity companies."
"This is an extremely important balance which we must all endeavour to secure on a daily basis."
"Consequently, Mr Commissioner, the report specifically proposes that the stability and convergence programmes should be looked at from the point of view of competition, that criteria should be laid down for restricting the amount of state aid Member States can grant, and that a code of conduct on state aid should be drawn up along the lines of the code on tax-related subsidies established by your colleague, Mr Monti."
"I should like to end by making two comments on international cooperation. The world is no longer what it was."
"There is a need to adopt a new approach."
"It is essential to cooperate with the applicant states and the World Trade Organization in order to establish a global competition framework that enables us to meet the new challenges raised by new technologies and interdependence."
"I congratulate the Commission on its report."
"And I hope it will take note of Mr Areitio Toledo's excellent report, which I have presented as well as I could in his absence."
"Madam President, first of all I would like to point out that it is extremely important for the Commission to use every means at its disposal to ensure that there is real competition in the EU."
"I would also like to congratulate the Commission on its preemptive victory in Amsterdam, when it succeeded in warding off the attempt to muddy the competition rules and your authority through vague provisions about public services."
"As previous speakers also pointed out, increased state deficits give cause for concern."
"In this area I really do hope new rules the Commission has announced will increase predictability."
"Tax reductions are not a neutral means of competition and need to be paid more attention, as previous speakers have said."
"Predictability in the area competition is also important."
"In this context I want to mention that there are certain doubts about the new concentration regulation."
"Practitioners point out that it is not as predictable as it could be."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights has raised some issues in its opinion."
"We strongly question whether there is a legal basis for the Commission's communication of 10 July 1996, that is, for the part concerned with reductions or exemption from fines in certain cases."
"Contrary to what the Commission has stated, there are no examples in case law of a reduction having been granted for anyone who has initiated such a procedure in cartel cases."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs therefore rejected the communication and questioned the legal basis."
"Politically we should ask ourselves whether we want a tale-telling society like the one this communication would ultimately lead to."
"In many cases the Commission is dependent on active third parties."
"Therefore it is also important that these parties have rights."
"Public access should not exist for its own sake, but is there so that we can determine whether the Commission is treating different parties fairly within acceptable limits where the Commission's investigative freedom is concerned."
"As the Amsterdam Treaty requires new rules on public access, the rules on access to documents in competition cases should also be clarified."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs considers that the communication which has now been adopted is not adequate and wants the Commission to revise it so that we get a balanced treatment of commercial secrets on the one hand and the important rights of third parties on the other."
"Madam President, on behalf of my group I should like to begin my speech by congratulating Mr Areitio Toledo on his excellent report and regretting his absence."
"As this is one of the mechanisms that enables us to control the Commission - and, specifically, the Commissioner, or the services responsible for competition policy - I should like to emphasize the good judgement of the Commission and the Commissioner in appearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy in relation to this report."
"In the short time available to me, Madam President, I should like to make just three points. It is true that we recently witnessed the conclusion of the negotiation and signing of the Amsterdam Treaty, which includes an article that should lead everyone to consider carefully how services of general interest can be guaranteed and how this can be balanced with competition policy."
"Secondly, at a time when public sectors or parts of public sectors are being privatized, I want to stress the need to analyze the other concentrations of interests to which the outflow of public capital from these sectors can give rise."
"Are the duopolies which are frequently being created really a spur to competition and the improvement of services, or is there not a danger that society will lose control over determining what constitutes an improved service?"
"And what about the concentration of the financial sector through privatization?"
"Thirdly, I should like to refer to the issue addressed by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil: state aid and its effects on regional development and competition - not between the Member States, but between the industrial sectors of the various Member States."
"This is an extremely important question, because we are making progress with the single market, and we are making efforts to improve public finances through convergence programmes, yet we may find ourselves with a mechanism which distorts the internal market and could mean industrial development is not viable in a large number of areas, especially the European Union's most neglected areas, because of Member States' unequal ability to finance aid to enterprises from national budgets."
"Furthermore, we must consider employment."
"And considering employment in relation to competition policy is very difficult - because increased competition means cutting costs, but as we all know, cutting costs to compete better has an effect on employment and the intensity of employment in the sectors concerned."
"On the other hand, increased competition should generate economic activity and create jobs."
"The Commissioner is sensitive to these issues, but I think he is going to have to tread particularly carefully in these discussions."
"Lastly, a paragraph which is particularly important to the Socialist Group, and which is included in the report, concerns the need for increased and more effective coordination of the different policies involved: economic, competition, industrial, internal market and trade."
"One last essential comment on globalization: the process of globalization must be fair, and one of the rules of the international justice system is that we must be governed by similar laws."
"That applies to competition too. It would be illogical for the European Union to endeavour to implement transparent competition policies if distortions were still being produced in other countries and other economic sectors."
"We would be doing our industry - and therefore employment and the social development of the Member States - a disservice."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to contribute a few fundamental comments to this debate on competition, on behalf of the European People's Party."
"More than ever, locations in all countries are facing global competition, and the world is becoming one market place."
"I believe we should see this as an opportunity to grasp."
"Companies are being wrested from the grip of nation states, and I think this is having a salutary effect on policy."
"The wonderful thing about the mobility of capital is that it stirs up everyone whose mind is closed to the idea of reform, and especially to structural change."
"However, the way goods flow demonstrates which countries have cost advantages in the production of goods and factor flows indicate where the most efficient locations are."
"This means that competition for the location of investment projects is a key aspect of market economy policy as we understand it."
"Other components are the safeguarding of dynamic competition and the dismantling of anti-competition regulations."
"If competition for the location of investment between EU Member States means that dynamic competition is safeguarded, then I would say that we should say no to excessive tax harmonization in Europe."
"We in this Parliament are also very often responsible for encouraging regulation by the state."
"But in the final analysis, overregulation provides protection against competition, reduces the pressure to innovate, curbs growth, and hinders access to the market by newcomers and the creation of new jobs."
"Instead of supposedly protecting responsible citizens from the risks of competition, I believe the EU - and its Member States of course - should give our citizens the scope to take responsibility for their own actions in competitive markets."
"That is the real reason for having a sensible deregulation policy which would also be the best policy for creating more jobs, and I believe we are still a very long way from achieving that."
"We should be demanding deregulation and liberalization instead of protection against competition."
"A general prerequisite for economic renewal in Europe should be to put all subsidies, including agricultural ones, under the microscope."
"The economic inefficiencies of subsidies are blindingly obvious."
"First of all, they distort competitive pricing mechanisms."
"Secondly, they result in the misdirection of capital."
"And thirdly, as a rule they reinforce existing structures and handicap non-subsidized businesses and concerns, because they push up taxes."
"In short, they undermine the market economy in Europe."
"Reducing subsidies in Europe would lead to more rapid structural change, thus creating more jobs than any employment summit."
"In my view, the combination of employment policy and state-financed programmes amounts to throwing good money after bad."
"That is why I would say that competition policy needs to be seen as part of a comprehensive policy that combines the efficiencies of the market economy with social equilibrium in a harmonious reciprocal relationship."
"Mr van Miert, I think we would agree that rather than worry about anti-trust laws and the regulation of mergers, it is more important to foster a competitive culture in Europe, to cut subsidies, as I have just mentioned, to create genuine competition and to open up markets to competition from within and from outside."
"The principle of an open market economy with free competition embodied in the EU Treaty is a permanent remit and needs to be worked towards every day both in this House and in the Member States."
"Madam President, at the outset I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report which had the unanimous approval of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy."
"It is widely recognized today that the free play of market forces alone cannot in an imperfect market achieve certain priority objectives of the European Union which are widely supported."
"The search for better economic and social cohesion in the Community, the reduction of differences between the regions, in particular promoting and ensuring the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises, paying more attention to the needs and prospects of research and better protection of the environment are just some of the important objectives the European Union needs to keep constantly in mind."
"These objectives are just as important for my county and my constituency in the north-west of Ireland as they are for any other part of the Union."
"Competition in the European Union and international market place is cut-throat."
"Therefore it is essential that we produce and deliver quality products, whether in agriculture, hi-tech areas, fashion, tourism, fisheries or the widerange of service sectors."
"The search for equal opportunities for small businesses and the development of a better competitive market are essential for the proper functioning of the single market and the creation and maintenance of employment in the Community at international level."
"A fair and flexible competition policy is a vital instrument to stop the financial, technological and commercial war between the European Union and the United States."
"For our part, because of globalization and changes taking place in production, it is necessary that a new approach in the Union's competition policy be defined which takes into account an increasing role for the World Trade Organization but which does not jeopardize certain fundamental policies."
"As regards the internal market and the applications of article 85 and 86 it is important that the principle of subsidiarity be borne in mind in relation to antitrust rules with a view to seeing which cases are covered by Community competence and which are better handled by the Member States."
"Madame President, I would like to thank Mr Areitio Toledo for the support he has given us and I am sorry he is not in the Chamber today."
"On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party, I can fully support the report as presented."
"I would like to start with a few general comments on the Commission's implementation of competition policy."
"Competition policy is of central importance in the single market."
"Effective, transparent and predictable management of competition policy is a guarantee of a successful single market."
"A European market in which our businesses can operate freely without obstructions and unfair competition, guarantees growth and new jobs."
"But, at the same time, I see many challenges to competition policy today."
"Closer cooperation between international bodies such as the WTO is required, and the national competition authorities in Member States should play a greater role as a decentralized part of the administration of the EU's competition policy."
"But let me say that decentralizing competition policy assumes effective, stringent control on the Commission's part, and the Commission must always be the body which ensures certainty in law."
"In the face of globalization, it is also essential that the new countries of Eastern and Central Europe fully enact, implement and abide by the EU's competition rules."
"Extending the Union will necessarily mean that we are undermining our own rules or the European culture of competition."
"So it is essential that we strengthen and continue the close cooperation with applicant states."
"I am very pleased that the rapporteur has stated that government support both distorts and is totally incompatible with the principles of the single European market."
"As a Liberal, I can only deeply regret the Commission's sometimes significant tolerance of certain Member States' unfair use of government support rules."
"It is like believing in Father Christmas for some of the Member States to try to prop up unviable businesses or sectors."
"I must once again demand that the Commission shows itself capable of acting and standing firm."
"Finally, I would like to express deep concern about the group exemptions proposed for certain categories of government support."
"If the present proposals go through, this may well lead to considerable distortions of the market, especially for small and medium-sized businesses, so I very much hope that Commissioner van Miert is aware of this problem."
"Madam President, in its policy on competition the EU must pay greater attention than it does now to the important basic aims of the European union, which are contained in articles 2 and 3."
"Competition policy should not be implemented at the expense of social equilibrium leading to threats to the protection of the environment and employment."
"In this connection my group are asking for better balance in Union competition policy."
"But in many areas we agree with the rapporteur and the Commission."
"Aid to business is now distorting competition to a very large extent and it should be subjected to serious re-evaluation."
"This evaluation calls for thorough transparency."
"Information must be made public."
"Much aid to business at national and Union level is responsible for unfair advantages for some companies, and others are the victims of it."
"I believe that a thorough evaluation would show that aid policy ought to be pointing in some other very novel direction."
"Madam President, the competition policy of the European Union will in the near future experience the consequences of so-called globalization more emphatically."
"There is a great temptation to move to the rigid formation of a bloc and to raise the external borders and tariff walls of the European Union high enough to resist competition from elsewhere."
"Can Commissioner van Miert give his response to a fundamental asymmetrical trend in the policy that some people support: liberalization within Europe, but resisting competition from outside?"
"The Member States of the European Union still give too much state aid to companies."
"Government aid is based on the false assumption that companies primarily operate in a national market."
"The increasing integration of the world market requires a sector by sector approach."
"On this very point the Commission practices a very fragmented policy that results in all kinds of annual reports and communications."
"Would it not be more sensible in sectors with structural over-capacity to ban all direct government aid to companies."
"The bankruptcy of one firm helps the other players in the sector."
"In the other scenario the government runs the risk of pouring tax revenue into a bottomless pit."
"Nevertheless, I have the impression that the emphasis is shifting towards the informal coordination of state aid."
"Does the Commission intend to follow this new course gradually?"
"I am curious to know Commissioner van Miert's response."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, reading Mr Javier Areitio Toledo's report, I was particularly struck by the contradictions this document contains."
"How can anyone be concerned about the social consequences of an ultra-liberal competition policy in an open economy produced by globalization, and at the same time preach ever greater competition and globalization?"
"How can anyone seeing the concentration, the friendly or hostile takeovers, increasing taking place in Europe, ignore the fact that survival of the fittest businesses in such a context will lead eventually to the creation of oligopolies?"
"And how can anyone fail to see that the oligopolies will not be beneficial either for the economy or for the consumers?"
"In short, how can anyone fail to see that excessive competition is the death of competition?"
"How can anyone fail to see that the Commission, with the complicity of the Member States, is dogmatically organizing total liberalization in all sectors, in the hope that this is bound to result in standardization of social, fiscal and economic legislation."
"Now, this standardization cannot be obtained directly, because public opinion rejects it."
"How can it be forgotten that consumers, who are the people competition is supposed to benefit, are also producers and workers whose employment is threatened by this ultra-liberalism?"
"The rapporteur should recognize that there is competition and competition."
"Competition between firms - which we would hope to see less asphyxiated by regulations and taxation, especially in France - belonging to countries with a similar level of development is stimulating and can respond to our objectives of social cohesion and full employment."
"But there is also competition that is savage and worldwide, involving the unilateral opening of markets and subservience to the WTO, hence the United States."
"That kind of competition ruins our economies and engages us in fratricidal struggles and the vicious circle of unemployment."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Areitio Toledo has done serious work."
"His report is coherent."
"In the name of liberalism, which he defends with skill, he proposes structural actions and priorities."
"These actions and priorities all lead in the same direction: elimination of what liberals call the rigidities in the internal market, elimination of subsidies to certain sectors of industry, and correct application of international treaties."
"So, as I said, it is certainly a serious report, but it is a report with which I have a whole series of disagreements."
"For me, for the French socialists, while free competition is a fact, it is not a goal, and even less an end in itself."
"For me, for the French socialists, if international treaties must be applied, that must be done without masochism and without always wanting to be the first, the best and the quickest to apply them."
"I would add that competitiveness cannot be measured - everyone knows this today - by the sole criterion of a market without rigidities."
"There are many other criteria and many other methods, and I be dealing with them in the report I am currently preparing on the competitiveness of European industry."
"But I want to stress right away the importance of strengthening our research programmes, both national or European."
"This is something fundamental for the future of our economy and our industry."
"I also want to express my disagreement with measures which, in dismantling state monopolies, threaten at the same time to destroy the public services provided to our fellow citizens."
"I want to say, finally, that if the ultimate objective is the disappearance of inappropriate state aid, this cannot be done by continuing to slaughter entire sections of our industries and adding new people to the dole queue every day."
"There is no lack of examples."
"I will quote two: textiles and shipbuilding."
"They are particularly significant and always topical."
"To conclude, I would say that, if state control has demonstrated its limitations - and it has virtually disappeared from four-fifths of the planet anyway - total liberalism, on the march in Europe for twenty years, is demonstrating its own limitations too, with 18 million unemployed, exacerbated insecurity and encroaching poverty."
"So we must find an intermediate model - I am not the only one saying this - a European model where employment is an end, competition a means, and universal public service an important factor in the necessary solidarity."
"I think this will be one of the issues at stake in the coming European employment summit in Luxembourg."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, in your introduction to the report you quite rightly pointed out again that competition policy and free competition are not an end in themselves, and I am grateful to the rapporteur for emphasizing that."
"Competition should after all serve to enhance the common good and to ensure that the market, which cannot simply be left to the free play of market forces, is designed to function properly in the interests of the people."
"In this way competition policy can indeed be a factor leading to higher employment in the European Union."
"I would like to see the employment summit in Luxembourg on 20 and 21 November focussing not just on labour market policy measures, but also on improving macro-economic guidelines."
"The summit should also treat competition policy as something that can be used constructively, as emerged very clearly from the Delors White Paper."
"I would also like to touch on two other points in this context."
"I believe the European Commission ought to play an even greater role in international competition law."
"For example, I regard the World Trade Organization not just as another organization, not just as another partner organization alongside the OECD, but as a partner for us and our interests."
"That is why we as a Parliament were right to request a report on the competition situation in the face of globalized markets, from all other states as well."
"It might then at last be possible to make specific proposals about the structure of international competition."
"Mr Commissioner, I also have another request for you: we have been talking about state aid policy and questioning its usefulness."
"We also need to look at article 92 and the following articles today and ask to what extent tax competition in the European Union, which is unfair and ruinous, is not in practice a form of state aid, and as such incompatible with the principle of the internal market and non-discrimination between Member States."
"I think that new rules need to be introduced in this area."
"And the Commission should for once home in on practices which quite obviously distort relations between Member States attempting to attract inward investment and hence jobs."
"Madam President, it is unfortunate that the Commission is not in a position to present an overview of state aid, although it accounts for 1.7 % of total gross domestic product."
"The very fact that 51 % of EU citizens receive some kind of aid is contrary to the spirit of the internal market."
"We need reforms which will ensure a shift away from the principle of 'equal shares for all' to one of providing targeted incentives, which would make Europe a competitive location."
"Combatting unemployment is a key topic in this respect."
"Incentives should not be allowed to distort intra-European competition, but in turn the competitiveness of the Community needs to be boosted."
"So research and development must be an absolute priority, paying special attention to SMEs."
"The EU budget reflects the disparity in aid objectives."
"It is simply not acceptable that more money is spent from the EU budget on subsidies for tobacco, olives and sugar alone than is spent on research!"
"Madam President, first of all may I warmly congratulate Mr Areitio Toledo."
"He is unfortunately absent today for health reasons, but I want to emphasize the extent to which he engaged in constant dialogue with my department and myself in drawing up his report in order to be able to present a good, coherent, well-documented report to this House."
"I must also say that I was impressed by the assurance with which Mr García-Margallo y Marfil presented his colleague's report on the hoof."
"I also thank him very sincerely for the questions he has put to me."
"Obviously, Madam President, with five minutes' speaking time, I will not be in a position, unfortunately, to respond to all the pertinent questions which have been raised in the course of this debate."
"I will try to give the maximum number of responses quickly."
"First of all, of course, I am delighted that, overall, Mr Areitio Toledo's report is in step with the Commission's competition policy."
"Certainly there is divergence of views on this or that point, pertinent questions have been raised, but we recognize that, overall, there is quite a large consensus on competition policy between us all the same."
"It is probably also explained by the very close cooperation that has been established between the relevant European Parliament committee and my department."
"I recall that we intensified our cooperation at the suggestion of Mrs RiisJørgensen, and that my department and I are at the disposal of Parliament to explain what we are or are not doing."
"Answers, Madam President, very quickly."
"First on the subject of the changes in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"I think that, overall, despite certain attempts in the area of competition, the basic rules have not changed."
"To tell the truth, a reference in the service of the general interest is included in the treaty."
"In article 7D, we proposed article 3, others proposed article 8, but let us recognize all the same that, in effect, by explicitly including this point in the treaty, a balance has been confirmed in the application of competition policy."
"This has been done through the liberalization of certain activities, but always asking the question: how do we ensure a service in the general interest of the whole population?"
"That is the actual point that has been consolidated in the new treaty."
"The deputizing rapporteur has also raised the matter of public agencies."
"I think the protocol which has been concluded confirms the balanced approach of the Commission here too."
"In fact, we have always said it was necessary, in the funding of public agencies, to compensate them for the public service obligations they have, but without going further than that, because competition must remain fair."
"The specific nature of public agencies in the majority of Member States must be recognized, for reasons of both democracy and, notably, pluralism."
"I think that side of the question has been taken up in the protocol."
"Another example is the debate taking place about the public banks."
"It is quite possible that the public authority could give certain public banks, sometimes even private banks, certain obligations to be fulfilled."
"Of course, here too, there may be compensation, but no more than that."
"And we are currently carrying out a study of the whole situation, not just that of the public banks in Germany, but equally the specific situations which exist elsewhere, so as to bring forward a coherent policy at European Union level, with the aim of creating the conditions for honest and correct competition."
"So overall it can be said that the debate to which the negotiations for a new treaty gave rise has led to the consolidation, with certain modifications here and there, of the rules of the game in competition."
"Very quickly, a few words on the subject of state aid, since most of the speeches rightly referred to this issue."
"Madam President, I would prefer to have another opportunity to come back to this, given the extreme complexity of the problem."
"I would like to tell you about everything we are currently doing in this area, because many of the criticisms made are correct."
"There is too much state aid, there are too many distortions to competition."
"As regards, for example, environmental research and development, certain small and medium-sized enterprises, frameworks and specific rules exist, as the rapporteur has mentioned."
"We know them, but we give less to objectives of this kind, although they are good objectives, than to enterprises in difficulty, to which we give much too much, for too long, to keep them alive, considerably distorting competition in relation to other enterprises."
"The rapporteur gave impressive figures."
"A little while ago only 7 % of aid was granted to companies in difficulty."
"Now this rate is close to 36 %, while aid granted for really laudable purposes like environment, research and development, or small and medium-sized enterprises is falling."
"This trend worries us a great deal because state aid for good purposes is decreasing, while for bad purposes it is rising."
"That is a real problem."
"If we look at another dimension, the cohesion countries, it is generally thought that these are the countries which receive the most state aid."
"That is not true."
"In the secondary sector, they only receive 8 % of the aid."
"The bulk of state aid goes to countries like France, Germany and Italy."
"I should specify that Great Britain is not one of them."
"Consequently, I understand very well that Parliament, and the rapporteur in particular, should raise this question."
"Would it not be a good idea to try not only to flatten out the amount of aid, but to discuss with the Member States how they can gradually reduce it?"
"It would be good to get into a debate of this kind and that is not easy, because it brings up a great many questions."
"One that has been raised by several of you is fiscal subsidies."
"What is the Commission doing about this?"
"Well, it is taking action and it is already dealing with a number of cases."
"In a few weeks time I will present a document to my fellow Commissioners which not only sets out the problems that exist in several countries, but tries to bring forward a coherent approach for all the cases in the fiscal sector."
"We know very well that this or that government grants tax privileges or advantages to certain sectors and businesses, but obviously this is not a general system."
"These are fiscal subsidies, which should be regarded and treated as such."
"So my reply to several of you is positive: the Commission does in fact intend to deal with this type of issue."
"Madam President, many other wholly pertinent questions have been raised, but I would like to state my disagreement with the amendment tabled by the Liberal Group."
"We have in fact drafted a communication on what is called ""leniency' ."
"When it is a matter of dismantling cartels, companies which cooperate with the European Commission must be able to benefit from a more understanding attitude, taking account of their cooperation."
"Let me explain."
"Certain enterprises, for example, may be drawn into cartels against their will, because if they do not cooperate they are killed off."
"Sometimes these companies, unable to go on, come to our department and tell us, in confidence, what is going on in their sector. They ask us if there is anything we can do."
"And if they cooperate, can they hope for a little understanding towards them?"
"I find that entirely acceptable because these cartels are becoming more and more sophisticated."
"These are no longer the old cement, girder or whatever cartels, they are becoming the high technology of cartels, if I can put it that way."
"If the Commission cannot step up the struggle, through the cooperation of certain firms which voluntarily offer it, I do not think we would be doing our job and the result would not be satisfactory."
"Madam President, I will stop there, because I can see that I have gone well over my time."
"I apologize to some speakers who asked entirely pertinent questions for not being able to respond today."
"And let us agree that, if the committee wishes, I will return at the first opportunity to deal with the questions raised in more detail."
"Finally, once again, many thanks to the rapporteur and his colleague, whom he was good enough to deputize for."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 10.50 a.m. and resumed at 11.00 a.m)"
"Votes"
"Mr President, last Friday my voting card was stolen right in front of Mr Rübig, while I was briefly outside."
"I was promised that the matter would be cleared up by this sitting."
"I have just been to the voting card office, and I have been given my substitute card, but it had not even been reported that my card had disappeared!"
"I would like to protest about this and demand that this matter be cleared up."
"Mr Posselt, I have been informed in this connection that it was a mistake by an assistant of a political group, who, instead of removing the card of another colleague, removed your card."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday I made a comment that was misunderstood."
"I said it gave me gooseflesh to think of the national emblems Spain and Portugal might select, in view of the history of those countries."
"I want to make it clear that I did not mean that the national emblems of those countries in particular give me gooseflesh."
"I do not know any country in Europe whose national emblem does not make my flesh creep because of its long and bloody history."
"That is why I regret the outcome of the vote."
"Mr Wolf, I am wondering which Rule of Procedure you asked to speak under."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mr President, please bear with me."
"We made a mistake in paragraph 25 in the heat of the debate, although I cleared this with the other groups beforehand."
"In paragraph 25b, it says that the production, distribution, exhibition or any support for the production of pornographic material should be punishable, if its production involves minors."
"We agreed in this House that the possession of such material should be punishable."
"It should also be possible to punish the people who buy this sort of filth, the consumers."
"That is not in the text now."
"I would therefore like to ask you to accept an oral amendment, so that the words 'and the possession of pornographic material' are added to paragraph 25b after 'exhibition' ."
"on paragraph 29"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the controversial part of this report is paragraph 29 and Amendment No 2 tabled by Mr Chanterie and Mr Nassauer."
"I would like to make the following suggestion to Mr Chanterie on Amendment No 2. The content of Amendment No 2 goes further than my original text."
"The wording is more consistent and radical as far as the role of the European Court of Justice is concerned."
"But it does not take on board the idea of a claim relating to a person, and in that respect the amendment is illogical."
"I would therefore recommend that Mr Chanterie accepts my oral amendment, adding the words 'and therefore demands his resignation' after the word 'responsibility' ."
"I would then withdraw my original text and accept Mr Chanterie's amendment."
"Mr President, when I think about it, there are perhaps two reasons for adopting this proposal."
"The first reason is that I think, and Mr Schulz has just said so, that the text of the EPP amendment is better."
"The second reason is more fundamental however."
"I think Parliament now has the opportunity to call unanimously for Mr Wathelet to recognize his political responsibility without running the risk of becoming a sort of kangaroo court."
"Therefore, Mr President, I would request a split vote on the one hand on the EPP amendment and then on the addition that Mr Schulz proposes but which I reject."
"Mr President, Mr Chanterie has made it clear that he wants to ask Mr Wathelet to resign, for which I thank him."
"That is something new in the debate, but it is not unreasonable."
"On the other hand he has also made it clear that we are playing a little tactical game here."
"I do not want to go along with that."
"So I request that we put Mr Chanterie's amendment to the vote in the original text, and then, because it will not get a majority, vote on my original text for paragraph 29."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, in a spirit of compromise my group wishes to withdraw Amendment No 50 and support Amendment No 4 tabled by the ELDR Group."
"This will help the House and should be taken first before Amendment No 8."
"We would maintain our request for a roll-call vote."
"Mr President, my group also wishes to support Amendment No 4 and we feel that it is better to deal with it before Amendment No 8."
"So I agree with Mr Macartney."
"Mr President, I wish to support Amendment No 4 which stresses the importance of continuing to recognize the unique nature of the fisheries sector which as a result demands special treatment within the Community legal framework."
"I do this in the spirit of compromise and in the interests of the future of the industry."
"Mr President, I think we should follow the voting list which has been distributed. If some groups are withdrawing their amendments we should take account of the withdrawn amendments when we come to vote."
"But we should follow the voting list and start with Amendment No 8."
"Mr President, as rapporteur for this report, I have to say the following: everyone present knows that drafting this report was a very complicated affair, and that the compromise eventually reached is extremely delicate."
"And, as rapporteur for this report, I have to say that I find it very odd that new compromise proposals should now be put forward at the moment of voting."
"Secondly, Mr President, I wish to say that Amendment No 8 by the Socialist Group, which is the one that your rapporteur supports, refines and improves paragraph 2 of the compromise text, whereas Amendment No 4 is diametrically opposed to it."
"Following the vote on Amendments Nos 48, 49, 51 and 52"
"Perhaps now that you have seen the results I could ask political groups to withdraw their requests for roll-call votes."
"Does it make sense for Parliament to have 10 more roll-call votes in order to confirm and reconfirm the same results?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, it does not make sense. May I request that they be withdrawn?"
"Mr President, certainly not."
"This is far too important an issue for the future of the fishing industry of Europe to worry about getting to lunch on time."
"It is our right to insist and we do so."
"Agreed, I am sorry."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, I would like to ask for Parliament's support for a small technical amendment to point 12."
"Point 12 says that we must refer the decision to the Commission and Court of Auditors."
"I have made a slight error, because, of course, I would also like to see us referring the decision to the Council and the governments of Phare recipient countries, so we can be sure that the wise words and stringent requirements of the report are much more widely known."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, on behalf of the ELDR Group I request referral back to the Committee on External Economic Relations on the basis of Rule 129."
"The reason is that the title does not cover the subject dealt with."
"The resolution contains many references to the relocation of companies and direct investments within the Union and not in third countries which is what the report intends."
"Secondly, the resolution is based on the industrial age whereas we are now rushing into the 21st Century in which we will chiefly be dealing with the digital age."
"My group therefore hopes that by referring it back to the Committee on External Economic Relations we will get a more balanced proposal in which the above-mentioned aspects are included."
"I hope my colleagues will support this."
"Mr President, for the benefit of the House, this is what would be called in English 'a wrecking amendment' ."
"It is simply to send something back and we have been given no notice of this."
"At no stage in committee and certainly not in the final vote, was any indication given by the Liberals that they fundamentally disagreed with this report, as they are now doing."
"No other member of that committee indicated such a line."
"This should be regarded as being a frivolous attempt to wreck this report and it would serve no purpose to refer it back."
"I ask this House to reject the motion."
"Mr President, I want to thank Mr Hindley for his speech, which I fully endorse."
"I would simply like to specify that, for several months, the Committee on External Economic Relations has been doing serious, realistic, pragmatic work on a highly important subject, and in speaking of foreign investment or relocation we cannot forget the consequences which this may have, notably on the economy of the European Union, at the social level, at the monetary level, etcetera."
"So I think this report, which is presented on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, should be put to the vote of Parliament today."
"(Parliament approved the request for referral back)"
"Mr President, we need a split vote here."
"I agree with the amendment from the Group of the European People's Party, which means having the report every two years."
"But I think that the second part of Mr Pronk's amendment should be rejected."
"I stand by my original text, which demands a report on poverty and affluence."
"Mrs Weiler, you should ask Mr Pronk and the Group of the European People's Party if they wish to accept any modification of the amendment."
"Otherwise I will put the amendment to a vote. I cannot put it orally."
"I think the solution is simply to split the amendment in two."
"We shall vote for both parts and I assume Mrs Weiler will vote against the second part."
"That seems to me the simplest solution."
"On Amendment No 12"
"Mr President, Amendment No 12 from the Confederal Group of the European United Left does not fall, it is an addition!"
"I am of the opinion that it falls."
"But if you wish I can put it to a vote as an addendum."
"On Paragraph 15"
"Mr President, we are grateful for the rapid progress you are making."
"But I must insist - with due respect to Mrs Weiler: there has not been a vote on paragraph 15 in the original as a whole."
"So far we have had individual votes on paragraph 15, and the European People's Party will vote to reject paragraph 15."
"I would like to request that this should be put to the vote again."
"You have not done that!"
"Mr Mann, once we accepted Amendment No 22, it replaced that paragraph."
"We cannot put a paragraph that was replaced to the vote again."
"On Amendment No 21"
"Mr President, yesterday evening I agreed with the spokesman of the Group of the European People's Party that in the third line, after 'social security rights' , the words 'for example' should be inserted, as examples are given."
"I was told that subject to this the amendment would be withdrawn."
"I therefore move that the additional words 'for example' should be inserted."
"I agree with that proposal, Mr President."
"As a result, amendment 21 has been withdrawn and we will insert ""for example' in paragraph 21."
"I shall put paragraph 21 to the vote with the rapporteur's amendment."
"On Amendment No 7"
"Mr President, I would like to suggest to Mr Crowley that his amendment, which I support in principle because I think it is clear, should incorporate the wording from my original amendment, ' people of the same sex who cohabit' ."
"(Mr Crowley refused)"
"Mr President, I would now like my original text, or rather the second part of it, to be put to the vote, because the point has not been dealt with."
"In any case, I would like the second part to be put to the vote, so that discrimination in social security systems against people of the same sex who cohabit can be voted on."
"Mrs Weiler, once Parliament accepted Mr Crowley's amendment, it took the place of the original text."
"There is nothing more to vote on."
"On Amendment No 14"
"Mr President, yesterday I agreed on a compromise for this amendment with the European People's Party Group, as I insist that the words 'comprehensive care systems' should be included."
"If this word 'comprehensive' is incorporated, then I will accept the amendment."
"Also, I would like to withdraw the word 'binding' in the second line, in the phrase 'binding legislation' ."
"Mrs Weiler, I would like to point out that your comments refer to amendment 14 from the EPP Group."
"But first we have to vote on the Liberal Group's amendment, which you are against."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, I am sorry that I have to make a short personal comment to conclude."
"This report has turned out to be very complicated, as has the vote on it."
"However, I would like it to be minuted that I believe two points were not correctly voted on."
"The first one is paragraph 24."
"Before the vote I pointed out that I insisted that there should be a vote on the second part, which does not include Mr Crowley's amendment."
"You refused."
"You are perfectly entitled to do that, but I cannot agree with it."
"The second point is about what Thomas Mann said on paragraph 15."
"I do not think we voted correctly on that paragraph either."
"You said that voting had been completed with Amendment No 22 from Mrs Boogerd-Quaak of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party."
"At the beginning of the vote I made it clear that I only accepted Mrs Boogerd-Quaak's amendment as an addition, and would like to have it included as an additional point."
"That meant paragraph 15 was not put to the vote as a whole."
"Mr Mann, I think that as far as the procedure goes, we agree."
"I must say that I find this voting procedure unfortunate."
"Mrs Weiler, I have noted your comments, but the Rules are quite clear."
"There are several provisions for taking the votes."
"You came with a difficult report, with many oral amendments and many consultations with the other political groups."
"Parliament, in its wisdom, accepts, rejects, does what it wants, it is sovereign. Neither your opinion nor mine will change the situation."
"We would like to thank the rapporteur for the report."
"In this explanation of vote we would like to underline our position on the issue, which is based on the fact that we think the coins should be manufactured in such a way as to eliminate the risk of allergies, that the needs of the visually impaired are met and that consideration is given to the need for a definite identity for the coins."
"For these reasons we think that euro coins should be nickel-free, that the denominations should be of different sizes and that the coin should have room for national designs on one side."
"The definition of the technical specifications of the future euro coins has led the Sub-Committee on Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament to ask an interesting question: is there really any point in working on defining and manufacturing the hundreds of billions of coins which would be needed in a traditional monetary system, for the deadline of 1 January 2002, when this system will be made obsolete between now and then by the development of electronic money?"
"Perhaps we should, after all, answer yes."
"But this question hides another, which our Sub-Committee on Monetary Affairs did not dare to raise: would it not be possible to make small payments with electronic money throughout Europe, just with a microchip card, even if the different currencies have been kept?"
"The answer is yes, of course."
"So that one can wonder whether the very idea of a single currency, the merits of which have been so vaunted to us to make tourists' lives easier, is not already at least outmoded from this point of view."
"No doubt given vertigo by these questions, the sub-committee preferred in the end to fall back on more banal arguments, like the risk of allergy to the nickel in the coins, as defined in the Commission's proposal."
"In this respect, the sub-committee invokes, with involuntary humour, Directive 94/27/EEC on the use of nickel which, in effect, takes stock of this risk for various objects in current use."
"Thus the activism of the Commission on points of detail sometimes comes back to haunt it in an unexpected way."
"More important is the question of the existence of a national face for the future euro coins."
"The European Parliament has just accepted this, grudgingly."
"But for the notes, it was decided otherwise: they will not have a national side, and will be European on both sides."
"Contrary to what might be thought, this is not a simple matter of national sensitivity."
"Certainly, what we see at work here is this conception of a standardized Europe, fleshless, rootless, which is in reality the worst enemy of the real Europe."
"But there is also something else."
"The federalists are afraid that the existence of a national side of the euro coins may eventually facilitate a switch-over at some future date to the parity of a given ""national euro' in relation to another, if the single currency system should prove too rigid in use, and if the countries want to make it more flexible."
"In order to prevent this eventuality, they want to lock everything up right away and not leave any way out."
"This will make it impossible to go back, and the day the single currency is up the creek the disaster will be complete, thanks to them."
"We have voted for a national side on the euro coins, but with reservations."
"It is clear that the reason why the Commission and the Council want to have a national side is not that they wish to show respect for national, democratic self-determination, but it is principally a trick to con the citizens into thinking that the EMU project allows a certain retention of democratic self-determination, which is not the case."
"We are, of course, opponents of nationalist rhetoric and chauvinism."
"It is incredible that this Parliament is supporting the campaign against nickel coins on socalled health grounds with absolutely no proof that is causes problems."
"The way in which this whole issue has been handled by the Commission should give rise to concern about its competence and integrity."
"I will be asking appropriate questions and may refer this to the Ombudsman or Court of Auditors for a thorough investigation."
"Coin it for Europe's citizens!"
"That is what I say."
"By making the coins Euro-friendly, we can help the process of introducing the single currency - something meaningful and helpful to the men and women in the street."
"First of all, let us keep the national emblem on one side of the euro coins."
"In Britain, that means posting the Queen's head on one side of the Euro."
"This follows current British practice where national emblems are kept on one side, and the Queen's head is left on the reverse, as the uniform side."
"Secondly, let us exclude nickel from the parts of the coins open to touch."
"By exercising the Precautionary Principle, we exclude the possibility of causing harm to the citizens vulnerable to skin-sensitive materials."
"Thirdly, let us reduce the number of coins, from 8 to 6 and help avoid confusion for the blind and other citizens by graduating the size and value of coins."
"By doing all these things, we can ensure that all citizens of the Union will coin it!"
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of the report by Irene Soltwedel-Schäfer dealing with the technical specifications for the future euro coins."
"The rapporteur emphasizes that the coins should be easily recognizable, particularly by the blind and the elderly."
"The Danish Social Democrats agree."
"The report states that nickel must not be used on the outside of the euro coins."
"The Danish Social Democrats support this as a compromise, as using nickel would be harmful to those allergic to it."
"While they support the Soltwedel-Schäfer report, the Danish Social Democrats would like to point out that Denmark will not be taking part in phase 3 of economic and monetary union."
"Since the Centre Party is opposed to the introduction of EMU, we have no reason to take a view on what the euro looks like."
"However, I think it is obvious that the coins should be designed so that people are not at risk of harm from them."
"So they should not contain nickel."
"I have voted for proposals which mean that nickel will not be included in the coins."
"I wanted to vote yes to paragraph 10 on removing the nickel, but it was impossible to tell whether there was a separate vote or a block vote on that paragraph."
"Of course, it would be welcome if the euro were nickel-free and therefore not harmful to health."
"However, I think that the euro itself is going to cause more damage to Europe than the nickel in the coin could cause."
"Because Sweden is not going to participate in the introduction of the euro in 1999 (if EMU happens at all), I am abstaining from the final vote on the report."
"Ghilardotti report (A4-0326/97)"
"I congratulate Fiorella Ghilardotti on the content of her report."
"On reading certain facts and statistics, one can only subscribe to her approach."
"I support the proposal to transfer the burden of proof to the defence when evidence can be brought by the victim of apparent sexual discrimination."
"Such discrimination targets women."
"We cannot hide behind words!"
"The first type of discrimination is the wage differential between men and women doing the same job."
"As the Third Millennium approaches, how can we allow such a situation to endure in a common area which claims to be an economic and social model for the rest of the world?"
"That remark does not target one Member State in particular, but the entire 15, which have done little to legislate for equal treatment regardless of gender."
"I would add that such conduct essentially occurs in the private sector."
"Can the invisible hand of liberalism, ensuring a just balance between the implementation and the implementor be seen in this example?"
"I would like to put it on record specifically that I am particularly opposed to those parts of this report in which a reversal of the burden of proof is called for in labour law cases."
"This would conflict with the basic principles of the free democratic order."
"Of course any state governed by the rule of law will have exceptions to the reversal of the burden of proof, but limited to interests requiring protection."
"However, any extension of this exemption for motives of pure political agitation should be rejected."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of the Ghilardotti report, as the implementation of a directive on reversing the burden of proof will be a major step forward for equal opportunities in the Member States."
"One of the main problems which women (and men) face when they are discriminated against is how they can prove that they have been discriminated against on grounds of their sex."
"If this directive is implemented, the burden of proof will be on the employer to show that no discrimination was involved."
"The European Parliament's amendments to the Council's joint approach is an extension of and a significant improvement in the scope of the directive."
"We realize that implementing the directive in Denmark may result in a change to Danish legal practice in this area, which may lead to the legal procedures act having to be changed; but we believe equal opportunities are more important here."
"Danish legal practice must therefore be adjusted to bring it into line with the new circumstances."
"There are areas where intransigence must give way to compromise, especially if the consequence of intransigence is to remove all meaning from the act to be implemented."
"I would apply this point of view to the position of the Council on this directive on the burden of proof in cases of discrimination based on gender."
"For several reasons. From 1988 to 1994, the Commission did everything to ensure that such a directive saw the light of day."
"The opposition of one Member State prevented this happening on a strong legal basis, notably articles 100 and 235 of the EC Treaty, which required unanimity."
"It was necessary to turn to the social protocol to find a legal basis for this directive."
"Today concessions are being made because the same Member State has decided to adhere to the social provisions of the new treaty and accept the directives already adopted."
"The Council explains that it was necessary to find a solution which takes account of the position of this Member State."
"As a result almost all the amendments from the Committee on Women's Rights have been rejected, even those which the Commission had accepted at first reading."
"The problem might have been smaller if it did not attack the very essence of the directive."
"By dint of compromise and derogations, the common position creates confusion instead of clarifying the situation."
"By reducing the scope of the directive, in disregard of Court of Justice precedent, by not respecting the criteria established by the Court in the definition of indirect discrimination (capital in this directive), by totally overlooking positive action measures accepted by the Commission, etcetera, the Council is asking us to endorse an empty shell."
"We cannot accept that and we have therefore supported the amendments from the Committee on Women's Rights which have the merit of clarity and respect for the principles established by the Court."
"I believe that the reversal of the burden of proof proposed in the Ghilardotti report is the wrong way to counter sexual discrimination."
"This provision conflicts with the constitutional principles according to which the plaintiff and not the defendant has to prove his accusation."
"Also, an unreasonable bureaucratic burden would be imposed on companies, if they are to prove that discrimination has not taken place, should there be a complaint."
"This would be the only way for an employer to protect himself against accusations by his employees and to 'clear himself' ."
"This would certainly have an effect on companies' recruitment policy."
"It is reasonable to assume that for fear of possible difficulties with female employees, they would not be hired in the first place, with preference being given to male applicants in case of doubt."
"For these reasons we cannot vote in favour of the Ghilardotti report."
"Bloch von Blottnitz report (A4-0288/97)"
"The report by Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz is courageous."
"I read it with real interest."
"I wonder whether there are good grounds for this experiment."
"The technical balance of biodiesel is not very convincing, but I would like to think the gain lies elsewhere, in environmental balance, for example."
"The claimed ""ecological' improvement is far from keeping its promises."
"A significant decrease in toxic emissions can be glimpsed in the future, and research is imperative."
"My second concern relates to the development of an intensive monoculture."
"We know the impact of this type of agriculture on soil and ground water."
"The net balance of this alternative in environmental terms must be clearly understood, and it is only at a second stage that it would be appropriate to establish a strategy on biodiesel fuel."
"I am convinced that the European Union is aware of the stakes and the need to accelerate research into renewable and non-polluting energy."
"Time is pressing, as new industrial countries develop, although we are far from satisfied with the progress of these countries and their people's standards of living. We need to find solutions as quickly as possible to an imminent environmental disaster which will be difficult to reverse in the medium term."
"Far more than for public debt, we will be liable for and probably guilty of the ecosystem we bequeath to our children and grandchildren."
"Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz's report on the Alterner II programme deserves praise for its highly detailed examination of the situation in terms of the use of renewable sources of energy in the Union."
"At the same time, the amendments put forward help tighten up the Commission's proposals considerably."
"At present, renewable sources of energy account for just 6 % of total energy consumption in the Union, which is totally unacceptable."
"The countries of Europe have a responsibility to see that this situation is put right, and sooner rather than later."
"When debating the Commission's Green Paper on renewable sources of energy, the European Parliament recommended introducing a requirement that at least 15 % of European energy consumption should be covered by renewable sources of energy by the year 2010."
"It is good that the rapporteur has represented this proposal, but I do not think it goes far enough."
"An even better alternative energy supply could be established without problems."
"It is simply essential."
"When the first Alterner I programme was started, there were a lot of technical and psychological obstacles to increasing the use of renewable sources of energy."
"Technical developments have really improved the efficiency of renewable sources of energy, and we must now make a major effort to overcome the psychological barriers to increasing use of renewable sources of energy."
"I am pleased that the rapporteur is aware of this and that his report seeks to increase the financial incentives in order to create a favourable climate of investment to promote the use of alternative energy sources."
"Renewable sources of energy are always decentralized, which is very important to the least developed regions of Europe."
"On this point, I am pleased that Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz's amendments do not seek to extend the number of partners to cover not only the Member States of the Community, but also the states we have partnership agreements with, such as Cyprus."
"One of the main problems in Europe today, however, is that we are using far too much energy."
"For this reason, I must regret that the Alterner II programme only looks at promoting the use of renewable sources of energy, but does not deal with the objective of reducing energy consumption as a whole."
"Energy consumption overall in Europe must also be reduced, and this problem will not be resolved by switching part of our energy supply from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy."
"Likewise, we could easily formulate a common objective for energy efficiency in the Alterner II programme."
"More efficient use of energy would produce the same environmental improvements as increased use of renewable sources of energy."
"As the rapporteur has also said, there are serious grounds for criticizing the funding of Alterner II."
"The total budget for the first two years is just ECU 30 million."
"With so few resources, it will be impossible to ensure a sufficient level of activity, and the entire project is at risk."
"If we are to meet the Community's environmental and energy policy objectives, it is vital that far greater resources are budgeted in the final phase of the project."
"Imaz San Miguel report (A4-0303/97)"
"We would like to thank the rapporteur for his report."
"We believe the agreement represents a move in the right direction, if only to a limited extent."
"However, we would like to emphasize our position of principle on questions concerning agreements with third countries."
"We think the European Union should give up this kind of costly fishing agreement and switch to supporting developing countries' own fishing activities primarily."
"Such a solution would do more to develop the importance of fishing for global food supply, to strengthen the economic and social development of these countries and also to avoid the risks which the fishing agreement might entail: for example, the fishing activities of certain Member States are being given an indirect subsidy to continue operating when major restraint is needed in European fishing as a whole."
"I am a great supporter of having interim assessments or current assessments and modifications of the fisheries treaties which the Community signs, especially when it comes to the developing countries."
"Such assessments are a good pretext for changing some of the terms of agreements which may prove to be inappropriate in terms of the local population or fish stocks in the area."
"I have decided to abstain from voting on the report, not because I have any major objections to the four technical changes it makes to the agreement but because I feel it should be pointed out that this assessment and these changes do not amount to practising what we preach."
"An amendment to a treaty should include a wider assessment and not just a few technical changes, as is the case here."
"In particular, consideration should be given to the general conditions and consequences for the local population and fish stocks."
"Amongst other things, the former corapporteur of the fisheries monitoring group (in respect of the developing countries) said in early November that five very large Dutch boats could catch 250 tons a day."
"One cannot help wondering about the state of the fish stocks in the area on hearing things like that."
"And what about the plan to monitor vessels in the area which was discussed when the agreement was signed."
"What has happened to that project?"
"So a lot of questions remain unanswered even after amending the agreement, and those questions are vital to many Mauritians."
"Schulz report (A4-0306/97)"
"Mr President, I must admit that I voted for the Schulz report with a fairly heavy heart, because I had the feeling that the report should really have been in two separate parts: first a statement concerning Mr Wathelet, and then consideration of the whole issue of child protection legislation."
"I think it was very damaging to link these two things together in the report."
"I voted for the report in the end because the explanatory statement, which was unfortunately not put to the vote, makes it clear that children requiring protection are defined as those up to 18 years old."
"We in the Austrian People's Party have always spoken out in favour of protection up to the age of 18."
"For that reason, I am very pleased with the explanatory statement."
"I am pleased that 18 is stipulated, even if this is to some extent qualified later on, and I think that is why I finally voted for the Schulz report."
"Mr President, as a logical extension of our vote in favour of the Schulz report and the many debates we have had since the terrible Dutroux affair, I would like to make the following suggestion: removing from article 6 of the new treaty on non-discrimination the very ambiguous concept of sexual orientation, because it can justify anything, and keeping to what already appears in this article, that is, non-discrimination based on gender."
"That is enough."
"Furthermore, I would like to draw attention to the disturbing phenomena developing in all our European countries and directly relevant to this topic, the destruction of the family as an institution."
"In this most fundamental area of human relations, as in other human relations and all social relations, what protects everyone, children in particular, is the law and what allows abuses and exploitation is lack of legislation."
"My last point is this: I think we need to think very seriously, as we are invited to do by the Committee on Women's Rights, about pornography in itself, and not just as it involves children, because we seem to be witnessing a dehumanization of sexuality in our European countries."
"Mr President, I voted for the Schulz report because it takes a stand against one of the must abominable crimes imaginable, and proposes tough measures. Nevertheless, in my eyes it typifies a rather schizophrenic attitude, in that the very people who are most vocal on this subject now, strongly advocate a permissive approach in other contexts to policies relating to the family, which actually lays the foundations for the dreadful things we have witnessed."
"I voted for the report, but I regret that Mr Schulz has yet again linked an important matter like this with a domestic policy dispute, that is, the Wathelet affair."
"I did not vote for that part of the report and I would not like my final vote to be taken as signifying approval of this confusion of domestic political demagoguery with one of the most important issues in Europe."
"Mr President, I would also like to explain my vote on paragraph 29 of the Schulz report on the resignation of Judge Wathelet."
"I do not think the European Parliament has done any good by accepting this paragraph."
"We do not have any authority in this area as a Parliament."
"A sitting judge should be able to administer justice independently."
"Even if we may think Judge Wathelet should not have been appointed, he must nevertheless be able to function independently."
"We can easily speak of a precedent here."
"Next year there will be another judge who does something that Parliament does not like and then we will again decide by a majority to make this other judge resign."
"I do not think it is only Judge Wathelet who has been damaged here."
"The whole Court of Justice in Luxembourg has been damaged and essentially the European Parliament has been too, because we have not taken account of the constitutional relationships."
"Mr President, one of the important questions was whether Parliament should express any kind of dissatisfaction with a judge."
"Of course it should be possible to dismiss a judge who commits a crime."
"However, I believe it is an important principle of law that political authorities or bodies, such as parliaments and governments, should not express general disapproval of judges in order to try to get them to resign their posts voluntarily."
"If this starts happening (and it is in fact what we have done in this Parliament by voting on this report) then next time, just as Mr Wiebenga said, we could be criticizing another judge on another issue."
"This sort of behaviour threatens to politicize the judiciary, and I strongly oppose that."
"As a good liberal, I would like to distinguish between the judiciary and the political legislature."
"Judges should not be forced resign their posts so that they can be replaced with more politically suitable judges."
"I listened yesterday to Mr Schulz, the rapporteur, with great approval."
"We fully share his commitment to combatting the sexual abuse of children and combatting child sex tourism."
"The only point that generated a great deal of debate from the start was whether the European Parliament should express an opinion on the position of the Belgian former Minister of Justice, who has recently been appointed a judge at the Court of Justice in Luxembourg."
"Following the debate I feel compelled to explain our vote."
"From the formal point of view, the European Parliament has no authority in this area."
"Furthermore, it is extremely unusual for the European Parliament to go into such great detail in a general resolution with regard to a Member State and an individual person."
"Nevertheless we can perhaps say that this is a very exceptional situation; that there are grounds for supporting the Group of the European People's Party in urgently calling for Judge Wathelet to reconsider his position."
"That is why the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations has supported Amendment No 2."
"But there is no fundamental difference between Amendment No 2 and paragraph 29, only a difference in gradation."
"That is why we have given the Schulz report our full support."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Schulz on combatting sexual abuse involving children."
"I did so because it is a good report, which sets out an impressive group of measures intended to combat abominable practices."
"But I want to express my deep regret at seeing the European Parliament demand, on the occasion of this report, the resignation of a judge at the European Court of Justice because of a decision, which is in no way contested on grounds of legality and regularity, taken by this person in the exercise of his duties as Minister of Justice of the Kingdom of Belgium."
"Parliament's vote on this is doubly shocking."
"First of all, it abusively encroaches on the prerogatives of the Belgian Parliament which alone has the power to assess the political responsibility of a member of the Belgian Government."
"Secondly, it does not respect the principle of the separation of powers which forbids a political and deliberative assembly from seeking to censure a judge sitting perfectly properly on an independent judiciary."
"Crime can only be fought by scrupulous respect for the state of law."
"This report, presented by our colleague, Martin Schulz, deals with a particularly serious and distressing subject."
"And I want to thank him for the quality and depth of his work."
"I unreservedly subscribe to its entire content."
"That is why I hope the proposals made will not remain mere empty pious wishes or good intentions, but will be converted into decisions and actions."
"Recent events have demonstrated the need to combat the perpetrators of unspeakable acts inside the European Union mercilessly."
"The term sexual tourism describes a sad reality."
"Extra-territorial and international legislative provisions must stamp out this barbarity."
"Cooperation in this field with the third countries involved must be established in order to prevent the sexual exploitation of children."
"The perpetrators of these crimes and their accomplices must feel under threat wherever they are, wherever they live, whatever their age, social status, or income."
"These macabre ""games' are also the consequence of another reality, that of growing poverty."
"The dual society is gaining ground, producing excluded people and monsters."
"The very rich are using and abusing their wealth and children are the main victims."
"How long will we go on accepting the deviance of a system that has gone blind?"
"How much longer will certain crimes not be absolutely treated as crimes?"
"The European Parliament can and must make its contribution."
"The report by Martin Schulz gives us the opportunity."
"Mr President, I very much welcome the production of this report by Mr Schulz."
"Following the Dutroux scandal in Belgium there was heightened awareness of the activities of paedophile rings and the alarming scale of child sex tourism."
"Public anger forced national governments and the European Union into action."
"Regrettably, this has not been followed through and little has happened since."
"It would seem that those that operate these rings can do so with impunity because they are protected by 'friends in high places' ."
"If the European Union wants to be closer to its citizens, then it should take action in this area as it is an issue of great concern to many parents throughout Europe."
"Action to combat the social exploitation of children will be ineffectual unless adequate budgetary resources are provided."
"Furthermore, the ratification and implementation of the European Convention is also a matter of extreme urgency in order to facilitate the coordination of police activity and gathering of intelligence across Europe."
"We shall of course vote for a resolution which is intended to strengthen the fight against the sexual exploitation of children."
"However, we would like to stress that the international fight against the sexual exploitation of children is best carried out through intensified intergovernmental cooperation and not through a harmonization of laws."
"We would also like to stress the importance of not disclosing the identity of suspects before a crime has been proven in court, and that the registration of individuals should be applied with the greatest possible care to protect the integrity of the individual."
"The Schulz report is excellent from the point of view of the measures proposed against sexual abuse of children."
"It contains a number of important measures which also demonstrate that legislation in the European countries has not got the measure of the foul nature of crimes against children."
"In this context, the European Parliament should question the governments and may question Mr Wathelet."
"I doubt whether there are good grounds for calling for Mr Wathelet's resignation."
"1.Parliament and the committee concerned have never given Mr Wathelet a hearing.2.Mr Wathelet's personal responsibility has never been called into question, by contrast to his political and/or moral responsibility, and that is a matter for his conscience."
"The European Parliament has no powers in this area, certainly not to set itself up as a personal conscience.3.Mr Wathelet's resignation cannot assuage a Member of Parliament's conscience."
"Parliament's job is to make law, and that law is visibly insufficient."
"Any Parliament must shoulder its responsibilities and have the courage of its convictions, but that does not mean pointing to one guilty party.4.The European Parliament seems to be in agreement on the accusation, but not in agreement about following its own recommendation to devote more resources to combatting sexual abuse.I have therefore voted against Amendment No 29 and for the report."
"I will not vote for the Schulz report for the following reasons."
"1.I cannot accept that a parliament should transform itself into a court and allow itself to accuse people without giving them the slightest chance of defending themselves.2.I accept it all the less because a parliament worthy of the name must be capable of resisting an unprecedented media lynching."
"Parliamentary democracy has nothing to gain when it lets the emotions of public opinion carry more weight than the principles underlying democracy.3.The political responsibility of a politician ends with his mandate."
"Criminal responsibility implies a fault which, in this case, has never been demonstrated.4.Taking a view as to his moral responsibility represents a dangerous departure, but if we are to consider it we must do so objectively."
"Mr Wathelet was probably the European minister who did most to amend national legislation to repress paedophilia and the sexual abuse of children."
"If Mr Schulz had taken the trouble to study Mr Wathelet's actions in this regard, he would have had the decency to recognize - at least I hope so - that the majority of the measures he is proposing were implemented in his own country by Minister Wathelet."
"In voting against the report before us, I have a clear conscience because I am taking a stand against postulating moral evidence and against a convergence of dominant ideas espoused by those who cannot tolerate a simple discussion."
"But I want to make three points."
"As regards paedophilia and sexual tourism in general, it seems to me that these important and serious subjects would gain from being studied in a context other than the moral outrage generated by certain particularly tragic events, themselves exploited in a nauseating way."
"In a report probably paved with good intentions, only point 20, which concerns the root of the evil, which is third world poverty, seems to me to merit approval."
"As regards the Dutroux affair which has engendered a general climate far more dominated by emotion and vengeful passion than by reason, I would like to recall that it is duty of the courts, alone empowered to do so by delegation of the people, to establish the responsibilities and, if necessary, the appropriate penalties."
"Finally, as to the ""affair within the affair' , that is, the European Parliament's invitation to a judge to resign for ""moral and political' reasons, it does not seem to me to fall within the powers of this House."
"The French radical philosopher, Alain, wrote that democracy is not the power of the majority, but the rule of law."
"We should remember that on this occasion."
"More generally and in the light of the polemics this issue has produced, I want to point out that freedom is eroded when a society is exhibiting the three symptoms combined here:"
"confusion between the major functions - legislative, executive, judiciary - of government; -a judiciary or a legislature targeting one person in particular for punishment in a broader situation; -legislators and judges deliberating in a context of public outcry and allowing that to dictate their decisions in advance.Without in anyway underestimating the emotional hostility and feelings of resentment such a situation can provoke, I am very resolute in voting against the report before us."
"The Danish Social Democrats are voting in favour of the Martin Schulz report."
"Child sex tourism and sexual abuse of children are an abominable phenomenon."
"They are an expression of the sick mentality of the offenders, and they also inflict intolerable damage on the children involved."
"It is vitally important that Member States give top priority to the fight against sexual abuse of children."
"The European Parliament's report raises a number of good ideas on how this can be done."
"We would in particular demand that non-member states be obliged to observe the convention on the rights of the child."
"The undersigned have voted against or abstained from voting on paragraph 29 for the following reasons:"
"1.The vote was confused by Mr Schulz's intervention during the vote. You cannot negotiate about wording in the middle of a vote.2.To demand accountability from a judge is the responsibility of the national government, not the European Parliament.3.Parliament is not a kangaroo court."
"If he is to be held accountable Mr Wathelet should have the opportunity to defend himself."
"This is a very important report aimed principally at preventing attacks on children."
"However, I would like to register my reservations about some of the points in the report, such as the EU taking a political line on this question, Europol being involved, a European centre for missing children being set up, and so on."
"In principle I am opposed to this kind of federalism."
"Instead I think it should be the Member States that carry on the fight against this type of crime."
"That is where efforts should be intensified."
"Fraga Estévez report (A4-0298/97)"
"Mr President, I would like to make a quick comment first of all."
"It is terribly difficult to hear you on the German channel."
"The sound quality is so poor that we cannot hear anything at all!"
"Excuse me for saying this, but your voice is too loud and the interpreters are inaudible."
"I am sorry if this has led to a degree of confusion."
"Perhaps we could ask the secretariat to have the system adjusted or set differently."
"I voted with great enthusiasm for Mrs Fraga Estévez's report, but there was just one thing I regretted."
"One point of general interest is not mentioned in this report, namely that the problems with fishing policy totally contradict what we were told 15 years ago."
"We should treat this as an early warning, because what is happening in fisheries today, with the changes being forced on us, will happen in other sectors in the future."
"I just wanted to point out that it might have been a good thing to draw attention to this again in the report."
"Mr von Habsburg, with regard to your first comment, we are indeed continuing to have a serious problem with the acoustics in this Chamber."
"It is a problem Mrs Fontaine and I have repeatedly brought up with the Presidency of the European Parliament."
"An initial attempt has been made to improve the acoustics of this Chamber, but they are still not at all satisfactory, as you are aware."
"I must say the President is in a very difficult position, because there is murmuring from the Chamber which makes it very difficult for the President to follow and understand."
"Anyway, the Parliamentary services have promised us that every effort will be made during the holidays to improve the acoustics, involving a great deal of investment and work."
"But it must be done, because we cannot go on like this, creating problems like the one you mentioned and many others besides."
"We would like to thank the rapporteur for a well-informed report."
"We believe the report contains important elements, especially on the conservation of fisheries resources, on the importance of inshore fishing and on the need for subsidiarity and increased regionalization in the future common fisheries policy."
"But we think the report takes doubtful positions on the agreements with third countries and on the common organization of the market in fish."
"Mr President, when the current common fisheries policy expires in 2002 it provides an opportunity to remedy some of its inherent flaws."
"As it currently operates it is grossly unfair to the Irish fishing industry."
"Ireland has 20 % of the European Union's coastal waters, yet we are only allowed 4 % of the total allowable catch."
"In many of our coastal areas fishing is the dominant economic activity and consequently a source of local jobs and investment in the local economy."
"I regret that the proposal to extend the exclusive zone from 12 to 30 miles was rejected as such a step would have redressed some of the current imbalance from which Irish fishermen suffer."
"Furthermore, the Irish fishing sector is unable to fish its full quota of certain stocks because our fleet is old and badly in need of modernization."
"The EU should make available the necessary funds to help us redress this problem, thereby ensuring that we can at least fully fish the meagre allowable catch that has been allocated to us."
"Mr President, I wish to state for the record that this report is bad for Scotland, bad for Europe and bad for the fishermen and the entire fishing industry across Europe, threatening as it does to destabilize the industry."
"The prospect of a free market free-for-all, even the spectre of fish wars, could be the consequence of the adoption of these policies."
"The dark threatening cloud however has a silver lining."
"In the first place, the French Government has, helpfully, and clearly, recommended outright rejection - in line with the views of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation."
"Secondly, the Commission has essentially confirmed that the obligation to respect relative stability will circumscribe the adjustments the Council will be able to effect in the CFP 2002 review."
"On important point to make about this 'own initiative' report is that, fortunately, it is purely an expression of opinion and as such has no legislative force - which is just as well, since it is clearly incompatible with Community law."
"The common fisheries policy is due for review in 2002."
"It is disappointing that the rapporteur chose to put the interests of a minority of Europe's fishermen before any consideration of how fisheries policy could be improved for all our fishermen."
"The fishermen whom I represent in Northern Ireland as well as fishermen throughout the UK and the rest of Europe have a right to expect a less prejudiced approach from a committee of this Parliament."
"It is quite clear that fisheries is unlike any other economic practice which takes place under the single market and yet the report takes a simplistic line on how fisheries policy can fit in with single market arrangements."
"The report is also wrong in giving the impression that the restriction on Spanish vessels fishing in the grounds of other European Union nations will end in 2002."
"It is unfair to promote such an idea when it is clearly not what the review is intended to be about."
"We made it clear throughout the debate that we would be voting in favour of the report because we had managed to secure the inclusion of a number of important amendments."
"Nevertheless, it would have been possible to improve and clarify the text further still."
"We therefore tabled a number of amendments in the part-session, and I would emphasize those on the following:"
"the need to stipulate that the - justifiable - decentralization and regionalization of powers and the management of policies under the future common fisheries policy must not involve the transfer of financial responsibility for those policies to national budgets; -the need to introduce compensation for the processing industry, which is under pressure from imports of fisheries products from third countries.The Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European People's Party agreed beforehand to vote against these amendments."
"Similarly, the joint vote of those two groups prevented paragraphs 11 and 24, which supported encouraging fishermen ""to leave the industry' , from being removed from the report, as we proposed in the House."
"Those groups prevented the adoption of this improvement to the report, although the recommendation that balancing of fleet size and resources should be achieved by other means which ""do not entail a general cutback in vessels' was retained, and, as everyone knows, that was proposed by our group."
"The Committee on Fisheries has taken the very commendable initiative of developing a view of EU fisheries after 2002."
"The problem is that the term ""view' suggests a coherent concept by one person or one organization."
"Mrs Fraga Estévez's outline report met that criterion of a coherent view."
"However, as soon as we, as a democratic institution, begin to amend the report, so many compromises and conflicts creep in that it is not so easy to describe it as unambiguous."
"I naturally accept this democratic procedure and therefore accept the amended report in broad outline."
"But I should like to point out the less desirable aspects of the current view, as I see it."
"Paragraph K of the preamble on the lack of harmonization of employment and social security conditions and the resulting supposed disruption in the fisheries sector is certainly not helpful to ever achieving a better fisheries policy."
"Small-scale fisheries are given greater protection."
"But this segment of the fisheries sector must also develop as we strive to achieve a more efficient and sustainable fisheries sector."
"Artificial viability will not serve this area of EU fisheries policy well in the long term either."
"Finally, responsible EU management of fish stocks begins with very young fish."
"The EU will have to monitor them."
"For one type of fish this monitoring seems completely inadequate: that is the glass eel of southern Europe."
"In the tradition of Agenda 2000, it now appears clear that the Commission, the Court of Auditors and the European Parliament want to make the Phare programme a fullyfledged instrument of the pre-accession strategy."
"From this viewpoint, the programme henceforth explicitly prefigures the intervention of the structural funds in the future Member States, a development which could only be in line with delegation of the financial management of Phare to the local level."
"While taking up the criticisms expressed by the Court of Auditors on the implementation of the Phare programme, not by the Commission, but, in the last resort, by the contracting firms, and on the lack of transparency in the tender procedures, the rapporteur considers that the decentralization of the financial management is imperative."
"The decision-making for the Phare programme in fact remain strongly centralized, which leads to the maintenance of cumbersome and lengthy procedures this programme is unfortunately famous for."
"The rapporteur is also pleased with the appearance of a real will to transfer the financial responsibilities to the beneficiary countries and argues for ""a bold approach whereby more advanced Phare countries be able as soon as possible (1999 at the latest) fully to take over responsibility for their Phare budgets... subject to... rigorous ex post financial control' !"
"So the rapporteur is proposing, in the context of measures prior to the new accessions, that certain countries should assume full financial responsibility for entire sectors of their national programme, with ex post control applying instead of ex ante control."
"The financial management can certainly be effectively delegated, but we already know where that can lead, notably in the context of the Med programmes or tourism policy."
"Furthermore the financial regulation is explicit: the Commission alone is responsible for the use of money from taxpayers of Member States of the Union, which means that, in the last resort, it must retain financial control of the Phare programme."
"As the rapporteur specifies in his explanatory statement, ""it is vital to understand that reorientation and a so-called ""accession-driven' approach are not miracle cures which will, in and of themselves, transform Phare into a lean and efficient machine' !"
"In this context, and in view of the previous experience of financial delegation, the decentralization proposed to us is unacceptable, as is the increase in the staff of the delegations called for by the Court of Auditors."
"One thing is certain: the current system is inefficient, much too cumbersome and represents an open door to irregularities and fraud in the Community budget."
"Because there is too great a tendency to amalgamate decentralization, delegation and sub-contracting, Mrs Kjer Hansen's report makes no response to the questions urgently posed by the implementation and management of Phare programme projects, as highlighted by the Court of Auditors."
"So my group has not been able to support it."
"Weiler report (A4-0291/97)"
"We have heard it affirmed once again during this debate that the euro is the right response to competitive devaluations within the Union."
"In my explanation of vote I would like to show that this one track-minded commonplace, dwelt on continuously, is actually an optical illusion."
"Such speeches target the depreciations of the pound sterling, the Italian lira, the Spanish peseta in the years 19921993, which caused massive damage to the economies whose currencies remained at a high rate (mark, franc, etcetera)."
"Simplistic economists have found a radical solution to this problem: just imposing a single currency will radically eliminate internal fluctuations in parities!"
"But analysis shows, in reality, that the elimination of legitimate monetary fluctuations would only shift the pressure to other sectors, and the damage would be even greater in the end."
"Remember first of all that the monetary disturbances of the early 1990s arose from a contradiction: on the one hand, the occurrence of an asymmetric external shock (German reunification), and on the other hand, the determination of the governments to maintain rigid parities between their currencies in the framework of the EMS, a determination later reinforced by the prospect of the march towards the single currency."
"This contradiction made the system explode; whereas the asymmetric shock actually called for a general realignment, the contrary policy prevailed, entailing de facto depreciations and exit from the EMS for certain currencies, and rigidity of parities and economic damage for others."
"Because it is important to recognize that the extreme depreciation of the lira (-30 % at some points) was not caused by the malevolent will of the Italian Government to manipulate its currency, but by the pressure resulting from a mistaken collective response to the asymmetric shock."
"It is also important to see that if the franc had itself been able to vary instead of being tied to the mark, the gap between it and the lira would not have been as large, and our economy would not have suffered so much damage."
"Finally, the disturbances in the years 1992-1993 were caused by the application before their time of the principles of the single currency."
"Instead of drawing the sensible conclusion that such rigidity is not appropriate in Europe today, for political reasons the opposite conclusion was drawn: this rigidity must be extended to the whole of the area."
"But the economies and societies of the countries of Europe are not the same."
"They do not evolve in exactly the same way."
"In these circumstances, changes in internal parities remain useful for making eventual adjustments at the margin, flexibly."
"If this possibility does not exist, if the parities are rigid, the pressure will be displaced elsewhere and disturb the real economy."
"Pascal Salin once said that exchange rates are like a dog's tail: the dog must be allowed to wag its tail, because if you hold it, then the dog will wag itself."
"The federalist ideologies have made Europe forget this elementary lesson, and we are going to have to pay very dearly for that one day."
"It is positive that the EU is taking more interest in social issues in relation to questions of trade, competition, markets and economics."
"There are also several good proposals in the report, on annual assessments of poverty, on tax switching with reduced tax on work and increased tax on natural resources, on energy and environmental destruction, as well as on local employment programmes."
"The proposals for a common European social policy, social convergence policy, harmonization policy, binding legislation and tax harmonization (paragraphs 1, 9, 27 etc.) would entail a far-reaching supranationality which I cannot accept."
"I have therefore voted no to such proposals, but otherwise I have voted yes to the report."
"Social policy is a national matter."
"The report is very good, but I cannot support paragraph 1, which contains the following: ' regret, however, that the treaty still requires unanimity for Council decisions on social protection and tax policy.'"
"As I have often said, my view is that important questions like these should be decided at the national level, where they can be given a proper democratic base, and not by some Union authority which hovers high above the people's consciousness and control."
"Areitio Toledo report (A4-0316/97)"
"As an economist, it is difficult for me to disagree with Mr Areitio Toledo's report."
"It is true that as general rule, we can put our trust in the markets to make the optimum allocation of resources, in order to achieve improvements in consumer welfare."
"But for that to happen, the public authority must ensure respect for the rules against dominant positions, abusive concentrations and, worse, monopoly positions contrary to equity and economic efficiency."
"I also share our rapporteur's position on the importance of monitoring the way state aid is allocated because it can be a factor which distorts competition, while emphasizing that it may prove necessary in certain cases."
"Finally, I want to welcome the idea of incorporating a parameter limiting state aid in the context of the analysis of budgetary convergence programmes."
"For these reasons, I will vote in favour of Mr Areitio Toledo's report."
"This report seeks to open up to private enterprise key sectors of the economy with a public service component."
"It calls for the continued liberalization of the energy sector, airlines and their support structures, and port infrastructure: all in the name of, and on the pretext of, competition policy."
"The report expresses concern about concentration of businesses, confirming the increase in mergers and acquisitions of companies, and links these phenomena to the liberalization and globalization of the world economy - which is positive."
"However, it fails to mention the responsibility of transnational business strategies in these processes, or the implications in terms of the abuse of dominant positions and the distortion of economic trends."
"It underlines the importance of establishing a genuine competition policy at multilateral level - European Union and World Trade Organization - but fails to mention the need to complement that policy with policies against social dumping and environmental policies."
"We believe the report gives the Commission too powerful a role, laying great stress on the need for effective control of competition policy and the harmonization of legislation, but insufficient stress on the need to combat fraud effectively. It makes an all-out attack on state aid as the root of all evil in the competition sphere, thereby establishing a bridgehead for the stability pact."
"Finally, it draws attention to the problem of the abuse of dominant positions, but proposes no solutions or alternatives beyond the framework of the liberal economic logic which gives rise to those positions."
"We think it contains too many negative points and not enough positive points, and that has determined the way we voted."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 1.05 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 6 November 1997."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to inform you that yesterday, 16 November, the Chinese dissident Mr Wei Jingsheng was released. In 1996, the European Parliament awarded him the Sakharov Prize for freedom of expression, in recognition of his struggle to promote democratic freedoms and human rights."
"However, although Mr Wei Jingsheng has been released, we should not forget that he has been forced to leave his country, and that China's prisons are still full of political prisoners."
"Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, the second news item I have to mention is by contrast a source of sorrow and anger: an extremist group has gunned down two busloads of tourists in Luxor."
"As far as we know at the moment, 79 people appear to have been killed, including a number of German and French citizens of the European Union."
"I feel sure I speak for the whole House in expressing our outrage at this act, and our solidarity with the victims."
"We will immediately send Parliament's condolences to the victims' families, and to the government of the country in which this barbarous act was committed."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of 6 November 1997 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"During the last part-session of Parliament, nine Liverpool supporters were arrested following an incident outside the Strasbourg stadium."
"Three of them were sentenced to eight months in prison."
"Whilst I quite understand that the French authorities wish to send a firm and clear message to potential football hooligans that this will not be tolerated in next year's World Cup, I must say that I find it somewhat excessive to impose a sentence of eight months for what was actually a very minor scuffle in a very incident-free match, involving people who have no previous convictions and no history of being involved in such incidents."
"I wondered whether you would join with me, Mr President, in appealing to our former colleague, Mrs Elisabeth Guigou, Minister of Justice and Garde des Sceaux , to look into the sentencing policy that surrounds this incident."
"(Mixed reactions)"
"Mr President, I asked you four months ago if you would find out how it was possible for the Council presidency to say at the conference in Zimbabwe that Parliament had no view on CITES."
"Parliament had in fact passed an urgent resolution, so it did indeed have a view."
"That view was available there as well, yet the whole international assembly said that we did not have one."
"I have asked here several times how such a thing could be possible, and I insist on getting an answer. I am slowly beginning to suspect that we increasingly pass resolutions here, which never reach their recipient."
"This can only create the impression that our work is pointless, or that it is not taken seriously."
"I do not believe either is the case, and it annoys me, for one."
"I would ask you now, and I am very much in earnest, to arrange for an answer to be given please, because the matter dates from July and it is now November."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz."
"I shall certainly ask the Council why you have still not received an answer, and we shall insist that they do reply."
"Mr President, the special Air France flight which enables us to attend the week-long part-sessions is experiencing constant scheduling difficulties, because of the attitude of the authorities at Madrid-Barajas airport."
"I would be grateful, Mr President, if you could approach the airport authorities on our behalf to sort out this scheduling problem once and for all."
"Also, I should like to thank Air France for all their efficiency and care today, which meant that we were able to arrive on time. I think they deserve our gratitude."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Díez de Rivera."
"It appears that the problems could not all have been due to a single airport authority, but that certain other people were also responsible."
"I have asked the Secretary General to find out exactly what happened, and once we know that, we will approach whoever is responsible for these alterations."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"As the rapporteur on China, I wish to associate myself with your remarks about Wei Jingsheng."
"We should also remember, of course, that there are many thousands of others still in prison in China for the same alleged crime."
"The Sakharov Prize is for freedom of expression."
"I refer to a matter that was brought to your attention at the last Strasbourg plenary regarding the now famous 'Strasbourg Four' - some of our colleagues in the Labour Group who were under an injunction not to speak about their selection procedures for the European elections..."
"Mr McMillan-Scott, this matter has been dealt with by the committee responsible."
"The decision has been taken."
"It is not on the agenda and it is not a matter for the part-session."
"I am sorry, I cannot let you raise this matter again."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"It is a matter that will be raised during the week and it concerns a human rights issue, a question of civil liberties..."
"Mr Andrews, questions of human rights cannot be dealt with in part-session at this time."
"I know you are referring to Ms McAliskey."
"If you want, I will take your letter and ask what is happening."
"If you want to give me more information that would be good."
"However, we cannot waste time now with questions which do not relate to the agenda."
"Mr President, thank you for your remarks concerning Mr Wei Jingsheng."
"As he was not able to receive the prize in person last year, perhaps it could be combined with the next part-session ceremony for the presentation of the Sakharov Prize to Mrs Ghezali?"
"Thank you, Mr Dupuis, I will talk to the Conference of Presidents about this."
"We will choose the best moment to receive Mr Wei Jingsheng, as the Sakharov Prize was presented to him via a third person."
"We will, however, try to receive him here at the most appropriate moment possible."
"Mr President, I should like to comment briefly on the issue you allowed Mr Corbett to comment on."
"Thank you for saying that you will look into this issue."
"I do not disagree with what you said about the judiciary in various Member States but I would say that many football supporters across Europe get very poor treatment both by police and courts."
"I would also point out that there is much more reticence in criticizing courts and police behaviour in many parts of the world during our human rights debates each month in Strasbourg."
"Please bear that in mind."
"Mr President, I wish to comment on the agenda for today and tomorrow."
"It mentions that the sittings from 7 p.m. onwards today and between 5.30 p.m. and 7 p.m. tomorrow are reserved for urgent meetings of parliamentary committees authorized by you yourself, Mr President."
"I note that this method is new compared to that of previous agendas."
"I believe this is a consequence of the Court of Justice's ruling of 1 October last."
"I note therefore that you are applying, as from 1997, a ruling of the Court of Justice of October 1997."
"I would have liked to have seen the same happen for our 1997 session timetable."
"I therefore note that with regard to this ruling of the Court of Justice you are using different methods of implementation depending on the point in question."
"No, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, I am not implementing the points differently. It is the Conference of Presidents which has drawn the conclusions from this ruling."
"On the one hand, it was not financially possible, as you well know, to organize an additional part-session in Strasbourg in November. However, on the other hand, we wanted to adhere strictly to the Edinburgh decision regarding committee meetings."
"We have therefore adopted a system which limits committee meetings at Strasbourg to the bare minimum required for the work of the House."
"This system will be applied as strictly as is necessary."
"On this occasion, once again, we are in a transition stage. I hope that, by the next part-session, there will be fewer committee meetings."
"Mr President, I cannot understand how you can pass over the rights of an Irish person, who has been in a British prison for 12 months with no charges preferred, and yet give a hearing to UK Members who are raising the matter of four Liverpool supporters in prison in Strasbourg."
"I would suggest we should have the right to raise a matter concerning a citizen of our country and I would respectfully say to Members of this House that they should have been in Brussels last Saturday night when there was no trouble at all with 10, 000 Irish supporters."
"And even if there had been we would not be raising it in this House."
"Mr Gallagher, I do not think we need return to a matter which, at the moment, is not our responsibility."
"I have already said that we will find out the precise details."
"Order of business"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I must inform you that the deadlines in relation to the statements on the third conference on climate change in Kyoto have been extended as follows: motions for resolutions, 7 p.m. this evening; amendments and joint motions, 4 p.m. tomorrow, Tuesday."
"The vote will be taken on Thursday."
"Tuesday and Wednesday: no changes."
"Thursday:"
"The UPE Group has asked for Mr Scapagnini's report, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the Commission communication on energy policy (A4-0308/97), to be given a more favourable place on the agenda on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday."
"Mr Scapagnini now has the floor, to move the request."
"Mr President, thank you for allowing me to speak on this point."
"I would like to point out that I have had to complain several times, including in writing, as chairman of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, that the its reports end up being discussed at very odd times: either late in the evening or at the very end of the sitting."
"This has happened again today with this important report on the review of energy policy measures."
"However, Mr President, as I realize that the agenda is extremely full, I would be prepared, if you agree, to ask for the report to be deferred to a future sitting provided, I must add, respectfully but also emphatically, that it is possible to discuss it at a suitable time."
"We are therefore prepared to defer the report to a future sitting because I realize that the situation is very critical at present, provided, as I said, that a suitable time is allocated."
"Mr Scapagnini, are you asking for your report to be dealt with on a different day of the week, or for it to be postponed to another part-session?"
"Mr President, the main request is to be able to bring the report forward to a more suitable time on Tuesday or Wednesday."
"If that is not possible, the secondary request is to defer it to a future part-session at a suitable time."
"Mr President, I wish to oppose that, because this report is a good one, and it would be a pity if we were to adjourn it."
"Whether it is dealt with on Wednesday or Thursday really makes no difference."
"I see no earthly reason, in any case, why we should adjourn the report."
"I move that it should not be adjourned."
"Mr President, I understand Mr Scapagnini's point but there is no space to bring this forward, without breaking up some of the very important debates we already have timetabled."
"My group would support taking it at a later part-session if Mr Scapagnini is not happy with its position on the agenda this month."
"Well, now that we have heard that comment, I put to the House the proposal that the Scapagnini report should be brought forward to Wednesday."
"(Parliament rejected the proposal)"
"I now put to the House the proposal to postpone the Scapagnini report."
"(Parliament approved the proposal)"
"In view of the fact that there is now a space on the agenda, you will recollect the discussion in the Conference of Presidents on the Jöns report on the European Social Fund which was originally envisaged for this month's agenda but which had to be dropped because there was no space."
"Perhaps we could now put this report in."
"I understand it is acceptable to the chairman of the committee and to the rapporteur that it goes into that space on Thursday's agenda."
"So, Mrs Green has requested that Mrs Jöns' report on the future of the European Social Fund should replace the Scapagnini report."
"Does anybody wish to speak in favour of Mrs Green's request?"
"Mr President, I would like to support the proposition."
"The Commission will issue its own communication on the future of the Social Fund at the turn of the year."
"If we are to influence that with this owninitiative report, it is imperative that we adopt it this week."
"There will be no time at all for it to be taken into account if we adopt it in December instead."
"I very much support this proposition."
"Since nobody wishes to speak against the proposal, I now put it to the House that the Jöns report should be placed on Thursday's agenda."
"(Parliament approved the proposal)"
"Mr President, I notice that in the draft agenda you are proposing, no specific time has been fixed for Question Time to the Council. This normally takes place from 5.30 p.m. to 7 p.m. on Wednesdays - which I think is traditional, and was agreed with Council - but its normal slot has been given to the important vote on the report by Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Tsatsos, after which the agenda just says ""followed by Question Time to the Council' ."
"I feel this lack of formality is inappropriate, partly because the Members of this House consider Question Time to the Council to be very important, and partly because of the respect we owe to Council, whose members should be informed of the precise time at which we plan to put these questions to them."
"Therefore, Mr President, I have to tell you that I am puzzled by this lack of clarity in the draft agenda."
"Thank you very much, Mr Gutiérrez. Question Time is indeed very important, and so is the debate in question, which concerns Parliament's opinion on the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"They both need to be accommodated, which is why the Conference of Presidents decided to extend the evening session, as you will see in the agenda, to 8 p.m. Assuming that the vote on the report by Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Tsatsos can be completed in about an hour and a half, we will still have from 6.30 p.m. until 8 p.m. for Question Time to the Council, which is the normal amount of time."
"In any case, we expect Council to be very interested in the vote on the Méndez de Vigo and Tsatsos report, which means that its members will probably be here during voting time, and will therefore be available to Members of this House who might want to put proposals to them."
"I realize this is not an ideal solution, but it was the only way to combine two such important items, which both had to be accommodated in a part-session which was already very full."
"Mr President, I would like Mr Posselt to know that we did not hear the question in this group, because if we had I could have explained that we tried very hard to keep Question Time with the Council on the agenda."
"It is just scheduled a little later now."
"In fact, it has only been postponed by one hour."
"I could tell you, Mr Posselt, what some Foreign Ministers have said to me about the evening sessions of Question Time to the Council, as regards attendance and Parliament's reputation. However, I think it best not to repeat such things in public."
"Friday: no changes."
"(The order of business was thus established)"
"Climate change"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report (A4-0343/97) by Mr Linkohr, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee, and the Committee of the Regions on the energy dimension of climate change (COM(97)0196 - C4-0232/97), and-the statements by the Council and Commission on the third conference on climate change (Kyoto, December 1997)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Chamber empties one can at least say the greenhouse effect here is reduced a little - but only here inside the Chamber."
"As for the matter in hand, I should like to say to the Commission that Europe has behaved relatively well in the runup to Kyoto."
"I want to say that at the outset, because that praise is deserved."
"When we look at reality, however, and not just at the printed word, there is rather more to say."
"If the climatologists are correct, then we have to reduce CO2 emissions world-wide to 10 thousand million tonnes by the year 2050."
"At present we stand at about 22 thousand million tonnes. If we assume that the world population by the middle of the next century will have reached 10 thousand million people, then by that time every single person will have to be producing no more than 1 tonne of CO2 ."
"In the EU the current figure is on average 8.4 tonnes, in Germany 11 tonnes and in Denmark 12 tonnes."
"If we assume that the principle of equality applies, then Europeans will have to reduce CO2 emissions within two generations to one-eighth, Germans to one-eleventh, and Danes to one-twelfth."
"In fact, though, emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases are rising, and most scenarios assume that a comparison of 2000 with 1990 will show a Europe-wide CO2 increase of 5 %."
"The only exceptions amongst the 15 Member States will be Great Britain, because they started early with the replacement of coal by gas, and Germany, because its statistics have been altered by reunification."
"The main cause of the reduction of CO2 emissions in Germany has been the collapse of the East German industrial base; in West Germany emissions are on the increase again."
"So if there is no great change in conditions, CO2 emissions will continue to increase up to 2010 and are even likely to reach a worldwide figure of 32 thousand million tonnes."
"Those are the stark figures."
"Unless, as I have said, we steer another course."
"The years 1978 to 1985 show that this is possible."
"In that period the ratio of energy consumption to gross domestic product was reduced by 2 0 %."
"But because energy - oil - then became cheaper, the increase in efficiency over the following ten years was only abut 5 %."
"We have to learn the moral of that: low energy costs are an obstacle to an active climate policy."
"It is a harsh economic and social fact that only expensive energy gets saved."
"We cannot avoid a new Community-wide energy tax."
"Anyone who does not want that - and I can sympathize with them - should not talk about climate policy."
"The European Union - by which I mean the Council and Commission - have, as has been said, taken a relatively courageous stand."
"They have promised to reduce CO2 emissions by 15 % by the year 2010."
"But our courage seems to be just a front - and I do not think that is just apparent."
"We are further than ever from an ecological tax reform."
"We swear by renewable energy sources, but their proportion of energy production is growing only slowly, and support programmes are being cut by the Council."
"I would cite our vain efforts on behalf of Thermie II."
"Voluntary measures, such as green pricing and voluntary undertakings within industry are certainly helpful, but fall far short of what is needed."
"Even the joint implementation recommended in Berlin did not survive an initial phase."
"Up to now clear guidelines, which would make joint implementation different from mere export trade, have been lacking."
"Tradeable emission permits, proposed by the USA, meet with no favour in the Council - although I would digress to recommend that we do in fact give this proposal serious consideration."
"So the proposals from the Commission and Council remain, however much I regret it, pure propaganda as long as they are not followed by definite measures."
"And where are those?"
"We even read in the press that the Commission is prepared to withdraw its proposals."
"What the European Parliament or the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy wants to achieve with the resolution is this: we need specific and ambitious objectives; we should undertake to reduce greenhouse gases significantly within a definite period; and we will then undertake to see that this obligation is maintained worldwide."
"Where the obligations are not upheld, sanctions should be possible."
"For this we further propose an international Climate Agency."
"That is the essence of the message and I hope to enlist Parliament's support for it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the eighth meeting of the Ad Hoc Berlin Mandate Group, which recently ended in Bonn after two weeks of intense negotiation, cannot be considered a success."
"Progress was extremely limited and was confined to relatively unimportant issues."
"Nevertheless some positions were clarified, certainly after the United States and Japan presented fairly structured proposals."
"The position taken by the United States was probably the most memorable event of the ABMG meeting."
"In his speech, President Clinton showed an awareness of the gravity of the problem of climate change and of the responsibilities resulting from this. We in Europe also agree with his analysis of the great potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the industrialized countries at limited cost through improved energy efficiency and elimination of waste."
"But we deplore the fact that this analysis does not translate into fixed objectives adequate to the challenges of climate change."
"The Community and its Member States have reconfirmed their negotiating position regarding the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the industrialized countries: 7.5 % reduction by the year 2005, 15 % reduction by the year 2010."
"These objectives are supported by the Group of 77 and China and thus by a large majority of the parties concerned."
"It should nevertheless be noted that the G77 is also asking all industrialized countries to reduce their emissions by 35 % by the year 2020."
"The Community also continues to support the need for common policies and measures."
"We remain convinced that the reductions we are proposing are necessary and achievable, both technically and economically."
"In its communication, the Commission set out a Community approach with a view to the Kyoto Conference, which provides very useful elements to that effect."
"The proposals made by the United States and Japan, shared by other parties to the convention such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand, have increased flexibility in common."
"Whilst recognizing that flexibility can contribute to finding an acceptable solution for everyone at Kyoto, we have clearly stated that the priority condition for possible acceptance of an element of flexibility is the existence of sufficiently ambitious objectives."
"Regarding the elements of flexibility to be considered in this context, the Council of 16 October had already showed willingness to consider budgetary periods instead of base or target years, provided this does not delay action."
"To put it clearly, this means that the pivotal years must be those indicated in the Berlin Mandate, and that periods must be short, no more than five years maximum."
"Furthermore, the Union also accepts the need for flexibility in the choice of base years regarding the protocol commitments to be fulfilled by countries undergoing economic transition, whilst underlining that this flexibility should not be without limits."
"In the same spirit, possible trading in emission rights would be subjected to a series of safeguards, in particular to avoid a trade in hot air, based on emission levels reached before commencement of trading."
"Furthermore, in our opinion this trade must only represent a limited percentage of emissions and must be governed by a transparent and open international system."
"Equally strict safeguards would apply to the possible implementation of projects in common between protocol signatories, aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions."
"One last factor which some parties are stressing is the need to take into account greenhouse gas sinks."
"Whilst not excluding this possibility, we are aware of the difficulties of setting up appropriate methodologies and we prefer to leave this problem until a later date, after the necessary details have been worked out."
"Finally, regarding commitments to be fulfilled by developing countries, whilst naturally encouraging countries not party to the protocol to take on voluntary commitments, we cannot subscribe to the demands advanced by other parties aimed at immediately imposing legally binding obligations on developing countries."
"It is clear that such obligations do not fall within the Berlin Mandate, which must continue to guide our action."
"Nevertheless, with regard to this we think that a review of the obligations of the different parties must take place, as anticipated in the convention."
"This reexamination must be of a fairly general nature and carried out on the basis of a careful analysis of all the factors, independently of the adoption of the protocol."
"This process could be set in motion when the parties meet in Kyoto, where guidelines for such a review could be drawn up."
"Finally, as regards the European ""bubble' , may I remind you that the Council meeting in March decided on the division of the burden between the Member States within the objective of a proposed 15 % reduction by the year 2010."
"The Council of 16 October agreed on a text which was proposed by the Community and the Member States during the last negotiations and which aims to clarify responsibilities, in case the objective is not achieved by the Community as a whole."
"Furthermore, the text anticipates the possibility of other parties to the protocol grouping together to form ""bubbles' with commitments identical to those of the European Community."
"Nevertheless, the attacks on the European Community continue, based largely on the fact that the burden-sharing decided by the Council is resulting in a wide disparity in Member States' efforts to achieve targets."
"It is clear that these attacks are largely pretexts."
"The convention expressly anticipates the case of organizations such as the Community, in as far as there is a formal transfer of competence from the Member States to the organization, that is the Community, regarding certain areas covered by the protocol."
"It is up to the Community to ensure that the common objective is respected, even if, out of concern for transparency, we propose that burden-sharing be formally notified at the time of ratification of the protocol."
"The Community must assert itself, uphold its uniqueness and be proud of the guiding role it continues to have in this process."
"Following the ABMG meeting in Bonn, a series of ministerial level meetings have taken place in order to attempt to advance the process."
"On 4 November we had a meeting with the State Department in Washington, followed by meetings with Senator Byrd and the Secretary of State for Energy."
"This meeting, which took place in a very positive atmosphere, enabled both partners to come to a better understanding of each other's position and how they arrived at that position."
"At this stage, there is still no agreement between the United States and the European Union regarding reduction objectives, particularly because the United States is depending on being able to use flexibility mechanisms such as trading and joint implementation to achieve their objective of stabilization of emissions at the 1990 level between the years 2008 and 2012."
"The United States also wants key developing countries such as China and India to be included in the process for fear of their refusing legally binding commitments."
"The European Union has again clearly stated its position and made known to the United States that we do not think that mere stabilization provides a sufficient political and moral basis from which to convince the developing countries to participate in the process from now on."
"Furthermore, the European Union remains convinced that the mechanisms for flexibility and above all trading in emission rights should only be applied on condition that ambitious objectives are put in place which must be achieved largely through domestic actions."
"The United States and the European Union agreed to continue bilateral negotiations at all levels in the days to come."
"The first occasion that presented itself was the Tokyo Conference of 8 and 9 November."
"The three main areas discussed were the objectives and elements of flexibility, policies and measures, and the developing world."
"At the time of the discussions on reduction and limitation objectives, it appeared that nearly all the participants were of the opinion that these should be legally binding."
"However, differences of opinion existed as to when action should commenc, above all regarding objective 2000."
"The proposals currently on the table vary between zero (stabilization) and 15 % below the 1990 level."
"A decision has yet to be taken regarding the inclusion of sinks and regarding the number of gases to be dealt with."
"The participants also had different opinions on the option to be negotiated at Kyoto: the flat rate, proposed by the EU and the United States, or the differentiation of objectives."
"We all hoped that Kyoto would be a success. Nevertheless, there remain many points of divergence on the crucial issues and there will be a need for political will if we are to resolve all these problems in the few days remaining."
"I sincerely believe agreement is still possible at Kyoto, but we must avoid agreement at any price due to pressure of time."
"The European Union remains convinced that all industrialized countries must adopt legally binding and ambitious objectives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
"Furthermore, we cannot delay action any longer."
"I have arranged for European Union Environment Ministers to have an informal meeting on 7 December in Kyoto in order to take stock of the situation and to decide on the course to take in the negotiations."
"Meanwhile, we will have to make all the necessary efforts to continue discussions with other key partners so that we can come up with a way of finding a consensus."
"Finally, and independently of the Kyoto results, the European Union will have to decide, at its ordinary meeting on 6 December, whether its own negotiating position can become a unilateral arrangement if the other parties cannot accept the targeted reductions."
"At that time the European Union will also have to decide on future measures to be taken in order to achieve these objectives."
"Mr President, I am very glad Parliament has decided to discuss climate change during this sitting on the basis of Mr Linkohr's report and Mr Pimenta's resolution on climate change."
"These two proposals strengthen the EU's negotiating position, and it is recognized that there is a need for policies, measures and adequate resources, particularly in the energy sector, if our reduction targets are to be achieved."
"I am sure that Parliament will support the Commission's efforts in this field after Kyoto."
"International climate policy is now at a decisive stage."
"In about two weeks' time, ministers from more than 150 countries will be meeting at Kyoto in Japan to issue a protocol on climate changes."
"This protocol will contain legally binding commitments for the industrialized nations to reduce their emissions in the period after the year 2000."
"Let me therefore now take this opportunity of giving my assessment of the situation after attending the meetings in Washington and Tokyo at the beginning of November."
"First, a little about the EU's position."
"The EU will of course retain its own proposals which, as you know, require a 15 % reduction in emissions of three greenhouse gases by 2010 compared with 1990 and of 7.5 % by the year 2005."
"This means that concrete action must be taken immediately, and at the same time there will be a check on progress made in this field."
"I am pleased that Parliament is supporting the EU's position: that will strengthen our hand at the negotiating table."
"On the other hand, we must be careful not to weaken our joint position by discussing the possibility of an even more ambitious negotiating position."
"The emission reduction targets were passed at the highest political level in terms of environment."
"They were established in the light of studies which showed that the targets were technically feasible, financially achievable and politically possible by using existing technology and methods, as the President-in-Office has already emphasized."
"But it was assumed, and I emphasize the word ""assumed' , that other industrialized nations would also make the same or equivalent commitments."
"In view of this, I do not think it would be appropriate to follow the approach in Mr Pimenta's resolution of the EU Member States changing their own position for the years 2005 and 2010 to a unilaterally binding commitment."
"How can we put pressure on other industrialized nations if we announce that we are going to be making cuts unilaterally beforehand?"
"We certainly need to get both the Americans and the Japanese more on board. But the EU's proposals contain more than just targets."
"We believe that the best way of meeting the reduction targets is to work together on the various policies and measures."
"We have also launched an active search for a system which makes it possible to use emission trading as a cost-effective solution."
"However, emission trading, as it is now called in just about every language, can only occur under conditions that ensure that something is actually being done to help the climate and not just a paper transaction."
"On this point, we have emphasized, in particular, that only a minority of the overall commitments can be carried out via such flexibility arrangements so as to ensure that all parties make reasonable efforts, including on their home ground."
"The second main condition is that emission trading should be based on the principle of simultaneity, that is, historical emission quotas which are established for one reason or another should not be traded."
"This is particularly important because there will be far lower CO2 emissions in the next few years and for a number of years to come, in Russia and other former Communist areas for example, because of the change from one system to another."
"It cannot be the intention that the OECD countries should use this fall in CO2 emissions to free themselves from reasonable commitments to do something about energy consumption in the transport sector, the energy sector and industry."
"If we are to achieve an ambitious result in Kyoto, it is clear that the EU must continue to take the lead."
"We cannot expect the USA and Japan to be out in front."
"Their targets are too modest, and their credibility amongst the developing countries is lower than ever."
"I hope that the EU can build a bridge between the parties."
"The EU's negotiating position has been extensively debated, both within the EU itself and at international level, and in particular amongst other industrialized nations."
"Reactions have varied considerably, from positive acceptance of an ambitious policy to scepticism and doubt about whether the targets are technically, financially or politically achievable."
"To meet these concerns, the Commission issued a communication on climate change in October which meets the criticism by explaining the background to the EU's negotiating position."
"The communication shows that we can achieve our emission reduction targets without harming our economies."
"When I visited Washington and Tokyo, I explained how the EU will achieve the 15 % target, with concrete examples of (amongst other things) renewable energy, combined heat and power generation, cars and switches to other modes of transport and energy efficiency in the household and service sector."
"On the basis of our communication on climate changes published recently, we can also show that the costs are tolerable."
"But it will still take some effort to combat climate changes."
"They cannot make the excuse that they will take equivalent action with equivalent results in their own countries, and as President Clinton said in his speech to the National Geographic Society on 22 October, most of that action will be wholly beneficial to the USA."
"On the other hand, there was considerable reluctance to deal with vested interests and any kind of costs."
"So what are the main obstacles to an effective agreement in Kyoto?"
"The main obstacle in our view is the minimalist, rigid positions which the other industrial countries have adopted, especially the USA and Japan."
"Some countries, such as Australia and Canada, have not even put forward concrete proposals yet."
"The USA cannot ignore the problem."
"It accounts for the greatest emissions in absolute terms of greenhouse gases in the world: 5, 006 million tonnes in 1994, and the figure is rising all the time."
"And they also have the highest figure when it comes to emissions per head of population, over 10 times more than most developing countries."
"Most - I think we could even say all - industrialized nations now realize that the world has actually got a problem on its hands."
"They agree with the EU and others in accepting the scientific consensus that human generated climate change is a reality, and (what is even more important) that climate change will have real effects, such as serious health problems, loss of a considerable proportion of the world's biodiversity, loss of territory and infrastructural costs as a result of the rise in ocean levels, floods and droughts, and dramatic changes in weather patterns."
"What can we hope to achieve at Tokyo?"
"First, a guarantee of high, legally binding reduction targets which will put the world on the right track to solving the climate problems."
"So what we have to do now is to reach a legally binding agreement which sets ambitious reduction targets for all the industrialized nations."
"And ambitious is the key word."
"A legally binding commitment must not become an excuse to set a reduction target which is merely a lowest common denominator."
"The only way to reach a solution in Tokyo is to oppose setting the same percentage reduction for all industrialized nations."
"The EU is not simply being rigid: we would like to consider flexible measures, as I said before, but only on condition that there are commitments to ambitious reduction targets, as I said earlier."
"The Commission also shares Mr Pimenta's concern about other greenhouse gases, namely HFCs, PFCs and SF6, for which a solution has to be found."
"The Council already decided in the conclusions of its March meeting that these gases would be included in the EU's basket of gases by the year 2000 at the latest."
"But the question is whether these gases should be included in this basket now or not."
"The Commission has raised the question with the Member States."
"The effects of including these three gases are modest, as even the whole of the EU together would only add another 2 % in CO2 equivalent."
"However, for certain Member States, this additional effort will be some proof that the burden is being shared, so it is essential to find a solution."
"But as this question is important to our negotiating partners, the Commission and the Member States are currently working on it with the Presidentin-Office in Brussels."
"The Commission is trying to find the best way is of reaching a common EU position in this field, and I am of course hoping that Member States will show the necessary flexibility."
"These reduction targets should be accompanied by certain common measures or procedures so that we avoid the problem of distortion of competition."
"I am also going to Kyoto on behalf of the Commission to get results."
"We are prepared to negotiate, and I know that we can count on Parliament's support."
"Parliament's resolution on climate change will send out clear signals to our partners."
"The EU has marked out a clear route for dealing with the climate question."
"What we need are effective, ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, global warming is undoubtedly the biggest problem facing humanity today."
"Man is changing the atmosphere and the climatic cycles that have shaped human life since the dawn of civilization."
"They are being changed irreversibly and we do not know where we are going."
"We do know that global warming, rising sea levels and the premature appearance and aggravation of phenomena such as El Niño this year have already caused thousands of deaths in South America, huge forest fires in Asia, unprecedented floods in Germany, the Central European countries, Portugal and Spain, and a whole train of destruction with incalculable human suffering."
"Humanity has a rendezvous in Kyoto in three weeks' time."
"It is quite unthinkable that Kyoto should turn out to be a failure."
"This time the European Union's position is clear; and this Parliament has given overall support to a 7.5 % reduction in emissions by 2005 and a 15 % reduction by 2010."
"We have also given overall support to the statement of 1 October 1997 on climate change, which, furthermore, is a much better-drafted and more fundamental document than the earlier one on the implications of global warming for energy, on which we have serious reservations."
"It is not enough, however, to submit a good proposal such as that of 1 October."
"We need an internal set of policies on the environment, energy, transport and so on which will radically improve our efficient use of energy and renewable forms of energy and bring in tax reforms."
"Unfortunately, those policies do not yet exist; and, if we look at the 1998 budget, there is no provision for such policies."
"There lies the Achilles heel of European strategy."
"This Parliament has admitted as much: as long ago as January we asked the Commission and the Council to tell us objectively, in quantified terms and with supporting data, how we are going to achieve the reductions in emissions to which we are now committing ourselves."
"As far as non-European countries are concerned, it is unacceptable that the United States, with 4 % of the world's population, should be responsible for nearly 25 % of the world's atmospheric pollution."
"In Kyoto we must achieve a compulsory timetable for reduction by the developed countries and a mechanism embracing all the developing countries to achieve the levelling-out and reduction of atmospheric emissions per capita in the medium term throughout the world."
"Flexibility arrangements and the devices of the market cannot conceal the enormous differences between countries."
"Since we all have to make an effort, it is obviously the case that greatest effort should be made by the country that has used up most of the planet's resources and is causing most pollution."
"Madam Commissioner, Minister, we shall be together in Kyoto, but I also hope we shall be here in January, when we finally begin to put into practice what we signed up to at the Earth summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992."
"Mr President, I am very pleased that we have the opportunity today to talk about the way the European Union has been performing at the Kyoto conference, and I should like to thank the President of the Council and the Commissioner for briefing us so fully."
"On the other hand, I am a little sad when I hear what you have to say, and when I think back nine years to the Toronto Objective, formulated at that time, in which there was talk of a 20 % reduction in emissions by the year 2005."
"Today we are a long way from that, but I am glad that at least in the European Union a clear aim has been set, and that we have agreed to call for a genuine reduction within a reasonable time."
"Mr Linkohr has already said we certainly want to, but will we be able to?"
"I think we shall have to expand the political options if we are to achieve the intended reduction."
"We must also discuss options other than those to do with energy, because there are one or two other things which will help us reduce greenhouse emissions, not just in the energy sector."
"I am referring here to switching to other production methods, and also to the retention of emissions."
"Perhaps I can mention a few examples."
"As far as energy is concerned, it is certainly a matter of greater efficiency in order to achieve better utilization, but also of using forms of energy which produce less CO2 - I am thinking here of renewable resources, familiar to everyone in the House, I am sure."
"One must, however, limit the use of energy by vehicles in the same way - we shall shortly have an opportunity to discuss this as part of the vehicle oil programme."
"Other policy options are, for example, agriculture and forestry, and not just where the aim is to reduce methane emissions, but also where we aim to prepare our plants and forests for a general change in climate: where different forestry methods and other types of fertilizer are used so that this general change will not mean the death of our forests."
"I say this as someone who comes from the Alps, where forests are very important."
"We need to prepare our industry and give some thought to possible methods of producing chemicals or metals in industry; waste disposal will have to be examined as well."
"My next point is very important - and here I address myself directly to the President of the Council, because I know that the subject of jobs is being discussed this week in Luxembourg."
"Not only can a reduction in heating, and hence less CO2 emissions, be achieved very quickly in almost every European country by the use of heat insulation, but numerous jobs could be created, particularly in small and medium-sized businesses, and the well-being of people can be increased."
"We could be in a win/win situation here, which really ought to be exploited. I hope that a proposal of this kind will be forthcoming."
"It is incomprehensible that the USA appears to be thinking only of the short term and putting cheap energy for its economy before the interests of the climate."
"I think we in Europe need industrial innovation right now, and that we could save the costs of change a thousand times over, compared to when the very high costs of climatic change become payable."
"After Kyoto we shall certainly receive a report in this House concerning implementation, particularly how and with what programmes we can achieve it in the Union. I very much hope that we shall not have to say afterwards that it was not a legally binding agreement, and that even if it were, the values were so low that we would not achieve our aim."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time the European Parliament has concerned itself with the question of how we should play our part long term in the marked reduction of trace gases relevant to climatic change, in order to achieve a real alteration in climate."
"The Group of the European People's Party agrees with the rapporteur on very many points."
"We need clear and straightforward regulations in order really to achieve all the measures required within the general category of long term economic management."
"This concerns many areas, not just energy and industrial policies."
"These points have already been discussed."
"I should also like to say, however, that we must approach all these problems undogmatically."
"We must also change our attitudes a little, each in his own specialization, so that we can arrive at a common decision."
"Climate protection and economic success are not mutually exclusive, but can be reconciled by, for example, the issue of emission permits - as you mentioned, Madam Commissioner."
"I think that is the right idea."
"We in the EPP Group have little sympathy for the establishment of an international Climate Agency."
"If this should prove to be Kyoto's sole success, then we shall have failed, then we really shall not have achieved anything!"
"We think it is quite the wrong beginning, to solve environmental problems by the creation of new bureaucracies."
"At both European and international levels there any number of bureaucracies available to us."
"More efficient linkage of existing authorities would be a different matter."
"There is a very sensible proposal in point 16 of the Linkohr resolution."
"We agree with that, but please, no new administrations whose main function is cooperation with other administrations."
"That will not solve any climate problems!"
"I should also like to say that we in the PPE Group will support Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel's amendment."
"The OECD presented calculations just this weekend showing that a CO2 tax, for example, together with a reduction in taxes on labour as a factor of production, could be really practical."
"That is not a matter of dogma for our group, and we shall support it."
"We must also make our views felt, of course, when it comes to reminding other large economic regions of their responsibilities for climate protection."
"Climate protection cannot function if reductions in some regions, such as the European Union, result in more emissions in others, because of relocation of industry."
"Here it is our duty, through our numerous delegations, to work with all our partners worldwide."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, the Kyoto meeting provides the opportunity to face the problem of climate change caused by anthropic activity with greater rigour."
"It seems to me from the press that we can hope for a more committed attitude from the US government, which we need if we are to achieve specific results together."
"On behalf of my group, and in relation to the problem of development, I would like to reaffirm several inspiring principles already set out by the Commissioner and by the Linkohr report."
"First, even if the scientific information on the correlation between industrial activities and climate change is not utterly convincing, the cost of the risk is sufficiently high that serious and speedy measures are imperative."
"Secondly, environmental protection measures should come first of all from the industrially developed countries."
"The problem is a global one, however, and cannot be resolved without also involving the developing and recently industrialized countries."
"Thirdly, it is not true that all environmental protection measures create difficulties for economic growth, but it is true that the environmental measures should be gradual and universal as far as possible, so as not to create market imbalances."
"Fourthly, in addition to technical efficiency in energy production and transportation systems, I would also mention the importance of energy saving."
"This point has been dealt with in Mr Linkohr's report."
"The point relating to Community energy tax was dealt with by the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy with our support. The interpretation given is that the various energy taxes should be harmonized at Community level, possibly with a neutral global effect."
"With regard to the action the Commission will have to take at the Kyoto Conference, I hope it will be possible to find an ambitious common position with the United States, because that could lead to a broader consensus and I do not think any progress can be made by accepting further competitive disadvantages in relation to American industry."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Commissioner, first I would like to congratulate Mr Linkohr on his excellent report."
"It is not that easy for sustainable energy from renewable sources to get off the ground, largely because there is no market for it at the moment."
"Oil and gas continue to dominate energy consumption."
"Yet the industry believes that sustainable energy has a future."
"Shell, for example, is investing one billion guilders in a new division for solar energy."
"Shell is following British Petroleum (BP), which already has a separate division for solar energy."
"Both Shell and BP are focussing their attention on lowering the price of solar panels in order to develop a market."
"In addition, investment in developing countries can play a crucial role in this."
"Two-thirds of the world, after all, is not yet connected to mains electricity."
"Large-scale solar energy projects contribute to the development of village communities and promote the use of renewable energy sources, thus preventing the emissions of CO2 ."
"My group is of the opinion that the political world and certainly Europe has the obligation to support such developments."
"Partly in view of Kyoto, the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party regrets that time and again the Council refuses to allocate sufficient resources to programmes aimed at encouraging sustainable energy and energy efficiency."
"The sun rises for free, and I hope the Council recognizes that soon."
"To conclude, Mr President, the Liberal Group takes the view that a Community energy tax is only feasible and acceptable when set against a reduction in tax on labour, thus retaining our industry's competitiveness."
"That alone will lead to new jobs and the preservation of existing jobs in Europe."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to express our group's agreement with Mr Linkohr's report and with the clarifications which have been given. We also agree with the proposal for an International Climate Agency, which we think is a very positive idea."
"My region, Murcia, like other regions of Spain such as Valencia, Andalusia and Estremadura, and regions of Portugal and other parts of the world, has suffered the consequences of terrible floods and rains, which can be attributed to the effects of this climate change."
"So we are well aware of the importance of the Kyoto summit, and the contribution which the European Union should make to it."
"However, we think it is important to get to the bottom of the problem, and not to avert our eyes when we are faced with something we do not like."
"I am referring to the fact that the root cause of these problems lies in the model of irreversible industrial growth which seeks continual increases in capital return, gross national product, profitability and competitiveness, with no thought for social needs or quality of life throughout the world."
"We need to change this model for one based on sustainable development and respect for nature, which can allow society to develop a similar attitude."
"Therefore, although we agree with the report, we think that certain basic elements should be introduced, such as the European Union's firm commitment, given in Toronto, to move towards reduction, and not towards the precise opposite, which is what is happening."
"Our energy consumption is increasing by 2 %, which will not get us anywhere."
"Furthermore, other gases should be included in the basket of greenhouse gases, and there should be alternative models for everything which involves energy consumption."
"We also need to provide more funds to improve the situation in Europe, and to obtain commitments from the three main players: the United States, Europe and Japan."
"Five years after Rio, and nothing to show for it except a lot of speeches and a lot of noise - some of it unfortunately just behind me."
"Absolutely no achievement. Nor are the Commission's reports on the subject very informative."
"They are vague, they lack ambition, they are insufficiently conclusive, and the biggest mistake is in the calculations - things simply do not add up."
"Our aim is to achieve a reduction of 15 % by the year 2010."
"Now the Commission says we need new nuclear power stations to reach that target."
"Even ignoring the fact that in most Member States these are quite unacceptable to public opinion, and the fact that their costs have grown much higher than those of gas power stations, there is still a construction period of 10 to 12 years, taking us into the year 2012, or at best 2010."
"How is that to be achieved in the time?"
"What we need is a revolution in energy efficiency."
"We need a change in our road traffic, which is the largest emitter of CO2 ."
"We need an energy tax, and of course we also need specific regulations for phasing in of energy from renewable sources."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, last week Greenpeace activists, who had assembled outside the US Embassy in Luxembourg, melted blocks of ice to symbolize the thawing of the polar icecaps due to the greenhouse effect."
"If Greenpeace activists wanted to show that the United States' position was far from helping the cause of the environment, then NGOs are of the opinion that the Commission's proposals are also far from helping this cause and that they will certainly not prevent the greenhouse effect worsening."
"Having said that, it has to be admitted that the approaches proposed by the Commission are worth considering."
"In this case it is about energy efficiency, about speeding up the establishment of renewable energy sources and, above all, about fiscal instruments."
"In this context, Mr President, let me recall the words of the President-in-Office himself, who last week stated the need to reduce taxation on labour and cease putting a financial burden on work, but also to introduce, at European level, taxes on CO2 and on energy."
"I am pleased that, for once, the ecologists' ideas have not fallen on deaf ears and I believe that, if the European Union truly wants to be credible at Kyoto, we must first of all start by imposing, for example, a tax on energy in our own countries."
"Mr President, we need to be careful when we talk about global warming, because at the moment there is nothing to prove that human action is responsible for this."
"A few centuries ago the polar icecaps were melting at a far faster rate than they are today."
"That said, it is clearly safer to err on the side of caution and it is therefore right to move in the direction of a reduction in the production of greenhouse gases."
"But in this case the policy that is being followed, in particular by the majority in this House, needs revising in two areas."
"First of all, the policy of globalization."
"The policy of free trade, and generalized free trade at that, which this House pursues by voting regularly, month after month, in favour of free trade agreements, promotes an increase in the production of greenhouse gases. In fact, each time a free trade agreement goes through there is an expansion in traffic, in movements of people and, of course, in the volume of goods transported."
"This is precisely what encourages the production of greenhouse gases. If we want to produce less greenhouse gases, let us agree fewer free trade agreements."
"My second comment relates to energy. If we want to reduce the production of greenhouse gases, rather than fighting against them let us choose sources of energy which produce less greenhouse gases."
"And what is currently the energy which produces the least greenhouse gases?"
"It is, quite simply, nuclear energy."
"Furthermore, France happens to be the country which produces the least greenhouse gases per inhabitant in the European Union for the very simple reason that, of the fifteen countries, it is the one that uses the most nuclear energy."
"With this in mind, the majority in this House should be a little more critical and a little more introspective, if they want to reduce the production of greenhouse gases."
"Finally, and in another respect, this House does not set an example."
"With the multiple journeys it requires and its vast glass buildings, it is not one of the greatest reducers of greenhouse gas production, but that is another issue."
"Mr President, currently there is a very expensive advertising campaign on US television in which people like the chairman of the Chrysler Corporation tell lies."
"This is the sort of lie they tell: ' If you took the measures that are necessary we would live in a life of dimming lights, turning off air conditioning, sacrificing our industrial competitiveness and curtailing our economic growth' ."
"That is a lie."
"It is a lie that market forces are guaranteeing efficient behaviour."
"If we undertook sensible policies, there are three things we could do which would almost eliminate the problem of climatic change."
"Over one half of the threat to the climate disappears if you use energy in a way that saves money - if, for example, your household appliances are efficient."
"You would eliminate another quarter if your farming and your forestry practices took carbon out of the air and put it back in the soil and the plants, where it should be."
"And the remainder would disappear if you took measures on other greenhouse gases like CFCs and methane."
"If our buildings and, in particular, our houses were designed properly we could manage with hardly any heating or cooling equipment."
"I was in the Rocky Mountain Institute in a snow storm, with very little heating equipment in use and looking at and admiring the banana trees."
"This is quite possible."
"You can be in a temperature of 115ºF in California and feel comfortable with very little electricity used."
"Power stations produce one-third of electricity and two-thirds of waste heat."
"With combined heat and power that could be eliminated."
"If we concentrated on hyper-cars we could have 70 % to 90 % fuel savings."
"In the United States petrol costs less than bottled mineral water."
"If we were more careful in the way we live and the materials we use, just as Mr Marset Campos said very clearly, we could eliminate this type of problem."
"Let us think about the developing world and the energy needs there."
"Energy efficiency in the developing world is abysmal."
"It is dreadfully poor."
"One shameful thing we do is to undertake negative technology transfer and deliberately sell goods in the developing world which are not energy efficient enough to use in our world."
"That is disgraceful."
"Luckily, where poor people live, often there is a lot of sunshine, which makes quite clearly the case for renewable energy in the developing world."
"Fuel cells, a technology of the future."
"Nuclear energy in the United States has cost US$ 1 trillion, one million million dollars."
"Yet, because it is so expensive it is not growing at all, any more than it is in western Europe."
"In fact, in the United States, it produces less energy than wood, even having cost that much."
"Energy taxes need to be carefully thought about."
"They certainly are a mechanism but we must make sure that they do not have other unwanted effects."
"I am becoming attracted to trading as a way of meeting our needs."
"In the United States - and I speak so much about it because I visited it recently to study carefully what is happening in that country - they have trading permits for sulphur dioxide."
"The benefits have been far greater than anyone could have foreseen."
"Once it costs you money to pollute you are very careful."
"You get novel experiences."
"A group of children in New York City have bought sulphur dioxide trading permits and they are keeping those permits and not selling them in order to prevent pollution."
"Others are being sold, so I agree with those who say we must not shift the whole responsibility onto the developing world."
"But trading permits seem to work."
"In a question like climate change, the European Union justifies its existence."
"It is a powerful bloc of countries whose climatic conditions could not vary more, from Lapland down to the islands of Greece, and where there is a huge variety of economic conditions."
"Let us use that strength in Kyoto to show what we can do."
"Mr President, the main points have actually been covered already."
"I should like to restrict myself, therefore, merely to a few facts and to a description of the situation, which is none too rosy."
"We all agree on the facts. We must do something to improve the climate and see that our CO2 emissions are reduced."
"We disagree on the objectives."
"What percentage reduction do we actually want to try to achieve?"
"How fast should it progress?"
"There is complete disarray about the methods for achieving our goals, themselves as yet not even properly defined."
"I must ask, Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, what do we actually expect of the Commission?"
"The European Union is too small, faced by this global problem, to work out solutions on its own."
"We at least need to have the USA on board."
"We need to show all industrial nations our determination and to lead by example."
"It is our duty to provide an example. It is our duty to show states which are still undergoing industrial development that there are other ways than the ones we have taken."
"These states do not all have to repeat our mistakes."
"We need voluntary agreements - my group and I would support that - which would then have to be kept."
"According to optimistic assessments eight thousand million people will inhabit this planet in 2050."
"Other calculations forecast even higher figures."
"If those eight behave then as five do today, our planet is really close to its end."
"We have got to act now!"
"Mr President, the problem of global warming is one that the European Union cannot ignore."
"The US must also play its part in Japan."
"Global warming is a problem of such magnitude that national policies alone are not effective."
"International cooperation is the bottom line."
"If bus and car emissions are maintained at their current levels then the average temperature could rise by 2 % compared to 1990 levels."
"It is worth bearing in mind that a 1 % increase can lead to ecosystem damage."
"There have already been disastrous floods in Portugal, Spain, Somalia and Mexico this year."
"These disasters, while significant in themselves, may be only a portent of a greater global catastrophe to come."
"I am anxious about the potential damage to the Irish ecosystem with potentially dangerous effects on Irish agriculture and our tourism sector."
"In Ireland, as in all of the European Union, all sectors must play their part in tackling global warming."
"For my part, I am wary of suggestions to introduce new forms of taxation."
"I believe it will be the hard-pressed consumers who will end up bearing the brunt."
"A report just issued by Ireland's Economic and Social Research Institute makes a significant attempt to quantify the cost of reducing gas emissions linked to global warming."
"The costs involved are very real, with direct implications for jobs, consumers and electricity generation."
"However, serious action is needed, and, to begin with, we need to examine what is known as 'demand-side' management."
"Energy conservation must be promoted on the supply side, and we must make sure that positive alternative fuels and electricity generating systems and renewable energy sources point the way forward."
"We must promote them."
"In my own report I have said that the European Union must put in place a rigorous monitoring system of Community carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions at the earliest opportunity."
"Mr President, we look forward to the negotiations in Tokyo with high hopes."
"But even if no satisfactory result is reached in Tokyo, the European Union will have to keep to its target."
"If the Union does not do so there is the additional danger that individual Member States will retreat from their targets, and that is why I do not entirely understand the Commissioneris reluctance to support the position set out in the resolution by Carlos Pimenta and ourselves."
"We must stick to the Union's targets, even if the results from Kyoto turn out to be unsatisfactory."
"Mr President, the results under the Dutch presidency are to be applauded."
"Burden-sharing is a good thing."
"But it imposes extra responsibility on the northern Member States."
"Germany will have to show a 25 % reduction, and my own country, the Netherlands, a 10 % reduction, by 2010."
"It will be all the more difficult to achieve those targets, as the majority of the Liberal Group does not view nuclear energy as an option for a sustainable solution to combat the emission of CO2 until the waste problem is solved."
"""Après moi, le déluge' as we also say in Holland."
"Because, despite the two instalments of 750 million guilders which the Dutch government has allocated, we will not manage to reduce CO2 emissions to that extent."
"We will not be emitting 3 % less in the year 2000 than in 1990; in fact we can expect to emit 10 % more."
"In that light, the attitude of the United States seems a little more realistic."
"Of course we must try to persuade them to go further than the target of stabilization in 2010."
"There is some movement within the Unites States, and that is what we have to build on in Kyoto."
"And we should not be to quick to congratulate ourselves on the virtue of our position when there is considerable scepticism about its feasibility."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, I agree with my fellow group-member Pedro Marset Campos when he says that the most important measure for removing the threat of this environmental catastrophe would be a new economic model to lead us towards sustainable development."
"I also agree with the environmental groups who say that the European Union's stance is timid, and that we should aim for a greater reduction in the year 2005."
"However, in reality, the European Union's proposal is the most advanced one available at the moment."
"That is what we actually have."
"Therefore, I agree with Mr Pimenta, the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, and with the resolution and amendments of that Committee."
"I think the most important of these, as Mr Eisma has just said, is the one which says that the European Union must maintain its position and not retreat from it, even though other countries may continue to hide their heads in the sand."
"I know that is very difficult, because Europe immediately thinks of its own competitiveness, but if Europe does not go ahead with its decision to reduce emissions, the other countries will never do so."
"Madam Commissioner, your comment about the United States is very significant. During the preliminary meetings, as you so aptly said, they have taken a significant step in the wrong direction."
"Well, let us not allow ourselves to be led by the United States and Japan. Let us show them what our own position is, for although it may not go far enough, it is more reasonable than any other at the moment."
"Mr President, I wish to ask the Commissioner how the European Union can so confidently in the preliminary negotiations for Kyoto offer the reductions that they have done and although we have heard this evening how important these targets are - 7.5 % by the year 2005 and 15 % by 2010 - how can we achieve them?"
"We show no sign of implementing this in practice and it is clearly not possible to achieve success without clear objectives, targets, incentives and sanctions."
"The Commission has made several proposals for programmes - Thermie II, Synergy, Save II - which were, however, not accepted by the Council or provided with adequate funding."
"Also, all progress towards introduction of a CO2 tax has failed in Council."
"The most effective method of achieving a substantial reduction in emissions would be through a European Unionwide CO2 tax."
"This would restrict emissions within the European Union in the long term while advancing a strategy which would minimize the economic cost as a whole."
"A CO2 tax applied to all polluters should be used to reduce other taxes and applied equally to all sectors, for example agriculture and smelting."
"No one should be favoured or the whole basis of such a tax would be undermined."
"Mr President, I come from a country which is, arguably, the best energy-endowed in Europe, namely Scotland."
"But I do not want to talk about Scotland today, I want to talk about countries on the far side of the globe, such as Kiribati, Tuvalu and Bangladesh which will bear the brunt of the rise in sea level if we do not take immediate action."
"I wonder whether this House could contemplate the disappearance off the map of these little countries like Kiribati and Tuvalu and the widespread devastation of Bangladesh, one of the world's most populous areas."
"That is why this debate is so important."
"I should like to commend the points made by our colleague, Mrs McNally."
"I hope the Commissioner was taking copious notes and I hope she will use these as a blueprint for taking things further."
"So much is at stake and although the EU is not the world and therefore we cannot take the whole world's burdens on our shoulders, at least let us argue forcibly for the right policies and the right targets and go to Japan in an aggressive frame of mind to try to save the planet from a catastrophe."
"Mr President, throughout this year, as we have gone from the recent G8 Summit to the UN Earth Summit and then on to the negotiations leading up to the conference on climate change in Kyoto, it has become very obvious that there are clear divisions on a global scale with regard to global warming, in particular on the targets to restrain emissions of the main greenhouse gas CO2 ."
"The current series of discussions have continued all through the autumn and are not yet at an end, but it is quite clear that we must come to some form of formal decision about the reduction in the emissions of greenhouse gases in Kyoto - in particular CO2 - and that must be done by the end of the year."
"I am pleased to say that so far the European Union has maintained an honourable position."
"We are proposing that the by 2010 industrialized countries should cut their greenhouse gases by 15 % as compared with 1990."
"I am here tonight to appeal to the Commission and the Council not to retreat from that position."
"Indeed, I urge them not only not to retreat from that position but actually to seek wider agreement on the need, certainly in principle, for future measures which would in particular bring about an emission standstill in the next century and, possibly, take the concentration of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere from an emission standstill of 550 parts per million down to perhaps as low as 350 parts per million."
"We cannot retreat from that position, we must accept that the negotiations at Kyoto are simply the first step."
"Two weeks ago I was part of Parliament's delegation to Japan."
"I spent three days in Tokyo talking with Japanese parliamentarians, the Environment Minister and a number of other ministers."
"It was clear to me that they would be prepared to go further."
"The position announced by their Prime Minister, pushed by their industry ministry, was not a position they had agreed on a consensual basis."
"It is quite clear that they would be prepared to go further, and if we press them they will go further."
"We must take up that opportunity; we must unite with them to push even the Americans towards some form of action."
"I would stress that there are a whole range of issues on which we should be able to find common ground."
"We must, for example, be prepared to consider very quickly the introduction of technology transfer to developing countries to ensure that they do not present a new series of CO2 emissions that cannot be controlled."
"We cannot in fact rule out the possible future role of nuclear power used in a safe and sustainable way."
"We cannot ignore the possible use of joint implementation."
"With sufficient safeguards, I am sure that could be a step forward."
"We have to realize that it is not just simply a question of CO2 : there are other greenhouse gases that we must deal with; they have to be part of the treaty."
"I urge a note of caution on the question of emissions trading."
"That is a tool which has not achieved a great deal of success so far."
"It is worth exploring but I would not suggest that it is something we should engage in when seeking to achieve an agreement in Kyoto."
"Finally, I urge the Commission not to relax its declared position."
"We should instead say that this is only the first step."
"We all have the future in our hands."
"The Commission and the Council in particular have the future in their hands."
"Future generations want them to stand firm."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have gone from great heat to intense cold, from violent rain to drought. We no longer have the in-between seasons."
"In spring and autumn we go from very high temperatures, as if it were July, to very low temperatures, as if it were January. The winds are strong and devastating at times."
"According to the FAO, the US Food Organization, the consequences of El Niño could be disturbing for cereals, tapioca, oil seeds, coffee, sugar, tea, bananas, tropical fruits, citrus fruits, grapes and vegetables and the repercussions could delay the planting of the rice seedlings."
"The ACP-European Union working party on climatic changes and small insular States, of which I am chairman, has presented a draft resolution, approved unanimously by the Joint Assembly in Lomé on 30 October this year, on ACP-EU cooperation on climatic change and on the third Parity Conference to be held in Kyoto next month, to adopt a binding protocol, or other legal instrument, that will give rise to real reductions in greenhouse gases based on the Berlin Mandate, although we regret we cannot be present or represented in the Japanese city."
"The variability of climate and the rise in the sea level are causing the coast to erode and the small ACP island states are particularly concerned because they are the most vulnerable in the global system of climatic changes. As their economic and social activities are mainly concentrated on the coastal regions, any small rise in sea level has a significant and profound effect on the local economy, on living conditions, sometimes even totally destroying infrastructures and houses."
"This is because the aims of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, indicated in the EU contractual positions, by 15 % by 2010, with an intermediate aim of at least 7.5 % by 2005, are the absolute minimum acceptable and, in actual fact, we should be aspiring to a 20 % reduction by 2005."
"We therefore believe that a full discussion should be held next year on the various energy options, paying particular attention to nuclear energy, hydroelectric energy and other renewable energies not emitting CO2."
"I will conclude with the hope that agreement can also be reached at the Kyoto Conference with governments which take a diametrically opposed view."
"Mr President, if I have understood what was said correctly, in Kyoto we will have a realistic objective, but the problem is whether or not we have partners - and indeed serious and reliable partners - who are in sympathy with this objective and the policies that go with it."
"I therefore want to ask the Council and the Commission whether they have, or whether they think they have, the means to exert effective pressure on the United States, so that it is possible for a reliable and serious agreement to be reached on objectives such as we have heard here and on the corresponding policies."
"If so, what are these means?"
"Are you willing to use them?"
"If these means do not exist, I would at least like to ask you if you are prepared to launch a large-scale campaign to inform and motivate the public regarding the seriousness of the issue, the proposals that have been put forward and the ways that exist to solve the problem, so that, at least at the level of propaganda, we can challenge the propaganda of the Unites States and other countries, which is being used to downgrade the issue and to ridicule efforts to change policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that we have to have an agreement on climate protection and reduction of greenhouse gases, in order to save mankind and the environment."
"The essence of the Pimenta report is that we have come out in support of a 15 % reduction by the year 2010, even if Kyoto fails to produce a binding agreement."
"Madam Commissioner, I am very disappointed in you."
"Did I correctly understand you to say that you do not support these measures?"
"Is the Commission not prepared to take on a pioneer role?"
"I think we can only be credible when we make it clear that we - regardless of what emerges from Kyoto - are ready to reduce by 15 % by the year 2010."
"If we do not do this we shall be hiding behind those climate killers, the USA and Japan."
"I think that would be a declaration of environmental bankruptcy."
"It would be a step backwards, were the Commission not to make clear that we want to advance realistically, that we are at last ready to accept that there is a global catastrophe, and that we are taking steps."
"I believe the European floods have shown quite clearly that we are not far away from that global catastrophe."
"Madam Commissioner, I urge you at long last to take on a vanguard role and to declare that we shall reduce CO2 emissions, so that we place other climate killers under pressure."
"Mr President, there is an ever- continuing growth in energy consumption worldwide."
"As a result of this increase, carbon dioxide emissions are increasing too, and will amount to as much as 8 % by the year 2010."
"The decisions we have taken on energy policy should be long term and lead gradually to a considerable decline in carbon dioxide emission levels."
"It is vital that we get large countries at the Kyoto Conference, like the USA, Japan, Australia and Canada, to commit to targets after the year 2000."
"It is five years now since the Rio Conference on the Environment, so it is high time we got real commitments worldwide and established deadlines."
"The problem of global warming will not be solved by an energy policy alone."
"For example, increased traffic exhaust is the direct cause of the rise in greenhouse gases in our atmosphere."
"We must also include the existence of nuclear power as a way of expanding our selection of energy alternatives and especially of reducing carbon dioxide emissions."
"The production of energy cannot be based only on renewable energy resources."
"Their role in the whole energy-producing scenario is only marginal."
"The enhancement of forestry conservation worldwide is an effective way of tackling the problem of climatic change."
"Trees absorb carbon dioxide."
"We must ensure that felled trees are replaced, in one way or another, with new trees."
"Finally, I would like to state that I can no longer believe in the idea of a new international climate agency."
"Political support for the implementation of a climate policy is needed, but it will not come from reeling out a lot more red tape."
"Mr President, limiting emissions of greenhouse gases is one of the great environmental challenges of our time."
"Even if we do radically alter our policies today, we know that emissions are going to increase for decades to come."
"This requires major and rapid changes in our transport and energy policies."
"It also requires a very high carbon tax."
"Our group naturally supports the Linkohr report, which is an excellent concrete report. Not least we support the proposals for monitoring and sanctions, which are very important."
"Leading up to the meeting in Kyoto, the EU's line and proposals are better than those of the Americans."
"In spite of that the EU's proposals are actually insufficient if you look at what nature is suffering."
"After all, nature's limits must be more important that the limits set by the USA."
"That must also mean that the EU, regardless of the outcome of Kyoto, should go ahead and try to achieve the goals which have been set."
"I therefore agree with Mr Eisma and Mrs González Álvarez, for example, who have suggested this here before."
"I would also like to complain about the Swedish government's position on this issue."
"Sweden is one of the countries which callously expect to increase emissions of carbon dioxide in the coming years."
"Mr President, my thanks to Mr Linkohr and Mr Pimenta for the reports they have presented on behalf of their two committees."
"I attended the Rio follow-up conference in New York as one of two representatives of the European Parliament."
"I praised the Commission at that time because it came out in favour of ambitious reduction objectives for Kyoto, even though we have to admit that, in view of what Mr Linkohr rightly said, these can only be a very first step and are not actually enough."
"It is what is practical today, though, and for that reason we must support the Commission on this point."
"The climate catastrophe will have many devastating effects."
"That has already been said."
"I would mention one point perhaps deserving of a greater public airing, and that is the effect on health."
"Because of the changes in climatic zones we in Europe will become subject to tropical diseases hitherto unknown here."
"I believe that when people fear for their own health they perhaps begin to think a bit more deeply."
"President Clinton also mentioned this in his speech in New York."
"It is most unfortunate that although that speech contained a few good points, the USA had to adopt such a restrictive position."
"The reason for it is that industrial lobbyists there are spreading stories of a crisis scenario, a catastrophe scenario, if serious reduction objectives should be decided."
"I believe the opposite is the case."
"We can give many good reasons for that."
"I shall cite one practical example, and everyone there in Kyoto should ask the Americans if they could not put an end to it. I am frequently told that people in many open-plan offices in the USA wear jerseys in summer because the air-conditioning is badly set."
"I do not think it would have anything to do with a reduction in living standards if this were ended by using modern and more efficient technology."
"We do not have to go back to the caves, but we must advance to better efficiency."
"The Commissioner should do more in this respect."
"Mr President, the Kyoto conference on our future climate is, in my opinion, an extremely important event."
"As a citizen of the European Union, I am proud of the negotiating position which has been adopted, and which means a reduction of greenhouse gases by 15 % from the 1990 level by the year 2010."
"That is an ambitious target which I hope will influence others in Kyoto."
"I am also deeply concerned about my own country's efforts leading up to this conference."
"In the past Sweden was the first country to set tough targets for carbon dioxide emissions in 1988, entailing unchanged emissions from 1987 onwards."
"We even managed to reduce emissions."
"Leading up to the Kyoto Conference, we in Sweden have now been given permission to increase our emissions by 5 per cent up to the year 2010."
"The reason for this is the closure of two nuclear reactors in Barsebäck, both of which work very well and have a high safety standard."
"If Europe followed Sweden's example, the European Union might just as well forget about going to Kyoto."
"It would make it impossible to go there with the current ambitious objectives."
"For the EU to be able to live up to its goals, it is necessary to introduce financial instruments."
"I hope it will be possible to introduce a carbon tax at EU level."
"Sweden's experience is that the tax has a significant effect."
"There is a transition from fossil fuels to biomass fuels in lots of places in our country, which is largely due to this tax."
"Vehicles are responsible for substantial emissions of greenhouse gases."
"In Europe we have a rapid development of vehicles driven by alternative methods, such as electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles."
"The City of Stockholm has just bought a substantial number of electric vehicles from Italy."
"It appears that technical developments in this area are progressing faster than we think."
"So there are grounds for considerable optimism."
"Mr President, at this stage in the debate I think most things have already been said, and do not need to be repeated by me."
"However, I do think it is important to convey the message that Parliament is going to support the position of the Commission and Council."
"It is essential for the Community institutions to share the same objective, which will enable them to negotiate from a position of strength."
"Having said that, and on the subject of the European Union's internal policy, I think it needs to be pointed out that not all governments have achieved the targets they committed themselves to at the Earth Summit. So our internal policy needs to make strict demands."
"Complementary policies have not been developed either, as Mr Linkohr so rightly said."
"Our Member States have to make a major effort, and we must of course call on the governments to reach an agreement about the distribution of the remaining 5 % of the commitment, in addition to the 10 % which has already been agreed."
"Next, I think we have to make a clear distinction between problems caused by the emission of gases in general, on the one hand, and the overall phenomenon of climate change on the other."
"There is much more to climate change than just gas emissions, and there are scientific phenomena which have not been analyzed sufficiently on a global basis, but which nevertheless need to be kept in mind: the influence of solar emission cycles cannot be ignored."
"However, this phenomenon requires deeper scientific analysis."
"As for negotiations with third countries, it is certainly very important for the European Union to convey the message that whoever produces the most pollution has to provide the most help. Therefore, we have to make the public understand that breathing costs money - that is also important for the European Union's internal policies."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Commissioner, it is very strange that the same date and the same figure crop up twice in European Union documents: the year 2010 and the figure of 15 % apply both to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and to the contribution of renewable sources to the supply of raw materials for energy production."
"This strange coincidence should make us stop and think, especially if we remember that, as Mr Linkohr's report says, the Commission's relevant Directorate-General predicts an 8 % increase in carbon dioxide by that same date."
"The fact is, energy consumption is increasing all the time and nobody can stop it."
"Nobody can prevent it."
"No agreement can avoid it."
"It is not just us: the developing countries are growing at the fastest rate - China, for example, with its coal."
"So we need to find alternatives."
"One of these, obviously, is nuclear energy."
"Just as obvious, however, is the fact that people just do not want the use of this type of energy to be increased or extended."
"That leaves only one choice: to rely increasingly on renewable sources of energy."
"A lot of data was published recently in an article by a renowned specialist. For example: the wind industry is growing by 25 % every year; in eight years, the world market in solar cells grew from $340 million to $900 million; and the big energy companies are moving more and more towards this sort of energy."
"Mr President, what we need is the political will. The Commission needs it and, above all, so does Parliament, composed as it is of the representatives of the people of Europe."
"If we had that political will, then perhaps the Member States would too. At the moment, they do not possess as much of it as they should."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I first of all congratulate Parliament on this debate. Above all I want to congratulate you on your support for the Council and the Commission."
"At Kyoto we will work with determination to negotiate an ambitious agreement."
"After Kyoto, we will need to establish the necessary measures to achieve the reduction rates on which we will have agreed."
"Various Councils will be responsible for the matter and we will take decisions on the basis of proposals from the Commission."
"Allow me to make a number of comments on the points raised during this debate."
"Firstly, regarding job creation in the environmental sphere, we must explore all possible paths."
"Both the Commission and the Council are aware of the efforts necessary to create jobs in the area of the environment and reducing greenhouse gases."
"Secondly, regarding harmonization and an increase in energy taxation, we must remember that unanimity is required within the Council to take such a decision."
"It is a big problem."
"The Luxembourg Presidency firmly intends to move in this direction, if there is unanimity."
"An increase in the taxation of energy could be advantageously combined with a reduction in the costs imposed on labour."
"I am sure that the President of the Council will do his utmost to obtain, at the Employment summit due to take place at the end of this week, a decision in principle along these lines: combining a reduction in the costs on labour with an increase in the taxation of energy."
"Parliament has laid great stress, and the last speaker reminded us of this, on the issue of renewable energy sources."
"It has to be said that we have at our disposal nearly all the necessary technology for the development of renewable energy sources."
"We now need investment, not only from the governments and the Commission, but also from the private sector and we need to create conditions which will encourage industry to invest more in alternative energy sources."
"We fully support the objective of increasing the use of renewable energy within the Community from 6 % to 12 %, as a proportion of all energy used."
"There has been a lot of talk abut industries which are opposed to measures against greenhouse gases."
"I recently had a similar experience in Luxembourg, with a large American multinational."
"When you negotiate seriously with an organization of this size, a large subsidiary of an American company, you can come to an agreement."
"This group said it was in agreement with testing for alternative products, not only in Luxembourg but also in the United States, because its members have very clearly understood that they could be the first to offer alternatives on the world market as soon as they have them."
"Therefore I believe that if the political will to negotiate firmly with industry exists, we can also come to an agreement with the United States on this subject."
"I would like to come back to a point raised by several speakers: the European Union proposals for Kyoto."
"I can only confirm what the Commissioner just said on this."
"The European Union proposals for Kyoto are not unilateral reductions but proposals in support of our position at the Kyoto negotiations."
"So our objective at Kyoto must be to obtain an ambitious agreement on this point, and I agree with everyone in recognizing that the United States has a very important role to play in this respect."
"After Kyoto, the Council has decided to raise the question of the transformation of negotiation proposals into unilateral reductions, but only after Kyoto."
"This is in fact what the Council decided at its ordinary meeting on 16 October."
"It will therefore certainly not be done before Kyoto, but perhaps afterwards."
"I am not even sure myself, it is for the Council to decide."
"In any case the Presidency has the firm intention of putting this question on the Council's agenda so that there is a decision on this."
"Mr President, I would also like to say thank you for the debate, which I feel has been very constructive, and I would just like to make a few remarks."
"I would like to stress, as Environment Minister Lahure said in his last comment, that this debate today has been about how we can strengthen our position relative to the other players at Kyoto as far as possible."
"I think it was Mr Bowe who said that the Japanese were certainly open to more pressure, and we hope that other countries are too."
"The question is now very largely how we can put pressure on other countries so we can achieve the highest possible targets in Kyoto."
"We will have an opportunity of discussing how we can do that later, and how we will achieve the results in the European Union."
"And, as many of the speakers have emphasized, there are a lot of useful proposals."
"I heartily agree with the comments which Mrs Granitz made on the possibility of linking this debate to the question of jobs as well."
"I also believe (as we have emphasized in our communication) that a sensibly implemented policy offers some opportunities for jobs and not the opposite, as we sometimes hear, and it is true that there are still some unused opportunities in working with industry."
"On the proposal for an international climate agency, I would like to say that, strictly speaking, something of the sort was established under the UN and based in Bonn, and it may well not be very sensible at this point in time to weaken this institution by trying to set up another one."
"In my view, we in the EU, with the targets we have established and the supplementary policies which have been passed, are well equipped for the negotiations."
"The only thing which amazed me during the debate was that some people have said that we in the EU do not have very ambitious targets."
"It is true that, as many people have said, that when you look at the size of the problem, there was nothing to stop the targets being higher, but if on the other hand you look at what we have been met with from the other countries, there is no doubt that the EU has played a leading role here, and of course we also intend to play that role in the run-up to and at Kyoto."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote on the Linkohr report will be taken at 12.30 p.m. tomorrow."
"The vote on the Council and Commission statements will be taken on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"Customs union with Turkey"
"The next item is the report (A4-0276/97) by Mr Kittelmann, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council Decision on laying down the procedure for adopting the Community's position in the Customs Union Joint Committee set up by Decision No 1/95 of the ECTurkey Association Council on implementation of the final phase of the Customs Union (5372/97 - C4-0081/97-96/0020(CNS) (Renewed consultation)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unlike many debates we hold on Turkey, here we have a task that is more concerned with technicalities."
"It has to do with the fact that a Customs Union Joint Committee is to be established. The Joint Committee, pursuant to article 24 of the Association Agreement, has to advise the Association Council, consult internally - this relates to exchanges of opinion and experience - and make recommendations to the Association Council."
"The European Parliament had already expressed its opinion at its sitting of 18 July 1996 on the proposal for a Council resolution to define the procedure, passing it by a large majority."
"The Council resolved on 19 February 1997 to consult the European Parliament once more on the same proposal in accordance with article 113 of the treaty."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy examined the draft report at its meetings of 16 and 24 September."
"At the latter meeting the committee adopted a draft of a legislative decision by 23 votes to one with one abstention."
"We have examined the legal basis, i.e., whether article 113 was the correct one."
"The Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities proposed the use of another legal basis."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, together with the Committee on External Economic Relations, which had also unanimously voted for it, resolved in the light of legal opinion to use article 113, because article 113 is essentially for commercial agreements and is therefore perfectly appropriate."
"An essential element of the legal opinion was that the legal basis became unimportant, once the Council accepted the recommendation from the European Parliament guaranteeing the right of Parliament to be kept informed."
"In these circumstances the proposed new legal basis could be accepted, quite independently of the fact that it was in any case what we wanted right from the start."
"I would briefly add that though we often discuss a range of problems during political debate, here we are dealing with the maintenance of a contractual regulation: the preparation of the Customs Union by the Association Council."
"Finally, I should like to point out that in this matter of the functioning of the Customs Union we have in the past repeatedly stressed that the European Union has been the beneficiary of customs union."
"With our unbelievably large export advantages we will gain goodwill from the fact that Turkey will import goods from the European Union with little formality, and it is our duty to do everything possible to establish a balance of relationships within the Customs Union between the European Union and that country."
"I am sure we shall do our duty today during the voting, and I would ask you to agree with the large majorities on the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on External Economic Relations, and pass the resolution."
"Mr President, as Mr Kittelmann has said, the issue is political, and there are technical aspects to it as well, with matters of regulations and a succession of decisions by both the Council and the Commission."
"Mr Kittelmann touches on all these in his report and I would have no difficulty agreeing but for the fact that we must look at the matter politically and substantively."
"First of all, this Parliament has judged the Customs Union with Turkey on the basis of promises that Turkey will comply with certain basic preconditions concerning issues of human rights, democracy, state of law, and cohabitation in accordance with international regulations as regards the Kurds, the Cypriots and Greek-Turkish relations."
"Secondly, Parliament has agreed that an annual report will come before it so that it can monitor whether these conditions are being adhered to."
"We may agree to any regulation on the condition that these two basic points are being observed, that is, Turkey's compliance with the preconditions and parliamentary control based on the Commission's report as to its compliance."
"Anything other than this is sheer perversity and only serves the selfserving economic, commercial and politically strategic objectives of various large powers."
"Mr President, a year and a half ago we stated quite clearly the conditions under which we would agree to a Customs Union, and because of that there has been a long drawn-out concerted action against us."
"Now the Council wants to push through regardless an amendment to the basic law, and that without any debate."
"We are to be kept retrospectively better informed, as far as Customs Union is concerned."
"The concerted action against us was, it seems, just a pilot exercise."
"Last year we insisted on being heard beforehand, but now that is all to be pushed aside."
"I believe this amendment in favour of article 113 is simply not applicable, and in its opinion the Committee on Legal Affairs even spoke of dangerous prejudice."
"Up to now the losers from Customs Union have been small and medium-sized businesses in Turkey, whereas EU exporters have been raking in ever-increasing profits."
"This imbalance is ruinous for Turkey."
"We have said right from the beginning that Turkey's acceptance path into the Union should not be obstructed."
"Turkey must be able to participate as an equal partner in the negotiations for the European Conference."
"The prerequisite for that is, however, the democratization of Turkey, respect for human rights and a political solution to the Kurdish problem."
"That includes also the cessation of all aggression in northern Iraq."
"We shall unfortunately be unable to vote for this report."
"Mr President, over and above its technical aspects, Mr Kittelmann's report provides us with an occasion to take stock of our relations with Turkey and, above all, to evaluate whether the political objectives which were put forward to justify the need for a customs union have been, or are being, achieved."
"The majority of this House had considered that the increase in prosperity which this agreement would entail for Turkey, and the political signal that it would give, would anchor Turkey for good in the camp of democracy, blocking the rise of Islam."
"The reality has been completely different since hardly a few weeks after the approval, on this basis, of the Customs Union agreement with Turkey, the Islamic Party came to power in Ankara."
"Another argument had been put forward at the time: the Customs Union was to substitute for Turkey not joining the European Union and would constitute the framework within which our relations with this very close neighbour would fit."
"So, there is more ambiguity than ever."
"Mr van den Broek indicated, when Agenda 2000 was presented, that Turkey felt it had a vocation to be a part of the Union, and Ankara is going to participate, against the wishes of many Member States, in the conference of candidate countries."
"This continued ambiguity gives rise to illusory hopes and, for Turkey in particular, the hope of achieving a status to which it cannot lay claim."
"I fear that disillusion and blackmail, today regarding the Customs Union, tomorrow regarding Cyprus, may deeply trouble our relations with this great nation."
"If, at a time when a specific framework for cooperation that is adapted to the importance of our relations with Turkey is being clearly heralded, we prefer to persist in this deviation rather than follow up a fruitful cooperation, then we risk compromising the good relations which have been built up by several of our Member States and of raising artificial and dangerous antagonism."
"I believe, Mr President, that it is high time to correct this direction and to base our relationship with Turkey on something other than ambiguity."
"Mr President, most decisions of the Joint Committee are implemented under article 113 of the EC Treaty."
"This relates in particular to the protection of free trade."
"However, Parliament' s Legal Department has shown, on the basis of Court of Justice precedent, that the Joint Committee should not limit itself to powers under article 113."
"Legally there is little to be said against the Council's decision to apply article 113 to the position of the Joint Committee on the customs union with Turkey, instead of article 235."
"It is curious that the European Commission initially chose article 235 as the legal foundation without giving the reason behind it."
"On the contrary, the European Commission itself indicated itself that the powers of the Joint Committee fall under article 113."
"Can the Commission explain why that illogical basis was chosen at the time?"
"The Committee on Legal Affairs opposes the amended legal basis and in so doing refers to the decision-making procedures in the Committee for the European Economic Area and in the Association Council with Turkey."
"That comparison falls short, however, as the Joint Committee deals with a defined, limited sphere, namely customs unions and certain provisions on intellectual property."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs also fears that the change of legal basis damages the institutional balance in the Community."
"That fear seems grossly exaggerated."
"The proposal is about decision-making in a committee."
"It is difficult to maintain that the Council should consult the European Parliament before every meeting of the Joint Committee."
"Parliament has been promised an annual report on the decisions."
"That is more than enough."
"Clearly we are happy to agree with Mr Kittelmann's report, which deals with this difficult problem in a lucid way."
"Mr President, I would like to start by saying thank you for all the work the rapporteur and his predecessor, Mr Matutes, have carried out."
"The proposal for a decision which has been discussed today, was drawn up by the Commission in January 1996 to enable the Community to establish its position at the EC-Turkey Customs Union Joint Committee."
"It is clear that the outcome is article 113 of the treaty because the Commission took the view that a technical role which was involved, thus falling within the sphere of application of article 113 of the treaty."
"The new report before the European Parliament today is about the legal basis for the proposal, which was amended by the Council after Parliament delivered its first opinion."
"The Commission has no problem approving the new legal basis the Council wanted."
"The approach on which it is based differs from that of the Commission, but it is also correct."
"The Commission therefore agrees with the conclusions of Mr Kittelmann's report."
"In particular, the Commission believes that changing the legal basis in no way affects either how the Joint Committee works or the rights of the European Parliament, something which Mr Kittelmann's report very much emphasized."
"And, finally, I would like to add that it is important that this legislation is implemented as soon as possible, so that the Customs Union Joint Committee can operate effectively."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12.30 p.m."
"Higher education"
"The next item is the report (A4-0358/97) by Mrs Heinisch, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, on the proposal for a Council Recommendation on European cooperation in quality assurance in higher education (COM(97)0159 - C4-0263/97-97/0121 (SYN))"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media we repeatedly stress the importance of mobility, not just for European integration, but in particular in preparing our young people at an early age for the demands of working life."
"Globalization is going full steam ahead."
"It is becoming increasingly important to learn languages, to become familiar with other cultures and to adapt oneself flexibly to the customs of other lands."
"For these reasons I have very much welcomed the Commission's initiative for the establishment of a European network for quality assurance in higher education."
"But I do think the title of the proposal was an unfortunate choice."
"The main thrust here is an opportunity to encourage mobility, rather than ensure quality assurance in higher education."
"Of course it is also important to demand a certain quality level within all European Member States."
"This should be a minimum requirement which must be met, and which guarantees that quality in our places of higher education does not decrease, but improves wherever possible."
"It is only in this way that our universities can continue to withstand the pressure of international competition."
"Member States point out quite correctly, however, that the detail of education does not fall within the competence of the European Union."
"In my report, therefore, I have tried in the first part of the proposal - which challenges Member States to develop a system of evaluation - to emphasize quite clearly the independence of the universities."
"The Commission's proposal is primarily aimed, however, at giving students and teaching staff information about courses on offer, course aims, and diplomas available at universities in various Member States."
"This is intended to facilitate the search by higher education centres for partner universities, and the individual selection by students of courses abroad."
"This is most welcome, because I personally learn over and over again from students how often enthusiasm and interest in neighbouring countries is stifled by inadequate information."
"The Commission's proposal provides that it alone will undertake the construction of the European network."
"I do not believe this is sensible and I understand why the Member States are opposing it."
"The establishment of this sort of network can only take place on a basis of mutual trust and with cooperation."
"It is hard to envisage a European network without national frameworks and the creation of national networks."
"On those grounds the Committee on Culture supports my amendment for these demands to be addressed both to the Commission and to Member States."
"The funding of the network remains a sensitive point."
"The proposal foresees financing by the Socrates and Leonardo programmes, but without the joint approval of Parliament."
"It has been said, however, that networks can be set up within the existing proposals for electronic networks in Socrates and Leonardo, and for that reason I welcome the proposal."
"The proposal also deals with the first recommendation on education under article 126."
"I support this for its own sake."
"In order slightly to reduce the obligations in the proposal, however, I have replaced some of the executive measures with less compulsory terms."
"I am pleased that the Committee on Culture has accepted these."
"Also accepted was my proposal for a definition of the term ""place of higher education' ."
"Let me just touch on a few points in my report which seem to me to be particularly important. I have suggested that the central and eastern European countries should become involved at once in the evaluation process and the creation of the network."
"Obviously their specific problems and situations must be adequately taken into consideration."
"It also seems to me to be important for research and training to be evaluated, as I am convinced that they are essential to our future knowledge."
"Furthermore, I think we must work out a comprehensive and generally agreed definition of quality within the overall drive for quality assurance, so that all higher education centres can identify with it and so that it can be used for the evaluation of student courses."
"Without such general agreement it will be exceptionally difficult to carry out evaluation which is applicable throughout Europe."
"Unfortunately, this proposal was rejected by the Committee on Culture, but as it seems to me to be really important, I shall reintroduce it on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, and hope for the Commission's support."
"There is great deal to be said for this network, ladies and gentlemen, for transparency in the quality of places of higher education, and for mutually confident cooperation in this field between the Member States."
"For this reason I hope that the Commission will accept our amendments and, with the support of Parliament, remove the obstacles to student mobility that still, unfortunately, exist."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate my colleague, Mrs Heinisch, on the work she has done regarding the Council's recommendation aimed at guaranteeing the quality of higher education."
"This recommendation invites all Member States to consider equipping their systems of higher education with mechanisms of evaluation and quality assurance."
"The Commission starts from the principle that it is important, in order to evaluate the quality of higher education, to base it on European cooperation, on transnational exchange of experience and on the positive advice of experts."
"I fully support this view, but I think that the objective is commendable precisely because it enables us, through this evaluation, to better comprehend the strengths and weaknesses in the educational systems of different European establishments."
"But for all that, the creation of a European network of quality assurance must not be too hasty."
"The idea of quality assurance is a difficult concept to define and, furthermore, I fear that we risk ending up with a hierarchical list of higher education establishments."
"The amendments that I have proposed on behalf of the Group Union for Europe extend the thinking of the rapporteur."
"We must not challenge the cultural diversity of European education systems, which is of real value."
"We must also preserve the autonomy of establishments and, thus, of the policies of the Member States of the Union in this regard."
"Furthermore, economic issues must not threaten the academic value of teaching as a whole."
"The selective demands of the labour market must not mean that the greatest emphasis is put only on training oriented in this direction."
"Vigilance is therefore called for."
"The difficulties in tackling this subject stem from the fact that we are treating both universities and technical establishments of higher education in the same way."
"Everyone knows that they do not serve the same purpose and they cannot therefore be judged by the same quality criteria, which will be difficult to define and of which the broad outlines must be clarified."
"Mr President, progress in education is one of the EU's main aims, but responsibility for school systems and educational content lies clearly at the national level, in other words, with the Member States themselves."
"This principle must be borne in mind when discussing European harmonization in quality assurance in higher education."
"Harmonization is meaningful if it brings something valuable with it and if it helps European colleges of higher education to do their proper job of improving research and the quality of the education offered."
"This aim will not be fulfilled by creating a centralized, uniform European scheme of evaluation."
"Itemized standards and rulings from the Community will not work if the variety and independence of colleges of higher education as well as the essential authority of each of the Member States are to be respected."
"Fortunately, the Commission's proposal has been improved through feedback on the part of Member States, and Mrs Heinisch's report puts forward important improvements in the area of broader harmonization."
"The goal of harmonization in education is to enhance European competitiveness and promote the movement of students and researchers."
"For that we need still more information on the structure and content of education in other countries."
"It is by means of fruitful harmonization that absolute trust can be built for an improved knowledge of systems."
"We can learn of other practice and experience, although, at the same time, we also make a stand for the wealth that exists in cultural differences, which is visible, too, in our educational systems."
"It is on the basis of these principles that the creation of a European quality assurance network can be given support."
"And the main task of the network will be the exchange of knowledge and experience, as well as technical assistance to Member States in creating methodologies for evaluation."
"It will be especially important to find ways to integrate graduates into the labour markets more effectively than now."
"To achieve that, we will need very extensive dialogue on the subject of future needs and improved training to meet those needs."
"Mr President, the idea of promoting a top class, truly European university is gaining ground."
"Recently, in a French evening paper, two renowned universities stated their desire for its creation."
"We must applaud such initiatives but, if the idea makes headway, we must not underestimate the distance to be covered, nor the obstacles to be found along the way."
"That is why this recommendation from the Commission, as unambiguous as it is, comes at the right time and I would furthermore like to congratulate Mrs Heinisch on the quality of her work."
"In fact, as she quite rightly emphasized, the independence of higher education establishments remains a priority that must not be put in jeopardy by a desire for rationalization."
"Furthermore, university cooperation is today built upon a certain number of programmes which are the basis for European policy in the area of university education. I am talking about the Socrates and Leonardo programmes."
"Above all else, they must be provided with sufficient financial resources."
"For when all is said and done what is it that guarantees the quality of teaching?"
"It is the Member States themselves perhaps, but it is also the recognition of the university community as a whole which, at a European level, authenticates it through exchange and cooperation mechanisms."
"We must not lose sight of this idea, particularly at a moment when, within the perspective of enlargement, a certain number of CEECs are being included in our youth and education programmes."
"Mr President, the mobility of students and scientists within Europe is still at far too low a level."
"Particularly in the field of university education a process of integration should be developed, a process which is permanent and consists of many levels, and which can function without an expensive institutional infrastructure."
"Cooperation between higher education establishments is currently hindered by a lack of knowledge about the higher education structure in other countries, about the quality and content of student courses, and above all about examination methods and final examinations."
"Evaluation research could contribute here to valuable enlightenment and encourage mobility amongst students and scientists."
"Greater mobility and a networked education would bring untold benefits to Europe as an economic entity."
"The encouragement of quality assurance and cooperation between centres of higher education, however, can only function on trust."
"Any apparently forced marriages, whether they be by the state or by the Community, must be excluded from the outset."
"Cultural variety, which is expressed in the diversity of educational systems, must be respected."
"The basic concepts of transparency and subsidiarity have particular importance in the context of the autonomy of higher education centres and the maintenance of their unique identities."
"At a time when unemployment is first on the agenda of all European institutions, I think it is extremely important that this subject should also include employment policy arguments."
"I have in mind, for example, the mutual recognition of diplomas, and the easing of the transition into working life."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that I am broadly in agreement with the paper presented by the Commission and most certainly with the report by my colleague Mrs Heinisch and the amendments she has recommended."
"I think all of us in Europe are now agreed that employment is a high priority and that we are going to help employment, in particular the employment of young people, by making the single market work well and by having a well-educated population."
"This paper goes some way towards that."
"There is still no easy acceptance across Europe of higher-education qualifications."
"For example, in the Committee on Petitions we are still receiving petitions from citizens of Europe who find that their higher-education qualifications are not accepted in one country or another."
"Involving foreign experts in the process of quality assurance would help us in very many ways to ensure that educational levels and provision in one country are accepted in another."
"I would also endorse Amendment No 59 which states that all players must be involved and spells out who those players are."
"Students have already been mentioned but we must not ignore the business community or professional associations."
"They most certainly must be involved in quality assurance."
"Finally, as one who has been involved in quality assurance in educational procedures in the United Kingdom, I urge the Commission and anybody involved in this to keep it simple: we do not want too much bureaucracy or a procedure where form-filling and record-taking are seen as important rather than delivering good education, which is what is called for."
"If we work on this report we will help higher education, the single market and young people to get the employment that they need."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first and foremost to thank Parliament and the rapporteur, Mrs Renate Heinisch, for the speed with which they have dealt with this proposal on a very important issue but one which is also, as has also been emphasized, open to debate."
"At the request of the Council, presented as part of its conclusions in November 1991, the Commission initiated a number of pilot projects during the course of 1995-1996 to test different methods before it produced its proposals on the position."
"Everyone who was involved in these projects, whether they were representing ministers, rectors, further education institutions, authorities responsible for quality assurance, all insisted that the Commission should do something to promote EU cooperation in this field."
"It is worth noting that as we have entered the information society it has become of decisive importance for the citizens of the EU that the standards of quality in education are set very high."
"To promote such quality education has now become the job of the Community."
"It is a virtually impossible task to define what the term ""quality' means in terms of further education, given that the education systems within the EU are as different as they are, which is also apparent from the debate here this afternoon."
"So we have not even tried."
"How can we give a single definition of the different working methods, the different basic views and the different traditions which are indissolubly linked with each education system?"
"If we follow this approach and follow the principles which should be the basis for the different assessment systems, this will create the necessary support in partnership between the universities."
"So we hope that the lack of understanding and the resulting lack of support in the future will give rise to far fewer problems in terms of, say, recognition of examination certificates and hence the true freedom of movement of labour."
"It should be noted that most of these problems are due to a lack of knowledge of what education has been received."
"In view of this, establishing a European quality assurance network consisting of representatives of the authorities responsible and linking universities in the Member States could help bring about a better exchange of experience."
"I would like to state that it is the Commission's wish that this approach should be a useful tool for the players who are responsible for evaluating the quality of education."
"By definition, this tool can be indicative or prescriptive, and it cannot be too specific."
"I would therefore like once again to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Renate Heinisch, and the other members of the Committee on Culture who have produced the proposals for changes or indeed improvements and additions to the text without changing the tenor of the approach itself."
"I am thinking here of the 17 out of the 38 amendments proposed which the Commission is inclined to approve."
"The changes we have therefore decided to make are amongst others those which relate to the variety of the education system, the independence of further education institutions and the Member States' wish to play an active role in setting up a European quality assurance network."
"The Commission cannot accept the other 21 changes, amongst other things because they include what we regard as inappropriate additions, such as references to non-member states and even research."
"Secondly, because they remove the reference to the Commission's White and Green Papers, and those provide the basis for the approach explaining the connection between the needs of the labour market and society in general."
"And thirdly, because they propose a summary presentation of the different stages of evaluation and of those involved in the individual stages, instead of the detailed, analytical presentation which the Commission has used."
"With that, I want to thank you once again for the debate here this afternoon."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12.30 p.m."
"Amendment of Rule 154 of the Rules of Procedure"
"The next item is the report (A4-0345/97) by Mr Dell'Alba, on behalf of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, on amendment of Rule 154 of Parliament's Rules of Procedure concerning the report for the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while technical in nature, this rule change has a certain symbolism, particularly when debated in this Chamber, which we are sharing with the Council of Europe at least until next year."
"What is it about and which report was I responsible for?"
"With the aim of making our regulations more legible, several months ago Mr Ford proposed deleting the reference to our relations with the Council of Europe."
"There were well-founded reasons for this initial proposal; in fact, Rule154 of our Rules of Procedure provides for the European Parliament to send the Council of Europe a report once a year, as if our MEPs were subordinate to an older brother from whom we are gradually being emancipated."
"The historic reason for this is that in 1952 with the signature of the ECSC Treaty, a privileged relationship with the Council of Europe was established by a protocol concluded at the time, and the European Parliament decided to respect it by forwarding an annual report which has lost all meaning over the years."
"We have had and continue to have relations, at alternate stages, which have not been intense but are still relations, not only with the authorities but also with the specialist Committees, presidential bodies, and so on. There is no doubt that the enlargement prospects and an increase in the number of members of the Council of Europe ensure that this institution precedes the developments made by our institution at this new stage too."
"Maintaining a formally closer link than that of the other European parliamentary bodies seemed important to the majority of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, although it was possible to take advantage Mr Ford's resolution aimed at changing the nature of our relations."
"The report I am presenting today consists of two motions which merely confirm the actual situation."
"We are deleting the somewhat out-of-date reference to this moral obligation to present an annual report and we are restricting ourselves to providing in the Rules for the bodies of the European Parliament to maintain mutually beneficial relations with the Council of Europe recognizing, in terms of the Rules, the importance of our special relationship with the Council of Europe, if only because we share the same place of work."
"Then we can delegate to the Conference of Presidents, which already has the institutional task, finally settlement of the matter with the other party involved in the Council of Europe."
"So this is a minor amendment which essentially confirms an historic link with the Council of Europe, provided for in the treaties, delegating to the Conference of Presidents the regulation of these existing relations at an appropriate time, particularly with regard to human rights and other subjects of common interest. It is useful to maintain these relations without the outdated forms we are deciding to abolish with this report."
"I hope you agree to the resolution and that the House will vote for it tomorrow."
"Mr President, I rise to speak on the Dell'Alba report on the amendment of Rule 154."
"I have to confess that it is all my fault."
"As a Member of this House for the last thirteen years it struck me some time ago while sitting in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities that I had never seen Rule 154 ever used."
"It moved me to table a question to the President of Parliament, asking him when Rule 154 had last been used."
"The answer was 1969."
"This is a demand for an annual report, not operated now for almost thirty years."
"So I followed the logic of the argument and tabled an amendment suggesting that Rule 154 should be deleted."
"But I have to make a confession - rare in politicians - and say that I was wrong."
"Richard Corbett, a man who has forgotten more about the Union Treaties than I have ever known - or will ever want to know - pointed out during a brief visit to the committee that this is in fact a treaty obligation."
"I have checked the matter and it is."
"It is actually in the European Community Treaties."
"Article 2 of the Protocol on cooperation with the Council of Europe, an annex to the ECSC Treaty says the European Parliament of the Communities shall forward each year to the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe a report on its activities."
"So, I am afraid we are rather stuck with it."
"It intrigues me that seventeen Presidents of this institution have managed to ignore the Rule."
"I am also interested that the Commission - the guardian of the treaties - has failed over the last 28 years to ensure that the rule is observed."
"It should have been taking us to the Court of Justice, although I presume the Commission is also aware of article 4 of the same protocol which demands that the Commission engages in a dialogue with the Council of Europe."
"I give the Commission notice that I will be asking it when it last did that."
"These meetings of the Rules Committee must be really exciting!"
"Mr President, it is obviously quite fashionable for Labour politicians to apologize to the public for mistakes that they have made."
"A yet more eminent one did so recently."
"Mr Ford is following in eminent footsteps."
"In my view the Dell'Alba report is not formally in contradiction with the Treaty obligation to which Mr Ford has referred."
"It would be wholly appropriate that the Conference of Presidents should be given the right - as Mr Dell'Alba has proposed - to monitor and to control relationships between the European Parliament and the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, and it would be up to them to decide whether quietly and discreetly the time had not come to honour in the breach rather than the observance this particular long-standing but not observed provision of the treaties."
"I am not worried about voting for the Dell'Alba report."
"On a formal level there is no contradiction."
"Politically it might be quite appropriate to move to this situation and the system that Mr Dell'Alba is proposing."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Ford and Mr Dell'Alba for finding such obscure articles in the Rules of Procedure that they have actually not been implemented for so long, and then to propose deleting them, but as Mr Ford has already pointed out there is a snag."
"Article 2 of the Protocol annexed to the Coal and Steel Community Treaty actually makes it a legal obligation."
"Why is there such a legal obligation?"
"Mr President, any Vice-President of this Parliament other than yourself would actually of course remember that when the Coal and Steel Community was set up only six states broke away from the then 14 that comprised the Council of Europe and its somewhat larger parliamentary assembly."
"They were going ahead as pioneers and this article symbolized the fact that they were leaving the door open to the others to follow later but keeping the contacts going: a very wise decision as history proved because the other states did eventually catch up with them."
"It would perhaps therefore not be appropriate to delete such a symbolic procedure."
"Even if perhaps we are not about to implement it we should not get rid of it."
"Who knows when it might be appropriate to do that again in the history of European integration."
"But in any case even if were not at such a juncture, respect of the treaties is fundamental."
"The treaties are the constitution of the European Union."
"They may be a bad constitution, they may not be very well codified, they may have all sorts of articles that people have forgotten about, but nonetheless they are the constitution."
"They determine the field of competence of the Union, and the powers of the institutions and we ignore the treaties at our peril."
"They are the very foundation of the powers of this Parliament and they cannot be blithely ignored."
"So I would urge the Parliament, and all those who have come to listen to this debate, to support the amendment that has been tabled by Glyn Ford to this report which I think will render it just about compatible with the treaty provision and make sure that this Parliament remains within the constitution."
"Mr President, very briefly, as rapporteur, I would like to thank those colleagues who have taken part in this rich and historic debate."
"I would also like to say that I personally have always thought that the legal basis for this amendment lay strictly speaking in the treaty."
"Article 230 of the Treaty on Union states that the Community shall use all useful means of cooperation with the Council of Europe."
"Vice versa, and I put this question to the authors, while awaiting tomorrow's decision, using a 1952 protocol as a basis which, among other things, recommends that the Members of our Parliament be chosen from the members of the Council of Europe, seems to me to be a little anachronistic."
"We have this wording which helps us; in my opinion, we have a treaty article devoted to cooperation with the Council: this seems sufficient to me."
"I would like to point this out without picking holes in a protocol which quite frankly seems rather out-of-date to me."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.15 p.m.)"
"Mr President, yesterday a terrible tragedy took place in the Spanish city of Melilla, where a water tower ruptured and flooded whole sections of the city, resulting in the tragic deaths of nine people, with many others wounded, and substantial material losses."
"I would like this Parliament's sympathy to be conveyed to Mr Ignacio Velázquez, the President of that city's autonomous authorities, together with our solidarity with the victims, and with those who have suffered such terrible losses."
"Mr Hernández Mollar, that message will be passed on."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr Wynn may speak."
"Mr President, on item 8 of the Minutes, the order of business."
"The agenda we voted yesterday says for yesterday evening at 7 p.m. ""urgent committee meetings authorized by the President' ."
"I attended two of those which were the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"Both committees took items off their agenda because they were not considered to be urgent."
"Can I ask you, Mr President, when you give authorizations for committee meetings in Strasbourg to be extremely strict in defining what is urgent."
"I will be, Mr Wynn."
"I heard you so it will be corrected."
"Mr President, yesterday I tried to raise the issue of Roisín McAliskey and her continued detention in a secure psychiatric unit in England."
"The purpose of the exercise, as recorded in the Minutes, was to bring to the attention of the British and German Members the iniquity of her detention."
"You asked me to write you a letter on the matter which I will do."
"But that precludes me from asking the British and German Members to request their governments to release Roisín McAliskey on humanitarian grounds alone."
"I do not want to go into the details of her continued detention."
"She is in a secure psychiatric mother and baby unit in England, and it seems to me that if the decent English people who fought hard for the release of Louise Woodward were to consider the inequity of the imprisonment of this young woman on very flimsy evidence, they would call on their government for her release."
"Your letter will be sent to all German and British colleagues so you will achieve your objective."
"Mr President, this is a comment on the Minutes, too."
"My name does not appear on the attendance register, perhaps through a mistake of my own."
"I attended other meetings yesterday, of both my group and my committee, and perhaps I forgot to sign myself in for the sitting in the Chamber."
"Mr President, on page 14, in the last paragraph, it says that the Scapagnini report has been postponed to the next part-session."
"Yesterday I listened to the reasoning behind this and asked for the floor, but it seems I was unable to attract your attention."
"I am taking this opportunity now because I can see it written in the Minutes."
"It has, I see, been deferred until the next part-session."
"No essential reason provided for in the Rules is given for this."
"Mr Scapagnini and a certain group were simply not happy with the day and time agreed for the debate of this report."
"The point, Mr President, ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr Ephremidis, I could not give you the floor yesterday because the relevant provisions of the Rules allow only one person to speak against such a request, and somebody had already done so."
"The House was fully aware of the issue at the time of the vote."
"We are not going to reconsider the matter."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Decision on urgency"
"Proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) on the conclusion of the Protocol establishing, for the period 1 July 1997 to 30 June 2000, the fishing rights and financial compensation provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea on fishing off the coast of Equatorial Guinea (COM(97)0522 - C4-0567/97-97/0268(CNS))."
"Fraga Estévez (PPE), Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries."
"(ES) Mr President, I just want to say that the Committee on Fisheries is in favour of these three requests for urgent procedure."
"I want to state the following on behalf of the Committee on Budgets. We have again agreed to the urgency, but we would like to point out urgently to the Council - at least through the Minutes, even if it is not present - that we have established in an interinstitutional agreement that a financial sheet is submitted at the right time with the relevant protocols."
"But for all three protocols, it has only been possible to have the corresponding financial sheet supplied after more resistance by the Chamber."
"This is an intolerable situation!"
"We insist that the interinstitutional agreement should be respected, and if that does not happen, this house must actually ensure that urgencies are rejected even if they are genuinely important."
"It cannot be right that one side always gives way in order to push the urgency through, whereas the other side simply does not fulfil its own obligations!"
"Mr President, on a minor point of order."
"Could you remind the House of the rule regarding mobile phones within this Chamber?"
"It would seem that some people forget that we have a rule on this matter."
"Thank you very much, Mr Thomas."
"(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)"
"Annual report and statement of assurance by Court of Auditors for the 1996 general budget"
"The next item is the presentation of the annual report and statement of assurance for the 1996 general budget."
"Mr Friedmann has the floor."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful for the honour of being permitted to speak to you this morning."
"I know that you have long night sittings behind you, and I value your presence all the more."
"70 % of European taxpayers are of the opinion that fraudulent and incorrect dealings with tax money should be judged much more critically than tax evasion."
"This means that the task which is set for the European Court of Auditors corresponds more than ever to the expectations of taxpayers."
"I will start with the revenue side of the budget."
"As you know, customs revenue, as the largest item in traditional own resources, represents an important source of finance for the European Union."
"It is therefore important to all of us that this customs revenue flows into the European Union as fully as possible."
"Even though this customs revenue is falling because of the GATT negotiations, it still funds about 15 % of the entire budget."
"We have repeatedly pointed out in previous years that there is a considerable risk in transit trade."
"You, ladies and gentlemen, therefore devoted the first committee of inquiry after Maastricht to this subject."
"We are grateful to you, particularly to the chairman, Mr Tomlinson, for bringing such important results to light."
"Here we are dealing with the risks which exist in free zones, which include most ports, and we are also dealing with active processing trade."
"That there are too many customs failures here, and the existence of these risks is linked to the fact that current regulations are often not applied at all, or are often applied incompletely and above all inconsistently."
"We should be concerned to ensure that this evil is removed, and incidentally I would like to point out that the Member States also lose tax revenue if goods evade customs duties."
"So in our opinion this is an important area."
"In this connection, certificates of origin have an important role to play."
"About half of all imports to the European Union take place under tariff preference conditions, and it is therefore not surprising that precisely this fact repeatedly results in irregularities."
"More than half of all irregularities which occur in connection with the European budget concern this area of tariff preferences."
"For instance, we established that a third country exported three times as much orange juice to the European Union as it produces itself."
"In another case, of textiles, we established that the certificates of origin were forged - it could be seen in the stamps, which were quite different from the originals."
"In one case, even the name of the capital was wrongly spelt, and when we enquired, the country of origin still documented the correctness of these certificates!"
"So great care is needed here to secure Community income, and considerable amounts are involved."
"For the period from 1986 to 1996, we checked 700 cases, and that is 700 out of several thousand."
"We established that in the 700 cases there were about ECU1 billion of subsequent claims because of irregularities, but very often the limitation period applies."
"Even if the original determinations begin at the right time, the necessary subsequent surveys stretch out, so that the limitation period applies."
"23 cases, which we checked from the point of view of the limitation period, resulted in losses of ECU 80 million to the European Union."
"I now come to the output side, and start with agricultural policy."
"As you know, within the McSharry reform the guaranteed price for cereals was significantly lowered."
"The purpose of this action was to avoid giving an unnecessary stimulus to overproduction through prices."
"Guaranteed prices no longer covered costs."
"Of course farmers cannot survive on losses."
"Direct, area-related assistance was therefore introduced."
"That was all right as long as the guaranteed prices were very low."
"However, meanwhile the supply of cereals within the European Union has dropped, because of the actions which were taken."
"On the world market too, the supply of cereals dropped, partly for climatic reasons."
"The result was that world prices rose steeply first, and consequently market prices in the European Union also rose far above guaranteed prices."
"It was really no longer necessary to pay direct subsidies at that level, but the appropriate orders did not provide for reducing direct subsidies in such cases, and the result was payments of ECU 3 billion, which in our opinion were unnecessary."
"I do not say that these payments were incorrect, but ideally they were unnecessary."
"In future, in a new programming period, it will be necessary to ensure that variations downward and upward are possible."
"In the field of agricultural policy, we again considered the tobacco and wine sectors in the last year, after we submitted special reports in 1993."
"Then as now, European tobacco cultivation does not satisfy the taste of European smokers, so these tobaccos are mostly exported."
"It is worrying that four-fifths of producer income consists of subsidies."
"Even bearing in mind that there are many jobs in the tobacco industry, on the other hand we must recognize that smoking kills people."
"It is also difficult to see how the European Union can finance a campaign against smoking and at the same time encourage tobacco cultivation."
"In the case of wine-growing, we came to the conclusion that neither the grubbing-up nor the distillation premium met expectations."
"Admittedly the supply of wine fell, but this was essentially related to climatic conditions."
"Wine is still being produced especially for distillation, and that was never in the mind of the inventor."
"To that extent, we must declare our reservations."
"In the field of structural measures, things have improved to the extent that both commitments and payments were put into effect to a large extent according to what was provided in the budget."
"98 % of commitments and 95 % of payments took place to budget, but closer inspection reveals the commitments and payments mostly took place in the last quarter, and two-thirds in December."
"This means that many advances were paid, and advances do not mean that the intended measures were put into effect."
"An example of this is given by the programming period from 1989 to 1993, which is long over."
"Three-quarters of all measures which fall into this programming period are not yet concluded."
"We must still complain that the necessary evaluations in the structural field are not done."
"To the extent that reports exist, they are rather state descriptions, but particularly now, when the new programming period from 2000 is being negotiated, it is important that appropriate evaluations should be available."
"As you know, structural assistance is always opposed to some extent to competitive conditions."
"The European internal market is based on the principle of competition, and in general subsidies interfere with competition."
"Article 92/93 of the EU Treaty therefore provides that such subsidies may only be given with the approval of the Commission, and only over a limited period and for specified purposes."
"We have here pointed out some cases which in our opinion do not sufficiently follow the regulations."
"In the field of structural assistance, we obviously also checked on the social fund."
"It can be established that in the case of the social fund resources have sometimes been paid out to people who were not at all entitled to receive the money."
"Sometimes the expected cofinancing did not materialize."
"In other cases, no preference was given to small and medium-sized companies."
"The field of structural assistance includes encouragement of small and medium-sized companies."
"We have not yet been satisfied with the way that this occurs through the Commission."
"Our opinion is that small and mediumsized companies are particularly important from the point of view of employment - incidentally this is surely a subject for the employment summit next week - and that in this context they must be encouraged more strongly."
"Yet the Commission cannot even state the exact amount which is given to these companies."
"There is still not even a definition of what is considered to be a medium-sized or small company."
"We checked a sample of 33 so-called small and medium-sized companies, and established that only 11 were really small or medium-sized."
"The other two-thirds of the selected companies belonged to groups."
"In one case, even a company with 2, 000 employees was defined as a small company."
"That cannot be right!"
"The Community initiative for small and medium-sized companies, which is to be controlled by the Commission itself, is also not functioning properly."
"ECU 910 million were provided in the budget for this Community initiative, but until now only ECU 140 million have been paid out in advances."
"Only one State, Germany, has submitted one expenditure certificate, for only DM 3 million, and even that was only an advance."
"This means that the European Commission must develop more activities in the field of small and medium-sized companies."
"Structural assistance also includes fisheries policy."
"We came to the conclusion that the desired goal is still not being reached."
"The fishing fleets of the Member States still fail to show the necessary adjustment of capacity, nor does their structure conform to expectations."
"In the field of structural policy, I must also mention the Phare and Tacis programmes, which are also structural programmes."
"We must continue to complain in connection with these two programmes that the flow of resources is too small."
"Nevertheless, there is certainly a good deal to be said for these programmes."
"For instance, by using the resources which are provided in the programmes, the administrations of the states of central and eastern Europe can learn to work with the Member States of the EU and the Commission."
"These are states which previously cooperated within COMECON."
"This is certainly an important education process, but there are absorption difficulties for the administrations of central and eastern Europe, which is incidentally an important point for the coming expansion negotiations."
"It must also be seen that, in the field of agricultural policy within the Phare and Tacis programmes, the goal has not yet been reached by a long way."
"As long as the ownership structure in these states remains unclear, as long as there is no land register and thus no basis for security for credits, privatization of agriculture is hardly possible, because new private agriculture is based on credit."
"In this respect, it is important to continue working in this field, and I also think that Phare and Tacis must be used more intensively in connection with the expansion to central and eastern Europe."
"In our assessment, the finances must be organized more strongly than before for this purpose."
"We also examined the field of development aid."
"As far as cooperation with the developing countries which do not belong to the Lomé Convention is concerned, we established that in at least one case a bank which was not particularly successful in this field was involved, so that in our opinion ECU 1 million were wrongly paid."
"In the context of the development fund, in other words the Lomé Convention, we also checked public order placing for the period from 1988 to 1993."
"There is much to complain about, because, for example, the most-favoured-nation clause was not applied, tax regulations were not observed and tenders and invitations to tender did not agree."
"As you know, we also had to prepare an auditor's certificate for the whole budget."
"The Treaty of Maastricht provides for this."
"We are submitting the third auditor's certificate this year."
"This time, the auditor's certificate is part of our report, as Volume II."
"As far as the general budget is concerned, we came to the following conclusion. The financial statements of the Community reflect correctly the income and expenditure, and thus the financial state, of the Community, apart from insignificant exceptions."
"The events on which the income is based generally correspond to the principles of legality and adequacy."
"The same applies to commitments."
"However, with reference to the events on which payments are based, in our understanding there are far too many substantial errors."
"We came to the conclusion that in 1996 5.4 % of the events on which payments were based were associated with serious errors, and we point out that the error rate in the field of structural assistance is above average, and in the field of agricultural policy it is below average."
"I would also like to establish one thing. This 5.4 % does not mean that only cases of fraud are involved."
"It also includes other cases such as application of a wrong exchange rate in the social fund, and so on."
"For instance, on on occasion our auditors could not carry out an audit because an angry farmer set vicious dogs on them!"
"We also come to the conclusion that there are 4.3 % of so-called non-opinion cases, in which we could make no judgment, perhaps because there was a strike in the state concerned, or the public prosecutor had seized documents, when we wanted to take the audit."
"In the field of formal errors, our opinion is also that there are far too many, but for us formal errors are those that do not have a recognizably adverse effect on the budget."
"Regarding the Lomé Convention, for which we give a separate auditor's certificate, this year we come to the conclusion that all the categories which I have indicated in the case of the general budget are in order, so that altogether, apart from a few exceptions, we can say that our auditor's certificate for the Lomé Convention is positive."
"Allow me to make a few quick remarks about the effect of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which is not yet ratified."
"As a result of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Court of Auditors has now become the court of auditors for the whole Community."
"It is thus made formally equal to the other Community institutions."
"We must now report on irregularities, the treaty says. An appropriate clause was inserted."
"However, here I would like to define our role."
"Our primary task is prevention, that is, contributing to ensuring that irregularities do not occur."
"We do not believe that we are police or the public prosecution service, but if we come across irregularities or even fraud while carrying out our normal tasks, we follow it up and then involve the appropriate authorities."
"We see our task as making our contribution in the context of budgetary control as I said, not as a police force or public prosecution service."
"The treaty also provides that we should work in close cooperation with the national courts of auditors."
"The treaty further provides that we should audit the European Investment Bank within the framework of the existing Tripartite Agreement."
"Even when the agreement is no longer in force, our right of audit continues."
"The time for which I was allowed to speak to you is over."
"Let me thank you for your good cooperation."
"These thanks apply to the Committee on Budgetary Control and its chair, Mrs Diemut Theato."
"We are grateful for the exchange of opinions which we always have in your committee, and we know that this time too you will surely make the necessary decisions on the basis of our work."
"We also thank the Committee on Budgets under Mr Detlev Samland, in which our work is debated with great expertise."
"I also thank the chief rapporteur, Mr James Elles."
"Thanks for his trouble!"
"I would also like to thank the Commission, particularly Commissioner Liikanen."
"I would like to recognize that much of what we report is taken up by the Commission."
"The reform efforts of the Commission concentrate on SEM 2000."
"It is already possible to recognize that the resulting administration and information system allows improvements to be expected."
"We also recognize that the new settlement procedure in the field of agricultural policy allows positive results to be expected."
"We are also grateful that the Commission shares our view."
"A new budget order is due, we have already made the appropriate contributions to it, and we are grateful that in the structural field too, definitions which may prevent irregularities have been made."
"Mr Liikanen, hearty thanks to you, also representing your colleagues."
"I thank you for your attention."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, the annual report and the statement of assurance relating to activities in connection with the general budget for the financial year 1996 identifies a list of shortcomings in the use of Community funds."
"In key areas it will help the Commission make progress towards fulfilling its joint responsibility for significantly improving the impact of Community funds in achieving the Union's objectives."
"First of all, the Court observes that a generous allocation of budgetary appropriations may discourage rigorous financial management."
"Such a potential risk is clearly reduced for the 1998 budget."
"However you measure it - in terms of growth rates, margins below the financial perspectives or in relation to the own-resources ceiling - the forthcoming 1998 budget is rigorous."
"The Commission, like the Court and Mr Friedmann, has identified overcompensation of cereal producers in the context of the 1992 agricultural reforms."
"The Commission has made a proposal for a partial correction."
"To its great regret, this has not been adopted, either by the Council or the European Parliament."
"The Commission therefore will come back to this question in the context of Agenda 2000."
"As far as the common agricultural policy in general is concerned, all observations of the Court are valuable for the clearing of accounts, and the Commission will make full use of them."
"I have also noted with interest the conclusion of the Court that for the EAGGF guarantee section there are indications that the new financial arrangements for clearance of accounts are having some beneficial impact."
"With regard to the structural funds, the number of significant errors affecting payments remains too high."
"This is the area where the most important decisions were taken in 1997."
"The rules of eligibility were agreed last April."
"In October the Commission adopted a regulation on minimum standards for financial control by Member States."
"These minimum standards apply to those operations which are cofinanced by the structural funds."
"Last month the Commission also took note of the internal guidelines on application of net financial corrections."
"I reported on the measures taken to Ecofin yesterday."
"The support of the Court of Auditors and the European Parliament for this process has been vital."
"It has not always been easy."
"Attention now shifts to framing regulations for the next programming period."
"This must permit a qualitative leap towards enhancing cost-effectiveness."
"Concentration, simplification, decentralization, combined with more stringent checks and verification of results, are the leitmotifs here."
"The discussions on the Court of Auditors' 1996 report and the discharge procedure coincide with the Commission proposal and will make it possible to draw the best possible conclusions for the next period."
"Here I would like to make a plea to the Court of Auditors."
"It would be valuable if, with the additional resources for the statement of assurance, the Court could in the future provide more sectoral information."
"This would help identify the source of the problem and the responsibilities, and this, in turn, would allow us to target the reform activities better."
"Briefly, some other observations."
"This report reinforces the conviction that in many areas of the Community budget there are too many projects which are too small and have too many objectives."
"Concentration and simplification need to be pursued throughout the Community budget."
"In several chapters the Court criticizes the management of Community subsidies."
"In line with the observations of its own Inspectorate-General and the continuous insistence of the European Parliament, the Commission is working towards general standards in this area."
"It will adopt an interim report later today, and I will inform the Committee on Budgets of the European Parliament about this report next week."
"Finally, the Court has convinced the Commission of the advantages of a general overhaul of the Communities' financial regulations."
"The Commission should be able to provide a first reflection document in the first half of 1998."
"In conclusion, let me assure you that the Commission will carefully follow up all the Court's remarks in the 1996 annual report."
"The future presidency has also indicated its particular commitment in this respect."
"The reform of the management of Community finances is a continuous process."
"A number of reforms have been decided, as I informed you."
"Their implementation must be persistent and rigorous ."
"Improving financial management is a continuous process."
"It is our duty and also the duty of the Member States."
"Only in this way will our efforts bear fruit, improve the regularity of Community spending and increase value for money."
"I congratulate Mr Friedmann on this annual report."
"The Commission is fully committed to working with the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato, the rapporteur, Mr Ellis, and all parliamentarians involved to draw the required conclusions."
"Thank you very much, Mr Liikanen."
"We now come to the debate on the report, and I would ask you to keep your questions concise please."
"Mr President, I have four questions."
"My first is a general one: to what extent are we talking about fraud, Mr Friedmann, as opposed to mismanagement of funds?"
"Can you give us some idea of that?"
"The next three questions are all on the DASS."
"Paragraph 19.30 of the report talks about substantive errors - which you also referred to in your speech - where the EAGGF guarantee funds are below average."
"Does this mean that we have a positive DASS for agriculture?"
"Does it also mean that we only have a negative DASS in the structural funds?"
"In paragraph 19.27 where the Commission talks about limitations to their work, we are given two areas: one concerning public storage and one unforeseen legal and physical circumstances."
"We are not told what these are in the report or in the Commission's response."
"Could you explain what they are, Mr Friedmann?"
"Finally, in the response to paragraphs 19.28 to 19.36 the Commission makes a statement which I seem to have seen now for the third time."
"It says it believes that because of the degree of uncertainty inherent in any statistical method and because it will be some years before the DASS has required sufficient maturity, the Court's findings must be interpreted with caution."
"What is your response to that?"
"Mr President, Mr President of the European Court of Auditors, first cordial thanks for your explanations, for a constructive report which the Commission will also follow up, as we have just heard from Commissioner Liikanen."
"We too are interested in protecting tax revenue, and will therefore go constructively to work."
"However, there are some points that obviously cause us great concern, particularly in the field of cooperation with the Member States."
"When I hear that nine out of ten errors happen in the Member States, as you showed, that is very disturbing."
"My question concerns the field of customs, which you addressed."
"Do you see similar risks in the case of VAT and also of the fourth income source, GNP?"
"Could the necessary controls be carried out more effectively, even if we still have no country of origin certificate, but the VAT is levied in the other countries?"
"I also have a question on small and medium-sized companies: do you have any recommendations on how fragmentation could be avoided, and above all how the information deficit, which obviously exists, could be made up?"
"We would be very pleased!"
"We have little time, so I am being brief."
"Finally, however, I would like to emphasize that we are now getting to work very energetically, and counting on cooperation with the Court and the Commission, as we do every year!"
"Mr President, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, with regard to individual programmes, in particular Phare and Tacis, last year you emphasized the difficulties of both monitoring use of funds and underutilization of open accounts."
"I believe the work of the Court of Auditors will be particularly useful when the time comes to develop financial procedures for the Agenda 2000 budget aimed at countries who are candidates for membership."
"But I would like to ask your opinion on a subject which particularly concerns me, as I am the rapporteur for the budget."
"It relates to the reconstruction of former Yugoslavia."
"Mr President, have you any particular information concerning the utilization of funds for this purpose?"
"Can you, in particular, tell us if you have effective ways of ensuring with certainty that the open accounts for rehabilitation and reconstruction are not being used for other purposes?"
"Lastly, given that management responsibility has been largely delegated to the World Bank, can you give us any information regarding your relations with this organization and, in particular, with regard to way in which control is exercised in the award of contracts?"
"Mr President, once again, the Court of Auditors has severely criticized the way in which the Community's resources are managed, and for example the Economic and Social Committee has been severely criticised for fraud in connection with travelling expenses refunded without proper documentation, and the meeting lists are not reliable."
"I would like to ask the chairman of the Court of Auditors when we will actually get an investigation into the European Parliament?"
"How come we did not get a report on the situation in Parliament long ago, so we can sort out our own management of resources and hence, ladies and gentlemen, also sort out our image, because presumably the Court of Auditors is not negotiating with the President of the European Parliament on whether there should be a review of Parliament at all?"
"My second question, Mr President, concerns the ruling by the Court, where I think we are still not answering the question of why there are so many errors in the payments."
"We are failing to have it clarified whether it is actually the Court of Appeal's method which is at fault, whether it is the Commission's system of controls which is at fault or whether it is simply the Member States."
"Who is responsible for the way things are, and how large a margin of error does the Court of Auditors think is acceptable in the first place?"
"Mr President, I refer to line 1426, former Yugoslavia."
"You state in the Court of Auditors report that up to July 1997 a total of 1.3 % of the resources which we provided in December 1995 for reconstruction in Yugoslavia had been used."
"Two weeks ago, we transferred ECU 100 million for 1997, which were provided for reconstruction, to fisheries and elsewhere, because DG 1a is unable to pay these funds!"
"I have asked Mr Westendorp to come to the Committee on Budgetary Control next week and explain this fact to us, because we are not getting any detailed information from the Commission about what is going on."
"My question to you is this: if you say that your work is for prevention, and if you say that the Commission has shown itself to be capable of learning to respond to your stimuli, how then do you assess the ability of DG 1a to learn something for 1997 or 1998 and following years from the mess of 1996?"
"Mr President, the report on the 1996 budget exercise is extremely rewarding, as were the previous years' reports."
"Unfortunately, I doubt that much follow-up will be devoted to it."
"On the eve of the European Summit, in which the European Union envisages attacking unemployment by making a substantial financial contribution which will benefit SMEs through the intermediary of the EIB, I would like to give a topical example, that of chapter 6, which deals with SMEs."
"The report points out that, within the context of the ERDF, there are no defined regulations for SMEs, there has been no inventory of the numerous actions benefitting SMEs, nor a statement of the amounts allocated to financing them."
"It notes that SMEs still have difficulty in gaining access to capital and in obtaining loans and that the SME initiative, provided with ECU 1 billion for the period 1994-1999, has not enabled more coherence to be given to the cohesion or to the strategy of aid. The procedures do not make it possible to ensure respect for the rules of cumulative aid and the Commission has carried out few analyses of the socio-economic impact of concrete actions benefitting these enterprises."
"Where they exist, these analyses do not prove that the overall creation of real jobs is due to the actions financed."
"So my question is: does the Court of Auditors envisage recommending that the Commission urgently rationalize and optimize the use of these Community instruments designed for SMIs and SMEs before it and Parliament release millions of ECUs, which we know in advance will not be of any use?"
"Mr President of the Court of Auditors, you have dedicated a chapter to general subsidies, in which you note numerous anomalies in their distribution."
"There are only a few hundred of these, while the various chapters of title B of the budget cover tens of thousands of subsidies."
"My question is therefore the following: do you envisage widening the study that you have made on the general subsidies of title A-3 to cover the chapters of title B of the Community budget, so that we will be able to understand them better?"
"That is my general question."
"I also have a more specific question to put to you."
"Still relating to this chapter, you quote two particularly important anomalies. One relates to a subsidy of ECU 400, 000 aimed only at internal usage, but without stating the beneficiary organization."
"Do you not think that in the interests of greater transparency the offending organization should have been named?"
"Mrs Kjer Hansen has briefly talked about the issue of travel expenses of the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions which was not mentioned by the President of the Court of Auditors."
"Investigations by the Court of Auditors are based on random sampling."
"My question is: would it not be sensible to complete the inquiry, both into the number of members and into the time that those members have spent on the Economic and Social Committee, to give the Council, which is politically responsible for the appointment of the members of the Economic and Social Committee, the opportunity to take the necessary action?"
"In other words, Mr President, it is really more a question for the chairman of the committee. The impression is created that the European Commission attaches more importance to the opinions of the European Council than to those of the budget authority and to the financial regulations."
"Mr President, I am glad that the President of the Court of Auditors and Commissioner Liikanen are both here, because my questions concern their lack of communication with each other."
"I should like to put three specific questions."
"The first question is about substantive errors."
"It seems that the two of you have different ideas about what constitutes a substantive error, and what the budgetary impact of these substantive errors is."
"This is quite important, because it affects, among other things, the amounts you query, for example in such important areas as the structural funds."
"Could your communication with each other be improved?"
"My second question concerns the rules of eligibility."
"From the Commission's replies, I assume that the common rules of eligibility for all the Member States have now been worked out."
"Has the Court of Auditors not been informed of these rules of eligibility?"
"The third question, Mr President, concerns the national monitoring institutions."
"It is clear that there is still a lack of cooperation between these institutions and the Court of Auditors."
"Does the Court of Auditors think they can perform their task of inspection without such collaboration?"
"Mr President of the Court of Auditors, in your report you mentioned that there are formal defects in the management of the structural funds, which amount to violations of the law."
"Four-fifths of those defects arise from the structural and institutional shortcomings of Member States."
"Those States, however, administer 80 % of European funds and the European budget."
"How, Mr President, do you suggest that this complicity or default on the part of Member States can be eradicated unless there are real changes in the criminal law and, in short, crime ceases to pay in Europe as it has paid up to now? That is what needs to be done."
"Why does the Court of Auditors not accuse and indict those Member States which are not operating correctly, instead of just recording the fact?"
"Mr President, I have a question about overpayment of income supplements in agriculture."
"Mr Friedmann, if I have understood correctly, are we only talking about the year 1996, or has he also included the previous years?"
"And in that case, has he taken into account the monetary aspects, the fluctuation in green rates?"
"Another question: have the regulations been wrongly applied?"
"Or have they been applied correctly and were they incorrect from the outset?"
"Had it been assumed that there would be a 5 or 10 % fluctuation against the guaranteed price?"
"This is important in connection with overcompensation."
"And then my last question, also in connection with Agenda 2000: these income supplements were set for six years; does he think it is reasonable that halfway through the game the rules are changed, and does he think it is credible in the light of the proposals the Commission is making in this context ahead of Agenda 2000?"
"Mr President, Mr Friedmann said there were around 5.3 % irregularities in the EU's budget."
"My question is: what does this look like in comparison with the budgets of the Member States?"
"Are the irregularities as large in the Member States' own budgets as in the EU's budget?"
"Or is it the EU which has difficulty in keeping track of its money?"
"As far as tobacco subsidies are concerned, these are very regrettable."
"I agree that tobacco subsidies should be revised and completely abolished, because it cannot be reasonable for the EU's taxpayers to pay four-fifths of the tobacco growers' income."
"My last question concerns the Commission."
"The European Commission has 17, 000 employees."
"However, I can find very little in the documentation about how the Commission deals with its internal situation, that is, how much corruption there is among the EU's employees."
"It cannot be only the Member States who have difficulty in keeping track of the EU's money; it must also be difficult for EU employees."
"Mr President, I should like to ask two questions."
"First of all, will the Court of Auditors accept that the threat to own resources shown in the annual report cannot be tackled at Community level alone?"
"Member States receive 10 % in a payment for collection of traditional own resources and they must, therefore, accept a high level of obligation with regard to this payment, particularly as it coincides with their own self-interest."
"The annual report, for example, of the United Kingdom customs and excise published yesterday shows a £1 billion shortfall in tobacco receipts alone."
"Secondly, will the Commission itself note and accept a paradox concerning the tobacco regime."
"While the Commission is trying to ban tobacco companies from using their post-tax profits on sports sponsorship, the Commission is supporting by over ECU 1 billion a tobacco regime as if it were a healthy agricultural pursuit."
"Will the Court of Auditors make sure that the Commission fully understands the criticisms of the existing regime and point out to the Commission that they are only in a position to take the moral high ground if they stop the support for the regime?"
"Mr President, this presentation merits more time but its brevity should not stop us from congratulating the Court and thanking it for this very good report."
"I just want to ask three questions."
"In chapter 15 the Court discusses the failings of the Community's decentralized bodies."
"Will the Court please look early at the proposals from the Commission, which the Committee on Budgetary Control is now considering, to see if, in the Court's view, they will meet the problem."
"Chapter 1 draws attention to the problems of revenue loss in the free zones."
"Could we please, at some time, have an estimate of the loss of revenue in those zones?"
"Thirdly, regarding the sentence quoted by the Commissioner on overprovision of resources in various areas, I would remind the House that this overprovision happens in the compulsory expenditure chapters."
"It lends weight to Parliament's argument that the compulsory side of the budget should disappear."
"Mr President, I read the Court of Appeal's report with pleasure this year, because I cannot see Denmark mentioned in the report as we were in other years and that is pleasing."
"I would like to support my colleague, Eva Kjer Hansen, in her proposal that we should have an investigation into Parliament's travel expenses, so we can improve our image."
"But there is one thing on which I would very much like to have an answer from Mr Friedman: is it the case that we are pumping a mass of EU funds into the Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund without us having any way of seeing what the money is used for?"
"The report says that people will not cooperate, and I believe this is the problem we need to take up."
"Finally, I would say that, until I came down here, I used to read an incredible number of detective novels, and now that I read our annual reports I find that my need for excitement is satisfied."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for the interest you bring to the report."
"Mr Wynn, you asked first to what extent we are talking about fraud."
"We generally talk about irregularities, and it is clear to us that fraud is a part, a subset of irregularities, because until now there have been criminal law definitions of fraud in connection with European Union money in only three states of the European Union."
"You then ask why we have not given a positive auditor's certificate for the EAGGF field, when this is below average."
"As stated, the average is 5.4 %, but we have to supply a global DASS."
"We therefore do not distinguish individual policy fields in the quantification of the DASS."
"You then asked about the uncertainties in the statistics and the reservations of the Commission about the auditor's certificate."
"I believe I can say that we have come a long way in the development of our auditor's certificate regarding the method, and also in the discussion with the Commission."
"Mrs Theato, you refer to the risks concerning VAT."
"Your question is well-founded, because with VAT in the internal market system we have a similar situation as in the customs field."
"As long as the destination principle applies, the goods on the way to the destination country are outside VAT and therefore subject to risk."
"You asked how it looks with the Gross National Product component."
"The problem is that the methods of calculation in the Member States still do not entirely agree."
"We are dealing with this subject, and have also brought in outside experts."
"What about small and medium-sized companies?"
"Can we give recommendations?"
"The MEP also addressed this subject."
"In general, I would like to say that from the point of view of employment, small and medium-sized companies have an important part to play."
"We have established that if money is given to large groups, they immediately rationalize and remove jobs, which can be commercially sensible."
"But each small and medium-sized company which is newly created means a new job every time."
"The small and medium-sized companies therefore have an outstanding job to do concerning the current problems within the Community."
"I was asked about the Phare and Tacis programmes and former Yugoslavia."
"You mentioned yourself how low the percentages of these resources which are put to use are."
"I know the difficulties between the Member States and the Commission."
"I myself recently telephoned the responsible Director-General."
"I am not satisfied with the situation."
"When you think that winter is now beginning in Bosnia, and work on houses which need repair cannot be started although the money for it is provided, that is more than depressing!"
"I have tried to answer Mrs Müller's question."
"Mrs Kjer Hansen, you spoke about the Economic and Social Committee."
"Indeed, we had to criticize that committee sharply."
"We criticized it for irregularities in the refunding of flight tickets, irregularities in the accumulation of day and session money, and some other things."
"We have indicated the percentages of irregularities in this connection which we determined last year and the previous year."
"They are remarkably high."
"We have noted that the Economic and Social Committee has now informed us that it has introduced the necessary counter-measures, and will demand the return of money which was paid unlawfully."
"You ask about auditing in the European Parliament."
"This audit is in progress."
"We are having discussions with your president and responsible representatives of your Chamber."
"We will submit the result of the audit during the next year, after consultation with you."
"Mr Le Gallou, you ask why we did not name the association which you have criticized and we also criticize."
"We are cautious about mentioning names in such cases."
"We have just been sued in the European Court in a case for ECU 1 million in damages, because we named a private company in a context which the company thought was unfavourable."
"So it is always a problem for us, how far we should go in naming companies."
"Also, in general we cannot write everything we know in the report, particularly if parallel investigations by the public prosecutor are in progress, because otherwise we would warn the other side too early, on the basis of the prescribed cross-examination procedure."
"This applies, for instance, to the special report on tourism."
"Mr Dankert, you also mentioned the Economic and Social Committee."
"I have already replied to Mrs Kjer Hansen about it."
"Mr Garriga Polledo, you ask about the consequences of the rates of error."
"I spoke before briefly about SEM 2000, where very promising work is being carried out, and I also state that in the Member States they are preparing more and more for the consequences."
"You must consider that our DASS gives the direction."
"If the fraud report of UCLAF states that in country X so many cases of fraud occurred and were reported, that simply confirms by example that the rate of errors which we list is justified."
"So we give the rate of errors, individual cases of fraud are then the proof that our estimate is broadly correct."
"You also ask, if four-fifths of all irregularities take place in the Member States, what is the result?"
"It is true that on the one hand, the Commission is responsible for executing the budget."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam again provides this."
"But in practice four-fifths of the budget is executed by the Member States, and to this extent, in connection with this criticism, the Member States are also in the pillory."
"(Applause) In general, if the Community is criticized again and again because the percentage of irregularities is so and so, it must be remembered that no more people are employed by the Community than by the administration of a medium-sized city."
"The expenditure programmes of the Community are put into effect by the Member States."
"As a general rule, how properly the money of the European taxpayer is handled depends on their quality."
"(Applause) Mr Mulder, you asked whether the estimate of ECU 3 billion, which in our opinion was overpaid in the field of agricultural policy, concerns one year or several years."
"This estimate concerns the agricultural year 1995/96."
"Yesterday, in the debate with you, I noted that in the first years of the programming period there was a different situation."
"What we are putting on the table is perhaps important experience if this policy is to be continued in the coming years, and new regulations must then be created."
"Mr Holm, you ask, if there are 5.4 % serious errors, what about the Member States?"
"You must consider that the Community budget is almost exclusively a subsidy budget, and therefore highly liable to irregularities."
"Whenever someone is given money, his human spirit becomes inventive."
"The part of national budgets which is associated with subsidies is equally liable to irregularities."
"It is therefore much more important to develop mechanisms which make fraud unattractive, perhaps by using cheap loans rather than subsidies, and above all if profitable investments are involved."
"I think we must continue to think hard together along these lines!"
"(Applause) Mr Tomlinson, you pointed out that in the case of own resources it cannot be the fault of the EU if so much is lost."
"You are quite right!"
"The income from customs belongs to the Community, but it is raised exclusively by the customs administrations, which are national."
"Customs officers are national officials."
"It is utterly deplorable that, as you yourself have already said, the customs administrations of the Member States work together abominably, and that they make far too little use of new information technology!"
"That is all the more annoying because the Member States are paid 10 % of the customs revenue for their work."
"The Member States should finally understand that when customs duties are not paid on goods that also means a loss of tax revenue for the Member States."
"We must convince the Member States more strongly so that these customs evasions no longer occur to this extent."
"Mr Kellett-Bowman, some of your questions were addressed to the Commission, but you also mentioned the subject of free zones."
"These are mostly ports, where goods arrive and are exported again free of customs."
"Sometimes the necessary evidence is not supplied, so that one just does not know whether it really happens as the legal regulations provide."
"Mr Blak, you say that this time we do not mention Denmark."
"That need not be so!"
"Europe is big enough."
"Obviously, Denmark is included in the overall figures, like all other countries."
"As far as the European Investment Fund is concerned, you are quite right."
"We have only a one-third share of it, and can therefore not audit as you would like, and so would we."
"I would be grateful if you would create the appropriate political pressure, so that we perhaps advance some way together, because after all this is about the Community's money!"
"Thank you for your attention."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you very much, Mr President!"
"The debate is closed."
"BSE"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report (A4-0362/97) by Mr Böge, on behalf of the Temporary Committee to follow up the recommendations on BSE, on the European Commission's follow-up of the recommendations made by the Committee of Inquiry into BSE; -16 oral questions to the Council and to the Commission (Â4-0525/97 and Â4-0526/97, on behalf of the Group Union for Europe, Â4-0714/97 and Â4-0715/97, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, Â40716/97 and Â4-0717/97, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, Â4-0718/97 and Â4-0719/97, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party, Â4-0720/97 and Â4-0721/97, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, Â4-0722/97 and Â4-0723/97, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, Â4-0897/97 and Â4-0898/97, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, Â4-0899/97 and Â4-0900/97, on behalf of the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations), on the report of the Temporary Committee to follow up the recommendations on BSE."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, on 23 April this House decided to set up a Temporary Committee to follow up the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry into BSE."
"Its task was to monitor the handling by the EU Commission of the 70 recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry, and to report to the Conference of Presidents about it at the beginning of November."
"So we were not a new committee of inquiry, although there was sometimes a temptation to open the books again."
"Our work was based on the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry and the progress reports from the Commission, which were submitted monthly."
"Anyone who compares the Commission's first progress report before the summer break with the final Commission document can see that a good start has been made."
"BSE was indeed no act of God, as certain people tried to tell us at the Committee of Inquiry, but a bizarre mixture of wrong behaviour, mismanagement, wrong assessment and ignorance, and these mistakes demanded that we should draw conclusions from them."
"Summarizing, I can say that wherever what mattered was to draw conclusions which were important to the consumer, and to drive the decision forward, we are on the way."
"Either the expressed recommendations have been put into effect, or a start has been made, or the Commission has promised to do so within a firm timetable."
"These, Mr President of the Commission, are bills of exchange on the future."
"Redeem these bills of exchange, because, as in business life, if you do not redeem bills of exchange, you are no longer in business!"
"I add that wherever we went in the undergrowth of the treaty or treaty interpretations, there really were problems."
"Even knowing the very varied legal interpretations of the services of Parliament and the Commission, I say that here we would have liked the Commission to be more courageous and more on the offensive."
"On the other hand, we recognize fully that the Commission has acted on some difficult issues right up to the last minute - I remember the promises to change the status of officials, and also the very clear promise from you, Mr President of the Commission, to put yourself on the side of the Parliament during the renegotiation of the interinstitutional agreement."
"Let me list some positive examples where we have made a good start."
"Obviously, reclaiming the costs of BSE, disciplinary measures, administrative proceedings against the United Kingdom, proceedings because of the nonappearance of Mr Hogg or the vote of no confidence against individual commissioners are so to speak the negative examples which have not been worked out."
"We consider as particularly positive the successes in efforts for more transparency and openness: access by Parliament and the public to the bases of the scientific advice, new members of the scientific committees, stronger participation by experts in human medicine."
"We demand here that the same principles of openness, clarity and information must also apply to international scientific bodies, otherwise we shall reject these opinions as a basis for business in future."
"We consider as positive the reorganization of departments, the separation of lawmaking on the one hand and scientific advice and control on the other."
"Even the supplementary budget is now finally on the way."
"But I also say here that if the Commission had acted collectively, the necessary jobs could have been created long ago by switching free jobs."
"And please ensure that the open question of the veterinary inspection department is settled on the principle of efficiency, not by location."
"This is also a subject which concerns the Council, Mr President-inOffice."
"Indeed, the actions and control activities of the Member States and the Commission, in the context of the possibilities of the internal market, were badly coordinated and inadequate."
"Here there is a series of good suggestions for improvement which have been promised to us."
"Spot checks in the country of origin, physical checks on the borders combined with improved information about the destination country, independently of BSE, can show a way to the future here."
"I expect here from the Council that it should declare itself ready to make the results of veterinary inspection accessible to the public."
"The pressure of public opinion and the pressure of markets would then have much more effect than the initiation of any breach of contract proceedings by the Commission."
"Mr President-in-Office, the negligent behaviour, sometimes contemptuous of Community law, of some Member States must be finally brought to an end."
"I am thinking in particular of the unbelievable events and lax behaviour about putting the appropriate directive about sterilization of animal meal into effect."
"We can therefore only say that the Commission must start breach of contract proceedings much more quickly in future."
"It must apply more boldly than before for interim injunctions by the European Court of Justice, and essentially, follow-up controls must become the rule when deficiencies are identified, and the costs must be charged to the defaulting Member States."
"In the spirit of transparency and openness and citizen involvement and with the support of the Commission, it was possible in Amsterdam to put through the extension of the codecision procedure to the fields of animal health and plant protection."
"This is positive, but at the same time we expect the Commission, where there is room for interpretation regarding the legal basis, to undertake always to exploit it in favour of Parliament."
"We have talked for a long time about compensation for the victims of this crisis."
"After long hesitation, the Commission has declared itself ready, in the spirit of solidarity, to provide money from the Community budget in addition to the resources provided by the Member States, if the Member States introduce corresponding initiatives."
"We see the promised support of the organization which is active in this field as the first step in the right direction, and invite the British government and the Commission to consult with the organizations about suitable support actions, and to report to us."
"It is quite clear that the root of the whole evil was the completely crazy use of insufficiently sterilized animal meals, which were also fed to ruminants."
"We have thoroughly investigated and clarified this question during an international conference of scientists and experts."
"You will find the results in the report."
"A truly functional recycling system can only be sustained if three safety keys are in place in future: clean base materials, slaughtering waste only from animals which are permitted to be used as food, the highest possible processing standards, and never, never, feeding to ruminants!"
"The behaviour of the Member States here is really a scandal."
"If a Member State completely refuses to put this directive into effect, it must be put in the pillory!"
"The prohibition of movement which the Commission declared was correct, but came very late."
"I will add that, regarding the problems of the risk material decision of the Commission of 30 July, we as a Parliament are giving the Commission as well as the Council a real helping hand with this report, on how to escape from the dilemma: step by step removal of the export prohibition on the clear conditions which were agreed in Florence, filling in the gaps in the decision of 30 July regarding pharmaceutical products, and many other open specialist questions."
"Read the report very carefully!"
"I believe we have made good proposals to you."
"It is clear that the staffing and disciplinary actions were not sufficiently put into effect."
"Mr President of the Commission, we are pleased that you have reorganized your staff, that there has been a reorganization."
"We regret that you have refused to take disciplinary action."
"We maintain our position but the promise to change the status of officials in the light of this recognition is also a bill of exchange on the future, which we explicitly welcome."
"Mr President of the Commission, we also welcome your promise, which you have again made clearly, to strive, in the renegotiation of the interinstitutional agreement with Parliament, to ensure that in future it should be obligatory for members of national governments to appear."
"It is clear that if the Council does not come, responsibility is put on the Commission, so it is in your self-interest that this should be changed for the future."
"Let me finally say, Mr President, that agriculture, rural economy on the principle of sustainability and thinking over generations must be our motto, the need for an agriculture adapted to its location, observing the precautionary principle in improving efficiency and using hormones, and the development of a code of good agricultural practice."
"I believe that in the last 16 months Parliament has tried, with the Committee of Inquiry and dealing with the recommendation, to recreate a front rank position for protection of health and the consumer in the internal market."
"I also warn the curious that Parliament is now able to reopen such a procedure."
"Therefore, let the past be a lesson to us all!"
"I would like to ask the Commission to remain the committed ally of the European Parliament in the future, when what matters is to put precautionary consumer and health protection at the centre of the internal market effort!"
"(Applause)"
"Mr Böge, I have allowed you to exceed your time, which was the least reward that I, as President, could give you for such a brilliant piece of work."
"I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you and the whole of the committee under the chair of Mrs Roth-Behrendt for an exceptional piece of work undertaken over the last nine months."
"Mr President, it may be necessary for me to appeal to that generosity too, but I hope that the time I have been allocated will be enough and I will not have to go on longer."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in his report Mr Böge has given a very accurate and excellent presentation of the credit and debit sides of the European Parliament's demand, as we in the Committee of Inquiry stated it, and today we have a very detailed list of achievements and failures in relation to what the Commission has done in the last halfyear."
"I must also say very clearly at this point that we are talking about the Commission, and I have never hidden the fact that I would much rather be talking about the Council!"
"And as we all know, if we thought and are still thinking about a possible vote of no confidence, the Council would have deserved this vote of no confidence."
"That must be said quite clearly, and I would be the first person to support such a vote of no confidence."
"But if we as the European Parliament, out of all the institutions, can only speak about the Commission, and evaluate what the Commission has achieved in the last half-year, the assessment which Mr Böge has also given shows very clearly that things are moving!"
"Suddenly movement is there, suddenly transparency is there, suddenly an effort by the Commission can be recognized."
"Effort!"
"That is a word we never heard in the early years, since 1987/1988, in connection with BSE."
"Where once there was cover-up, now there is transparency."
"There could not be a bigger contrast."
"And suddenly the efforts are achievable, to an extent that no member of the follow-up committee, in any group, had believed possible six months ago."
"We would never have believed that we would get to where we are."
"All the committee members said that they did not trust the Commission to move in this way."
"Neither did I, to be honest!"
"That it took the threat of a vote of no confidence to get the Commission moving or to put it under pressure, is regrettable on the one hand, but gratifying on the other, because it shows what a Moloch like the Commission can achieve if it has to."
"Nevertheless, I have few illusions that there has really been a change of heart in all Directorates-General, and I doubt very strongly that the speed and intensity of the change would have happened without the coordination of Commissioner Bonino and her Directorate-General."
"And if you ask me for my personal opinion, I say to you very clearly, I do not believe it!"
"There are still unfulfilled demands of the European Parliament, perhaps few, perhaps not the most important."
"For instance, a few weeks ago a compensation fund for family members of CreutzfeldtJakob victims could only be squeezed out by pressure from the European Parliament."
"Mr Böge pointed out that jobs in the Commission which have long been unfilled apparently cannot be brought flexibly and quickly to where they belong, that is, in Directorate-General XXIV."
"That all shows that what the Commission rightly wrote in its fourth progress report is urgently necessary."
"It hopes, or at least I understand it as a hope, that the European Parliament will continue to be a determined ally of the Commission."
"Yes, we certainly will be, but I add, as so often, a determined yes, but above all a watchful yes."
"We will be very watchful!"
"Our colleagues in the follow-up committee have shown this watchfulness in their intensive work in the last few months, and it is now up to the standing committees of the European Parliament to ensure that the Commission, on this path of new openness, new transparency and new mobility, does not again become sleepy or careless."
"I say this with a slight undertone of warning, I do not say threat, but warning."
"The half-yearly reports which the Commission has promised in its first progress report will certainly be a reminder for the Commission, and I can assure you, Mr President of the Commission, and I think also all colleagues, that we shall look at the content and quality of these half-yearly reports in great detail."
"Finally, allow me to thank the services of the European Parliament for the speed and support that we received in the committee, for the flexibility about meeting times and meeting rooms, the uncomplicated facilitating of unscheduled meetings, which is not to be taken for granted even in this Parliament."
"I would like to thank the services of the European Parliament, particularly the translation services, and the secretariat of my committee, for their very hard, precise and quick work, without which it would not have been possible to achieve what we have achieved."
"Above all, I would like to thank Mr Böge and all our colleagues in this Temporary Committee for working together very fairly, as colleagues should, which enabled me to enjoy being in the chair, and I hope I was a fairly tolerable chairperson!"
"We could only do this work by working together as colleagues should, and as we have for the last half-year."
"I am glad that it has ended, but I am also glad of the time when we were able to move the Commission slightly, and when we could all work together!"
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt, I would like to join with you in thanking the services of Parliament; sometimes they really do carry out their duties in an exemplary way and it is wrong not to give them a mention and some praise from time to time."
"I would also like to thank you personally and to congratulate you on the work of your committee."
"On the basis of your report and the questions to the Council and the Commission, we have accepted eight motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 40, paragraph 5, of the Rules of Procedure."
"Voting on these will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by issuing, on behalf of the Socialist Group, a great tribute to the work of the Temporary Committee and, in particular, to its rapporteur Mr Böge and its chair, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, and also to all Members who took part in what has been an exemplary piece of work."
"It is important because it signifies that now the European Parliament has come of age in terms of its monitoring, investigation and control of the Commission, which is one of our fundamental roles."
"We are now demonstrating that we are carrying this out."
"So my group wants to thank the Members concerned very warmly."
"No one who has read the report can be left with any doubt as to the seriousness with which the task has been tackled."
"It is the same quality of work which we saw coming from the first Committee of Inquiry which resulted in the recommendations which the Temporary Committee have been seeing through."
"The combination of that Committee of Inquiry and the follow-up work of the Temporary Committee bodes very well for the future in our role in this respect."
"It is a matter of some personal satisfaction that one of the very first actions of the new Minister of Agriculture in the United Kingdom, following the general election on 1 May, was to offer to come here to this House and talk to the Temporary Committee, in contrast to his predecessor who refused to do so."
"In coming to this House he acknowledged the responsibility of the British Government for this whole BSE crisis."
"That has changed the tone of the debate with the British Government and I welcome that."
"I recognize the huge commitment of the Commission to the work needed to fulfil the recommendations of the original Committee of Inquiry."
"I pay tribute to Mr Santer and his colleagues' openness in the discussions."
"Mr Böge and Mrs Roth-Behrendt have made comments about what still needs to be done and I am not saying that everything is fine."
"We recognize that there are still shortcomings, in particular, the five areas where work still needs to be completed."
"Although, I am sure that the Commission did not expect us to say everything is wonderful, it is right that we pay tribute to the commitment it has shown in work with the Temporary Committee."
"There are still shortcomings and my colleagues who will speak later will deal with these."
"But that 70 recommendations have been dealt with is no mean feat and we should recognize that."
"We in this Parliament have watched and will continue to watch what goes on - in the way the Commission responds to the recommendations of the Temporary Committee and the original Committee of Inquiry through our standing committees."
"It is now their role to take up this work."
"If there is one major deficiency - and Mrs Roth-Behrendt has already referred to it - it is that in our resolution we have made no criticism of the Council."
"Clearly in some areas where the Commission has tried to carry through the Committee of Inquiry's recommendations, the Council has not been helpful - in fact, quite the opposite."
"We should be making that case here."
"Mr Böge made the case that national governments are not carrying through their responsibilities."
"We are not giving a completely clean bill of health to the Commission and we retain our criticisms."
"But, given the progress made in 70 of the recommendations, it is my group's view that the Commission has responded and, as far as we are concerned, should not be subject to a motion of censure on this occasion."
"Mr President, the vote of no confidence on probation has proved itself."
"The Commission has moved, but what is also very important is that the European Parliament has reminded itself of its duties."
"In the short history of the European Parliament, there is no precedent for how legislative control was exercised in this case of BSE."
"When our chairman said that suddenly there is effort in the Commission, suddenly there is openness, and suddenly there is effort, that has to do with the fact that we in Parliament, through this gentle pressure, but also through insight in the good work of the BSE Committee of Inquiry, have forced the Commission to accept Parliament's demands."
"One of these demands was that there should be a separation of the legislative work of the Commission and the control activity."
"That happened, but we must not forget that true legislative control starts with Parliament."
"I would like to emphasize that what has now happened in the Committee of Inquiry and the Temporary Committee is basically the normal work of a proper parliament."
"I therefore ask this Parliament to remember its duties, and to perform the role of Parliament in future less with radical utterances outwards - I say this to my group and also to the Socialist group - and more with consistent demands inwards and consistent work."
"Then the Commission will move."
"Thanks to Commissioner Fischler, Commissioner Bonino, Mr Reichenbach - it was good work together."
"I believe we have all benefitted, and that we all start from the assumption that we will not fall back from the standard we have achieved, and that we will together historically force back this historically unique Council, which is executive and legislative at one and the same time - Montesquieu would turn in his grave - and arrive at normal parliamentary work and lawmaking, where we all have our due responsibilities."
"Mr President, we find today that it was right to set up a monitoring committee."
"It gives us an insight into what the Commission has done and what it has not done."
"We can say that roughly two-thirds of Parliament's demands have been met."
"This is in fact more than we expected."
"I would like to name some of them briefly."
"We have made the fight against BSE more transparent, we got a comprehensive information policy so that we could spread information on the results of research in this field, which was very important."
"We also reinforced the national inspection authorities for veterinary and human health, which also proved to be highly necessary."
"We developed better systems for transporting fodder in the Union, but these have not been completed yet."
"Even if the Committee's work is over, we have to note that BSE is not."
"But there are signs that the disease will fade over the next four to six years, provided the programmes put in place are followed."
"Now it is often the case that people only do something about an epidemic once it is upon them, and that reduces the interest in fighting it."
"People do not take so much notice any more."
"So it is vital that the rules we have laid down are followed so that there is no such weakening of interest in combatting BSE."
"We have a tradition in the Union of being better at regionalizing epidemics than combatting them."
"I would therefore call on the Commission to follow the demands we have made on it in the committee, to try to regionalize BSE so that areas where there has been no BSE and which meet the rules on identifying cows and calves are declared BSE-free for the simple reason that this will encourage areas where there is BSE to step up the fight against the disease."
"It is my wish that this demand should be met so that we can continue this tradition."
"Finally, I would say that I regret to some extent that it was necessary to set up this committee, but on the other hand I have to admit that, when you have an organization which is as heavy as the Commission, it is sometimes necessary to attack it to get it to do its work better."
"You can dismiss governments or put pressure on them, but the Commission is a peculiar hybrid of a legislative and administrative body."
"So it has also proved necessary to put pressure on it to get it to do its work better, and that has succeeded for the moment."
"I hope there is no need to set up another committee of inquiry in the near future."
"Mr President, after one year of intense, continuous work on the part of the committees of the European Parliament with regard to bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the time has come for us to see what has been achieved and if there has been any real progress on the issue of the protection of public health and of consumers alike."
"In particular, we can make the following observations, which must not be forgotten in the future."
"First, there is no doubt that the European Parliament, with its resolution of the 19 February 1997, has succeeded in consolidating its position and today is able to exercise real control over the actions of the European Commission."
"Secondly, it has been ascertained that the conduct of the Member States and of the Commission with regard to the internal market was inadvisable and so they were unable to guarantee effective protection of public health."
"Thirdly, it is absolutely essential, Mr President-in-Office, for the Commission's veterinary inspection services to be organized as efficiently as possible, and we must ensure, in the future, that they operate appropriately and effectively, as regards their responsibilities, the flow of information, the guaranteeing of timely, effective action at both a legislative and a political level, and also compliance with the treaties."
"Fourthly, Mr President-in-Office, effective coordination and cooperation between the various services and the Member States is the real basis on which the protection of public health and the protection of consumers must be supported, as also the mapping out and execution of the necessary Community programmes and strategies in this area."
"Fifth, it is not possible to use slaughtered animals that are unfit for human consumption in the production of cattle feed."
"Sixth, the production of cattle feed must take place in strict compliance with regulations concerning safety and handling."
"Seventh, in the future, Mr President-in-Office, the Commission must aim, on the basis of scientific facts, at the highest possible protection of public health and consumers, especially in the area of food production and nutrition."
"Eighth, it is essential that the Commission should actively monitor the transfer and implementation of Community law within the Member States and submit proposals for improving the system of control and export of meat and other foodstuffs, since the effective protection of consumers can only be safeguarded when measures are taken beforehand, rather then afterwards, when the damage has been done, as in the case of BSE."
"Ninth, the Commission has of course complied with many of the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry but not always in the same satisfactory way."
"There were five recommendations that were not taken into consideration at all."
"For example, the recommendation concerning the investigation of the activities of certain of the Commission staff, the recommendation concerning compensation for the damage caused by bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and the recommendation concerning administrative action against the United Kingdom are three of the recommendations of the European Parliament, in connection with which the Commission has done absolutely nothing."
"It must be added that, once the Committee of Inquiry had completed its work, the findings showed that there is a close link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy and new-variant CreuzfeldtJakob disease."
"This disease is extremely serious, it has tragic consequences for the families of the victims and of course we do not yet know the total number of deaths the disease will cause, given the fact that there are people in whom the disease has not yet manifested itself."
"Mr President-in-Office, I would like to remind you of the commitment that you made that every piece of legislation, every regulation, directive or programme that is brought before the European Parliament in connection with the protection of health, will go forward under the codecision procedure."
"Finally, I would like to stress that, from this dramatic crisis, which has brought about human tragedies and has had social repercussions and economic consequences for the internal market, and which has led to responsibilities for the Council, for the Commission and for the United Kingdom, we must move definitively towards taking effective action, not just uttering fine phrases."
"Mr President-in-Office, these actions must be based on the principle that the protection of the health of the citizens of Europe is the greatest priority of the European Union and, as a result, is of much greater significance than other aspects of the internal market."
"Mr President, we have been able to appreciate how seriously Mr Böge took his role as chairman of the Committee of Inquiry into BSE, and he has today presented us with an excellent report on behalf of the Temporary Committee for which I congratulate him whilst at the same time regretting the fact that my group, the European Radical Alliance, was left out of this committee through some ignominious procedural wangle."
"Six months ago, the Committee of Inquiry highlighted some serious malfunctions in the way the crisis had been handled."
"There were 118 of us who felt that this justified a motion of censure."
"That path was not followed - such is democracy - and today we therefore have to draw the political and institutional conclusions of Mr Böge's report."
"Much has been done, it is true, but the facts show that much remains to be done."
"At the request of Parliament, the European Commission initiated reforms which represent considerable progress."
"However, consumer fears persist, and recent cases of fraud in Belgium demonstrate that this affair is not over."
"The European Union still does not possess the necessary instruments to enable it either to stand up to such a crisis or to avoid it. So there is an inevitable risk that such a crisis will occur again."
"It is upstream that the Commission must provide itself with effective mechanisms for risk management in general, and we note its sincere efforts in this direction."
"But many questions remain unanswered and many answers are insufficient."
"Where are the potentially contaminated masses of unrefined meat-and-bone meal?"
"Are the storehouses safe?"
"Do the controls offer real safety?"
"Why do we continue to recycle sick animals?"
"Why are certain Member States still not implementing Community legislation?"
"Who will compensate the victims' families?"
"Why are those responsible, who have been identified, not prosecuted whether they be Member States or government officials?"
"This crisis has brought in its wake another, that of the lack of confidence of European citizens in Members of this Parliament."
"The European Union has just been shaken by a serious crisis, but will it be the Union that has to pay rather than those responsible?"
"It is our duty to ensure that the Commission follows through its work."
"If this were not the case, I would hope that the politically correct consensus which seems to be current here would finally be weakened and that Parliament, which has begun to take itself in hand, would be able to take decisions which the interests of our citizens call for, otherwise the ultra-liberal machine would be able to lay down its own laws."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group I should like to congratulate Mrs RothBehrendt."
"It has been a pleasure to get to know her through the work in the committee. I also want to congratulate Mr Böge, whom I had already had the pleasure of meeting, when he chaired the earlier Committee of Inquiry."
"I also want to pay tribute to my colleagues for their fine work. Finally, I should like to mention Mr Reichenbach, who represents the participation and collaboration of the Commission - that is, the participation and collaboration of all his colleagues, who regularly assisted us with our work."
"We need to evaluate jointly the work done by the Committee of Inquiry and the Temporary Committee."
"We must remember that since the Committee of Inquiry completed its work, clear evidence has been obtained that new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is linked with BSE. This has increased the seriousness of the responsibilities identified by the Committee of Inquiry."
"Furthermore, the violation of the ban on UK beef and veal also came to light after the Committee of Inquiry had published its report."
"In this respect, the Temporary Committee did not have a mandate to investigate new responsibilities nor to modify the judgements made by the Committee of Inquiry."
"The recommendations which have been followed have to be considered as encouraging rather than satisfactory."
"There have certainly been steps in the right direction as regards consumer protection, and new administrative units have been created."
"However, for the moment my group can do no more than entertain well-founded hopes that the arrangements will all work adequately."
"There are indications of the distortions which can arise in the decisionmaking process, and also of problems with implementation."
"Of the recommendations which have been put into effect, there are several whose implementation has been only partial, or consists of no more than promises from the Commission."
"I think this House should seriously consider a method for the monitoring and evaluation of these aspects."
"As for the recommendations which have not been followed, they share a common feature which needs to be pointed out: they are all either institutional in nature, or the obstacles preventing them from being implemented are institutional in origin."
"Among the recommendations which the Commission has not observed, I should particularly like to mention the lack of disciplinary measures for serious mistakes made by certain officials. Speaking for myself as a Member of this House, this does not mean we are taking an inquisitorial attitude about punishing such mistakes - quite the contrary."
"In any case, it is clear that not all the recommendations made by the Committee of Inquiry are equally important."
"Several of them are extremely important in a legal sense, concerning precautions about risk materials and monitoring, but have still not been implemented to any great extent."
"For example, there are still shortcomings in the use of risk materials in the pharmaceuticals industry."
"I must confess that during my time on the two committees (the Committee of Inquiry and the Temporary Committee) my attitude has changed. I used to be far more critical of the Council, whereas I am now critical of the behaviour of the Member States."
"However, the Council should be far more aggressive in forcing the Member States to comply with Community guidelines."
"It is clear - and I am just finishing - that a lot of the progress which has been made has been due to pressure from this House."
"It would therefore be a very good thing if the usual relations between Parliament and the Commission could be made completely transparent from now on."
"My political group is hopeful, and we wish we did not have to be critical, but we think that in order to resolve this contradiction, next year the Commission should honour all the promises which it has made."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Böge, both for the work he has done and also for his willingness and availability to listen to the members of our committee."
"Regarding the report of the Temporary Committee to follow up the Recommendations on BSE, our group proposed a very short motion for a resolution, of only seven paragraphs."
"It is sufficient in order to define our position and to show our determination."
"In the first place, we want to support fully the rapporteur's proposals in his conclusion regarding the need to ensure transparency within the Commission."
"In fact, throughout this affair, as we all know, the essential problem has been a desire to suppress the so-called mad cow affair in order to avoiding delays in both the completion of the single market and the process of ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, and perhaps also, regrettably, to satisfy many other shameful interests."
"Regarding the Temporary Committee to follow up the Recommendations on BSE, we can but regret that our Parliament, by refusing to give our Temporary Committee the status of a Committee of Inquiry, did not opt for a more efficient procedure."
"To put it clearly, I fear that our conclusions may not have the necessary and essential legal scope to oblige the Commission to modify its manner and its way of working."
"The third paragraph of our resolution denounces the modifications to the Amsterdam Treaty - which, may I remind you, is in the process of being ratified - regarding article 100a. The new wording gives clear priority to the single market, to the detriment of European consumers' health."
"And I would like to remind you that it is thanks to the action of the French Minister for Agriculture at the time, Mr Philippe Vasseur, that we were able to achieve the implementation of an embargo on British beef."
"In its new version, article 100a, paragraph 4, we would no longer be able to apply this method without incurring the wrath of both the Commission and the Court of Justice of the European Community."
"The fifth paragraph of our resolution specifies that we would like to know what the consequences of the development of the new CAP are, as described in Agenda 2000, as well as those of international agreements, especially agreements concluded within the framework of the COM, for the quality of agricultural and food products to be provided to consumers."
"In fact, everything is pushing European farmers in the direction of improving their productivity even if, deep down, they do not want to do so."
"They have a business to run; this business is very often the one and only source of income for them and their families."
"Finally, Mr President, I will conclude by saying that our group reserves the right to propose a motion of censure during the November 1998 part-session, that is in a year's time to the day, if the Commission does not respect the conclusions of our two reports, that of the Temporary Committee of Inquiry and that of the Temporary Committee to follow up the recommendations on BSE."
"I would like to remind you that at the beginning of this affair, our former colleague, Philippe de Villiers, had already threatened the Commission with a motion of censure."
"Some months later, you will have noted, it was lodged."
"We keep to our word; our credibility is at stake as is, of course, Mr President-in-Office, your own."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Luxembourg has always been convinced of the key role of the European Parliament in Community life and has therefore not spared its efforts, each time it takes the Presidency of the Council, to maintain an intensive and constructive dialogue with your Parliament."
"This seems to us all the more important today as the subject of debate is particularly important and sensitive."
"In my speech, I will endeavour to draw up a balance sheet, necessarily brief but at the same time as complete as possible, of the Council's deliberations with regard to the problem of BSE, particularly since the resolution you adopted on 19 February this year concluding the work of the Temporary Committee of Inquiry."
"I will also take this opportunity to reply to the various oral questions which have been put to the Council."
"In general, I believe it is appropriate to note that, beyond taking into account the legitimate economic and social concerns raised by a considerable number of those who depend on the survival of the beef industry for their living, the Council has constantly acted and continues to act, within the context of its legislative jurisdiction, by basing its action on two principles."
"Firstly, the protection of human health must be guaranteed and thus regulations must be established which enable the quality and safety of food products to be ensured."
"Secondly, all actions must be based solidly on the best and most up-to-date scientific proof."
"The Council agrees with the European Parliament and with the rapporteur, Mr Böge, in recognizing that it is by acting with transparency, clarity and responsibility that we will contribute to the restoration of the confidence of European citizens in the way our institutions function and, consequently, to the reassurance of consumers within the Union and in third party countries as to the gravity of measures taken at European level to protect their health."
"In addition to the need for legislative action with regard to the quality and safety of food products, the Council also recognizes the considerable importance of effective controls, particularly in the fight against fraud."
"Furthermore, it is clear that beyond the different veterinary and phytosanitary legislations, action in the fight against BSE must be extended to research into, and prevention of, the different forms of BSE."
"Since BSE appeared, and above all since the recent scientific discoveries which highlighted the possible link between BSE and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the Council's actions within its different fora have included all of these aspects."
"Let us start with the Agriculture Council, which adopted a series of measures in the food, veterinary and phytosanitary fields, along with regulations relating to animals."
"Amongst the principle results obtained, two decisions are worth highlighting in particular."
"Firstly, the adoption by the Council of the regulation on the system of identification and registration of bovine animals, and on the system of labelling of beef and beef products which will ensure, in particular, the traceability of beef products and thus a very efficient control mechanism."
"Secondly, the decision adopted by the Commission last July following the Council deliberations, which aims to ban the use of specified risk material, particularly in human and animal foodstuffs."
"The principle of precaution played a determinant role in this decision."
"Furthermore, and without claiming to be exhaustive, I would like to remind you of the different measures such as the ban on hormones and hormone derivatives in livestock farming, the certification of animals and animal products, the protection of calves and sanitary policing of intra-Community trade in cattle."
"By adopting these different legislative acts, the Council has largely heeded the European Parliament's position."
"With regard to the embargo on exports of British beef, you are aware of all the decisions taken by the Florence European Council."
"Within the Agriculture Council we are regularly informed of the development of the situation and the work relating to the British certified herd scheme."
"The time has not yet come for the Council to give an opinion on a possible relaxation of this embargo."
"We will do so when the Commission considers the conditions are right and when it provides us with a clear proposal."
"On this subject, I can confirm that the decisions taken by the Florence European Council regarding the criteria to be used and the procedures to be followed will be fully respected."
"The question of controls, and above all the flaws that recent fraud cases have highlighted, is a serious subject of concern for public opinion, for the European Parliament and also for the Agriculture Ministers who are looking into this question under my presidency."
"Of course, we all know that it would be illusory to hope for the total eradication of a criminal activity whose suppression is the responsibility, primarily, of the judicial authorities."
"However, the Agriculture Ministers were unanimous in confirming their firm will to do everything possible, both at national and Community level, to fight fraud energetically."
"That is why, apart from adopting stricter national measures, we have given our full support to the Commission in its desire to strengthen the existing control mechanism."
"With regard to hormones, the Council fully supports the Commission's action within the framework of the WTO, for we consider that the Community has the right to set the level of protection of human health that it judges appropriate and consequently, to ban the use of substances considered dangerous for human health."
"In the field of research, an important result for the improvement of the cooperation and coordination of research into BSE has been obtained with the common decision of the Council and the European Parliament regarding the report of the expert, Professor Weissmann, which aims to allocate a further ECU 35 million to research into transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, vaccines and viral diseases within the context of the fourth framework programme for research and development."
"This decision brings to ECU 50 million the funds allocated to research."
"With regard to the Health Council, I will limit myself to reminding you that its conclusions on the question of BSE highlight the need to give the highest priority to the protection of public health and to take all appropriate measures to eliminate the risk of the transmission of BSE."
"The Health Council agreed to continue detailed listings of cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and to collect together and analyze all the statistics at a European level."
"It will make sure that the cases of BSE are reported in the appropriate manner."
"Furthermore, it intends to return to all of these questions during its meeting on 4 December this year."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we heard of the Commission's communication regarding consumer health and food safety with the greatest of interest, as well as the Green Paper on the general principles of Community legislation."
"The Luxembourg Presidency has clearly stated, in its action plan, that it would give food safety a high level of importance."
"That is why it asked the Council to participate fully in the debate on the Commission's documents."
"Before the end of the year, they will have been examined by the ministers in charge of agriculture, the internal market, consumers and health."
"The ministers responsible for agriculture and consumers have already begun to study them and in particular have recognized that the protection of human health and research at the highest possible level into the safety of foodstuffs should remain the top priorities of European legislation."
"Mr President, the mad cow crisis is an event which deeply marks not only public opinion but also ourselves as decision-makers and which can raise questions concerning convictions and behaviour."
"If there is one lesson we can and must learn from this crisis, it is that there can be no effective protection of human health or development of lasting agriculture without permanent research into the harmonious integration of agricultural activity and nature."
"Restricting and damaging the latter is inevitably the same as endangering agriculture itself."
"This realization, which is being increasingly confirmed every day, is inspiring the deliberations of the Ministers of Agriculture on Agenda 2000."
"Today or tomorrow, we will have to adopt common directions regarding the future of the CAP."
"In this context, we intend to confirm and defend a European agricultural identity for the future which will, in particular, be in a position to take care of the countryside, to support the natural spaces and, above all, to respond to the concerns and demands of the consumer with regard to food safety and quality, environmental protection and the defence of animal welfare."
"Our objective is to ensure lasting agricultural production processes and the production of reliable, healthy food products."
"By confirming this European agricultural identity, which it hopes to consolidate and develop through the reforms to be undertaken, the Council also wants to send a clear and unequivocal message to countries which are candidates for membership of the European Union regarding the directions their agricultural policy should be taking in order to facilitate membership."
"The Council furthermore wanted to underline the need, within the perspective of future multilateral WTO negotiations, to adopt an offensive strategy intended to protect Europe's chances of developing an agricultural sector which meets these extremely high quality and safety standards."
"Finally, Mr President, and to reply to the oral questions raised by the different political groups, you will understand that it is not possible to take a position today on the conclusions of the report of the Temporary Committee to follow up the recommendations on BSE as, due to lack of time, it has not been possible for the Council to study this report."
"I note, in general, that the European Parliament and the Commission have carried out excellent work and that the Council largely took account of the European Parliament's position in the context of its deliberations devoted to the Commission's proposals following your recommendations of February this year."
"I have no reason to doubt that the case will be the same for the proposals that the Commission will present following your conclusions of today."
"Personally, I have taken note of the recommendations made by honourable Members of Parliament within the context of the inquiry into BSE and I will take note of the observations that you will make during the course of today's debate."
"I shall not fail to draw the Council's attention to the recommendations and conclusions of your debate."
"Before finishing, I would like to touch on two aspects relevant to the relations between the Parliament and the Council."
"At the end of the work of the Committee of Inquiry into BSE, your Parliament had demanded a strengthening of its powers, particularly regarding agricultural policy which affects or which could affect health protection and food quality."
"Important progress has also been made in this area, and you have highlighted this."
"The Amsterdam Treaty has, in fact, considerably modified the legislative role of the European Parliament, including in this sector which is particularly close to your hearts."
"Thus article 129 has been modified to take account of your requests."
"In particular, the codecision procedure is anticipated, notwithstanding article 43, in the adoption of veterinary and phytosanitary measures with the direct objective of public health protection."
"The Luxembourg Presidency is extremely happy with this development, which it judges to be very positive."
"We are convinced that it will contribute to the even greater improvement and development of Community legislation relating to the protection of human health."
"Regarding the participation of the Council and Member States in the work of the Committee of Inquiry into BSE and the concerns expressed on the subject of cooperation between Member States governments', I would like to emphasize that the Council and the Member States have made great efforts to contribute to the work of this Committee of Inquiry."
"As far as the Council is concerned, let me remind you that it provided all the information required of it by the Committee of Inquiry with regard to its deliberations on the subject of BSE."
"What is more, Mr Yates, President-in-Office of the Council, replied positively to the Committee of Inquiry's invitation and personally participated in its work, providing extremely complete and detailed information on the approach followed and the measures adopted in the past by the Council."
"I myself addressed the Temporary Committee to follow up the Recommendations on BSE to inform them of the package of measures adopted since February 1997."
"In addition, in compliance with article 3 of the interinstitutional decision of 19 April 1995, the Council appointed a senior civil servant from its secretariat with authority to appear before the Committee of Inquiry."
"Furthermore, I would point out that it is not for the Council to give an opinion on the follow-up given by Member States to the invitations of a Committee of Inquiry in compliance with article 3, paragraph 2, of the decision of 19 April 1995."
"I would like to remind you that the interinstitutional decision of 1995 expressly anticipates the possibility of a revision to take into account experience gained."
"This possibility is defined in article 6 of the aforementioned decision."
"On the occasion of my appearance before the Temporary Committee to follow up the Recommendations on BSE, I believed I understood that the Members of Parliament wished to bring up this issue within the framework of the trialogue."
"I have already informed the chairman of the General Affairs Council of this wish, which I personally consider to be a possible way of clarifying this question and of improving understanding between the institutions."
"Mr President, the debate today once more brings out clearly the fact that in the areas of public health and food safety, the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council have shared responsibilities and common duties."
"It is therefore a question of uniting efforts and forces and of cooperating closely in this sphere."
"I repeat the desire of the Council to encourage this cooperation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you will be giving your opinion, during this sitting, on the report of the Temporary Committee to follow up the Recommendations on BSE."
"Nearly ten months ago to the day have passed since I came to Parliament to participate in the debate on the report of the Committee of Inquiry into BSE."
"On that occasion, on 18 February, I shared with you the concrete conclusions that the Commission had already drawn from this major study."
"We have acted without delay in order to rectify the weaknesses noted in the report."
"Thus you will recall that the Commission decided, as from February, that an unprecedented restructuring of its department in charge of public health should take place."
"This restructuring is not a simple administrative operation, but it corresponds well to the birth of a new political idea."
"At Community level, all the players are now aware that the protection of health and food safety must figure amongst the highest of our priorities."
"The Commission has put them at the heart of its programme of work for 1998. And the Council has organized debates within four different fora."
"On this occasion I would like to pay tribute in particular to the members of the Temporary Committee, especially its chairperson, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, and its rapporteur, Mr Böge."
"An immense amount of work has been accomplished and an intense cooperation has taken place between the Temporary Committee and the departments of the Commission."
"The results have been extremely fruitful and I am convinced that the mutually beneficial relations which have developed in response to this difficult issue have contributed significantly to the enhancement of dialogue between our two institutions."
"Mr President, Mr Böge's report, which is now submitted to you, is an indication of the work accomplished during these last months."
"It is for you to measure the progress achieved."
"As President of the Commission, however, I can but rejoice to note that an ambitious and fundamentally necessary objective has been achieved."
"Anyone who has read the report can but note that the Commission has achieved virtually all of more than 70 recommendations and is committed to respecting precise deadlines for the implementation of those that the brief period of time given has not enabled it to accomplish."
"I will not go into details regarding all of the measures that have been taken or are anticipated by the Commission."
"They are numerous."
"They are given in detail in the final report on the implementation of the recommendations on BSE which the Commission adopted on 8 October last."
"They are influenced by a completely innovative and essential desire for transparency in order to reestablish citizen and consumer confidence. For consumers wish to be informed, to understand and to choose knowledgeably."
"Mr President, more than 20 people have been victim to the new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease."
"Their families deserve our solidarity."
"The Commission has decided to back the concrete support that your Parliament has agreed to give them."
"We are confronted by immense expectations from our citizens."
"Their fears relate not only to BSE, but also to other questions to which we must give clear responses."
"On the basis of the Commission's new approach, in-depth work has been carried out by the departments concerned in the areas of consumer health and food safety, with the aim of improving our capacity for action."
"Let me give you the most outstanding examples."
"We have undertaken an in-depth overhaul of the system of scientific advisory committees, governed by the principle of transparency, independence and excellence."
"Legislative measures to fight against BSE and the new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease have been adopted."
"Methods for monitoring respect of BSE legislation have been strengthened."
"A good number of infringement procedures have been initiated following the inspection missions in Member States."
"We have gone in a number of directions in order to ensure better effectiveness of control systems."
"In this respect, I am committed to the fact that the proposals should be drawn up before February 1998."
"The research programmes of the Commission give a predominant place to research into transmissible spongiform encephalopathies."
"Two large conferences have been jointly organized with you, the conference on meat-and-bone meals, and the conference on food laws."
"Their results will be translated into concrete initiatives. Some measures have already been taken."
"Thus we proposed the inclusion of agricultural raw materials in the directive governing liability for products."
"The Agenda 2000 proposals contain important reforms of the common agricultural policy which move in the direction of an agriculture which is more respectful of human health and of the environment."
"Mr President, we are today at the end of a first stage."
"We are here to draw up a balance sheet and to talk about the future."
"You are expecting the Commission to share its future intentions with you regarding the recommendations of the report of the Temporary Committee on BSE and, in particular, regarding those which, in the opinion of the Temporary Committee, have not been implemented or have been implemented insufficiently."
"Your Temporary Committee has identified five specific recommendations which it considers have not been implemented."
"Five out of more than seventy."
"I would now like to concentrate on each one of these."
"The Commission has not adopted measures to make, and I quote, ""the authorities which have allowed the disease to appear and spread responsible for the financial costs of BSE' ."
"In fact, I hope you will understand the reasons for not adopting such measures."
"The crisis has led the Commission, as well as the Council, to take a series of legislative measures involving financial support to the eradication of BSE and to the economic consequences of BSE for the producers."
"At the Florence European Council, solidarity was emphasized by the Heads of State and of Government."
"This solidarity must remain intact, in particular when we are faced with major and complex crises."
"Should we now initiate a financial exercise, independent of all consideration with regard to the legal capacity of the Commission, in order to attribute these charges to those responsible?"
"How possible is it to name those presumed responsible?"
"The exercise would not match up to the objective of solidarity that characterizes our Community, a solidarity which was furthermore underlined by the European Council of Florence in its conclusions."
"I come, in this context, to another recommendation of the Committee of Inquiry."
"This concluded that it was necessary for the Commission to bring immediately administrative proceedings against the United Kingdom for repayment of all sums allocated for the purposes of eradicating BSE."
"This administrative action can only relate to control of the correct implementation of legislative decisions taken by the Council."
"Consequently, within the context of the audit of the EAGGF accounts, the Commission will not fail to draw the financial consequences if the United Kingdom has not respected the Community regulations at issue, in accordance furthermore with the rules applying to all Member States."
"It will do this with regard to controls on implementation of programmes to eradicate the disease."
"This brings me to a slightly different subject."
"What has happened to the financial sanctioning of companies who participated in the illegal trafficking of British beef?"
"Let me remind you that the Member States are responsible for the notification of any company which has committed irregularities to the detriment of the Community budget."
"In this case, most of the fraudulent transactions in British beef were destined for third party countries and have benefitted from the restoration of exports."
"In September, we asked for reactions from Member States concerning companies having, to the knowledge of the Commission departments, participated in this traffic and we will draw the consequences of this."
"I now come to another question."
"Parliament has asked the Commission to institute proceedings in the European Court of Justice on account of the failure of Mr Hogg, UK Minister of Agriculture, to appear before the Committee of Inquiry on the basis of the interinstitutional decision of 19 April 1995."
"The Commission, as you know, did not do this."
"Legally, according to our interpretation, such a recourse would have no chance of success. But we are agreed with you in theory."
"To make our support of your request more concrete, I wrote to your President on 5 November indicating that the Commission fully supported your demand for obligatory appearance by government members of Member States before Committees of Inquiry of the European Parliament, following the example of members of the Commission, and that the interinstitutional decision of 1995 should be revised to take account of this."
"It seems to me that this is a matter, if not of a legal obligation, then at least of a political one."
"Furthermore, I must note that relations between the Council and Parliament seem to have improved."
"Thus, the British Minister for Agriculture, Mr Cunningham, has appeared before your committee, and today, I am pleased to note the presence here of the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Fernand Boden."
"This was not the case, you will recall, on 18 February."
"We now come to the functioning of the Commission's departments."
"The Committee of Inquiry recommended individual disciplinary measures against Commission civil servants."
"I would like to start by saying that since 1995 this Commission has been involved in an exercise of reform and global modernization of its administration."
"In this respect I would particularly refer you to the SEM 2000 and MAP 2000 programmes."
"Furthermore, the College will adopt, this very afternoon, here in Strasbourg, a new and important document regarding good and sound administrative and financial management."
"In this document, the different possibilities for improving its ways of working are analyzed as far as professional shortcomings, financial irregularities, fraud and corruption are concerned."
"Also, within this context the Commission anticipates the possibility of modifying its status."
"More directly concerning the departments responsible for the fight against BSE, as I have already mentioned, we have completely restructured these departments."
"This measure was necessary because the handling of the BSE affair had revealed a certain number of gaps and structural shortcomings."
"With regard to possible disciplinary measures against individual staff members, after carefully examining the situation - and as you know I never refuse to accept disciplinary measures - the Commission came to the conclusion that there were not sufficient grounds for commencing disciplinary procedures, even if certain misjudgements were clearly made."
"I would also like to emphasize that the work of our staff was certainly not facilitated by the existence of an inadequate system and by the extremely complex nature of the issue."
"I would lastly like to mention the recommendation of the Committee of Inquiry regarding the possibility of a motion of censure being brought against individual members of the Commission."
"My reply will hardly surprise you. We have, furthermore, pointed this out to the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The Commission would not want to abandon the essential principle of collective responsibility. It is the guarantee of the independent exercise of the Commissions' responsibilities in the general interest."
"Any sanction of the Commission, just like its responsibilities, could only be collective and collegiate."
"Furthermore, the Intergovernmental Conference shared the Commission's point of view on this."
"Mr President, together we have come a long way."
"The work of the Temporary Committee is now finished."
"I would like to reiterate the Commission's full commitment to continuing the fruitful cooperation which this work has given rise to."
"We will continue this cooperation within the context of the work of the permanent committees of Parliament."
"With regard to this, I am also happy that the codecision procedure will from now on be applied to veterinary and phytosanitary questions, with the objective of protecting public health."
"A great deal has already been achieved."
"We have laid new foundations, healthy new foundations, and the real work starts now."
"The Commission will present, twice per year, a report of activities regarding BSE to the European Parliament and to the Council."
"We have additionally arranged a meeting with you for the end of 1998."
"A big conference on consumer health, organized jointly with you, which will give us the opportunity to measure the distance covered together and I am confident, along with the Council and Member States, for we firmly believe that only a close collaboration between the three institutions and the Council will succeed in restoring citizen and consumer confidence beyond the crucial question of protection of health."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, thank you! What you have said today agrees to a large extent with what we have said, and I think it is unnecessary today to discuss differences between you and us or between you and the committee."
"I will only make one short remark about what you said: the fact that Mr Cunningham, as British Minister for Agriculture, and Mr Boden, as President of the Council, appeared before the committee is not something I would call remarkable, however pleasant it was."
"It should be taken for granted - excuse me, Mr President of the Commission - that ministers appear before a parliamentary body."
"At this point, I would like to pass on immediately, and turn to the Council, because I have been able to negotiate with the Commission often enough in the last few months, and I make it clear that I am no longer speaking as chairperson of the committee, but on behalf of my group, the Party of European Socialists."
"Mr Boden, I listened to you carefully, and I am convinced that you mean what you say."
"The only problem is that you are one minister for agriculture out of 15, and I am not sure that with all your goodwill you will find a majority in the Council."
"I listened to you when you said that until now the Council has had no time to discuss many questions which were dealt with, for instance, in our oral questions."
"This amazed me somewhat, because we have said nothing in the Temporary Committee that we had not said before in the Committee of Inquiry, and I would have expected that the Council, at each of its meetings, whether started by you or another President of the Council, would have as the first item on its agenda: BSE, the fight, consequences and what we have done wrong!"
"I do not hear you asking - and I am now saying this to you as a representative, I am sorry, Mr Boden - I do not hear you asking: what have we done wrong?"
"You say that consumer and health protection must be considered, fine."
"Why do not you say that we have neglected consumer and health protection, and now we want to consider it?"
"That would be the correct formulation, Mr Boden."
"I say again that this is said to you as the representative of the whole Agriculture Council, because you are now its President, and I would much rather say it to the German Minister of Agriculture, for instance, or other ministers of agriculture."
"For instance, why do I still have the feeling that those with responsibility have understood nothing?"
"Mr Boden, you said that the labelling of beef products is now new grounds for creating trust."
"If that is so, and if you really seriously mean to create trust in this way - and I hope you mean it seriously, but I do not believe the other ministers do - if that is so, why could not you agree to the change of the legal basis, which Parliament and the Commission decided on together?"
"Why did you have to depart from that and again choose the soft formulation of article 43, which gives you the most power, which offers you a free ticket?"
"Why, Mr Boden?"
"Just tell me."
"Tell me also why I still have the feeling that the crow syndrome rules in the Council."
"One crow does not peck the other's eyes out."
"You said that people must be protected, including people who make their living from cattle."
"I can understand that farmers must be protected, but I can also understand that the vast majority of the people of the European Union must be protected, and they are many more than the farmers!"
"You failed to do that in the Agriculture Council."
"Why was it that the meat market and support for the market used to be more important than protection of health, and why should we believe that this has changed?"
"Can you tell us?"
"For instance, when Mr Santer's Commission made a modest attempt in Agenda 2000 to decide on a change to agricultural prices, and to change the subsidy scheme, for instance, why did not you agree and rejoice about it?"
"Why have I heard bleating and moaning and great fear from every minister for agriculture?"
"We all know that the basic evil of what we are now experiencing, BSE and much more, including crime, lies in this subsidy scheme."
"Why did not it come from you, why did not you say: we must make a clean break and change everything, we as ministers of agriculture will show that we have understood something."
"Mr Boden, I am sorry that I must say that so sharply."
"The Commission certainly has understood something."
"How much it has understood we shall soon see."
"I do not think the Agriculture Council has understood anything, or that the ministers of agriculture, except yourself, have understood anything, and we should monitor them all the more closely!"
"Mr President, in the interests of transparency can I declare an interest in that I am a beef farmer."
"Few people in this Parliament will have any appreciation of the enormous amount of material that this temporary committee has looked at in detail over the last few months and great praise must be given to rapporteur Böge and the chairman for the way in which they have handled it."
"The close scrutiny of commissioners, veterinary officers, scientists, ministry officials and many others who gave evidence has quite clearly shown that in the early days of this dreadful BSE epidemic there were mistakes at all levels, both at Commission and European level."
"I stress European because, although the bulk of this problem has hit the United Kingdom, there is no doubt that there have been problems in other European countries."
"It is a pity that we did not have a uniform European standard policy towards BSE from the start."
"With the tonnages of contaminated material which were exported to mainland Europe from the United Kingdom, it was quite obvious that a few cases would appear."
"I am delighted, Mr President, that Commissioner Fischler has taken a strong stance to create a European policy and get the same high standards in other European countries that we have been bound by in the United Kingdom."
"Nor should we forget the huge knock-on costs to other industries such as transporters, renderers, slaughterhouses, which are now crippled by a devastatingly low market for beef animals and beef products."
"That is looking back."
"To look forward it is quite obvious from the statistics that, having had a peak of 37, 000 cases three years ago and only 3, 000 cases this year in the United Kingdom, the efforts of the last government and the present one have had a dramatic effect on the reduction of this disease."
"But British hill farmers are being devastated and we must as soon as possible bring in a certified herds scheme, whereby farms can be declared clear and then, by a process of tagging and identification, make sure that meat can be traced from the animal to the butcher's shop."
"Mr President, can I support both the report from Mr Böge and the resolution."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, as a member both of the Committee of Inquiry and of the Temporary Committee to follow up the recommendations on BSE, I would particularly like to congratulate Mr Böge for all the work he has accomplished."
"Mr President, unfortunately the fact that we are today bringing the work of the Temporary Committee to follow up the Recommendations on BSE to a close does not mean we are going to stop talking about the so-called mad cow affair."
"In fact, Mr President, I would like to underline the importance of information and transparency."
"Throughout our work we have noted that for a long time everything possible has been done to get the issue forgotten, or rather to stifle it."
"The European institutions will not remain credible unless transparency is the rule."
"The European Parliament must remain vigilant on this point, for not only is the mad cow affair not finished, but there is nothing to say that other problems of a similar nature will not present themselves as well, be it hormones, GMOs or any other badly controlled new technology."
"I must explain, Mr President, that I am of course not against technological developments, but the citizens of the Member States of the European Union must have confidence in these developments."
"They will have this guarantee if they know that there is real transparency at the level of decision-making."
"Both from the point of view of this report and of the development of the Commission structures, I note with satisfaction the creation and development of DG XXIV, under Mrs Bonino's responsibility."
"However, I would like to draw your attention to the need to preserve a balance between the different Directorates-General."
"Let us take care that we are not robbing Peter to pay Paul; I am thinking particularly of DG VI."
"I would like to remind you that its mission is important and vast. We must preserve the necessary means to enable it to fulfil its task."
"In conclusion, Mr President, I would like to remind you that I was one of the signatories to the motion of censure which was rejected by this House, and emphasize that, in this capacity, I will remain particularly vigilant with regard to this affair and with regard to the way in which the Commission implements my recommendation."
"If I see that the issue is being buried, I will know how to jog your memory when the time comes."
"Mr President, I also would like to agree with those, who are congratulating the members of the Temporary Committee to follow up the Recommendations on BSE, the chairman, the rapporteurs, and the members, on the work they have done."
"It is a good example of how this Parliament works and how things should be done in an Committee of Inquiry."
"Thankfully the European Commission has acted upon most recommendations, and that means that as far as we are concerned, the sting has been taken out of the debate."
"We are pleased with the fact that every six months the Commission will be reporting on the state of this dossier."
"This will mean that we will be able to look into the situation regarding the quality of our food."
"We think that is extremely important."
"We also think it is important for the Commission to raise in international fora, because I find it increasingly difficult to explain to European farmers what they are or are not allowed to do for this or that reason, while this does not apply to farmers outside Europe."
"Agreement on these issues needs to be reached in an international framework."
"Regarding the appearance of ministers before committees of inquiry, I understood from Mr Santer that it is legally impossible to force ministers to do so."
"I think that all possible resources must be used politically to do just that."
"It is unacceptable that a certain parliament ratifies a Maastricht Treaty that makes this type of committee of inquiry possible, and that same parliament then endorses certain ministers not appearing."
"To my mind that logic is unacceptable."
"One of the issues which needs to be resolved as soon as possible is the extent to which animal meal can be used in animal feed."
"I assume that sick animals cannot be used, but what can be done with other animal meal?"
"That needs to be sorted out as soon as possible."
"One last point."
"Participation by Members of this Parliament as observers at scientific committees is a good thing, because openness is good."
"Nonetheless, I favour a separation of powers."
"Parliament can never take responsibility for the decisions of these committees before they are made."
"There is no doubt that first the Committee of Inquiry into BSE and then the Temporary Committee to follow up the Recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry demonstrated serious shortcomings in the assessment of risk, control and application of the Community regulations both by the Member States and by the Commission."
"The European Parliament chose the conditional motion of no-confidence as a means of creating a new relationship of cooperation between the European Parliament and the Commission; in some ways, this choice has borne fruit, as indicated in previous speeches."
"However, many problems still remain unresolved and the speeches made by the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission do not seem to have dispelled all doubts."
"For this reason, the Green Group intends to strongly oppose the need to satisfy all those requirements pointed out by the two Committees on BSE, to ensure consumer protection and to protect the health of the citizens and the animals reared."
"I would now like to touch briefly on several aspects requiring further commitment and further cooperation between the Member States and all the institutions of the European Union: the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"First of all, we should recall that other cases of this disease will occur owing to negligence and omissions in the policy of combatting BSE and we should be prepared to intervene in these cases, avoiding a repetition of what happened in Belgium, where an infected animal carcass was converted into animal meal."
"Just as there will be further cases of BSE, there will also be further cases of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob variant, which is now at the incubation stage, because the scientific connection between the pathogenic agent of BSE and the new Creutzfeldt-Jakob variant has unfortunately been established."
"We therefore need to adapt our monitoring and actions to the safety and screening of citizens."
"With regard to what President Santer said, we also need the means to make a financial contribution in solidarity with families affected and to provide compensation for the sick and their relatives, with the involvement of the Member States as well."
"Drawing the necessary conclusions from all of this, we can say that we need to establish a new policy of controls right down the line, from company to table, and to apply the principle of precaution adequately."
"From this point of view, we need to remember that the BSE affair is symbolic and should serve to improve the entire consumer protection policy and lead to a system of farming that is compatible with the environment."
"We will soon have to deal with new problems: revision of food legislation, on which a Green Paper has been drawn up but leaves room for serious doubt, particularly with regard to the policy on hormones, antibiotics in animal feeds, novel foods, the introduction of genetically modified organisms into foods and the future of veterinary salmonella."
"For all these reasons, we hope that this year, with the half-yearly reports from the Commission and joint monitoring body, the various institutions of the European Union will find adequate answers that satisfy the requirements of the consumers and citizens of the Union."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Party of the European Radical Alliance, I would like to express my simultaneous satisfaction and disappointment at the situation and the way the BSE question has been handled: first my satisfaction, as an MEP, at the very important role played by Parliament in dealing with this issue and stimulating the Commission; and my satisfaction at seeing how the Commission has in many ways responded to the legitimate expectations of this Parliament, which is also an expression of European public opinion, by curbing the risks of the mad cow affair, carrying out inspections and not repeating the mistakes of the past."
"But I am also disappointed to see that not all our recommendations have been followed by the Commission, which has perhaps been too timid, President Santer, with regard to the accompanying measures, the reorganization has been good, the work carried out so far has been very good, particularly that of the Commissioner responsible for this sector and by the Commission as a whole, but in my opinion it is a pity not to have had the courage to go right to the end, as Parliament requested, both internally and with regard to measures against the state which, I have to say, was at the origin of this crisis."
"I am also disappointed with those MEPs who relied on slaughter and called for a mass cull, thereby giving us and the Commission an inappropriate image."
"It is just as well that those threats were not followed up and that the proposed censure motion did not materialize;"
"Parliament will vote seriously on a critical wording but naturally cannot fail to recognize that a lot of good work has already been done."
"Mr President, I also wish to join with those who have congratulated the chairman of the committee and the rapporteur on doing a very fine job."
"I certainly welcome this report as a basis of ensuring that we are never again faced with such a serious or difficult problem as BSE has been to us."
"Beef farmers in the United Kingdom have had to bear the maximum pain because of the short cuts taken by the meat and bonemeal industry."
"We must learn from our mistakes of the past and ensure that they never again occur."
"Yes, we need transparency and greater openness, and we must restore to consumers confidence that the food they buy in the shops is of the highest possible standard."
"We must now look to the future."
"I welcome the present approach of Mr Cunningham, because since he came to office he has certainly transformed the relationship between the Temporary Committee and the UK Government."
"I was pleased that the report was able to avoid some of the more extreme views held by a minority of people."
"As I say, we must now move on."
"I also believe we must end the witch-hunt that has existed against Commission officials and, indeed, to a large extent, against the United Kingdom Government."
"It is important to build confidence and return to the highest standards in production of all of our food and ensure that the food imported into the European Union is of the same high standards as that produced by farmers within the European Union."
"In future we must base our decisions on totally scientific facts and not hyped-up misinformation put forward by the media and the press."
"I wish to congratulate the Commission on the positive way it is facing up to the recommendations made to it by the Temporary Committee and I would like to put on record my tribute to both Commissioners Fischler and Bonino and their staff for the help, assistance and the responsible way in which they have approached this problem and for the way in which they have faced up to their responsibilities."
"I would like to say, as I come from Northern Ireland where our beef farmers have suffered greatly from the export ban on UK beef, that I hope that both the Commission and the Council will face up to their responsibilities."
"I hope that when the Florence commitments are achieved, as I believe they have been achieved in Northern Ireland, the ban will be lifted immediately, and there will be no foot-dragging or drawing back and that the increasing demands we are making will be met."
"I look forward to that."
"I wish you well in the future."
"I hope that we never again have to return in this House, on any similar occasion or at any similar time, to such a problem."
"Mr President, Mr Böge has presented us with a report from the Temporary Committee to follow up the Recommendations on BSE, which has amazed all of us."
"Cows continue to die in Belgium, France and Great Britain, but everything is fine."
"Even if this includes cows born since the banning of meat-and-bone meal, and even if one Belgian cow finds its way into 1200 tonnes of meal, it is not serious!"
"There are 21 official cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease."
"As long as all this does not affect the Commission, it does not matter."
"Scientific proof of transmission from animals to human beings is presented, and that is not worrying."
"Meat-and-bone meal continues to circulate, to be produced, to be consumed. What is needed is transparency!"
"In the name of transparency, Mrs Green removed the non-aligned and the European Radical Alliance MEPs from the Committee - 10 million voters do not have the right to transparency: they can die!"
"So in exchange the Commission has offered us a few crumbs about internal reorganization, the ruling on the withdrawal of specified risk materials from the food chain, a small crumb of ECU 50 million for research, a slight improvement in the treatment of animal waste meals, but the most important thing has not been done, Mr President, Mr Commissioner. There have been no disciplinary measures against those responsible for serious errors."
"Mr Hoelgaard, from Denmark, has been promoted to director of vegetable products so, after poisoning the animals, he is now in charge of the vegetables. Mr Meldrum has been pensioned off, that is the only punishment, and nothing at all has happened to Mr Marchant."
"And as for that wheeler-dealer McSharry, he is clearly doing alright."
"Neither the responsibility of the British government, nor of the De Mulder brothers has been considered. The British government has not apologized, if not for this crime against the bovine species, and I do not know whether it is indictable or not, then for the crime against the human victims, because seeing your herds destroyed is no negligible psychological tragedy for the breeders, nor for the crime against the taxpayers, if you believe Mr Tillich who, in his general report on the 1998 budget clearly told us the costs of these measures: ECU 2.2 billion in 1997, and a billion more indirectly."
"I thought the European Commission was supposed to defend the financial interests of the European Union."
"Furthermore, there remain discrepancies. It is true that carcasses continue to be processed as meat-and-bone meal for non-ruminants, specified risk materials which are banned in the European Union are nevertheless being imported from the United States of America, such as hormone-treated meat."
"The cows will probably be labelled, but in the year 2000!"
"For two years, no labels, no controls at Dover, no controls on the embargo!"
"But worse still, Northern Ireland - the last British colony along with Gibraltar, now that Hong Kong has disappeared - has become a Trojan ""cow' ."
"This is a little of what has essentially been done - smoke screens, technical smoke devices."
"It is true, Mr President of the Commission, that the only effective measure would have been the banning of free movement, but to tell you that is the only effective measure would be to strike at the heart of European construction!"
"Mr President, I would like to say a few words on how I feel at this stage in the debate."
"First, I want to underline that what we have been doing together over the last six months is part of a process which is not yet completed, it is simply one stage of a process which must be followed."
"It is clear that we could not sort everything out in six months."
"This is why we have told you about a whole series of measures to be taken in a given period of time."
"It must be clear to us, between ourselves."
"We are at an important stage, not the final point."
"It is not a question of now relaxing the pressure or putting an end to reciprocal controls, to dialogue between Parliament and the Commission."
"The contact will probably no longer be through the Temporary Committee, but I think that we must at least continue to inform and involve the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, as we have done over the last six months."
"Thus, ladies and gentlemen, the issue must not be reduced to the two reports and the conference to be organized at the end of 1998 for this debate to be fuelled; relations of a permanent nature must be continued with the Committee responsible for consumer protection."
"Furthermore, I think that this period has shown us that in such difficult situations there are no ready made answers, things are not always clear."
"We, too, would like it to be that way, for then everything would be clearer for us."
"But unfortunately that is not how things are."
"Virtually every day, every week, science is making new discoveries on this very subject."
"And we have experienced this together, drawing up legislative proposals only to have to change them in the light of scientific advice which has moved in an opposite direction."
"So that is where we are, that is what has been done in a dynamic process."
"In such a complex context, I think a positive factor has been the cooperation between the Commission and Parliament over the last six months, which has demonstrated that it is possible to make progress, admittedly not always peaceful, sometimes in a climate of confrontation, but in a spirit of dialogue which is the most suited to helping us."
"As far as we are concerned, we think we will soon be able to complete the structure responsible for control."
"The scientific advisors are already in place; the scientific committee has its procedure, which everyone knows."
"As regards the control structure, we think that it will be operational by the end of 1998, with around one hundred inspectors."
"There is a third factor I would like to emphasize here."
"Everyone is very pleased with the separation we have been able to establish between the legislative powers and the control structure;"
"I would however like to point out to you that this is not the methodology followed by the majority of Member States."
"This is therefore another very complex aspect of a situation in which legislation, controls and scientific advice are separate at Community level but not at national level."
"This leads us to feel that more efforts must be made to strengthen dialogue between Member States and to encourage them to improve their way of doing things as well, given that primary responsibility for control will continue to fall to Member States."
"We will perhaps have the opportunity of talking about all of these factors by the end of the debate, and we will see that these are the three factors which - it seems to me - are the most obvious in this affair."
"This issue is not black and white, it unfortunately also contains a lot of grey and a lot of grey matter and that should encourage us to observe the principle of caution, whilst obviously taking into account the fact that even this principle has aspects that would be interesting to analyze in depth."
"I would like to thank all those who have joined in the debate."
"I am sure that the Council will be more cooperative from now on."
"In any case, we can always hope."
"The reception is different, of that there is no doubt."
"Thank you for your presence here today."
"We felt more isolated a few months ago."
"Like the President, I would like to emphasize that this fact alone is proof that you wish to rise to your responsibilities."
"That is all I can say to you at this stage, although I would like to leave time to answer any further questions a little later on perhaps."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to restrict myself to a few aspects of the Böge report for which I am directly responsible."
"First, food safety and quality, and at the same time improving the competitiveness of European agricultural products."
"As you know, these are primary aims and leitmotifs of the agricultural part of Agenda 2000."
"I therefore welcome the clear, relevant conclusions in the report, and I am grateful for the support of the European Parliament for introducing social and environmental support criteria into the future formation of the common agricultural policy, as I proposed in Agenda 2000."
"However, we shall have to do a lot of work together to convince the Member States."
"I also welcome the desire for locally adapted measures, and the demand for regional or local consideration of the optimum specific degree of intensiveness."
"I consider this demand to be much more reasonable, and I am grateful for the further development of this position by this Chamber."
"To this extent, increasing the flexibility of Order 20/78 is a logical consequence."
"I am very sympathetic to the idea of linking compensation payments to a code of good agricultural practice in the sense of sustainable farming husbandry."
"I hope that the President-in-Office will be able to back me this afternoon when the Council of Agriculture Ministers will define its attitude to Agenda 2000."
"However, I see a certain contradiction to the demand of the European Parliament, as listed further up, for an increase in cultivated areas and encouragement of extensive agriculture."
"But we shall certainly go more deeply into this point as the occasion arises in Parliament's Committee on Agriculture."
"As you know, the Commission has appealed against the WTO panel on hormone meat."
"There is no divergence here."
"However, it seems important to me that you should use your parliamentary contacts, particularly to the USA, to make clear to our trading partners that we will not give way on the hormone question."
"Now let me go into some points of the report."
"The aim of ensuring high standards for the protection of the health of consumers must be achieved through legislation, but also through implementation and monitoring by the Member States and implementation on site."
"We shall therefore have to continue checking systematically whether our legislation meets this requirement, and where revision and adjustment are required, they must be carried out."
"Additionally, we shall use the updates of existing legislation, which take place regularly to adjust to technological novelties, as an opportunity to carry out a thorough check on these regulations."
"We must be clear that we are facing a work programme which, as my colleague Emma Bonino has said, is a continuous process to be dealt with on a permanent basis, and its effectiveness also depends on the available resources."
"As the first point of this programme, my departments are working on an improvement of the Community system of controls in the veterinary field."
"Another field in which there are several unanswered questions is the use of animal and bone meal to feed animals."
"The Commission is following the only possible path by basing its policy on the principles of safe sourcing, safe processing and safe use."
"You indicate two specific problems in this connection in the parliamentary report, the question of what should happen to dead animals and the question of whether we should feed animal protein to herbivores at all."
"We must have a serious debate about both questions."
"As I announced at the meat-and-bone meal conference, these questions will be discussed in the context of a public consultation."
"The appropriate consultation paper has been prepared and sent to Parliament, and since 14 November it has also been available on the Internet."
"Research is also subject to permanent further development, and the list of research priorities is becoming longer and longer."
"We now have to deal with a new kind of disease, and the research requirement is enormous."
"The Commission is trying to coordinate the research activities of the Member States in this field, and to provide money for research projects."
"To ensure sufficient interest in research by the scientists, particularly about questions of applied BSE research, we should consider, together with Parliament, whether we should also follow new paths."
"You say in your report that in future the Commission should take action promptly, as early as possible, in the health field."
"I agree with you entirely."
"However, I would like to clarify that this is only possible when, among other things, the necessary resources are available."
"BSE has faced the European institutions with a unique challenge to overcome a crisis of European dimensions."
"Parliament's Committee of Inquiry and the subsequent committee have shown new ways to formulate our policy in the field of health and consumer protection, but also of agricultural policy."
"I would like us to take this path of cooperation between Commission and Parliament ."
"Thank you!"
"Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to respond briefly to the questions and comments which have been made to the Council."
"I note that you have appreciated the presence of the Council at this debate and that you have confidence in its president, but it seems to me that you lack a little confidence with regard to the Agriculture Council."
"I would like to tell Mrs Roth-Behrendt that she is wrong and that this mistrust of the Agriculture Council is not justified."
"Furthermore, this Council has interrupted its debate on Agenda 2000, on which a decision must be taken before tomorrow evening, to highlight the importance it accords to this debate and the problem of food security."
"I will also try to show, during this speech, that the Council, and in particular the Agriculture Council, has not been idle in its efforts to improve the problems of health and food safety and that it has tried to follow the recommendations and proposals made by the Commission in this regard."
"I would also like to say that, in our deliberations, priority is not given to social or economic considerations, although they are important for a number of farmers."
"I have emphasized that the Council has always acted by giving overall priority to the protection of public health."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt reproaches the Council for not having taken the article proposed by the European Parliament as a legal basis for a regulation on the labelling of beef and veal and the registration of cows."
"On this issue I would like to say that the choice of an appropriate legal basis, in accordance with consistent legal practice of the European Court of Justice, does not depend on political considerations but must be based on the content of the act to be adopted."
"Regarding the regulation on identification and labelling, the Council considered, again following European Court of Justice precedent, that given the current clauses of the treaty, article 43 was the appropriate and sufficient legal basis since this regulation concerns the production and marketing of agricultural products listed in annex II of the treaty and it contributes to the achievement of certain objectives of the common agricultural policy stated in article 39."
"Of course, if the Council did not follow the Commission's proposal regarding this legal basis, which was modified virtually at the last minute following a debate in the European Parliament, it should still be recognized that the Council carried out specific and very rapid work and that it tried to bring into force an essential regulation, for we all know that registration of animals and cast-iron traceability of their movements are essential to be able to eradicate these diseases effectively and rapidly."
"It is a precondition for all reliable and controllable labelling of meat and meat products."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt also criticized the Council for not having approved the proposals for price reductions proposed by the Commission."
"On this subject, I would like to say that the Agriculture Council is of the opinion that farmers' incomes are not high enough for them to be reduced any further."
"The Council is of the opinion that, given the Agenda 2000 proposals, we must now insist on defining and confirming an identity for European agriculture, an identity with an image of which the European Parliament would approve, a multifunctional agriculture, enduring, spread over the whole of Europe, which respects the environment and animal welfare and which offers products of a safe and reliable quality."
"I hope that, when we recommence the work of the Agriculture Council this afternoon, my colleagues will be unanimous in affirming and defending this European agriculture identity, both inside and outside the Community."
"If this is the case, I believe we will have taken a step in the right direction, which the European Parliament also wants, in order to promote an agricultural sector which respects health and safety."
"Mr President, I too welcome what my colleagues have been able to do in the committee and I salute the real heroes of this report - Mr Medina, Mr Böge and Mrs Roth-Behrendt - for the major work they have done, and also those in the Commission who have interacted with us in an extremely positive way over the past six months."
"BSE and CJD have been a nightmare for Europe for some years."
"Many have lost their livelihoods and some have lost their lives."
"The Medina report and its follow-up have shown that the European Parliament can take an appropriate initiative by itself in this matter."
"It is another form of co-decision, except that here we were not responding to proposals that came to us from the Commission or the Council but taking a view because of the absence of such proposals at an earlier stage."
"The criticisms of the Commission during the debate on the Medina report were made in that spirit."
"We should acknowledge quite properly that the Commission has made considerable advances, in particular through DG XIV, in the last six months."
"Because of that, by far the majority view in my group and in others as well, is that a vote of censure would be inappropriate."
"There are many things which still trouble us."
"One is the somewhat dilatory attitude to disciplinary procedures within the Commission itself but that is no ground for a vote of censure."
"We said at the outset that while we were concerned with issues of public health and safety, we are not a committee of public safety in the French revolutionary sense, calling for heads, calling for show trials."
"We simply want to make certain that the lessons with regard to internal discipline are learned as effectively as some others."
"We also feel that the Council was lethargic early on in its response to the Commission's very necessary proposals for health and safety and the treatment of risk materials throughout the Community."
"The whole of our committee, in particular on its visit to the United Kingdom, was moved by the plight of the CJD victims and their families which was eloquently expressed to us by Mr and Mrs Churchill."
"The whole committee wanted to express solidarity with the victims of this terrible disease and their families."
"We know that this must be material sympathy and support, as well as mere moral support."
"It must involve the Member States as well as the Commission, and we look forward to initiatives on both sides in that regard."
"Speaking for myself, an inquiry into the origins of CJD in the UK is long overdue and I shall do all I can to try to bring it about."
"The argument in principle is settled and there should now be no unnecessary delay over the details."
"The UK Government welcomes this report."
"This time there is none of the spiteful criticism that was directed at Mr Medina's earlier report."
"When he came before the committee the minister, Dr Cunningham, made it perfectly clear that the committee would be right to call him and that he would always attend."
"It is better to lay some stress on the positive aspects of that, rather than go into the legal quibbles of what is or is not requested or permitted or demanded under the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"The United Kingdom has been at the centre of the BSE epidemic from the beginning but, with the precautionary measures which have now been put into effect, it is entitled to be seen as setting an example in health and safety standards, including the safe storage of rendered carcases."
"A number of people have referred to this."
"I would simply point out that whilst everything has been done to meet the conditions of the Florence agreement, it is absolutely the essence of health and safety that rendered carcases - in the form of meat and bonemeal in which they are stored - should be kept in conditions of absolute security and safety until they can be safely incinerated."
"We should not be demanding that the whole stockpile be put up the chimney at once."
"We believe that all Member States should now be prepared to join in precisely the same preventive measures which have already been implemented in the United Kingdom."
"Recent events in Belgium have shown that BSE can occur in states which felt they were free of it and that mistakes can be made in analysis and in the final destiny of the carcasses concerned."
"I do not say that in any spirit other than one of sympathy and - to use the word that the President himself used today - solidarity with any country anywhere which finds itself affected by BSE in the way that we in the United Kingdom have been."
"The answer is not to clamour for BSE-free regions or zones but to recognize that throughout the European Union we are a single zone which needs total security, safety, traceability and vigilance as the soundest basis for consumer confidence and for beef to be traded once again throughout the Community on its merits and in a market where that confidence has been restored."
"My final point is just to say that in the future this process of scrutiny must continue and I look forward to the information campaign on food safety which DG XXIV is planning for 1998."
"I hope that campaign will be launched during the British Presidency with full backing from Member States and consumer groups."
"From all of this, after so much distress, much good can come for both consumers and producers in the Community."
"Mutual trust between them and a proper regime of health and safety has to be the outcome of the BSE crisis."
"Mr President, this Parliament is often reproached for acting somewhat irresponsibly."
"Against this reproach, which is not always unjustified, it can be said that where it truly has power this Parliament acts responsibly and also achieves something."
"We in this committee have achieved something."
"We have promises that in future health, the environment and consumer protection will be treated as more important than the other aims of the internal market."
"We have promises that our agricultural policy will be changed in such a way that dimensions, quantities and areas are not the most important criteria, but we put our bets on quality, class, health and sustainable economics."
"We have also achieved something on democratic politics."
"Work in the Commission today is organized differently from a little while ago."
"Transparency is something which we have experienced in the last days and weeks."
"The relevant legislation will in future take place with the responsible cooperation of Parliament."
"At least we hope so, and we hope so at the latest on the basis of the changes of authority which the Treaty of Amsterdam will bring with it."
"We have not achieved everything."
"We have not really sanctioned any individual responsibilities."
"But in this connection we have the promise of the President of the Commission to ensure by a new disciplinary law that in future we shall have an appropriate legal basis if irregular behaviour occurs."
"We have no real compensation for the victims, but at least we have starts in the right direction, and we expect that solutions for the future will be found by cooperation between this Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"We have not achieved everything, and therefore we must continue to work together in the coming months, so that the consequences of the BSE scandal are appraised and that we all profit from the work of the two BSE committees."
"Mr President, for the food sector, food safety and quality must surpass all other considerations."
"Profitability cannot be at the expense of consumer rights and welfare."
"BSE has been an expensive lesson for Europe and one that cannot ever be repeated."
"The human tragedy can never be forgotten."
"I very much appreciate President Santer's acknowledgement this morning of that human tragedy."
"He treated it in a very sensitive manner."
"In supporting the report before Parliament, it is to the credit, I believe, of the Commission that regulations were quickly put in place to address both the eradication of BSE and, more importantly, measures to prevent a recurrence."
"In this regard I have to say that the work of the special committee and the views of Parliament were also significant."
"I am pleased to say many of them were taken on board by the Commission."
"I want to say in relation to BSE that farmers were the innocent victims of circumstances beyond their control."
"Farmers are not normally involved in compounding feedstuffs and when they purchased their animal feed they were not always aware of the actual protein content."
"On the question of food security and food quality, we must ensure, and I think this is important in the context of the next world trade talks, that the European Union commitment to consumer protection does not place our consumers at risk or place our industry at a competitive disadvantage."
"We have faced up to the importance of food security and food quality and we must also ensure that our consumers are fully protected in the broader world trade."
"Mr President, I would like to look at the deficit of political responsibility which has become so clear through this case."
"It is quite clear that where economic interests and massive promotion combine with subsidies, outrages are almost compulsory."
"There we should fill in the institutional gaps."
"One is the absolute demand for parliamentary responsibility for European agricultural policy."
"There we will not let go!"
"The second is political responsibility against officials."
"Something has been promised by the Commission, we shall wait and see what comes."
"We have established a Commission political responsibility."
"That has been good and helpful, and we shall maintain it."
"But one point is not fulfilled, and that is the political responsibility of the national governments."
"It is a scandal if a government breaks the law, and can actually do it without any political sanction!"
"Here we, as the European Parliament, must work together more strongly with the national parliaments, particularly the oppositions."
"Final point: it is intolerable that such wrong behaviour has no financial consequences!"
"We must demand that if a government, a state, burdens all the others with such massive costs, these costs can then be demanded back from that government."
"This is an absolutely central demand which we shall pursue further!"
"Mr President, I will try to be brief."
"I want to concern myself with what the President-in-Office said here."
"That seems to me to be very near the truth."
"Mr Boden, you ignore the fact that the Member States have a very poorly developed awareness of Community law, particularly in the case of BSE."
"States can declare that they do not think about applying the standard which should be applied to animal meal, for instance."
"The Commission has to fall back on lengthy breach of treaty proceedings."
"What matters here is that we in Parliament enable the Commission to react faster, to take the appropriate actions for people's health."
"It is also necessary, and you said nothing about this, for the veterinary controls within states to be made effective."
"In Germany, for instance, they must become independent."
"Inspectors have a link there, either an employee relationship or a fee relationship, so that they depend on the slaughterhouses."
"What matters here is that we should decide on independent veterinary control, and that must also be put through by Parliament and the Commission."
"I would have criticized the Commission much more if I had not heard your speech."
"For instance, you mentioned labelling."
"The only point on which you were unanimous was the rejection of Parliament and the Commission!"
"In this matter you have made compromise after compromise, and what came out of it was what the Commission submitted and Parliament's proposals for improvement!"
"That is a scandal!"
"Excuse me, Mr President, I would love to speak for ten more minutes, to give the Council a real rocket at last!"
"Mr President, very briefly, of course."
"There is an additional problem with regard to the entire BSE dossier, namely that the entire investigation is threatened with collapse as the result of an additional situation, and that is why I find the report somewhat incomplete."
"Indeed, in addition to the BSE dossier, there is organized crime, which has made use of this file to transfer food products illegally and on a massive scale from Great Britain to countries within Europe, and also to other countries outside the European Union."
"This is a case of fraud which we have raised repeatedly in other temporary committees of inquiry, and I would request that this dossier is in any case taken on board by the Committee on Budgetary Control, and that is why we have tabled a number of amendments on this matter in order that this dossier, which in addition to the ordinary BSE dossier is pending, will also be given a chance."
"Mr President, when at 9.15 a.m. this morning the President asked Members to leave the chamber as quickly as possible, that happened en masse. Nonetheless I am glad that most colleagues have returned in the meantime."
"As far as BSE is concerned, the rapporteur points out that the European Commission has followed up most of the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry, or at least a start has been made."
"I do not believe that trust in the European Commission has been affected."
"The fight against BSE and against CJD requires guaranteed safety of animal materials intended for human consumption."
"The European Commission has therefore quite rightly introduced new standards for the processing of meat-and-bone meal as from 1 April this year."
"That as many as ten Member States have not implemented them is a serious omission."
"I would like to be told the Commission's position regarding the processing of hazardous cattle organs in gelatin and tallow."
"The decree of June this year aimed at zero risk."
"There was every reason for that, considering the recently proved link between BSE and CJD."
"Yet the Commission appears to be abandoning the ban on the processing of risk organs in gelatin and tallow."
"That such a ban endangers the availability of medical drugs, I beg to doubt."
"Australia, New Zealand and European companies as well are able to produce gelatin according to European standards, in other words without organs."
"Does the Commission not give in a little too quickly to the commercial policy pressure of the United States?"
"Although it would have been better if the British minister, Mr Hogg, had appeared in front of the Committee of Inquiry, I think it is an over-reaction to want to compel the members of the governments of Member States to appear at a Committee of Inquiry of the European Parliament."
"Governments are answerable to their national parliament; the European Parliament is overplaying its hand on this."
"Improvements of veterinary controls in accordance with the working programme is a good thing."
"The European Commission will never be able to take the place of national control systems."
"The European services fulfil an additional role."
"Cooperation and coordination with the national control bodies will remain necessary."
"Mr President, I welcome the submission of the report."
"It shows clearly what actions the Commission has taken during the BSE crisis - taken late, but taken - and what actions it has neglected to take."
"This means that many of Parliament's demands have been put into effect, and some have remained open."
"The rapporteur, Mr Böge, has spoken of a bill of exchange on the future."
"But first I put the question whether the Commission can be released from its political responsibility."
"I would like to suggest a comparison."
"Austrian criminal law recognizes the concept of making good the damage, so that if the accused is only slightly guilty, he can be acquitted."
"Let me now stay with my image and discuss how the Commission is making good the damage."
"The efforts of the Commission to make good the damage can be clearly recognized in the report."
"It speaks of a new openness, the responsibilities of the Directorate-General for Consumer Policy and Health Protection were extended, and actions to restore the function of the market were taken."
"The Commission has thus attempted to make good the damage."
"But in the end this all happened only because of the massive pressure from Parliament and an indignant public, and unfortunately it happened far too late!"
"The EP drew attention to the BSE problem as early as 1990."
"For far too long, the Commission let itself be led by the nose by individual Member States in carrying out its duty of control, without doing anything about it."
"I know that the Commission itself is not directly responsible for the individual Member States' lack of will to carry out the controls, but it should have fulfilled its role as guardian of the treaties long ago."
"There lies the politically guilty behaviour of the Commission."
"I come back to my image."
"Is acquittal of the Commission by Parliament justified?"
"Unfortunately, article 144 of the treaty only provides for a vote of no confidence against the entire Commission."
"As long as this threshold exists, it will continue to be difficult to demand political responsibility in future."
"I regret this, and the citizens of Europe will not understand it!"
"The debate will continue at 3 p.m."
"Votes"
"I wish to inform the House that due to a technical error in the tabling of amendments to the Linkohr report, for which the vote was due to take place today, an amendment tabled by the Green Group has not been translated and distributed."
"The vote on the Linkohr report is thus postponed until tomorrow, Wednesday, at 12 noon, to enable the rapporteur and the Members to become acquainted with the text."
"May I furthermore remind you that the vote on the Resolutions regarding the Kyoto Conference on climate change will also take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Mr President, on a point of order under to Rule 24.2 of the Rules of Procedure, which states that a reply to a written question should have been given within 30 days."
"Well, Mr President, I put a written question to the President of this Parliament in December last year."
"It was question 3/97 about the report of the Vice-President of Parliament, a report dated 18 November 1996, on the installation of 128 extra shower cubicles for Members of Parliament in Brussels, at a cost of 90 million Belgian francs."
"Everyone who can add up knows that 90 divided by 128 makes 703, 125 Belgian francs per cubicle."
"The answer normally has to be approved by the Bureau."
"This answer was already on file at the Bureau of Parliament as far back as May."
"Twice I have written to ask for an explanation."
"Up until today I still have not received an answer; it is now eleven months after the date the question was put."
"The Bureau is meeting today, and I am asking for this be put on the agenda today, so that I will receive an answer after eleven months."
"Mr Vandemeulebroucke, please be assured that this very afternoon your question is going to be submitted to the Bureau and you will receive all the necessary explanations."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I want to raise a matter concerning a statement today in one of the Irish papers - The Star - attributed to an MEP, Ms McKenna, where she makes an accusation: ' Concerning the new building in Belgium there are people in Brussels getting massive financial backhanders for the buildings."
"There is serious racketeering going on for this.'"
"In addition she makes a false accusation..."
"That is not a point of order."
"I must therefore ask you to stop."
"Mr President, on a point of order: is it possible for you to make clear that the socalled Herod premium is hidden behind this order?"
"It is about slaughtering mere calves, and this has rightly fallen into disrepute."
"The animal protection organizations have rightly fought against it."
"We have submitted an amendment to insert that, so that it is also clear in the Chamber, and so that people know what they are voting about."
"Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, all the Members have read this document, which is without debate."
"(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)"
"The undersigned will vote against all reports concerning the slaughter of calves unless they include bans or restrictions on the production of so-called white veal."
"Colino Salamanca report (A4-0330/97)"
"Owing to the nature of the Portuguese sugar industry, and in order to keep it viable, we consider it essential to maintain national subsidies to Portuguese sugar-beet producers in addition to the framework laid out by the Commission."
"Sugar-beet is an agricultural option which is economically viable. It facilitates crop rotation and in some regions it is contributing to an increase in agricultural production."
"Against this background, we should not forget that the quota was increased not long ago to make the Portuguese sugar-beet conversion unit viable."
"Furthermore, the Sturdy report on sales of agricultural products has already predicted a gradual decrease in subsidies to Portuguese sugar-beet producers up to 2001, and the present proposal by the Commission is going down the same road."
"So we cannot accept the cancellation of national subsidies after 2001, as proposed by the Commission."
"We also think that it is premature to reach any conclusion on the subject before the reform of the COM on sugar, which should take place before the 2000/2001 marketing campaign."
"Apart from that, because sugar-beet growing is a Portuguese speciality, those subsidies should continue in order to support a profitable form of agriculture in one of countries most seriously affected by the CAP."
"We therefore support Mr Colino Salamanca's proposed alteration to article 2 of the Commission's proposal, and thus we vote in favour of the report."
"Mr President, I would like to ask you to have my voting machine checked."
"It failed to function several times during the voting."
"I therefore ask you to put into the minutes that I wanted to vote for the Greens' amendment about the Herod premium."
"Heinisch Report (A4-0358/97)"
"We did not vote against this report because it concerns a technical change of the legal basis, but we do consider it appropriate to underline Turkey's major deficiencies with regard to human rights."
"We demand that Turkey respects and improves human rights, strengthens democracy, creates a non-military solution to the Kurdish question and a peaceful solution of the Cyprus question."
", in writing . (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of the proposals on Turkey and establishing the Community's position on the Customs Union Joint Committee."
"The proposal is merely of a technical nature and concerns the procedure for establishing the Community's position."
"We are in no doubt that the European Parliament's influence on this subject has already given democracy strength in Turkey."
"The Danish Social Democrats believe that conditions in Turkey are such that quite simply there should not be any financial assistance from the EU at the moment."
"To get public assistance, Turkey should observe human rights, accept and follow the rules of democracy and developments in the country should be monitored by a supervisory body."
"That concludes voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.10 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Mr President, I should like to ask for your permission to make a brief personal statement under Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure."
"In the course of lunchtime today I received a telephone call from a prominent radio station in my constituency which attributed opinions and behaviour along the following lines indirectly to myself as a Member of this Parliament in relation to our new building in Brussels: ' there are people in Brussels who are getting massive backhanders, there is serious racketeering going on, the procedures in Parliament have not been properly followed and Parliament has gone against its own Rules in the matter of its buildings policy.'"
"This is not only a slur against myself - and it was put to me in these offensive terms - but a slur against the work and function of the Bureau and, moreover, a slur against officials of Parliament who cannot come here to answer for themselves."
"Mr President, I invite you to ask the presidency to contact the Member who made the allegations and who has been quoted - Mrs Patricia McKenna, of the Green Group - and to ask her to substantiate these allegations or have the decency to withdraw them."
"Mr President, I would like to agree wholeheartedly with the questions which have been raised just now."
"This afternoon we agreed with the Group of the European People's Party's Bureau members, that all these accusations before us should be submitted to the Bureau of Parliament, and that we, as Members of Parliament must have an answer about these matters as soon as possible."
"When it concerns fraud, when it concerns the misuse of expenses, travel expenses, and so on, the Members of this Parliament - and I tell you, Mr President, that is 95 % of this Parliament - think it is important that things are clarified as soon as possible, so that accusations cannot be made out of the blue for others to consider as well, and which we have nothing to do with."
"I ask you, Mr President, to tell Parliament tomorrow morning what the reply should be to questions about shower cubicles, travel expenses, fraud, and the rest."
"We cannot start a debate on these matters now. They are on the agenda of the meeting to be held by the Office of Presidency this afternoon."
"So I would ask Mr Cox to summarize what he said in his speech a short while ago and send that comment to the President, either through me or directly."
"The Office of Presidency will meet at 5 p.m. today and the agenda includes the appraisal of a Dutch television broadcast acknowledging that two of our colleagues had made at least two mistakes, may extend the discussion to the fact reported by Mr Cox as well."
"BSE (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on BSE."
"Mr President, the mad cow affair has shaken consumer confidence, shown the limits of an internal market which has no serious rules of consumer protection and revealed that this market can only function if the Commission and Member States work in close symbiosis."
"The work of the parliamentary inquiry and the political pressure exerted on the Commission have shaken the latter and made quite a few things move at Community level."
"The European Parliament recognizes this in the Böge report, adopted virtually unanimously in the Temporary Committee to follow up of the Recommendations on BSE, and in the impossibility of getting enough signatures together for a motion of censure."
"That is a political fact."
"However, the point of my comment here is primarily to denounce the attitudes of Member States, because they are still lagging behind."
"Not only are ten of them indicted for having infringed the rule on animal meat-and-bone meal, but I wonder what national MPs are doing as far as their ministers for agriculture and consumer protection are concerned."
"As well as the national MPs, the national level professional organizations have an enormous responsibility in this respect."
"For example, they would do well to examine how effectively the veterinary controls function in their respective countries."
"In this respect, I think a strengthening of veterinary controls is required throughout Europe, and a standardization of these controls, both qualitative and quantitative."
"It is not acceptable that there are several thousand vets in a big country, and the same number, more or less, in another smaller country."
"This is therefore clearly one of the great responsibilities of Member States."
"Everything must be done to respect public health and to protect our consumers."
"I am in complete agreement with Mrs Bonino who this morning said that the inquiry and follow up work of the European Parliament, just like the work of the Commission, is a long cleaning up process that our Parliament must undertake, together with the Commission and the Council."
"Mr President, the BSE crisis has created winners and losers."
"Amongst the losers I would certainly like to mention those who are affected by CJD, but I would also like to mention the farmers and all those who are dependent on them, and who have run great risks financially and who have seen their operating profits decline considerably over the past year as well."
"The winners are the consumers, I hope, Mr President, in the long term."
"Winners, why do I say that, because as part of the Treaty of Amsterdam we have been able to give public health and the consumer greater priority."
"Also because in the fight against BSE - and this was already happening in a number of Member States - something was getting increased attention, namely the integral chain management from producer to consumer."
"This means that in Europe the consumer has become the winner in this BSE crisis, although I am not forgetting the losers."
"The report produced by the Committee of Inquiry and the Temporary Committee is excellent."
"The issue has been tackled very systematically."
"All points raised by the Committee of Inquiry have been taken up."
"I also think that from here, from this position, I should sincerely thank the rapporteur, Mr Böge, but most certainly the President of this Committee, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, for the way in which they have listed all the points and tackled everything in such a systematic fashion."
"The Committee, too, Mrs Bonino, Mr Fischler, and certainly Mr Reichenbach, is due much gratitude."
"Much has been learned, including by Parliament."
"I wonder nonetheless if this greater knowledge has led to more concerns."
"The concerns I have personally, are international concerns."
"How can we make sure that the European concerns go on to be translated internationally?"
"How can we make sure that the Member States follow up European concerns on an international level?"
"I would like to ask one more brief question: what are we going to do with gelatin and medical drugs?"
"I understood last week that, at the request of the Netherlands, a decision by the European Commission would be withdrawn."
"What exactly is going on?"
"Could you please give me clarification on gelatin and medical drugs?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to agree with my colleague, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, when she spoke on behalf of the Socialist Group, and was critical of the Council."
"I am very appreciative of what the committee has done up until now, and I also appreciate that people are present at this late stage of the debate, but I think the Council needs to make a more determined start."
"I am not all that satisfied about what has happened between the final report of the Committee of Inquiry and now."
"I would like to mention, as others have done before me, the illegal transit of meat, for example in Flushing harbour, and I would also like to mention the infected cow in Belgium which was turned into bone meal."
"I think that what appears in the six monthly report will also be crucial in preventing these kind of things from happening."
"I would like to make an urgent appeal for the British minister to give a personal report next year during the British Presidency."
"Finally, I would like to agree with Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's question regarding the use of medical drugs."
"Mr President, as rapporteur for the report which was approved by the European Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry, I should first like to congratulate the chair of the Temporary Committee, Mrs Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, and the committee's rapporteur, Mr Böge, for all their hard work in finishing what was started by my report, and what was approved by Parliament at the time."
"At this stage, I think it is fair to say that the mad cow affair is an example of chaos theory."
"A small detail, certain omissions or lack of care in the transformation of animal remains into proteins for animal consumption, has led to a terrible tragedy in the agriculture sector, and to consequences for human health which are still relatively unpredictable."
"I feel that this crisis has led to a reaction from the Community - a healthy reaction from the Commission above all - and also from certain Member States (such as the United Kingdom) and from Community institutions such as the Council."
"In the last analysis, I think this has just been the first example of what can happen in an internal market which is dominated exclusively by economic considerations."
"It makes me think that there are limits to economic activity and to the extent to which market forces can be allowed to regulate every situation within the internal market. If the European Union is nothing more than a mechanism for economic harmonization, then we will encounter this type of difficulty from time to time."
"In other words, the European Union has to be more than just a sort of referee of market forces, and I think we made some progress during the Amsterdam Conference along these lines. It is unimaginable that the European Union should continue to function on the basis of the sovereignty of the Member States, with a totally free interaction of market forces, and a lack of effective Commission powers in health and other areas which are important for the welfare of its citizens."
"Mr President, when the safety of food is in jeopardy, firm action needs to be taken, irrespective of whether the cause is malfunction of institutions, laxity, or the pursuit of financial gain at the expense of everything else."
"One cannot be careful enough with food."
"Let that be the lesson that the BSE crisis has taught us."
"The BSE issue has also taught us that the shortest route to the solution of a problem is not always the most negative."
"If we had closed down the committee in February, we would not have been able to present the same result today."
"It is by showing what should be done ourselves, and by using the vote of censure as a driving force, that we have succeeded in setting in motion fundamental changes, including a new policy culture."
"The BSE crisis has confirmed the need for parliamentary control."
"Without the work of this Parliament, and particularly with Reimer Böge and Mrs Roth-Behrendt as central players, we would never have achieved this result in this time."
"We should ask ourselves, however, if we as a Parliament have sufficient instruments at our disposal to carry out this control duty continuously."
"Mr President, the state of affairs today shows that democracy has been vindicated, that we can be satisfied about our own work, and about the constructive and cooperative reaction from the Commission."
"But while the European Parliament may have controlled the European match, we are by no means through yet."
"There will soon be a world championship. And on the WTO and Codex Alimentarius pitch it will not be an easy match."
"We can be satisfied, but should not be triumphant."
"The disease has not been wiped out, we cannot remove the suffering of the families and the farmers, even with a lot of money."
"Not all recommendations have been turned into action, not all measures have been implemented yet, and finally, Mr President, we should ask ourselves whether it would not be a good idea to keep all animal products which are suitable for human consumption out of the cattle feed circuit."
"Mr President-in-Office, your continued presence today in the European Parliament does you great honour and underlines the seriousness of the problem."
"However, Mr President of the Commission, although I have followed the debate I have not yet understood who is to blame."
"I have not yet understood who will take some responsibility for the situation that has been created."
"The Council has, in a very elegant way, disclaimed any responsibility and has loaded all the responsibilities onto you."
"You have told us that you have found no evidence against your staff and so you have not punished them. You have also said that we, as the European Parliament, rejected the generous increase in the 1998 budget funds for research, controls, and for the infrastructures of the veterinary service."
"I also listened with great interest to what you said about the continuing illegal trade to third world countries is continuing."
"However, I would like you to tell me in your reply whether this illegal trade is continuing not only to thirdworld countries - although it makes very little difference, people live there too - but also to countries of the European Union."
"Five weeks have passed since I submitted a question in writing to the Commission and I have not yet received a reply."
"I would like to know, Mr President of the Commission, if this illegal, contaminated meat has gone to countries of the European Union and to which countries."
"Mr President, what have we learned from the BSE scandal?"
"We have learned, and the learning was bitter, that he who puts the market before health precautions loses."
"We have learned that keeping policies secret behind closed doors or failing to admit mistakes results in people losing trust, and that great damage results, damage of which we can still not say exactly how great it is and how long we shall need to make it good."
"But we have also learned that to change can mean to win, that transparency, as we now have it, for instance, in the field of scientific advice, as we want to have much more of it in the initiation of legislation and the decisionmaking process, can instil trust back into people."
"We have learned that if we give priority to precautionary health and consumer protection, and if we practise sustainable agriculture in earnest and not just in Sunday speeches, this change can regain people's trust for us."
"I would like to thank Commissioner Bonino in particular, and of course her staff."
"Mrs Bonino, you have demonstrated just how much really good and important work the right woman in the right place can achieve!"
"We have learned a great deal."
"We shall see how it goes."
"We shall look very carefully at the half-yearly progress reports which we discuss in the committees, and we shall check very carefully, Mr President of the Commission, on how the proposal for a new interinstitutional agreement is shaping. This will be submitted early next year, and we must debate it."
"In my opinion, it is the Member States which have learned too little, and the President-in-Office has regrettably shown that again today."
"Over 25 years ago, Willy Brandt won an election with the slogan 'Dare more democracy' ."
"We too must dare more democracy in this Parliament."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, along with all my colleagues, for all his work both on the follow-up committee - as we have just been discussing - and also on the earlier committee."
"I was a member of both."
"It is obvious to everyone now that many mistakes were made in the past."
"Some of these mistakes were made through ignorance of the disease, which we should all accept was very new at the time."
"Some mistakes were also made for political reasons."
"Much of the criticism of the handling of the BSE crisis made within both committees of inquiry centred on the failure of Commission staff involved."
"I do not support this criticism."
"My experience of dealing with Commission officials over a long period of years has been one of great satisfaction."
"They have always been cooperative and competent and they would often have liked to go much further and do much more than they were allowed to do."
"I believe we should concentrate our criticism, if criticism is needed, on those responsible: in other words, the political masters of the officials concerned."
"The officials acted or did not act as a result of the direct instructions of the commissioners responsible at that time and the then Council."
"We all need fully to recognize this."
"I do not think it has been recognized well enough."
"The biggest scandal surrounding this tragedy was the British decision rightly to ban the use of contaminated meat and bonemeal in the UK but, at the same time, allow and even increase the volume of infected feed which was exported to other Member States, with disastrous consequences for innocent farmers including specifically in my own country, Ireland."
"Both committees have done excellent work."
"The present Commission has now acted responsibly and satisfactorily on the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry."
"We are now at last making good progress under the direction of Commissioner Fischler and Commissioner Bonino."
"So what more have we to do?"
"Research must be intensified as quickly as possible."
"The risk to human health must be established scientifically."
"Whatever the level of that risk, it can only be removed through the eradication of the disease."
"We must push that forward with all speed."
"Mr President, we have been justifiably shocked by the failure of both the Member States and the European Commission to manage public health and by their response to the outbreak of mad cow disease."
"The shock has been heard here in this House and through the Committee of Inquiry; in a number of Member States, especially in the United Kingdom, there have been some changes, as well as in the European Commission."
"The achievement of the rapporteur and the chairman of the committee and its members, has been to put the European Commission under permanent pressure and to push for more transparency, more clarity."
"On several fronts some things have started to move."
"There remains, Mr President of the Commission, dear Commissioner, one major drawback: the lack of disciplinary measures."
"Mistakes have been made, and the European Commission is not succeeding in taking the necessary disciplinary action."
"I can only regret that."
"As far as we are concerned there is not one single reason for complacency."
"Only for vigilance and permanent parliamentary pressure to set the measures in motion."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this stage in the BSE debate virtually everything of importance has already been said by those who have spoken before me."
"However, I should like to emphasize Mr Böge's efforts, and I want to congratulate both him and Mrs Roth-Behrendt for the fine piece of work they have done, for the rigorous and responsible attitude they have shown, and for the way they remained calm throughout the whole process which, believe me, was not easy."
"Since certain aspects of the matter (such as meat-and-bone meal, inspection, evidence from ministers, and so on) have already been adequately covered by the debate, I should like to say that the Commission seems to have indeed realized that consumers' health is more important than anything else, and that in everything which touches on this matter, it should therefore act with transparency, speed and responsibility. That is how it should be done, and that is what people are demanding of us."
"The Commission was slow to react, but it has reacted."
"That is the first step down the long road we have to travel."
"As to the reorganization of services, I think it should be speeded up. It ought to be working already."
"The public does not understand that the inspections are not fully implemented because of staffing problems."
"Speed up the recruiting process."
"There are a lot of empty posts in the Commission, and they are provided for in the budget."
"So there is no excuse."
"You can and should do it."
"So do it!"
"Research in this area has been promoted, provided with funds, and coordinated."
"But I am going to say the same thing again: do it now!"
"We cannot eradicate this disease until we have found the missing piece in the jigsaw, and this has to be done by the technical experts - the scientists - by means of those research programmes, for which they should be given adequate funds."
"As for the question of responsibilities, I have just a small comment to add."
"Once it has been confirmed that demands are going to be made, they should be applied across the board."
"We have not made much progress on this point."
"Finally, I should like to make a request to all the European institutions: please do not make us wait for another BSE to break out before you respond - attentively, vigilantly and cooperatively - to the European Parliament."
"This should be the normal approach - this House's standard method."
"Interinstitutional collaboration should be the trademark for constructing the Europe we all want."
"Mr President, I would like to take my turn in thanking Mr Böge and Mrs Roth-Behrendt for the work that they have done, enabling us, within nine months, to arrive at a point where we are now debating this issue in this pleasant atmosphere."
"Of course, I do not think that this pleasant atmosphere, indicating that we have found a common language, prevails in the beef market."
"The consumer remains wary, there is a lack of confidence in the beef market, which means that whatever half-hearted steps we have taken towards transparency need to be speeded up in the future."
"Mr President-in-Office, it would be good if you showed greater decisiveness on issues concerning your officials and their competence and responsibilities."
"I think that a little more courage is needed as we must make up lost ground."
"Of course, I want to be fair."
"The lack of trust in the beef market is not only due to the mistakes of the Commission. It is also due to the Council, and the unfortunate thing is that, even today, the Council, while showing some good will, has not answered the questions put to it by the President of the Commission and by all of us."
"I believe that, if we wish to be honest with the consumer, we must tell the truth today."
"We have begun our efforts, there is a long road ahead of us, and there will be no success if we do not manage to coordinate the action of the Commission, of the European Parliament - because we have not been generous in the budget for research into this disease - but, chiefly of the Council."
"Because, at this moment, market controls are not in the hands of the Commission; cross-border controls are in the hands of the Member States and in this we see that market logic still reigns."
"They have not learnt their lesson."
"If they learn their lesson, the unfortunate thing is that the lesson will be learnt not only by the Member States, but much more harshly, I am afraid, by the producers."
"For this reason, Mr President-in-Office, please push forward all the measures against the United Kingdom that we call for in Mr Böge's report."
"Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, everything which has been said today is important and right."
"There is no question about that."
"Thanks for this milestone which Parliament has established today go to Mrs RothBehrendt and our good friend Mr Böge - they did outstanding work!"
"And we still got on with each other, as Mrs Roth-Behrendt emphasized this morning."
"As a farmer, I am particularly pleased if I can somehow cope with a Berlin lawyer, because that means something!"
"But what conclusion can we draw from the story?"
"Mr President of the Commission, could such a sickness break out even today?"
"I say yes."
"That is the starting point."
"What do I not like about the whole story?"
"I like, for instance, the fact that we now have a strategy, that the Commission has moved, that Parliament has made enormous efforts."
"I do not like the fact that we have no guarantee at all that in the 15 Member States things will be even approximately put into effect in a foreseeable period."
"That is my problem."
"When we say that no more animal meal must be fed to ruminants, that will succeed to some extent, because the farmers themselves would be stupid if they did it."
"But when I hear that meat should be labelled so that the consumer knows where it comes from, I would give no guarantee that that will actually be put into effect in the 15 Member States."
"I would also give no guarantee that the 15 Member States will put into effect the separating out of risk material, and above all that the heating regulations, which we believe to be right, will be observed."
"Those are the bills of exchange Mr Böge spoke of this morning, and which the Council must redeem."
"Really, 15 ministers of agriculture should be present at these decisive debates, not just one who has to act as the whipping boy for the rest."
"He will go to his 14 colleagues this afternoon, and they may say that Boden is crazy, he has let them drop him in it!"
"That is the point."
"We must make sure in future that we in the Community can rely on it being put into effect."
"Then things will be all right, not otherwise."
"Mr President, I personally do not like triumphalism: we still need to work, we still need to insist a great deal on the protection of health and ensure that no scheming goes on."
"I think we have managed to separate the wheat from the chaff."
"The Böge report contains several worrying points; there are still uncertainties that have to be dealt with. They have to be dealt with by the work of the Commission and by the Member States, identifying the differences between the States."
"Not all the Member States are equal and different positions are held in Council: some Member States make their contribution, while others do not."
"We cannot make a general statement."
"It seems to me the measures taken in Italy are very important and, from this point of view, it may be a country that has developed an extremely important action."
"I am very concerned about the disposal of animal meal, because it will take fifteen years to dispose of these products, and concerned too by the possibility of this animal meal being exported for processing and incineration in third countries."
"I do not want this animal meal to go back onto the market in third countries."
"This is a point I think we need to watch."
"It is true that we need scientific activity, but I am convinced that research should be independent."
"I am not convinced by the Böge report when it says that MEPs are joining scientists in monitoring the situation."
"We need separate roles and separate duties."
"I think there is a lot still to be done; in particular, I fail to understand why we have not used all the legal means to bring an action for damages owing to the responsibility of the former British government."
"We need to insist on this and do a lot more, because other countries will also have to assume responsibility with regard to international public opinion."
"Mr President, I cannot personally share the optimism of this debate, because I believe people's lives are at risk, and also the lives of the animals themselves."
"And there are two policy errors, two basic policies which have caused this problem."
"Those two problems are still untouchable; I mean, we know this disease is transmitted through the use of types of meal - and we are now concerning ourselves with paying compensation to the victims - but we have not yet had the courage, in the face of vested interests, to ban the use of animal meal to feed other animals."
"It is not acceptable, Mr President, for us to discuss this situation without discussing the core issue and the means by which the disease is spread."
"The other matter, the other policy at issue is the common agricultural policy."
"As you are aware, Mr President, under the policy, payments are made according to the quantities produced."
"There is no concern about the method or the means of production; production is rewarded according to quantity."
"This violates all the rules of public health and animal protection."
"Unless the Commission gives an unconditional undertaking to ban the use of animal remains in feed for other animals, and unless it gives an unconditional undertaking to change the CAP, which is not on Agenda 2000, in favour of quality, animal health protection and animal welfare, then for my part I shall continue to protest here, Mr President, and use the only weapon at my disposal: my vote against this situation."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, the chairman of the committee and Commissioner Bonino for the work they have done."
"The important thing in the context of the follow-up Committee of Inquiry has been the amount of change that has been implemented by the Commission."
"In a reasonably short amount of time, there has been a complete reorganization of the way food safety is dealt with and I am sure this will increase public confidence and improve food safety by ensuring high standards."
"The key points are reorganization of DG XXIV and transparency in the work of the scientific committees, together with improved monitoring measures and wide dissemination of data."
"While the vast majority of Parliament's recommendations have been fulfilled, there is still plenty more needing to be done."
"The lack of political will at Council level means that we have to keep up pressure to ensure more progress is made to keep the public fully informed about all aspects of nutrition that are important for public health."
"Regaining public confidence is the essential factor in this affair and a real start has been made to achieve this."
"Mr President, like so many others I agree that the consequences of BSE are terrible and tragic."
"At the same time we can still see that BSE has had the effect of making us take the process forward, not least in the Commission."
"We now have greater openness."
"We can also see that we have the chance of having better food safety and a strong consumer perspective."
"I think that is good and I also welcome the measures the Commission has taken."
"For me this is just the beginning of a process which can only go forward."
"For me this does not only concern BSE as a disease, but also other diseases and other parts of our agricultural policy which actually endanger people's health."
"We must therefore have food legislation which is all-embracing from a health point of view."
"We must have a system for registering cattle and a control system which ensures that the legislation is complied with."
"Most important, however, is that we should have a change in agricultural policy which gives us good food throughout the EU."
"Mr President, I congratulate you."
"You have made a good move."
"You have managed to give the impression of being serious about this, which has pacified the conscience of the great majority of MEPs, who were asking for no more than that."
"This is the only thing on which I congratulate you."
"As for the rest, allow me to put a damper on the barrage of praise that the majority of my colleagues have lavished on you."
"You have made important transfers of staff from DG VI to DG XXIV but in practice nothing has changed."
"Consider the last case of this kind in Belgium."
"Information exchange still remains as slow, and the absence of controls still as obvious."
"Is the truth frightening?"
"Quite clearly so."
"And I believe if you hide behind the status of civil servants to abandon putting sanctions in place, it is because in fact, in my opinion, you did not want, and you still do not want, to see who those truly responsible are, those who could have, at a crucial moment between 1985 and 1989, assumed their responsibilities and thus protected the health of the citizens of Europe and the world."
"You have your own internal inquiry services to monitor the actions of the different bodies of the Commission and you do not make use of them."
"Was it necessary, is it necessary, regardless of the suffering of the human victims and their families, regardless of the citizens of Europe as a whole, to prevent for mercenary reasons, as I have understood in my group, the condemnation of Great Britain as responsible?"
"We must not, they say, force the current British government to pay for the errors of the previous regime."
"This is a dangerous short-circuit for the principle of continuity of power."
"British government, Commission, Council, European Parliament, same battle."
"For what?"
"For health?"
"No."
"Against fraud?"
"No."
"Your attitude of refusing responsibility kills political credibility amongst young people, on your knees as you are before the interests of money."
"Pitiful, Mr President, but perhaps with fifty more deaths..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen in the Chamber and looking at the monitors in the office, Mr Böge's report deserves approval."
"But I would have liked more for consumers and more for cattle farmers, whose existence has been endangered by failure in key positions."
"It is not enough to give emphatical warning of disciplinary action in Item 7 of our decision."
"We must name names!"
"In the case of BSE, the fact is that the very high officials who have escaped unpunished, as the Commission wanted, are not the only people to blame."
"The Commission and Council, at least in the case in BSE, have entangled themselves equally in guilt."
"I want instruments which do not just make possible the more flexible handling of disciplinary action which the Commission has promised."
"Ministers in the Council must also be brought to account, otherwise BSE will soon flourish again in another form!"
"Mr President, I would just like to say a few words before leaving Mrs Bonino to reply to a number of the questions that have been discussed, which are appropriate to her own portfolio within the Commission."
"For my part, I would simply like to thank everyone for their contributions, contributions sometimes worth qualifying, I have to say, because we do not share the feeling of certainty that some of you have just touched on with regard to a possible subsequent crisis."
"At the moment, I feel truly humble, I must say."
"I do not know how I would have reacted in 1985, or 1989, when the crisis struck, when it was in its first stages and when the scientists were still not agreed on its causes."
"In terms of the mad cow crisis, I still feel very modest and very humble."
"I would not dare to say that we have come a long way since then."
"If we have come a long way, we have certainly still not reached the culmination of all the efforts we must make."
"And we know very well that, in certain of our Member States, as some have just mentioned, illegal trafficking, which is certainly of a nature that will shake not only our confidence but that of the consumers, is still deplorable."
"All these traffickers, all these criminals are, moreover, also those who are already mixed up in other fraudulent dealings, who have in the past sullied our Community, whether it is a question of trafficking in hormones or whatever else."
"We will never be able to rid ourselves entirely of this type of crime."
"I repeat, I feel very humble in the face of this problem."
"We admitted, from the moment our first appearance before the Committee of Inquiry, that there were some malfunctions within our departments."
"I did not want to accuse my predecessors."
"I nevertheless took political responsibility for the Commission as an institution."
"In this spirit, I believe I can confirm that, all in all, we must work constructively in this area to ensure collaboration which will enable us to straighten out the situation, both good and bad, without letting ourselves be taken in, without giving ourselves false guarantees, which nobody here can give."
"I have just read, in a scientific journal which is an authority in France, La Recherche Scientifique , that scientists have a new theory on the origins of this crisis."
"Let us therefore show humility in the case in point and see to it that consumers, whoever they are, regain confidence in the guarantee of the safety of our food products."
"It is in this direction that we must work and I am happy that there has been a change in climate in the collaboration between the Commission and the House regarding the mad cow crisis."
"I hope that the same climate of confidence is going to be established between ourselves and the Council because we should be well aware that a great responsibility still falls on Member States."
"In this respect, I believe it is essential that we also work to find common ground between our different institutions and the Council."
"This is all I wanted to say."
"I would like to thank you once again for the spirit of collaboration you have shown, but also for the truly determined action your Temporary Committee has carried out to widen perspectives regarding the future management of this crisis."
"It is to this objective that I feel an attachment, this is why we have taken a certain number of measures."
"When, just now, I took stock of the five questions still pending following the reports of the Committee of Inquiry and the Temporary Committee, it was within the context of the jurisdiction of the Commission."
"And I am sure that, if we continue to work as we have been doing, as we have started to do today, we will have set in motion a process, a process which opens up new perspectives, which enables us to hope that consumers will once more regain confidence in the safety of food."
"The debate is closed."
"Voting will take place tomorrow at 12: 00 noon."
"European systems of worker involvement"
"The next item is the report (A4-0354/97) by Mr Menrad, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the final report of the Group of Experts on ""European systems of worker involvement' (Davignon report) (C4-0455/97)."
"Mr President, as you said, this item is on a comment by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs about the final report of the group of experts on European systems of worker involvement, a group which the Commission set up under the chairmanship of Mr Davignon, and consisting of scientists and social partners."
"Its main task was to make proposals about how the position of employees could be defined in the statute of the planned European public company."
"Unsuccessful attempts have been made for more than 25 years to harmonize or coordinate European company law more strongly."
"Very recently, the debate about the legal form of the European public company has flared up again."
"Adoption of an appropriate order about such company forms has failed until now in the Council of Ministers, because it was not possible to agree about the directives which concern the position of employees, and which are linked with this instrument."
"The ideas about involvement and co-determination of employees are very different in the Member States of the European Union and the various social partners."
"This complicated weave of opinions can be disentangled only with great readiness to compromise by all participants."
"I am convinced that involvement and co-determination are a part of the democratization of company law."
"They also mean economic productivity."
"Mr Davignon is right: Only informed, qualified, engaged and motivated employees, who are aware of their responsibilities and who have opportunities for involvement, can develop modern organizational forms and technologies, and deal with them in such a way that all opportunities for sustained development are exploited."
"As well as a statement from the Commission about information and consultation, there was a proposal for a resolution by Parliament, which in important points already led to similar results to the Davignon report."
"On the basis of the Davignon study, the Luxembourg Council Presidency made a compromise proposal to the Council of Social Ministers in October."
"The report of the Social Committee, which is being discussed today, sees a very good basis for discussion in both documents."
"It warns against trying to transfer a particular model of codetermination from a few member countries to the others."
"Co-determination is not an export article, but the more extensive co-determination by employees in countries such as Germany, Austria, the Netherlands or the Nordic countries must also not be evaded using a European legal instrument."
"That could easily have anti-European effects."
"The oft-quoted danger of a flight from co-determination must not simply be brushed aside, because it could happen because of the possibility of converting the company from a national to a European legal form, with reduced possibilities for co-determination."
"Davignon closes this escape route, and we are glad that he has."
"The question which is very often asked is why the directive about the European works council is so successful."
"It can be turned round as you like, the real recipe for the success of the European works council consists of certain procedural principles, which can also play an important part in the development of the co-determination model of a European company: flexibility, negotiated solutions, minimum standards."
"In the case that no agreement is reached between the organization boards and the special negotiating bodies of the employees, a European directive on legal minimum rights of employees should be prescribed."
"Both documents - the Davignon report and the Luxembourg compromise - also provide for economic involvement of employees, when in doubt, by limited representation of fully entitled employees on the administrative and supervisory boards."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs hopes that a political agreement will be reached in the Council of Social Ministers under the Luxembourg Presidency, and in the spirit of our positions."
"I will summarize these briefly again. Social partners must have a decisive role in the formation of rules of involvement, and their cooperation is a precondition."
"Therefore, in my opinion, two signatures are possibly the most important on the Davignon report, those of the representatives of the European trade unions and the employers."
"There must not be a European public company without the involvement of the employees."
"The European model is not the pure market economy, but the social market economy, the important principles of which are involvement of employees and partnership."
"In this spirit, I ask you to agree to this report, and at the same time I thank my colleagues on the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for their support."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights considers that Mr Davignon and his group have done good work on a difficult issue and we are largely in agreement with the conclusions that Mr Menrad has just presented on behalf of the committee in charge, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"The problem of the European company, we know, is that its stumbling block is the place of workers within the company. This has been the case for a long time."
"In fact, this obstruction to the European company leads to another blockage around a different group of issues: the proposal for a fifth directive on company law, for a tenth directive on cross-border mergers, the statute for cooperative societies, mutual societies and associations."
"Mr Davignon and his group also propose a solution to get around the difficulty by advocating a flexible and optional two tier system."
"It is first a question of choice of formula for European companies; indeed nobody is obliged to become a European company, this is already the first option."
"Once this decision has been taken, supremacy is then given to a negotiated solution between union and management who can decide what they want between themselves."
"It is only failing agreement that the ""reference rules' proposed by the Davignon group come into play, on the one hand regarding the information and consultation of workers and on the other their participation on management boards and supervisory boards."
"It is therefore a very flexible system which enables, by leaving a great deal of freedom to the unions and management, a formula to be found which is agreeable to both, which therefore enables the legal structure to be adjusted at the wish of both parties, and which simply, in the final analysis, at that point proposes what is the norm in our countries as a whole, that is one method or another of worker participation in the company."
"It seems to us, and this is noted by the great majority of members of the Committee on Legal Affairs, that this solution is likely to win over a majority in the House and above all to raise, within the Council, objections for which there are no longer grounds."
"Mr President, many of us are convinced that the best instrument for regulating labour relations is dialogue between the social partners, and if that dialogue can be translated into agreements, so much the better."
"At European level, the involvement of the social partners has improved since the first attempts at the beginning of the seventies, but progress has been much too slow."
"The history of the report we are debating today - or of the background to it - is an example of the difficulties which arise when we try to elevate normal national practices to a European level."
"Problems arise in finding common ground on how to define unequivocally what we understand by worker involvement, as regards both what that involvement should consist of, and how to develop that involvement."
"The implementation of the internal market, and the effects of the globalization of our economies, demand that workers' representation and involvement must be elevated to supranational level."
"Today we are trying to unblock the outstanding proposals about this in Council."
"It is a question of having a realistic approach to all the controversial questions relating to worker involvement; of finding formulae which go further than just information and consultation; and achieving worker representation which enjoys real involvement, and is not limited to just being on the receiving end of a little information."
"Mr Menrad's report tries to promote and speed up the debate on these important matters, and allow the European company statute to rapidly achieve full legal status."
"The expert report, known as the Davignon report, found a way of formulating a European system of worker involvement."
"Using this approach, it should be possible to reach agreement in Council and overcome the obstacles which have been encountered so far."
"In its day, the European Works Council Directive found a way to make the different labour-relations models compatible."
"In questions of European companies, it is a matter of achieving the same balanced, flexible agreement (as Mr Cot said a moment ago) in order to guarantee workers' information, consultation and involvement, not by imposing a specific model, but by using a model which is compatible with those currently in force in each of the Member States."
"Mr President, first may I thank the rapporteur Mr Menrad very heartily."
"His understanding and broad vision are reflected in the report."
"He has suggested sensible additions, and the agreement in the Social Committee also shows this."
"The economy of the European Union presses for a statute on a European public company or a European company."
"The Davignon group has done good preparatory work, there is no doubt about that."
"Despite differing structures for participation by employees, the Member States can live with the proposals because, first, changes of legal form to evade co-determination are not possible, and secondly, for those Member States in which the employees themselves do not want participation, a null solution is even possible."
"Thirdly, if the employees and employers do not reach an agreement, after the negotiation period expires a minimum quota of employee representatives is binding."
"Information and consultation of employees are thus ensured."
"The minimum quota seems to the rapporteur to be set too low."
"In this I would like to support him explicitly."
"Likewise, his reference to the need for haste after decades of discussion is surely right, and I also think that the inclusion of the European co-operative associations in the proposal is necessary."
"The Commission's task of convincing the Council, Commissioner Flynn, ought to be entirely possible on the basis of the proposals, which really take account of all objections."
"I wish you much success in this task, in our interests too, and I thank you in advance."
"Mr President, it has been stated that the issue of the status of European companies has been blocked for the last twenty five years, during which our businesses have loudly demanded such a status."
"Thus, for example, in France, a company such as Airbus lacks a legal framework."
"This is the reason why I would today like to thank Mr Menrad for his work on this issue as well as his commitment to worker participation."
"I believe it is important that, in this House, a certain number of Members are motivated to bring the issue of participation to a successful conclusion because it is also one way of making progress in employment policy."
"In spite of this, there are two observations I believe are worth making."
"Firstly, whilst being in agreement with this report, I feel that it is necessary to consider the great diversity of national traditions in the areas of worker information, consultation and participation, and compared to the Davignon report perhaps, where you feel we have found a consensus, or compared to national traditions, to avoid going too far down the path towards a German system of co-management."
"Mr Rapporteur, this is the reason why it would seem reasonable to us that the House does not adopt point 9 of the report which is proposed and, in particular, the last part requesting that a higher threshold than that provided for in the report of the Group of Experts and in the compromise proposal of the Luxembourg Presidency be set for worker representation on supervisory boards."
"Indeed, this seems to me unrealistic and I fear that this will once more thwart the procedure which the Davignon report is today trying to unblock."
"This, Mr President, is what I wanted to say very rapidly on this issue."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Commissioner, we do not need to persuade each other here today that the European form of company partnership offers an excellent opportunity to promote cross-border trading in Europe; thus it ultimately benefits employment."
"The involvement of employees in the running of business cannot be the problem, because it is this which promotes good management."
"So what is the problem?"
"The problem is that Member States do not want to come to an agreement, and are perhaps looking for a bandage to stop the bleeding."
"My question to you is: do fiscal motives play a part, and not just the participation of workers?"
"I make a final plea, to the Member States as well to Commissioner Flynn, to put this issue on the agenda now, formally, or if that is not possible informally, for Thursday and Friday when the Heads of State and of Government meet in Luxembourg, and to see to it that the Luxembourg Presidency produces results."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Menrad on his report and thanking him for his great commitment to this issue."
"I can do nothing but agree with the committee's and the rapporteur's opinions on the report of the group of experts and even with the opinions which have been given on the Luxembourg compromise proposal which means that any statute for European companies would under no circumstances be allowed to result in it being possible to circumvent the workers' right of co-determination in companies."
"Nor shall it be possible to use European legal instruments to circumvent the right of co-determination."
"Furthermore, consideration must be given to the different models for negotiated settlements between the various parties in the labour market which exist in the different Member States."
"The rights which unions enjoy through national legislation or by tradition must also apply to any European companies."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to thank Mr Menrad for his proposal, which we as Social Democrats also support."
"That it has become a minimum consensus, Mr Menrad, is not your fault, but I think that of the Council of Ministers."
"However, I would also like to thank Mr President-in-Office Juncker for making the effort to bring about a compromise at all after many years."
"This proposal also states that we want to use the experience from the debate and the results of the European works council."
"But that also means, Mr Flynn and Mr Juncker, that we must use the negative experience from the works council directive, for example, with Vilvoorde."
"There is a big disproportion in Europe between the opportunities of labour and of capital."
"We have waited for 25 years for this opportunity for co-determination to come about, whereas it took only 25 months to put directives about the internal market into effect."
"It is also not enough to enable employees to own more share capital."
"They must also participate in decision-making. There I think we agree, Mr Menrad."
"The Europe of the internal market, freedom of services and movements of capital even if they are speculative, has become taken for granted."
"We need co-determination by employees and trade unions, further development and perhaps harmonization."
"The reason that we have not come further today, in my opinion, does not lie in the complicated relationships, the different interests or even the different traditions, but quite clearly in the excessive power of capital."
"I would also like to mention that we are happy and satisfied that this directive or consensus was reached together with the trade unions."
"I do not think that the Davignon report assesses that correctly."
"Finally, two principles. First, the trade unions must be represented, and second, there must be further development in the direction of true co-determination."
"Mr President, it is important that worker influence can be guaranteed at all levels and in all kinds of companies."
"The model being proposed here with a voluntary system for European companies is perhaps the most practical."
"It makes it possible for employers and workers in each company to negotiate suitable forms of worker influence themselves through a voluntary system regardless of what country the company is in."
"This is a decentralized system which provides a lot of local influence, which is good."
"The weakness of the system is that the worker side, which is often the weaker in such a negotiating situation, could be put at a disadvantage."
"The agreement could then become quite meaningless, which could mean that in reality European companies can circumvent the whole process."
"That must not be allowed to happen."
"Proposals for minimum rules could therefore be one way to gain influence and a good remedy when negotiations have failed."
"However, to begin with it is national measures which should be taken and which are needed in order to be able to solve this."
"If they are introduced, minimum standards must take into account local rules and local laws on negotiations in each Member State."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Menrad on an excellent report."
"I speak as rapporteur on a European company statute and in particular the directive on involvement of workers."
"The company statute is a voluntary measure and no company, when this proposal is eventually adopted, will be forced to set up a company statute against its wishes."
"Other forms of setting up branches in other countries, such as by subsidiaries, will remain, so there is no need for Member States to fear this proposal."
"As a quid pro quo of setting up a company under the European company statute model, there must be an element of worker involvement."
"The Commission insists on this, and so does Parliament."
"The choice of method of worker involvement is flexible and respects national cultures and traditions."
"Many businesses want to be able to set up European company statutes."
"I urge the Member States that are being difficult over this proposal to wake up."
"Not only are they undermining the position of companies which actively want this proposal, they are also undermining the good work that has been done in this Parliament over the last nine or ten years."
"We need a European company statute, we want one, the workers want one and the business people of Europe want one."
"They must pay heed to the work of the Davignon report experts and also the work of Mr Menrad."
"Let us hurry up and get this sorted out."
"Mr President, I also wish to congratulate Mr Menrad; he has produced a very balanced report."
"We have always enjoyed the charm with which he has introduced all his reports, and he has done the same again!"
"However, as I would like to see this report developed into a successful one, I have to contradict what some of my colleagues have already said about a fair balance of traditions and cultures in industrial relations across the European Union."
"I must point out to our colleagues and comrades alike, in agreement with Mrs Hermange, that indeed we cannot force one model on all countries across the European Union."
"Many of those cultures and traditions are not enjoyed in the same way as perhaps they are enjoyed in Germany or Austria."
"I am quite sure that this is where the sticking-point actually lies - in the compulsory element."
"It is this issue which will unblock this mechanism and will bring about worker involvement, not participation or codetermination, as all the arguments seem to centre on."
"Perhaps if we can be a bit more progressive and rather more flexible about this, we can have a voluntary arrangement between companies and trade unions which will enable them to enjoy the fruits of worker involvement, however far they want to take that."
"I agree with Ms Oddy that this is voluntary in its nature."
"Indeed one would hope that people will be able to spot the difference between that and other ideas about compulsion."
"Let us face the other fact: if people do not join up to the European Statute, will they not be at a competitive disadvantage at some time in the future?"
"These are the thoughts that are going through a lot of people's minds."
"These are the worries and fears that some people are trying to raise."
"These are issues which need to be addressed and they are not being addressed thoroughly enough."
"We have time to do something about that, and Mr Menrad's report goes a long way towards reducing some of the fears and qualms."
"As a compromise arrangement I think and I hope it will be very successful."
"Mr President, let me first of all thank the European Parliament for having taken the initiative to deliver an opinion on the Davignon report and subsequent developments in the dossier on the European company statute within the Council."
"As we all know, there was a clear mandate from the European Council in Amsterdam to make every effort necessary to secure the final adoption of the company statute by the end of this year."
"We are all aware that this will require an early political agreement within the Social Affairs Council on the outstanding issue of worker involvement which will allow the Internal Market Council to finalize the whole dossier in good time."
"The contribution that the European Parliament is about to give to the successful completion of the dossier is of course extremely relevant and I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Menrad, for having once again understood the great difficulty of the challenge that we are facing and the issue of the adequacy of the solutions envisaged, both by the Davignon report and by the compromise proposal presented by the Luxembourg Presidency."
"We all know that these texts give us a real opportunity for the very first time in very many years to make substantive progress on this dossier."
"Let us exploit the opportunity to the greatest possible extent."
"As underlined in the draft text by Mr Menrad, any solution capable of gathering sufficient support within the Council must preserve the autonomy of the social partners in shaping the model of worker involvement which will apply to each European company."
"At the same time we need a reference framework which will apply in the event of failure of negotiations."
"To facilitate consensus among the Member States, this reference framework must incorporate both information and consultation, as well as participation provisions."
"It is not designed to harmonize national laws and practices on worker involvement which differ substantially from country to country."
"Ms Oddy is quite right: this is voluntary and it is available as an option and should be seen as that for the benefit of business and workers."
"Its real purpose consists in meeting the legitimate concerns of some Member States who fear that the European company statute will be used to circumvent national rules on worker involvement, notably with regard to the participation systems."
"But, on the other hand, we also recognize the equally legitimate concern of those who do not wish to have foreign models of worker involvement imposed upon them."
"The priority given to negotiations and to the fact that companies will be dealing, within this context, with mere options will, from the point of view of the Commission, greatly minimize this risk."
"So I am glad to see that these fundamental elements of the possible compromise are fully endorsed here by the European Parliament."
"I would like once again to thank all of you for your support and express my hope that with your help and a lot of good will - and it will require a lot of political good will and a spirit of compromise by all the parties concerned - we will manage to make real and decisive progress in this dossier and fulfil the mandate given by the European Council."
"Once again to you personally, Mr Menrad, I would like to express my thanks, to you and to your colleagues, and to Mr Schiedermeir for his good wishes because it is going to take a fair bit of political goodwill to see this through."
"Mrs Boogerd-Quaak, I know that you were denied some of your time but you made a very valid point that this should be a central issue."
"We hope to achieve the momentum that you have asked for on 15 December at the Social Affairs Council and see this business through finally."
"Thank you all once again."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12: 00."
"Part-time work - Employment"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"(A4-0352/97) by Mrs Jöns, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commissionproposal for a Council Directive concerning the framework agreement on part-time work concluded by UNICE, CEEP and the ETUC (COM(97)0392 - C4-0551/97); -(A4-0353/97) by Mr Hernández Mollar, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission's report ""Employment in Europe - 1997' ."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing the part-time work agreement which the social partners have negotiated after the Council of Ministers failed to achieve an agreement for fourteen years."
"Yet we have nothing to celebrate."
"The agreement falls far short of what this Chamber agreed in 1990, that is to protect all atypical employees from discrimination in both employment law and social insurance."
"The social partners have made an agreement which only affects part-time work."
"They have thus excluded millions of the atypically employed with their specific disadvantages."
"I am thinking of the 14 million short-term employees, but I am also thinking of the 10 million homeworkers and teleworkers, and we all know that teleworking is booming at the moment."
"But there is more."
"Even in this agreement, which is restricted to part-time work, all questions of legal social insurance are bracketed out."
"What is bracketed out is thus precisely the core area in which discrimination of atypical work is manifested financially."
"Now, one could understand that the social partners, just before Amsterdam, did not want to provoke the Member States with regulations on social insurance, to avoid gambling with the inclusion of the Social Chapter in the treaty."
"But the part-time work agreement has more gaps, because whereas we get only an agreement on part-time work, which completely brackets out legal social insurance, we ought to be able to expect at least that employment law and occupational social security benefits are clearly defined and regulated by European minimum standards."
"But this is not the case!"
"Each Member State can define national exceptions to the praiseworthy principle of non-discrimination, just as it pleases."
"Admittedly objective reasons must be given, but the room for manoeuvre is immense."
"For instance, a whole group of employees can be completely excluded from the principle of non-discrimination."
"I am speaking here of part-time employees who work occasionally, as it is so nicely put in the outline agreement."
"Also, the length of employment, the working hours or even the amount of income can be reasons for further national exceptions for all part-time employees."
"This means that the Member States can, at their own discretion, define thresholds below which discrimination can continue with enthusiasm."
"A European principle of nondiscrimination thus exists only on paper, but the national right to exceptions is concrete."
"All the other regulations are recommendations, for which there is no legal redress."
"In a time in which we all want to create more employment, not least through flexible forms of work and shorter working hours, this really does not contribute to more making part-time work more attractive."
"If we nevertheless agree to the proposal for putting the outline agreement into effect, this is only because at least it does no harm."
"It does not prevent a single Member State from making better regulations."
"But this does not alter the fact that the Commission is now required to submit, as quickly as possible, a proposal to put an end to discrimination against part-time work in social insurance law."
"That is particularly important to me because 80 % of part-time employees are women."
"But the Commission must also make proposals for removing discrimination in the other forms of atypical work, in both areas, employment law and social insurance."
"Let us say here to the social partners: Even if this Chamber agrees to the agreement on part-time work, this is by no means a licence to assume that we shall accept similar weak agreements without minimum standards in future."
"The social dialogue is a tender plant."
"I will bet that future agreements will have more substance."
"After all, this is only the second agreement since the Social Chapter."
"Mr President, Commissioner, with only a few days left now before the Luxembourg summit, this may be the last debate before the Heads of State and of Government confront a challenge in which perhaps the people of Europe have more hopes invested than any other."
"The report which I am presenting to the House was approved by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs with only two abstentions."
"The gravity of the unemployment situation in the European Union is dramatic, even though it is improving."
"The whole of European society needs to be aware of the sheer size of the problem with which we are confronted."
"It is a problem which directly threatens the very foundations of the Union."
"When we talk about solving the problem of unemployment, we need a sound basis for our analyses."
"There is only one realistic formula for reducing unemployment in an economy such as ours: to create useful jobs."
"Everything else is, as we say in Spain, ""bread for today and hunger for tomorrow' ."
"Useful jobs are mainly produced by businesses - more specifically, by small and medium-sized enterprises. In order for this to happen, the right climate has to be created, to allow them to survive and be competitive."
"Any government can create jobs by decree, by increasing the number of civil servants or reducing working hours, but these are only short term solutions."
"In the end, this sort of solution damages the economies which resort to them. The long term effect, in an increasingly open and globalized climate, is that unemployment rises to levels even higher than those which led to such measures being applied in the first place."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam, on the other hand, represents the will to coordinate national policies, in order to create more jobs."
"The common objectives are very commendable, and in some ways they are necessary."
"But let us not deceive ourselves: objectives do not create jobs."
"There have been many objectives set and plans made, from Essen up to the present day, but unemployment figures remain almost static. What we need is to achieve the Member States' own objectives, as set out in their multiannual employment plans."
"That, of course, is compatible with the continuing development of their policies."
"Mr President, I should like to share with the House my understanding of what the ten commandments for employment could be."
"Firstly, to complete monetary union successfully, which is not an end in itself, but an instrument for restructuring the macro-economic climate."
"Secondly, to give priority to government policies on education and training, so that our young people and long-term unemployed can gain access to the jobs market with proper and effective qualifications."
"Thirdly, to reform the Member States' fiscal systems, in favour of job creation."
"Fourthly, to facilitate sources of funding for small and medium-sized enterprises, removing administrative and bureaucratic obstacles, and making self-employment easier."
"Fifth, to improve and complete the internal market, increasing workers' mobility, and removing language and cultural barriers, and the protection of interests."
"Sixth, to promote dialogue and social contact at sectoral, national and European level, studying new ways of organizing work, and new conditions in which to develop them (including, of course, reduced working hours, new formulae for contracts, and workers' protection and health), and proposing these measures to workers and employers."
"Seventh, to increase the role of local authorities in the search for solutions, and to involve the private sector also, encouraging jobs which spring from social solidarity, the voluntary sector, cultural rehabilitation and leisure itself, and the by-products of new sources of work: regional employment plans urgently need to be put into effect."
"Eighth, to improve infrastructures, and support innovation within companies, and the application of new technologies."
"The ninth point is the creation of the right conditions to end the discrimination suffered by women: we have to do away with those regrettable statements still heard today in our society - that women deprive men of their jobs."
"Work is the traditional right of every human being, and does not belong specifically to either men or women."
"Both should work together - with governments as well - to create the necessary family and social conditions to grant women access to the jobs market. There is no doubt that part-time work is a good way to achieve this."
"Lastly, Mr President, Mr Commissioner, the tenth point is to modernize our social security system."
"No European citizen wants to lose what society won long ago, but our companies cannot be weighed down by social burdens, and pension payments cannot be supported just on the shoulders of an ever-decreasing active population."
"We have to face this problem with courage."
"Mr President, those are my final thoughts as we approach a summit which all the people of Europe hope will provide realism and concrete political commitments."
"Thirty million people want a job."
"A man or woman without a job ends up rejecting the society to which they belong."
"Economic and social exclusion causes despair, and a serious decline in the society where it occurs."
"We have to compete - not just at the level of economies and markets, but also at the level of people's hopes and confidence, for the Europe we all want to see in the twenty-first century."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the employment summit will be the yardstick for the social profile of Europe."
"The employment profile makes the ills we have to overcome very clear."
"Because great successes in the creation of jobs will be thanks not just to labour market policy, but at the same time we need a macro-economic policy which promotes economic growth and does not put brakes on it."
"Here there is more to be done."
"We should not always be talking only about the deregulation of job markets, their modernization and restructuring, or about people's employability."
"We must create economic conditions so that we finally bring the gainfully employed ratio in the European Union close to the Japanese and American ratio of 70 %."
"Only that meets our social obligations."
"We therefore certainly need a prompt start of currency union, so that monetary policy can play its constructive part at European level."
"But we obviously also need coordination of economic policies, and the indescribably indifferent attitude of the finance ministers must be overcome at the European summit in Luxembourg."
"We must switch to targets, to reduction of the unemployment rate and redirection to an active job market policy."
"But above all we must do more in relation to investment."
"Investment is the key."
"When I think that job-creating investment in production plant rose by 30 % between 1989 and 1996 in the USA, but by only 5 % in Europe, we can imagine the difference in the employment trend."
"I must say that benchmarking for employment and benchmarking for investment must be added to our vocabulary."
"This does not only involve pump-priming for private investment, but also redirection of infrastructure investment, public investment, from wasting it on subsidies to employmentoriented public expenditure."
"Mr President, I rise to put forward the view of the Committee on Fisheries about this important report on employment, drawing attention firstly to the fact that the question of employment takes on special characteristics in the fisheries sector."
"Matters relating to employment and working conditions in the fisheries sector are perhaps the least developed aspects of Community fisheries policy at the moment."
"This is a significant lack, when you consider that since the seventies, this sector has been suffering from continual erosion, leading to constant job losses, deteriorating working conditions, decreased job security, and so on."
"In fact, the consequent lack of attractiveness is resulting in an aging workforce which is no longer being renewed by fresh generations."
"As we all know, the new international law of the sea, enshrining 200 miles as the exclusive zone for the exploitation of fishing resources by coastal states, meant that the Community fleet found itself with excess capacity. This has produced a constant demand for reductions in both the ocean-going and the small-scale coastal fleet, resulting in an alarming loss of jobs."
"To quote just one example, in the case of Spain, which has the greatest fishing capacity of any country in the Community, nearly 20 % of jobs in this sector have been lost over the last ten years."
"The loss of jobs in the fisheries sector has in some cases had a dramatic impact, since many of these jobs - especially in small-scale coastal fishing, which is labour-intensive in terms of processing and related jobs (shipyards, marketing, etc.) as well as the actual fishing - are located in outlying regions heavily dependent on fisheries, where at present there are few real opportunities for converting to other activities."
"Furthermore, since the phenomenon affects outlying regions of the Community, this can only serve to exacerbate the conditions I have already described."
"Therefore - and I am just finishing - the Committee on Fisheries urges the European Commission to draw up a detailed study of employment and working conditions in this sector, and to undertake specific revisions of the directive in relation to the question of jobs."
"Mr President, first I would like to thank Mr Hernández Mollar for his, in my opinion, excellent report."
"Especially excellent, by the way, because it contains two issues which could provide a correction to the decisions made last time on the report to the summit on employment."
"These are, in paragraph 10, a clarification on the shift from tax on labour to other factors we consider necessary and also a clear request in paragraph 15 to instigate research into the feasibility of the system proposed by Michel Rocard to modulate social security contributions between the first 32 hours worked and the remainder."
"Other speakers have already said that this report has to be seen above all in the light of the summit in Luxembourg, and I also think that this must be the first subject under discussion here in this debate."
"This summit is a first step, is what has frequently been heard during these past few weeks."
"That is true in itself, but it is often said as if it is an excuse to ensure that the step taken will be small."
"I believe that this first step should be a very clear one."
"Clear enough to inspire trust, trust on the part of the citizen that finally, after all those exaggerated stories, after that huge amount of paperwork, there will be action."
"I would like to concentrate on what is the least that action should achieve."
"There should be concrete targets both at European and international level."
"There is resistance because people are afraid that they will not be able to meet those targets."
"I would like to point out that this fear did not exist when targets were formulated for the EMU."
"At that time the criteria could not be tough enough, and were aimed very high."
"I conclude from this that the issue is above all one of political will."
"A political will to promote an employment policy, and the political will to recognize that the out-dated belief that EMU will lead to economic growth and that economic growth automatically leads to employment is wrong, and that we should pursue a much more active labour market policy."
"Secondly, a important goal is benchmarking: to direct our policy, our targets at the performance of the three countries with the best performance."
"If you take those targets no-one will be able to say that they are not realistic, because you have at least three countries which meet those targets."
"And for the first time, at last, you are not involved in this dismal process of harmonizing to the level of the lowest common denominator, but at the level of the best."
"I would think that that will give people much more hope."
"Finally, various objectives should be set, but above all, as a priority, a policy that guarantees that young people under 25 will never be unemployed."
"They should have a job, or be in training, and all long-term unemployed should be given a second chance to re-enter the job market."
"And, last but not least, in the Delors White Paper there is finally a serious decision about tax reductions, the shift from tax on labour to the environment, to raw materials and to capital."
"Mr President I would like to thank Mr Hernández Mollar sincerely for the excellent report he has produced, and also for the ten commandments for employment, which he spelled out a short time ago."
"Much has been said about the summit in Luxembourg, but we must realize that we are now involved in an exercise which rises above that, which constantly tries to improve the still unhappy employment situation in the European Union."
"I am sometimes surprised at how sad people feel when we discuss Luxembourg."
"When it is the socialists who are particularly sad, I want to say: look at the numbers; look at the twelve of the fifteen governments in which socialists are represented."
"If the summit fails, then it will be a failure of socialist Heads of Government, so beware of that."
"I believe there is still hope for the summit, and I hope that we can keep this afloat."
"But we are discussing the report by Mr Hernández Mollar who has given an exceptionally accurate analysis of the situation, and also of what we have already done in the past and what we should continue to do."
"There is little I can add to that."
"The other item on the agenda is the Jöns report on part-time work."
"This report, too, has created quite a storm."
"I originally wondered how it would be possible to discuss these two very different reports in one debate, but actually it makes complete sense."
"In a number of countries, including my own, part-time work has contributed more to the reverse of the unemployment figures than anything else, and it has done so in a way that conforms to the market."
"But then part-time work should, of course, be remunerated in the same way and be treated in the same way as full-time work, in such a way that we get rid of the outdated idea that part-time work is some sort of secondary employment, employment that does not count."
"It was not an easy report."
"We know that."
"We fought very hard for it and for us the most important issue is that we as social partners should formulate an agreement that says that we will not interfere in the content of the agreement."
"We can reject the agreement."
"We can accept it, but we should not take halfway measures."
"I think that in the amendments which are now on the table, we have found some kind of halfway house."
"The Jöns report states quite rightly that it is incomplete, that we will have to do more for atypical industrial relations than this report alone, that this might be a small contribution."
"But it is the first contribution to this debate, and that is more than we have had so far."
"That is why I think it is important to support the agreement."
"And also to ask the Commission, to ask you, Mr Flynn, to take the necessary extra steps so that we come up with a balanced package, because then we will be further helping to defeat unemployment."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Jöns for her report which draws attention to the nature of the work contract between employees in part-time work and their employers and the many ways in which discrimination against these workers occurs."
"There are a number of other serious implications arising from parttime work which should be brought to the attention of the Commission."
"The main one is the exclusion from certain EU-sponsored schemes of many of the least well-off in our society."
"I regret to say that this situation pertains principally to my own country, Ireland."
"I refer, for example, to the Commission's programme for rural development or accompanying measures under the common agricultural policy."
"In this report and in the Commission document, great importance is attached to the need for proper provision for social security and pensions for part-time workers."
"Yet, the Irish Department of Agriculture is at this very moment debarring applicants from the EU's early retirement scheme for farmers if they are found to have been engaged in part-time work for a period prior to their application."
"I do not refer here to farmers with large holdings which are commercially viable."
"I speak of those farmers with holdings of 15 or 16 hectares who simply must supplement their incomes with off-farm work in order to survive."
"Surely it was to these farmers that schemes such as the retirement scheme were in the first instance directed."
"And the matter does not end there."
"For these small-scale farmers, who one would have considered unfortunate enough not to have secured some type of part-time work, the option of work on state sponsored schemes became available."
"Yet, what do we discover?"
"We discover that the modest amount they have earned on these short-term schemes is also being used to keep them out of the retirement scheme."
"Before they ever reach this stage, our Department of Agriculture is seeing fit to exclude them from certain premium payments by making an assessment against them for this off-farm income."
"It was always my opinion that the taxation system of our Member State was there to regulate the amount of money that an individual earned."
"If they earned over a certain amount they were taxed on that amount and that was the end of the matter."
"The majority of farmers are in that network."
"Yet it seems to me that what is going on here is discrimination of the most blatant nature."
"The weakest and traditionally most vulnerable of our rural community, in terms of social welfare, and smaller farmers are being dealt with in the harshest and most unjust manner by our state."
"I most certainly hope and believe that it is against every objective and principle of the Commissioner's directive that a Member State should be allowed to manipulate what is essentially an EU social benefit in this way."
"Mr President, I would also like to congratulate both rapporteurs on their reports."
"Many of the issues which have been raised in the Hernández Mollar report, have been under discussion here on account of the van Velzen report."
"I would like to bring one more point to the attention of the Commissioner, and that is that despite fine words about tax reductions, tax on labour has risen again from 43.5 % to 51 % at present."
"I think that most of the emphasis on Thursday and Friday should be directed at shifting tax on labour to other sources, as recommended in the Hernández Mollar report."
"Mr President, the Jöns report is also under discussion."
"Here you may ask yourself to what extent we can leave this to the social partners."
"I see no sign of the participation of small and medium-sized business in the social dialogue."
"But now, in principle, that we have left the issue to the social partners, this is where the main responsibility lies."
"With each company they will have to give flesh and blood to this agreement in collective labour and others agreements, because we are not doing it now."
"And that is why I wonder whether we should continue to deal with proposals like this in this way."
"Mr President, I would like to ask Commissioner Flynn which proposals on the issue of shifting tax on labour to other sources he considers achievable at the summit in Luxembourg."
"Perhaps he can indicate whether tax on energy or other taxes will indeed now stand a chance."
"Mr President, first I would like to congratulate Mrs Jöns on the splendid degree of skill she has brought to this difficult issue: the blanket agreement concerning part-time work."
"What we have before us is the result of labour market negotiations."
"Given this, it is very difficult to reject this proposal, although its shortcomings are evident."
"I think the rapporteur has come to the right conclusion in proposing that the results of these negotiations should come in for some strong criticism, though their acceptance is recommended."
"The greatest problem with the blanket agreement is its limited scope."
"The agreement affects only part-time workers and totally ignores others in atypical employment relationships."
"However, it is just these groups of workers that have problems which, as the report states, are often greater than those of regular part-time workers."
"The Commission must immediately start drafting a motion for the equal treatment of those in untypical employment relationships, who remain left out of this motion for a directive."
"Furthermore, I am afraid that there is a danger that the same kind of watered-down decision will come out of the Luxembourg Employment Summit as from this part-time work contract."
"Messages emanating from yesterday's marathon meeting of the Council of Ministers have not, at least around me, increased optimism for the prospect of getting very clear and concrete decisions on how we might improve the employment situation in Europe on any large scale."
"Hopefully my fears are groundless, but yesterday's meeting of the Council of Ministers was not very promising."
"Even the Commission has shown more initiative and been more active that the Council of ministers and individual states appear to have been."
"I also wonder about the attitude of my own country, given that it is not interested in the Commission's proposal to reduce the VAT burden on services."
"But that would help to create those very jobs which are badly needed in the service sectors."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Commissioner, many of us have great hopes leading up to the forthcoming summit in Luxembourg."
"There are not many days left to go."
"Above all it must be the 30 million unemployed who hope that this summit will achieve great things."
"I am not so sure that it will, but let us still hope."
"Many people believe that growth is the only thing that can help us out of unemployment. Even Mr Hernández Mollar does so in his report."
"I believe that we are going to fail if we believe that growth will get us out of this mess."
"I do not believe, you see, that there is one single solution. I believe there are very many solutions in which we must have faith."
"These solutions look very different depending on what country, what region and what local conditions we are speaking of."
"One such solution, which we must allow to bloom, might be to concentrate on the most serious problem we have, youth unemployment."
"We Greens believe that you must guarantee young people training positions in companies if they are ever to get a job."
"Otherwise they will end up outside the labour market for a long time."
"We have to be able to give them a paid apprenticeship for a lengthy period, perhaps even up to two years."
"We must also encourage and support what we call the third sector or the social economy (a loved child has many names) which is concerned with cooperatives, non-profit-making organizations, small businesses, things concerned with cultural work, with nursing, caring and that type of activity."
"In Sweden there are in fact examples showing that this is the sector which is growing most rapidly; i.e. small cooperatives and the third sector."
"It is also absolutely essential to have an environmental tax reform linked to a reduction of tax on work."
"I totally disagree with Mr Hernández Mollar regarding the wonderfulness of EMU and that EMU is the most important thing for getting results where employment is concerned."
"There are well-known economists, Mr Hernández Mollar, who maintain the precise opposite, and we have already seen the effects of EMU with the cutbacks which have been made."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Hernández Mollar for the quality of his report on employment in Europe in 1997."
"Eighteen million unemployed, very different social legislation from one country to another, economic policies that are still too nationalist, a growth rate which is still not sufficient to create true jobs and to curb, let alone reduce, the European scourge of unemployment."
"In the face of this balance sheet, we today have the proposals from the European Commission along with the European summit in Luxembourg which will take place in 48 hours."
"My group, the European Radical Alliance, is happy with the proposals made by the Commission."
"How could you not subscribe to them in the face of the failures of national employment policies, at least to date?"
"How could you not accept the setting of quantifiable objectives at last, aimed at effectively fighting unemployment in Europe?"
"On this point, it is unacceptable that Germany and Spain are blocking the process which is to be undertaken in Luxembourg in a few days time."
"The guidelines in these proposals will enable the creation of nearly 12 million jobs by the year 2003 and bring the rate of unemployment down from 10.6 % to 7 %."
"An SME/SMI plan, professional training for 25 % of those unemployed, technological innovations, reduction of costs, these are the strong points of this plan."
"Very good. But we could go further, be more daring, more ambitious."
"At a time when the European Employment Summit is about to open in Luxembourg, European public opinion would not understand if we were unable to propose a strong project for employment in Europe, unable to admit the urgency, to search at a European level for solutions to this problem that undermines, traumatizes and weakens each one of our countries."
"After European peace and security, which have been assured for decades by the European Union, employment is the main concern of our citizens and a good measure of the health of our societies and of the dignity of our workers."
"I support a socialist government in France, which has placed employment at the heart of the European project and it is, perhaps, to reply to one of my colleagues who was asking just now, because there are today a majority of socialist governments in Europe that the Luxembourg meeting may result in a true European employment policy, which we can but welcome."
"ECU 800 million of aid to SMEs, European status for company heads and workers, improved European rates of enterprise creation, the development of small home-based industries, the lightening of the tax burden, there are so many factors which could enable us to go further."
"Let us take courage, if we want to give meaning to Europe, if we want to make it credible and useful to our citizens."
"A coordinated employment policy is required. We need a Europe which leads the battle, here in Parliament as well as in Luxembourg, for modernization of our social relations."
"After the failure of a social Europe, we must not mess up the employment meeting in Europe."
"The citizens of Europe would never forgive us."
"Mr President, I consider the report by Mr Hernández Mollar to be extremely important. This report of the Community Commission was given an almost unanimous vote in this committee."
"Of course I also congratulate and thank its rapporteur, Mr Hernández Mollar. Mr Flynn, the report was based on a very valuable piece of work undertaken by the Commission."
"Today, just a few hours before the special summit on jobs, we in Parliament are having a debate on the same issue. Quite by chance rather than by good fortune."
"I believe that this is our opportunity to send out a strong, separate political message, but one without political oratory and without political rhetoric, but with political action."
"I do not feel pessimistic concerning the special summit meeting the day after tomorrow. What does worry me of course is the widespread - and well-worn - pessimism about the outcome of the meeting."
"Yet I believe that this meeting may, and please forgive my pomposity, be of historic importance. Since those citizens, that nightmarish number of our fellow citizens who are trapped in the vicious circle of unemployment, in the final analysis do not care about who or what is to blame, but value, quite rightly, solutions and results."
"This means those responsible must shoulder their obligations and take action."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mr Hernández Mollar on his report and on a very good speech."
"I would just like to add and to reiterate that jobs can only be created through many more successful and expanding companies."
"Particularly in the debate on employment politicians appear to be concentrating exclusively on measures which tackle the symptoms rather than the disease."
"Many of us appear to want to regulate a bit more."
"But I think that some of the wording in the Jöns report suggests a fear of leaving anything unregulated."
"We must look upon the new age with confidence."
"I believe that employees and employers need to have more room for individual agreements."
"Quite clearly the labour markets also need to have fewer regulations."
"It can be seen that countries with a lower level of regulation have also succeeded best in the fight against unemployment."
"The UK under a Conservative government is a prime example."
"The Commission's guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States for 1998 emphasizes four sound concepts."
"I welcome the debate on individual people's employability and adaptability."
"But the keyword is entrepreneurship."
"From 1988 to 1995 small and medium-sized businesses in Europe created 250, 000 new jobs per year, while businesses with more than 100 employees lost 200, 000 jobs."
"These 250, 000 new jobs are good, but are not sufficient."
"That is why the policy must now be aimed at avoiding barriers to new jobs by having more growing companies."
"For that we should not switch taxes, but reduce them."
"Working hours will also have to be flexible."
"Again I say to this House: the EU's Member States should not give up prosperity and growth through job sharing."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs for their work, which falls within the remit of improving employment policy on the eve of the European Summit."
"I believe that our work has shown that we have a spirit of confidence and determination with regard to this summit, because it is what our citizens are asking for."
"It also shows the political will of the European Parliament to make progress in this area."
"Furthermore, my group has demonstrated this, because we proposed the anticipated allocation of ECSC surpluses to EIB loans for SMEs which create jobs."
"It is a concrete proposal to make progress in this area."
"Personally, I would have liked to see us go further and that the employment summit would enable social indicators to be defined, for I believe that our citizens do not understand very well why criteria exist with regard to Maastricht but not with regard to social policy."
"Mr Commissioner, I would like to make a concrete proposal: as the Summit will last two days, I propose that on the first day, the Heads of State reflect, but that on the second day they invite fifteen young unemployed people from Europe and they tell them clearly what proposals they could offer them so that, tomorrow, they can find work."
"Share this proposal with the Heads of State and of Government."
"This would prove their concrete determination to make progress on this issue."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I believe our most important task in the eyes of the general public is to solve unemployment in Europe."
"That is why many people, including myself and others, have great expectations of the Luxembourg summit. In fact, it must not fail."
"We need a positive business climate."
"We need reduced tax on employment and increased tax on environmental and natural resources, as many have said."
"We need new companies to grow which can take advantage of the future recycling society with new environmental technology, etcetera."
"We need simpler and cheaper services."
"We need to support female enterprise, and not just with regard to jobs for women."
"We also need lots of local solutions."
"I do not believe in any fiscal or financial policy."
"Nor do I believe that EMU is a kind of 'open sesame' which is going to solve all the unemployment problems in the EU."
"That is not how things work."
"But now that there are proposals for convergence criteria for budgets and for inflation targets, there must also be convergence criteria for employment in order to balance out the budget and inflation targets."
"That is why it is necessary to introduce these kinds of convergence criteria, with the same standards, requirements and levels as for budgets and inflation, as a step towards solving the problem of unemployment."
"However, measures must be taken at the national level."
"Mr President, I am going to speak on the framework agreement on parttime work, but first I should like to congratulate my compatriot Mr Hernández Mollar for his work and his speech."
"Two types of part-time work exist at the moment. One relates to so-called corporate strategy, which is defined according to company interests."
"The second type corresponds to the strategy of the individual, in which employers adapt to their workers' needs."
"Obviously, the first type is the most common. This means that, generally speaking, part-time work does not satisfy the requirements of the people who are obliged to do it, most of whom - over 80 % - are women."
"Mrs Jöns, I congratulate you on your report."
"I agree with both the thinking behind it and the resolution."
"Above all, I support the idea that this agreement should contribute to overcoming the gender-specific segregation of the labour market, and that no direct or indirect discrimination on the grounds of gender can ever be justified."
"In calling on the Commission to prepare an annual report on part-time workers, I hope that my amendment requesting a specific chapter on the situation of women will be supported. My amendment was inspired by the following question: does part-time work liberate women and represent progress on the issue of equal opportunities, or does it perpetuate the traditional division of roles and fail to benefit women at all?"
"I hope that chapter can be written, so that we can have an answer to this question."
"Mr President, the agreement between the social partners on part-time work is, to be honest, even more dreadful than the original one which covered parental leave; what is more, the treatment of part-time workers is undermined by countless exceptions in this agreement, and the flexi-workers have simply been fobbed off."
"How is it possible that the European Trade Union Congress agreed to this?"
"Mrs Jöns uttered serious accusations in her report."
"It is no coincidence that the agreement was reached ten days before the Amsterdam Summit, and in doing so the social partners sacrificed the importance of part-time and flexiworkers to the preservation of their position of power in the new treaty."
"I am afraid that Mrs Jöns is right about that."
"Perhaps the fact that more than 80 % of part-time workers and most flexi-workers are women plays a part in this."
"Or should I say: after all, they are only women, gentlemen of the trade unions."
"We are on the threshold of the summit on employment, which is in danger of becoming a disaster, although I understand that Mr Pronk continues to have faith in the socialist leaders."
"This agreement, too, is a missed opportunity to stimulate part-time work, and thereby create new jobs."
"We really must get rid of this corporatist procedure which farms out European social policy to social partners without there being a parliamentary driving force."
"In her original draft resolution Mrs Jöns took the view that the agreement, and I quote her original resolution, does not need to be transformed by a Council directive, because this contributes neither to uniform standards, nor to increased legal security."
"That was a brave and appropriate conclusion."
"But unfortunately it had disappeared from the current report."
"Yet I continue to agree wholeheartedly with that original vision."
"I would like to ask Mr Flynn if he plans to do anything with the amendments which this Parliament will adopt, and when will the Commission produce the additional directive for atypical work, as is requested in paragraph 14."
"Because this is particularly important in this case."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the employment report for 1997 confirms the worsening of the job market situation in many details."
"Women's unemployment has risen further, youth unemployment is at 20 %, relaxation is not in sight."
"The reasons for the high unemployment lie firstly in the trend of business activity, which continues to be bad, but also in structures which have become rigid, and make it more and more difficult to act nimbly in international competition."
"Fair competition within the EU is also made impossible because of the existence of different social and environmental standards in the individual Member States of the EU."
"The consequence is that the net growth of jobs in 1996 is entirely due to part-time jobs."
"This is a disturbing development, which offers no real solutions, above all for socially weak groups, and above all for women."
"Low income, bad social security and low chances of improvement are the start of social impoverishment."
"The special Luxembourg summit on employment questions takes place against this background."
"A summit which is linked with high expectations, because the Commission has announced the ambitious goal of 12 million jobs."
"It is in the nature of things that much is expected of those who promise much, and there will be deep disappointment in the end if these goals are not achieved."
"Mr President, I wish to express my congratulations to Karin Jöns for the excellent report and thorough work she has undertaken on the issue of part-time work."
"Secondly, I wish to congratulate and thank the Commissioner and the social partners for making some progress after many years of difficulties; but it is a qualified thank you and qualified congratulations."
"I want to refer specifically to the position of women, who make up over 80 % of part-time workers in the European Union."
"In many Member States such part-time workers do not enjoy equal rights with full-time workers."
"This is reflected in their pay and pension entitlements."
"For example, women working full-time receive on average 80 % of men's full-time pay."
"However, in the United Kingdom women working part-time receive on average only 58 % of the average hourly earnings of men who work full-time."
"This pay gap between women working part-time and men working full-time has not narrowed in the last 20 years."
"The low pay of women part-time workers is reflected in their current social insurance entitlements."
"Again an example from the United Kingdom: 2.25 million women workers - mainly those working part-time - are excluded from social insurance schemes because their wages are too low."
"This inequality between part and full-time workers is increasingly contributing to the fastest growing group of the poor in Europe. That group is older women."
"A recent study illustrated that two-thirds of older women are receiving minimum pensions compared with one-third of older men."
"The framework agreement is a small, but I hope significant, step in a process which may lead to greater equality since it will allow part-time workers the opportunity to compare their positions with full-time workers and require employers to address the issues of equal treatment and equal pay."
"However, the agreement, as Karin Jöns' report thoroughly demonstrates, is very limited in its scope, and it is necessary for the Commission to draw up a new draft directive which will protect all atypical workers against discrimination."
"If the Commission's proposals for its employment guidelines for 1998 are to take effect, then it is important that the Commission draws up some legislation and brings it before the institutions so that this can be implemented."
"We need to ensure that all our workers have equal protection in the social field and in terms of employment, pay and conditions."
"Mr President, I should also like to congratulate Mrs Jöns and Mr Hernández Mollar on their reports. I would like to focus on the Hernández Mollar report."
"As many speakers have already said, coming up to the Employment Summit, it is one of the key areas where Parliament could at last have its voice heard by the Council and the Heads of Government."
"Despite what other people may think, some brilliant ideas come from this Parliament."
"I know there is a lot of rubbish but there are some very good ideas."
"In particular, in Mr Hernández Mollar's report one sees the basis for employment creation and, most importantly of all, employment retention - looking at ways of maintaining jobs as well as creating new ones."
"If I were to hope for anything from the Employment Summit it would be for the Commissioner to come forward with three suggestions."
"Firstly, that tourism as an employment growth area be recognized."
"Secondly, that the small and medium-sized enterprise sector, which has been spoken about by other colleagues, be given freedom to operate and create new jobs and new economic growth within the whole European Union."
"Thirdly, previously wrong decisions of the Council, Commission and European Parliament should be overturned."
"In particular, the question of the abolition of duty-free in 1999, which will cost us over 400, 000 jobs."
"Those are practical measures which can assist employment growth and retention."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to express my congratulations to Mrs Karin Jöns for her report, which quite accurately exposes the problems caused directly or indirectly by the Agreement that was signed by the bodies of the European organizations of employers and employees and which, unfortunately, lags far behind the settlements which have been elaborated by the International Work Organization or which are already being implemented in certain Member States."
"Mr President, we are faced with two sides of the same problem, with enormous implications for the living and working conditions of working people."
"On the one hand, an entire operation to make part-time employment common practice, a whole range of atypical forms of employment, the major responsibility for which lies in the general orientation of the economic and social policy of the European Union."
"On the other hand, the provocative downgrading of those rights concerning not only the part-time employed, but also all atypical forms of work, which are placing millions of workers at the mercy of their employer, with dramatic reductions in wages, in holiday entitlements, in benefits, in hours of work and in social security."
"Working people are being called upon, through this virulent and unjust treatment and through the widespread increase in poverty, to shoulder the burden of strengthening the competitiveness of European capital."
"It would appear that the European trades unions that have signed this agreement have assumed enormous responsibilities towards working people."
"On the contrary, in fact this agreement promotes employer immunity and in no case does it cover the rights of working people in part-time employment."
"It is also clear that the European Union has not freed itself of its own enormous responsibilities by promoting a legal basis which downgrades rather than promotes the labour, wage and security rights of working people."
"As a result it is necessary to promote measures for the defence of those who nevertheless will work under part-time or atypical work agreements. Above all, however, an obstacle must be placed in the way of the anti-labour logic of the push to make flexible employment common practice."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Hernández Mollar for an altogether outstanding report."
"On two previous occasions I have talked about the employment situation."
"Now that we are debating it again, we can note that the situation has improved slightly."
"But, in spite of everything, we now have a new situation."
"This time we have a new treaty with a partially new content."
"We also have a summit on employment which shall take place this week."
"I hope that this summit does not become one more in a series of summits between Heads of Government from which people emerge with a 'book of poetry' which is put on the shelf and taken out on ceremonial occasions."
"We now need concrete objectives: concrete objectives with regard to youth unemployment, concrete objectives with regard to long-term unemployment and concrete objectives with regard to an active labour market policy."
"We also need a major effort in the area of training measures and a proper effort in the area of small and medium-sized businesses."
"I would like to comment on a few things."
"The question of EMU and its effects on employment are disputed."
"What I say is that it cannot be disadvantageous to a long-term rise in employment to have balanced budgets, to have low inflation and to have low interest rates."
"Seen in the long term that can only be good."
"We now have that situation in Europe, so we should now have an opportunity for long-term growth in employment."
"Secondly, Mrs Carlsson from Sweden, who is not here right now, said that there was a clear link between deregulation and higher employment."
"That is not true."
"Before Mrs Carlsson became a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we had the Molitor report, which investigated this question."
"We looked into it on the committee and there is no such link."
"If we look at the countries in Europe which have the highest levels of employment, they do not have the most deregulated labour markets."
"Finally, I want to tell Mr Pronk that it is true that there are 12 Social Democratic governments."
"We shall try to influence them prior to the employment summit."
"However, I believe that the most important person to talk to is Helmut Kohl."
"I therefore think that is what Mr Pronk should do, since that is the greatest obstacle leading up to this employment summit."
"Mrs Lulling wishes to speak on a point of order."
"Mr President, I note with amazement that we are interrupting this debate for Question Time, and that it will not be continued until 9 p.m."
"I know that we are running late, but if this was accepted for the mad cow issue, why not do as much for the questions."
"I am asking the House to continue with the debate regardless."
"It should soon be finished and you do not interrupt such an important debate for questions, whose importance I contest..."
"Mrs Lulling, I respect your opinion, but I must remind you that the agenda is set at the start of the session by the chairmen of the political groups, and we should respect what we have ourselves approved. In the agenda, Mrs Lulling, it was approved that Question Time to the Commission should start at 5.30 p.m. today."
"Besides which, Mrs Lulling, there is also an agreement with the members of the Commission that they should attend here at strictly specified times."
"In any case, this is a question which you should refer to the chairmen of your respective groups, to see if they think the system should be changed."
"However, ladies and gentlemen, my duty as the Presidency's representative at this moment is to respect the agenda which has been approved."
"And the agenda states that Question Time to the Commission should start at precisely 5.30 p.m. today, so that is what we are now doing I am afraid, Mrs Lulling - and five minutes late."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is questions to the Commission (B4-0901/97)."
"The Council's 1991 decision on the abolition of intra-Community dutyfree sales granted a particularly long transition period (up to 1999) in which duty-free sales would still be tolerated within the scope of the single market."
"This was a significant exception to enable the operators and competent authorities to take all the necessary measures to adapt to the new scenario, in which these specific tax benefits will no longer be granted."
"It is the Commission's duty to report the well-known distorting effects of duty-free sales, particularly with regard to the various means of transport, where in the Union in general trains and buses compete with sea and air transport, the latter two benefitting from the possibility of offering duty-free sales."
"It cannot be ruled out that some transport fares may increase following the abolition of duty-free sales."
"The benefits of duty-free sales, on ferries for example, help them to operate to a certain degree."
"The Commission considers that, if Community support were provided in this sector (for Ireland or other similar cases) it would be advisable to look for a specific solution totally independent from the mechanisms of indirect taxation."
"Ireland has identified the tourism sector as one area where it is possible to generate economic growth and new job opportunities for our young people."
"With the help of European Union structural fund investment in tourism projects in recent years, it has been possible to record significant advances in the tourism sector."
"Equally vital components of successful tourism policy for an island nation such as Ireland are low-cost air and car-ferry links."
"The cost of both air travel and ferry links has been kept at a low level, partly because of the EU-imposed competition between airlines and between car ferries and partly because of the cross-subsidizing of transport costs through duty-free sales."
"Why does the Commission continue to disregard the calls from MEPs, Member State governments and the tourist industry and refuse to bring forward proposals to extend duty-free for a further ten years or until all indirect taxes have been harmonized?"
"Mr Collins, I would like to point out that the Commission also regards tourism as important as a sector generating growth and employment, and that the Commission regards the situation of the islands as important and worthy of attention."
"At the same time, we believe it essential that the single market should operate fully and, within its scope, eliminate serious distortions to competition, because we think that those concerns, that may arise with reference to the specific cases indicated by Mr Collins, may be adequately taken into account with means that do not distort the single market and that do not have the disadvantage, as duty-free sales do, of generating unemployment in other sectors of the economy."
"Would the Commissioner not agree that there are inevitably going to be distortions to air and ferry links, meaning very serious distortions to internal travel within a single market, as a result of the removal of duty free, for the simple reason that it costs a great deal more to fly from Dublin, Scotland or Milan to Brussels than possibly to take the train from one of the Benelux countries?"
"Would he not think it is more appropriate to extend the derogation for ten years, bearing in mind not just the jobs in the duty free sector but also the fact that you are calling a special conference to boost employment in the European Union, whereas, in fact, with one fell swoop you are going to make approximately 13, 000 people unemployed?"
"What we know for sure is that the present system generates distortion."
"If the elimination of intra-EU duty does have certain consequences then, as I just said in response to Mr Collins' question, specific instruments can well be considered - and the Commission is prepared to do that - to alleviate any adverse consequences."
"But we must not close our eyes to the fact that the present system generates, and has for many years generated, hidden, adverse side effects on other means of transportation, on other ways of doing retail business."
"It also has the more subtle and perverse effect of transferring resources from general tax-payers to those benefiting from the use of duty free."
"Normally the average tax-payer is less well-off than the user of duty free."
"Having said that, I repeat that though the Commission is definitely not prepared to consider a prorogation of the duty free system, it is willing to consider what transparent, clear instruments might be put in place to offset certain specific, adverse consequences, should they materialize."
"Question No 25 by Jan Bertens (H-0820/97)"
"Subject: EU policy on APMs in the aftermath of the Conference of Ottawa"
"In December the 'Ottawa Treaty' to ban APMs will be signed."
"In that regard it is of vital importance that the Union gives a signal to support the global campaign to ban APMs."
"What concrete steps is the Commission going to take to increase participation in the Ottawa Treaty and activities in demining of third countries?"
"What concrete proposals is the Commission intending to make during the Ottawa Conference in December?"
"Do the funds set aside in the 1998 draft budget give the right signal of commitment to the Ottawa Conference in December?"
"As everyone knows, the European Commission is making a decisive contribution to the international action aimed at overcoming the anti-personnel landmines tragedy."
"In the last two years, around ECU 52 million have been allocated to mine-clearing measures in the countries most affected."
"The Commission has therefore been invited as such to the Ottawa Conference where it will be represented by the Commissioner responsible for humanitarian aid."
"The signal to support the Commission in the battle against landmines is now loud and clear."
"It is also clear that the signature of the agreement by the States supporting it will not mark the end of the process, but will encourage all the parties in question to intensify their efforts."
"For that reason, the Commission is attributing particular importance to the Action Forum that will be held at the same time as the signature ceremony."
"The Commission will take an active part in all the discussion groups where it will firmly insist on the need to strengthen international coordination, emphasize the need to improve the means of management and data banks and describe the capacities it has available."
"At a practical level, in 1998, the Community will implement four types of measures in the mines sector."
"Firstly, the European Commission will to a large extent continue to support the anti-landmine actions worldwide, using all the resources available, including the ECU 7 million of the anti-landmine budget line and the plans implemented in all the countries affected, through the budget lines for reconstruction, cooperation in development and humanitarian aid."
"Secondly, the Community will become the first individual supporter of the programmes drawn up by the International Red Cross Committee, aimed at helping landmine victims and making public opinion aware."
"Thirdly, the international and regional actions will be supported by plans drawn up by organizations such as the United Nations and the Southern African Development Community."
"Fourthly, and finally, the technical plans will be intensified, irrespective of the type of measure."
"Mr President, the Commission, which will benefit from the constant support of Parliament, can make an enormous contribution to achieving the Ottawa objectives."
"May I wholeheartedly thank the Commissioner, and through him the entire Commission, for the way in which they have defended themselves against the plague of landmines."
"We are delighted that Commissioner Bonino will be present in Ottawa."
"Mr Cunningham and I myself will represent this Parliament."
"It is unnecessary to call on this Parliament here to later on play a leading role with the Commission during the second phase of the Ottawa process."
"Financial efforts, as you are well aware, Mr Commissioner, even hundreds of millions are not enough, but I am in any case delighted that the first step has been taken."
"I have two questions."
"Will the Commission raise the issue of landmines, anti-personnel mines, at the transatlantic summit which is to be held the day after the Ottawa Summit?"
"And what attempts will the Commission make to get China, Vietnam, Iran and even the United States to add their names to the signatories?"
"And furthermore, how does the Commission hope to improve the existing technology, because I understand that at present mines are still cleared using technology which originated during the First World War?"
"First of all, as pointed out by the questioner, I would like to record the full agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on this important matter."
"Without being able to give a very detailed answer to the second question, I can recall once again our opinion that Ottawa will certainly not end a process, as after this meeting there is a lot still to be done; certainly, the various international aspects, that Mr Bertens pointed out in his second question, will all be duly taken into consideration and, in this sense, the Action Forum that will be held at the same time as the signature ceremony will be of great importance."
"I would like to add that the United States have announced that they have appointed a special representative to guide and boost the Demining 2010 initiative, which also indicates the United States' interest in this matter."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, there was something missing from your splendid answer, at least from my point of view."
"It was once said - I no longer know by which Asian politician - that landmines are the nuclear bombs of poor nations."
"There is some truth in that."
"I believe that what it refers to is that the landmines, and the whole situation, which is sometimes difficult to solve, can mostly be traced back to the fact that the two great nuclear powers, Russia and the United States, have done nothing themselves, despite their earlier promises, about nuclear disarmament."
"Is the Commission prepared to refer to this question in relation to landmines?"
"Because as long as there is a nuclear bomb monopoly for two great powers, there will be no disarmament!"
"First of all, I can assure you that I will pass these points on to my colleague, Mr van den Broek, who is responsible for this matter."
"Personally, I have no doubt that the aspects of the world framework you have brought to light will be kept in mind, otherwise I cannot see how the European Union can carry out its action effectively; also, aware of the determination with which the Commission has acted and intends to continue acting on this subject, I think I can assure you that this dimension you have brought to light will be perfectly kept in mind."
"Question No 26 by David Martin (H-0798/97)"
"Subject: Primates as laboratory animals"
"Would the Commission please detail its plan for involving the European Parliament in the elaboration of the 'Community Policy Statement on the use of Primates as Laboratory Animals' which is currently being drafted in the meeting of national competent authorities for the implementation of Directive 86/609 ?"
"Mr President, the first draft of the Community's statement of policy on the use of primates in research was produced in 1994."
"The initiative is aimed at improving the supervision of the acquisition and use of primates for test purposes in laboratories."
"Further work on this statement was put on hold until well into 1997, as first it was necessary to resolve the important question of producing statistics on the use of animals in research."
"The competent authorities of the Member States finally agreed on use of joint statistics in April 1997."
"The first discussions on the draft statement have just begun."
"On 4 December 1997, the Commission's service branch will have a first meeting with the national authorities responsible for protecting the animals used in animal research."
"A subsequent meeting is already scheduled for early 1998."
"We very much hope that the meeting in December will give the Commission's service branch an opportunity to assess the situation on primates including wild animals as it appears in the Member States."
"It will then be possible to draw the necessary conclusions for the EU."
"We can then decide what tools to use."
"It may be a political statement, a recommendation from the Commission or an actual law initiative."
"Once the preparatory work is complete and the status of the statement in law has been defined more precisely, the Commission will of course involve the European Parliament in the discussions."
"And I would like to add that it is my personal belief that we will need to choose a form which gives Parliament a reasonable amount of influence in this very sensitive and important area."
"I wish to begin by thanking the Commissioner for that very helpful response."
"I wonder whether she would agree with me that primates are man's closest relative and all the evidence shows that they feel pain and suffering in the same way as man?"
"Therefore, the Commission's work - which I repeat I welcome - should be aimed at ensuring that we make the minimum use of primates and secondly that their transportation and housing is of the highest order and has the highest welfare standards in mind."
"I look forward to bringing this matter before the European Parliament so that we can give a political response to the Commission's technical work."
"Mr President, I can only say that I agree with the additional remarks completely."
"I also think it is about finding a form whereby we uses animals as little as possible, and I also agree on the comments on transport."
"I have already had an opportunity to have discussions with the animal welfare group here in Parliament, and I certainly think we will get some results too."
"Mr President, as both a Dane and an Environmental Commissioner, I have been following the news of the serious environmental incident which happened in connection with the building of the Hallandsås tunnel in Sweden very closely and with considerable interest."
"After such an incident, it is only natural to ask what could have been done to avoid it."
"Could the Commission have intervened when work was suspended in 1995 to ensure that the most appropriate solution was found to the environmental problems before work continued?"
"And let me say straight away: no, the Commission could not."
"The Commission has no powers to check that the Community's environmental legislation is being observed."
"The relevant legislation, Directive 85/337/EC on environmental impact assessment (the EIA Directive) became binding on Sweden when it joined the Community, in other words on 1 January 1995."
"Under the terms of the Directive, Sweden is obliged to assess the impact of new projects on the environment if the approval procedure started after 1 January 1995."
"The project in question, that is the Hallandsås tunnel, which is part of the west coast railway line, did not come under this obligation, as it had already been approved and started before that date."
"The relevant Directive 85/337/EC on environmental impact assessment does not state that a new EIA has to be carried out if a construction or building project which has been approved and on which work has already started is suspended temporarily and then restarted."
"So there is no way the Commission can intervene in such a situation."
"As I said, it is the Commission's responsibility to ensure that EU legislation is followed; but this does not extend to technical or engineering decisions, which are a matter for the implementing authority."
"I would like to say thank you for your reply."
"The environmental scandal at Hallandsås which involved the release of dangerous chemicals into the environment has caused serious damage."
"It could most probably have been avoided."
"What can be said with certainty is that if the project had complied with the requirements for environmental impact assessments found in Directive 337 of 1985, the accident would never have happened."
"The directive includes far-reaching requirements for accounts of all the consequences of various methods of working and also for a public statement of emission risks."
"I think this shows how important it is that the Commission really ensures that the directive is implemented as soon as possible and really puts some weight behind the Union's decision."
"Sweden has had a long time to tighten up its legislation."
"For investments of this type, however, I would like to question whether or not it would have been logical to have carried out a tougher environmental inspection in the light of the EU's requirements."
"No, the Commission has not had an opportunity to look into this matter."
"I am aware that the Swedish authorities held an environmental assessment of the project themselves at an early stage of the proceedings, and I can perhaps say for Mr Virgin's information that we have of course now amended the directive in question as Directive 97/11/EC, which must be implemented by the Member States by 14 March 1999."
"If the environmental assessment Directive had been in force, it would have been possible to intervene and hold a new assessment, but this cannot be done with the existing Directive."
"I would like to ask whether the draft directive on the assessment of certain plans, such as the programme's effect on the environment, which the Commission recently put forward, could have had an effect if it had been in force, since a lot of the damage which has occurred is not directly project-related, so to speak, but is connected with the transport planning which took place a long time ago and which resulted in the need to build a tunnel, which has since led to leakages, which in turn led to the emission of toxins."
"I would like to hear the Commissioner's assessment of what effect this proposal from the Commission, which we in this Parliament also mentioned in a resolution on 22 October, could have had on developments at Hallandsås, and similar cases of course."
"As I said to Mr Virgin, it is of course always interesting when an incident happens to consider whether it could have been avoided, and if it would have been better if another Directive had been in force."
"But there was no other directive, and so of course we have to abide by the Directive which actually was in force and, under that Directive, there was no provision for the Commission to intervene in the matter."
"As I said in reply to Mr Virgin's supplementary question, the matter would have looked different if it was a question of Directive 97/11/EC, but this Directive will not be implemented by the Member States until March 1999, and until it is implemented, we cannot of course use the provisions it contains."
"Question No 28 by Robert Evans (H-0773/97)"
"Subject: Policing at international football matches"
"In the light of the events of Saturday 11 October in the Olympic Stadium Rome during the football match between England and Italy is the Commission intending to conduct its own enquiry into the organization and policing of the event?"
"With reference to previous resolutions and reports adopted in this Parliament does the Commission feel that the principles of free movement of people, including football supporters and others have been contravened?"
"Constituents that attended the match, or who were simply shocked by the appalling scenes on television, have asked me to raise this issue at a European level."
"Football is a sport enjoyed by millions; negative images and the maltreatment of genuine supporters do serious damage to the efforts of the European Union in promoting sport as an essential part of European culture."
"Proper planning and coordination, combined with effective but fair policing has demonstrated that many similar sporting events can take place without any such problems."
"What steps does the Commission intend to take to enforce European legislation and to avoid any future repetition at similar events?"
"The implementation of appropriate policing measures for the purpose of preventing hooliganism and violence generally at sporting events or other occasions attended by large numbers of people aims primarily to maintain public order."
"The Commission thus does not have competence and is therefore not in a position to intervene in the way police forces in the Member States maintain public order on their own territories."
"Within the Justice and Home Affairs Council, the police cooperation working group tackles this issue from an operational point of view, with liaison officers and an annual meeting of these contact points."
"In this context, the Council adopted in 1996 a recommendation on guidelines for preventing and restraining disorder connected with football matches."
"More recently, in 1997, a joint action with regard to cooperation in public order and safety and a resolution on preventing and restraining football hooligans were adopted by the Council."
"The Commission is, of course, in favour of the promotion and implementation of closer international police cooperation."
"However, the implementation of appropriate measures for preventing and restraining disorders is undertaken by Member States in accordance with their own national laws and Community law."
"Furthermore, a Council draft recommendation on the responsibility of organizers of sporting events is currently being discussed at a technical level."
"The Commission is not involved in the application of UEFA regulations concerning stadiums but it does operate with organizations that have a specific role in this area such as the Council of Europe, where a standing committee has been created."
"I thank the Commissioner for her answers although they are not answers to the questions I put."
"She mentioned football hooligans several times."
"If she were to look at the large number of newspaper cuttings regarding this particular event she would see that many of the people involved - and I have evidence - are not people who can be stereotyped as 'hooligans' ."
"Many of them are barristers, executives, company managers, sales people and people from wholly different walks of life to those alluded to."
"The point of my question was, does the Commission feel that the principles of free movement of people have been contravened?"
"We hear of people being held in the football stadium until 3 a.m., by which time no public transport was available and they had to walk home."
"Many of them had items of clothing taken away which were never returned."
"I am talking about a broader issue than the one raised in the Commissioner answer."
"Could she address my specific points?"
"I would once more remind the honourable Member that the Commission does not have competence and is therefore not in a position to intervene on the way police forces of the Member States maintain public order on their own territories."
"We must respect that."
"I just want to ask Mrs Gradin whether she is aware that a number of Members of this House will warmly welcome her statement?"
"The Commission has got enough serious work to do without having to try to take over the responsibility of national police and national enforcing bodies."
"Will she, in her answer, perhaps add just one or two sentences, particularly in praise of the football authorities of Member States who sought to coordinate the many complaints of genuine football supporters who were caused a great deal of inconvenience during that particular match and managed to communicate those complaints with great clarity to the Italian football authorities?"
"Perhaps she will agree that the imperative is that the lessons learned from that should not have to be relearned during the World Cup next year."
"All of us who are interested in football really hope that the coming events will be handled in a proper way."
"As I said, the Commission is not involved in how UEFA and the relevant organizations are working with stadiums."
"We cooperate with organizations that have a specific role in the area."
"We should all try our best to have good football matches that we can enjoy."
"Question No 29 by María Izquierdo Rojo (H-0756/97)"
"Subject: Vocational training in the Maghreb countries"
"What measures and initiatives are to be undertaken to assist the development of vocational training schemes in the Maghreb countries?"
"What are the expected results of such action?"
"Mrs Rojo, as you know, Community policy on technical education and vocational training forms an essential part of Euro-Mediterranean policy as established at the Barcelona Conference, and its general aim is to increase the competitiveness of the industrial and services sectors, and to help the process of economic transition in those countries by creating a much better qualified workforce."
"This is being achieved by means of a series of efforts designed to restructure the systems of technical education and vocational training, in close collaboration with other aid donors, both bilaterally and multilaterally."
"You ask what specific steps we have taken in the association agreements negotiated so far, of which a fundamental part relates to vocational training."
"Firstly, I must tell you (although I think you already know) that one of the first projects under the Meda scheme, which came into effect in October, is the Manform project being implemented in Tunisia, with a fund of ECU 40 million."
"In collaboration with the Tunisian Government, we have used a programmatic approach to negotiate a large project - almost ECU 40 million - which is of great importance for that country. One of its objectives is to increase the competitiveness of Tunisian businesses, but above all, focusing on the network of small and medium-sized enterprises, it aims to improve the quality and capacity of the education and training system."
"At the moment we are negotiating a similar programme with the Moroccan Government, and a decision will be reached before the end of the year."
"It has the same overall aim of increasing competitiveness, which of course in the Moroccan case includes the private sector."
"In the first instance, the contribution which the European Union has offered the Moroccan Government amounts to ECU 38 million."
"We would like to establish negotiations covering vocational training and government attitude, which also - in the case of Morocco - take account of the demands of the private sector of Moroccan management."
"I should also like to mention that in the past, within the framework of our relations with Egypt, we created the socalled Social Fund, as part of the process by which Egypt's economy is being opened up, following that country's negotiations with the Bretton Woods institutions. Of this project, which amounts to approximately ECU 70 million (if my memory is correct) a large part has been devoted specifically to helping the Egyptian Government reform its whole system of vocational training."
"In conclusion, I can assure you that we are supporting the reform of the educational system, and particularly of the vocational training system, as regards its links with the manufacturing sector, and its contribution to the private sector, particularly the small and medium-sized enterprises which need it."
"These enterprises have the potential for good production, because they benefit from a cost differential in their favour, but the big problem faced by small or medium-sized enterprises in the Mediterranean area is precisely a lack of qualified workers."
"That, then, is the line the Commission is taking, and will continue to take as other countries join in, for vocational training is a key element in the economic adaptation and liberalization of these countries, and the countries themselves are specifically asking us for help in this area."
"Thank you, Mr González, for your very full, even exemplary, answer."
"I would like to thank the Commission for its decisive actions in this area, especially now that it has enabled the European Foundation for Vocational Training to get involved in the Mediterranean countries, as we had requested."
"I have been able to see with my own eyes what the European Union is doing in the Maghreb, and I think it is very successful."
"However, I did notice some aspects where I think we are encountering more difficulties."
"With Tunisia, I think the problem lies in managing to integrate vocational training with industry."
"Another problem is making sure that education is adapted to the reform."
"Also problematic, though less so in Tunisia than in other countries, is the use of positive measures to promote the involvement of women."
"I also wonder whether you will boost these policies particularly in those areas where there is a lot of emigration, such as northern Morocco?"
"Will you reform human resources training?"
"Will you take account of the special characteristics of the Maghreb countries, so that you do not just copy what has been done with Tacis and Phare? This last point is very important."
"Thank you very much again, Mr González, Vice-President of the Commission."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, but allow me to say two things."
"Firstly, you have exceeded your allotted time by one minute."
"May I remind you that you are taking up time which is needed for other Members' questions."
"Therefore, please keep to time."
"Secondly, I am a little surprised to hear you addressing your requests to Mr González."
"I am not sure exactly which Mr González you are referring to, but...Ah!"
"Mr Marín González. I see, thank you very much."
"It was just that, had it been some other Mr González, I was going to offer to pass on your comments. However, Mr Marín González now has the floor."
"Mr President, my second surname is González."
"I am a second son, Mr President."
"You are absolutely right: that is the line we are taking."
"We do not have any problems negotiating with the World Bank, because in fact we are cooperating very closely with that institution in defining the objectives."
"However, the countries in question have difficulty understanding the dual system of vocational training (linking education, vocational training and industry) which is normal in Europe and works very well there - you mentioned the experience of CEDEFOP in Berlin."
"Furthermore, these are countries whose political and democratic development is relatively recent, and it is not easy to get the trade unions, the employers and the authorities to sit down together."
"I am not going to hide the fact that this difficulty exists, because it obviously has an effect on negotiations for collective bargains and aspects related to internal politics."
"You ask if there are programmes specifically for women."
"The answer is yes, there are."
"You ask whether we have considered the most deprived regions. Again the answer is yes."
"In the case of Morocco in particular, one of the options offered to the Moroccan Government involves the development of industrial zones in the north, to consolidate a network of small and medium-sized enterprises, together with vocational training, so that the people who emigrate across the Straits of Gibraltar in such a distressing manner can at least be shown that they do have a future in their own country."
"However, that will take time."
"Thank you very much, Mr Marín González."
"Question No 30 by Bernd Posselt (H-0812/97)"
"Subject: Fundamental freedoms in Cuba"
"In the light of the Pope's forthcoming visit to Cuba, how do you view the current situation with regard to religious freedom in that country, and what efforts is the Commission making as part of developing economic relations to exert pressure on the Cuban Government to respect fundamental freedoms and human rights?"
"I have a problem with this question. It refers to fundamental freedoms in Cuba in the light of the Pope's visit, and to religious freedom and the role of the Catholic Church."
"I think it is a question which should be addressed to the Vatican spokesman."
"There is little sense in the Commission expressing an opinion about something which the Pope is going to do, acting through the Vatican State, which is completely sovereign."
"Therefore, I do not think the Commission should express any opinion on this matter."
"Mr President, privately you can believe what you like, like any of us, but you must not mock us!"
"You are the representative of the Commission, and what matters is that we should respect human rights in relations with third states."
"That is not a job for the Pope, it is a job for the European Union, to put its external relationships, its development relationships to the service of human rights."
"Religious freedom is an elementary human right, which you must press for!"
"What you have said seems to me to be simply mockery of the people who have died or been imprisoned in Cuba for their beliefs!"
"Mr Posselt, it is my responsibility as President to request - indeed, demand - that all Members of this House to show the greatest respect for the members of the Commission who attend here to answer their questions."
"At no point did I notice anything offensive in the attitude of the Vice-President of the Commission, and I want to put that on record."
"In any case, Mr Marín now has the floor to respond to Mr Posselt's question - if he wishes to do so."
"Thank you for your comments, Mr President."
"Mr Posselt, I have neither insulted nor shown a lack of respect to any Catholic or any Christian in this hemicycle."
"Absolutely not!"
"Your remarks seem to me to be deliberate and demagogic, and I do not accept them at all."
"On the contrary, I have replied in an institutional capacity, because the European Commission has no reason to pass judgement on the aims of the Pope's visit, as your question asks."
"To make my point absolutely clear, let me tell you that I have been personally invited to the Vatican to give my opinion on this visit, but in an individual capacity, as a private person."
"I am always very respectful in this sort of situation, so please do not use such an offensive tone."
"The negotiations which the Vatican State is initiating with the Cuban Government (about religious freedom, the Church's presence, the opening of new churches, and new priests) are strictly a matter for bilateral discussions between those two parties."
"Furthermore, I think you should allow the Vatican authorities to carry out their work in peace. I think they are doing very well."
"That is all I can say to you."
"But I will not allow anybody to say to me in public that I was lacking in my respect to Catholics."
"I do not accept that at all."
"Mr Commissioner, this is indeed a very delicate matter, in which I think we have to choose our words very carefully."
"I think there has been a misunderstanding here, Mr Commissioner."
"I think Mr Posselt is talking about defending human rights, and as far as human rights are concerned, there are certain attitudes in Cuba which do not respect them adequately."
"My supplementary question is this: I recently received a directive about respect for human rights under the legal basis of article 130w, that is, development aid."
"Mr Marín, with all due respect and in an attempt to regain our sense of proportion - because I realize that we have to be extremely careful with this, and what you said is entirely reasonable - I would like to stick up for this view."
"Where Cuba is concerned, the Commission should also take account of the criteria expressed in the proposal I have mentioned, and should act accordingly."
"Mrs Palacio, thank you very much for your balanced view, but there has been no misunderstanding."
"We both heard the Spanish interpreter, and I was accused of a lack of respect towards the Catholic Church. That is unfounded."
"I have tried to be very careful."
"I have a very good relationship with the Catholic Church and the Pope's diplomatic representative."
"However, negotiations of this type have to be conducted, as you say, with restraint and intelligence, and the Vatican authorities have to be allowed to negotiate."
"Let them negotiate: I can assure you they are excellent and extremely clever negotiators."
"That is all I can tell you, except to say that I am in contact with them."
"Secondly, you asked me a general question, Mrs Palacio, but I have a completely clear conscience."
"Indeed, I was the Commissioner who decided to break off the Cooperation Agreement negotiations, because I judged that the circumstances at that particular moment did not correspond with the mandate issued by the European Council."
"How can this House ask me whether or not I am aware of problems of civil liberties?"
"Of course I am aware of them."
"However, there are ways of approaching this type of negotiation. As a layman and an agnostic - which I do not deny - it seems perfectly reasonable to me that religious freedom in Cuba, as in any other country, should be included in a set of negotiations if indeed the Cuban Government wants the Pope to visit Havana next year."
"To me it seems common sense that they should negotiate, and we are in favour of it being done in this way, but your question was intended in a wider sense."
"Therefore, let us allow the Vatican to negotiate with the Cuban Government, in order to resolve certain problems relating to the Catholic Church."
"Do not forget, Mrs Palacio, that Catholicism is not the only religion in Cuba; there are others, with other types of problems, making this a much more far-reaching debate."
"So, now that we have made contact again with the Cuban Government; now that we have made use of the new approaches they are making to a Member State - you know very well that things are improving; now that the Cuban Government has contacted us again and it seems that a point of reference is being established for the future, which the Pope's journey itself will open up: please allow us to see if we can guide this matter in a new direction."
"However, I repeat: this sort of thing has to be done very carefully and cautiously."
"Since the time allocated to questions to Mr Marín has now expired, Questions Nos 31 and 32 will be answered in writing."
"Mr President, the Commission has already dealt twice with the subject matter which is again presented in the question."
"First, I have written a letter on this question to the Spanish government, and I have already commented on it once in the debate on the Green Paper on numbering here in Parliament."
"I will willingly repeat it."
"However, I must first correct the assumption in the question."
"The reference to the code number for Gibraltar in the Appendix to the Green Paper about a numbering plan is not in the 'Countries' column, but in an untitled column, containing explanations of the actual use of certain code numbers, including quite different code numbers such as short codes for European services, telephone information, etc."
"Also, the code numbers which have a geographical meaning are not country codes but regional codes."
"The fact that the regional code for Gibraltar - which was not defined by us, but by the ITU - happens to be between those of Germany and Luxembourg has no political significance at all, but is the result of the numerical sequence of the table."
"It was therefore decisively important to include a reference to code number 350, which is currently used for Gibraltar."
"That is, as I said during the debate, the table only gives an overview of technical data, based on facts."
"Nothing else!"
"It does not take a political position."
"I said in the debate that if we were to change these facts now, by taking the code number out of the table or something similar, we would be making a political declaration, which the Commission never intended."
"Obviously, we would not get involved in this political question in favour of either side."
"That was not the intention of the table, and I hope that is now finally clear."
"We take the greatest possible care to be politically neutral in this question."
"Commissioner, you mention a reply that was given to the Spanish Government, which does not concern us in this House."
"Also, you say that the column in question is empty, with no entries."
"Nevertheless, I can read that it says ""country's dialling code' ."
"You could have put ""territorial dialling code' or ""dialling codes for Member States and territories whose foreign relations are dependent on a Member State' , or anything you like."
"But ""country' means country, whether the word is used in a political document or an annex to a political document, which is what this is."
"Therefore, I would ask you, Mr Bangemann, to please reconsider the situation, because there is a resolution from this Parliament requesting you to do so."
"Mr President, the question has just been repeated again."
"I have already said: If you look at the column on the far left, there is country code today, and then indeed comes 350."
"In the column on the right, where the proposals are, it says quite clearly: regional code."
"For this reason, we refrained from changing it, because that would have been a political declaration."
"But I would like to ask you to take account of what I have said."
"It is the same as what is in the letter."
"Fine, the letter does not concern you, but it may interest you that we also said clearly in this letter to the Spanish government that this is not a political statement."
"It does not mean that we recognize Gibraltar as an independent country."
"The fact that the number was assigned to Gibraltar has nothing to do with us, but is a decision of the ITU."
"I have already said in the debate that we do not associate any political motivation with it, and I say once again as the answer to your question: We do not take any position in this way to one or the other claim of one of the two countries which cannot agree about this question."
"I think that must be enough!"
"Question No 34 by Robin Teverson (H-0779/97)"
"Subject: The Millennium 'Bug'"
"Every owner of a computer is being faced with the potential collapse of his/her computer after the year 2000 simply because of the short-sightedness of the computer industry who have failed to program their products with the information necessary to function after the start of the new Millennium."
"What action is the Commission undertaking to deal with the potential catastrophic repercussions of this 'Millennium Bug', as it is now known, not only throughout the European Union but also within the Commission itself?"
"Mr President, this really is a problem, and Mr Teverson is quite right to refer to it again."
"We have discussed this question intensively for the last two and a half to three years, prompted by the then British Minister for Telecommunications."
"First we marked out the extent of the problem in a group of experts."
"We then informed the Member States, and above all we informed those concerned in several conferences, and by now everyone is clear about what the problem means."
"One can spend a long time thinking about where the roots of the problem are."
"It may be to do with the shortsightedness of some people at that time."
"It may also be, and I presume that this is the more likely explanation, that with the available memory which existed then it seemed too costly to many people, because the year 2000 was still relatively far away."
"So they saved costs."
"But now money has to be spent to make the necessary adjustments."
"That is not cheap."
"Whether a cost saving results if the two are compared to each other will surely depend on how long the old systems have been used."
"So we have done everything necessary at the right time."
"There is now software to make some of the necessary corrections, and therefore the users and suppliers of software themselves will know best how to solve the problem, and we know that this is now happening."
"So we have again and again made people aware of this year 2000 problem."
"We have set up working parties, etc. Now we can do no more than we have already, and I think that now those who are affected must themselves do what they previously neglected."
"Obviously it is easy to say that it would have been better if they had all looked forward to the year 2000, but it is sometimes the case that foresight about such things is not very great."
"Thank you for that reply."
"Very briefly I would like to come back to you on three things: firstly is the Commission itself happy and confident that its own systems will survive through from 31 December 1999 to 1 January 2000?"
"Will the Commission's own systems actually function properly?"
"I would be interested to know, given all the research and the work that has taken place in the committee of experts, how well prepared you now think that business in Europe, in the European Union, actually is."
"Are you confident that commerce will not grind to a halt on 1 January 2000?"
"Lastly I am concerned at reports that in the computer business itself systems are still being sold that do not sufficiently take account of the millennium bug."
"Is this also the Commission's understanding, and what steps is it taking in the single market to make sure that stops?"
"Mr President, I can really only answer the first part of the question with hope."
"I do not know 100 % how things will turn out, but I think that the responsible people have thought about it just as we have."
"Perhaps it is easier for us, and that is, if you like, an advantage of neglect."
"Everything has two sides. In the past, we neglected to make 100 % use of the possibilities of electronic data processing - we are now trying to change that - and to that extent we are not now in this fix, because we certainly have available data material which can be brought past the year 2000 in other ways."
"That is only a provisional answer."
"If the MEP is interested, we will willingly tell him what we ourselves in the Commission have done to solve this problem."
"As far as others are concerned, they have been made aware of it."
"We have also set up certain research programmes to help to find solutions. The solutions are there now."
"There are two problems."
"For one thing, they are expensive."
"The software producers expect to be well paid for what they are offering."
"For another thing, even if software is used, in some cases experts still have to be involved, and there are not many experts, so that there are bottlenecks, and I must say that it is possible that some companies will not sort out the problem, despite our efforts and their efforts."
"Then there is a third group, to which you refer in your second question."
"Indeed there are companies, even today, which think it will be all right: it does not affect us, we will get round it somehow."
"And that means that there are still companies which have not discovered the problem, and that is alarming."
"Question No 35 by Marianne Eriksson (H-0783/97)"
"Subject: Tunnel through the Halland Ridge in Sweden"
"Large amounts of acrylamide were released during the construction of a rail tunnel under the Halland Ridge in Sweden, and have polluted the groundwater for years to come."
"During the construction work several workers using Rhoca-Gil sealing compound suffered damage to the nervous system and are at increased risk of cancer."
"Farmers in the region are unable to sell their produce because of the discharge of acrylamide into the ground water."
"At present only those who can prove the presence of acrylamide in their ground water receive compensation, although all farmers on the Bjäre Peninsula are having great trouble in disposing of their produce."
"The French chemicals firm Rhône-Poulenc, manufacturers of Rhoca-Gil sealing compound, stated before the accident that the acrylamide content of the ceiling compound was 1.5 %; it has since proved to be much higher."
"What action does the Commission take against large European undertakings involved in breaches of environmental legislation?"
"Will the Commission investigate Rhône-Poulenc's sales methods?"
"Will the Commission investigate the use of Rhoca-Gil sealing compound?"
"Mr President, I have a very long answer, and I am wondering if I can shorten it in the interests of the other questioners."
"In principle, the answer is as follows. First, we have all the necessary directives to understand this dangerous substance, which incidentally is classified as poisonous, level 2 carcinogenic and level 2 mutagenic."
"This means that it is not a substance which can be handled carelessly. That is legally controlled."
"That is the first point, and therefore the whole legal regulations are quoted here."
"The second point is this. In the first place, it is the task of national authorities to ensure that substances which in our directives are classified as poisonous and dangerous are either kept out of use altogether, or, if they are used, the appropriate regulations for use are observed, so that no environmental danger occurs."
"We are waiting for what the Swedish government will tell us."
"We can then decide whether we need to make our own decision."
"At the moment, therefore, we see no reason to intervene, but when the Swedish government reports to us what violations have occurred and how it has been handled, we will check whether there is an additional need to act."
"That is the short form of a long answer, Mr President."
"I can read it out, or I can give the answer to the MEP."
"It is six pages long, so we would lose a lot of time if I read it out."
"I would like to thank Commissioner Bangemann for his reply."
"I look forward to receiving these six pages, since, just as the Commissioner says, it concerns a very dangerous substance."
"I still do not really think that I have had an answer to the questions I put."
"I now wonder, among other things, whether the Commission intends to investigate the use of the substance throughout the EU's Member States."
"It has been used for just over 20 years, not only in tunnel construction, but also at airports and in mines, and so on."
"Are we totally unprepared?"
"After all, the substance is forbidden in Japan and its use is restricted in the USA."
"Surely, this is not the way the EU is going to compete in the world market?"
"Mr President, as I have already said, we shall check that when we have the report of the Swedish government."
"At the moment we are also investigating this substance within our regular risk assessments, whether it should be classified at a different level or possibly use of it must be completely forbidden."
"That is a possible result of our current investigations."
"Since the time allocated to questions to Mr Bangemann has now expired, Question No 36 will be dealt with in writing."
"Mr President, Mrs Kjer Hansen, the questions concerns one of the grants which was approved for the 1993 PACTE programme."
"The programme is financed in the form of a global grant to the European Committee of the Regions, which was commissioned to monitor the programme administration."
"On the basis of the reports which were submitted to it, at the start of 1997 the Commission paid the Community resources which had been approved for it since 1993, in full."
"The administration office of the Committee of the Regions subjects each project to a check after the event."
"In some cases, claimable expenditure which differed from the amount which the project manager stated in his final report was identified."
"Before the last tranche was paid out, the Committee of the Regions required the project managers to send it vouchers for all expenditure."
"It informed the Commission that most project managers met this requirement, and the remaining amount was paid to them."
"If the project managers could not submit the required vouchers within the set period, the conclusion of the projects which were then still open was based exclusively on the expenditure which was classified as claimable."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for his reply."
"I am glad that these payments have now been sorted out."
"I feel it is annoying that there have been problems with the administration of the PACTE programme, because if people do not get the resources which they are due, this puts the EU in a bad light."
"I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner a supplementary question, as to whether he can promise a deadline by when we can get the refunds we have been promised, so we do not find things dragging on for years again before those involved in the project can get the resources which the Commission promised."
"Can the Commissioner set a fixed time limit for the payments?"
"Yes, Mrs Kjer Hansen, indeed the execution of the PACTE programme was afflicted with many problems, and one cannot be at all satisfied with how it has gone, especially because, as you know, even during the process, because of the justified criticisms which the Court of Auditors and others made of the execution, the conditions for claimability had to be tightened."
"I think that in future this must never happen again."
"Directorate General XVI is therefore thinking very hard, first about how this cooperation can be further promoted, but on the other hand how such things can be avoided in future."
"I can only promise you that we have learned from the problems of the past."
"I welcome that answer."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner to say a little more about the PACTE programme."
"I know in the next few weeks she will be coming to a decision about the future of the PACTE programme."
"I know she will not announce that today."
"I understand that she has concerns about some of the deficiencies in management of the programme."
"Will she accept today that some of the criticisms levelled at the PACTE programme are because some of her officials do not like the large number of small projects the PACTE entails: they prefer the bigger figures in the article 10 programme?"
"Will she accept that there is some merit in the principle of having a programme run by associations of local authorities themselves, which have good contacts, rather than by private consultants?"
"While we are trying to achieve concentration, will she accept that in this very fractional, peripheral part of the structural funds there is some merit in keeping a programme which provides very small amounts of money to large numbers of authorities that otherwise just would not get involved?"
"Mr Howitt, I can very well share the principle, and I also know that the effect of these programmes was partly very positive, particularly in local communities."
"But I also know that if we are unable to administer such programmes properly, afterwards the frustration is greater than the success."
"It is not a matter of whether some officials perhaps are not so keen on seeing these programmes, but simply of what the Commission is able to do."
"I believe that we must also have some ideas, not only with the PACTE programme, but also with all the article 10 actions, about how we ensure the mobilizing effect of such small projects, but at the same time find administrative forms which do not overstretch us."
"There is no point in bravely starting such things and failing in the end because we are unable to ensure the appropriate management."
"We therefore check all these things."
"As you know, that has nothing to do with the fact that because of the inter-institutional negotiations we are forced to set up programmes where we have budget lines without a legal basis, and therefore we have to investigate again how we can include such programmes in the pilot projects."
"I ask you please to understand that the Commission does not now simply make promises, but is really trying to find a system which can ensure responsible execution of such projects, at all levels, the Commission level and the level of the authorities which are carrying them out."
"Mr Marinho, President Santer's statements are based on the document Agenda 2000, which was submitted in July."
"He referred in what he said to the increase in total resources for objective 1, resulting from the retention of the Commission proposal on the weighting, until now, of objective 1, that is two thirds of total resources."
"Apart from the Lisbon region, which considerably exceeds the threshold value of 75 % of gross domestic product per head, the level of regional prosperity of the Portuguese regions is appreciably below this threshold, so that they continue to be eligible for support within objective 1."
"Regions which lose their eligibility for support, which will probably include Lisbon, will receive a generous 'phasing out' ."
"Finally, the proposal to retain the cohesion fund in its present form does not raise a question about Portugal's further eligibility for support within this fund, so that in future Portugal will have available considerable resources from the Structural Fund and the cohesion fund."
"Mr President, I had intended to put a question to the Commissioner asking whether she knew if the cohesion fund was included in the Commission's accounts. The cohesion fund is not affected by the inclusion of a given country which benefits from it in the front line of economic and monetary union."
"I was very pleased with her reply, because even before I asked the question the Commissioner gave me her assurance here that the countries in the front line of European monetary union, which will therefore be adopting the euro, will not be at a disadvantage in terms of the cohesion fund and that the fund will be maintained."
"It was a splendid reply and very positive from the Portuguese point of view."
"Mr President, Agenda 2000 makes a distinction, so to speak, between the continuation of structural policy for the 15 Member States, and pre-entry and structural support for new Members States after entry."
"What I said, and what Agenda 2000 also ensures in this sense, is that support for objective 1 regions will not be reduced because of the entry of new members, but that the proposal is still two thirds of resources which are increasing in total."
"Also, the cohesion fund will continue to be open for Member States which do not exceed 90 % of gross national product."
"The half-time check refers to this 90 % and not to future members which enter in the period from 2000 to 2006."
"Does the Commissioner agree that in looking at which regions will qualify under the 75 % rule for objective 1 funding after 1999, it would be inappropriate to apply this rule in a rigid, statistical way given that some regions will fall just above or just below the 75 % according to some, frankly, not very reliable statistics."
"In the case of regions on the borderline, ought not consideration also be given to factors such as whether they came into objective 1 status during the last review - in other words whether they are regions that have only just gained objective 1 status and only just got the infrastructure and the procedures into place to benefit from it?"
"Just as they are beginning to benefit from it and obtain results, it would make no sense whatsoever to cut them off, and that aspect merits consideration."
"Mr Corbett, I must point out to you that your question goes beyond the scope of Mr Marinho's."
"The question being considered refers to Portugal, and you have strayed a long way from the point which was being made."
"I do not know whether Mrs Wulf-Mathies wishes to answer your question, but in any case, you should restrict yourself to the subject covered by the question."
"The floor is yours, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, if you would like to reply."
"Mr President, I think I can do that quite briefly, because afterwards I shall go into the question again specially."
"But the basis for calculating the eligibility for support of the regions is the last three years for which regional data is available."
"Our problem is that we must make fixed rules, and however much I understand every individual with his imaginative arguments, I think we would all be in an awful mess if we did not keep to preset criteria."
"As far as I can see, the 75 % criterion is mostly undisputed throughout the Community."
"Question No 39 by Hugh McMahon (H-0777/97)"
"Subject: Agenda 2000"
"In its reflections on new objective 2, Agenda 2000 states that 'a limited number of significant areas should be identified in order to facilitate an integrated strategy for economic development'."
"What is the Commission's view on how these 'significant areas' should be identified, will NUTS 1 or NUTS 2 classification be used for this purpose and will the final decision be left to each Member State to decide?"
"Mr President, Mr McMahon, in Agenda 2000 the Commission proposed that simple, transparent and specific Community support criteria for the various types of area which fall under the new objective 2 should be set up."
"These criteria should take account of the regional priorities of the Member States."
"The affected areas should therefore be defined in the context of the partnership between the Commission and the authorities of the individual states, and the aid should be concentrated on the most disadvantaged areas."
"However, implementation of an integrated strategy for regional development, in which actions to extend the infrastructure, human resources and the economy are meshed, requires a certain size."
"Experience with objectives 2 and 5b shows that NUTS 3 regions or areas which have a coherent local economy and can be delimited administratively are most suitable as a spacial concept."
"However, the Commission strives for a certain flexibility, which allows us to take account of national and regional criteria."
"I thank the Commissioner for her answer."
"Who will make the decision on the criteria?"
"Will it be a joint decision?"
"Will it be a Commission decision?"
"Will the Member States make the decision?"
"Secondly, what level will it be based on?"
"Will it be NUTS 1, NUTS 2, or NUTS 3?"
"It is important that we receive some indication of the level the Commission is thinking of."
"When is the decision likely to be made?"
"Mr President, I indicated in my answer that I assume that the NUTS 3 regions, i.e. the NUTS 3 level, is in principle the suitable level."
"Who decides?"
"First, in the new Structural Fund orders, the criteria for eligibility for support are defined, and thus European criteria, which obviously require the consent of the Member States, are specified by the Commission."
"The national criteria, which we shall take into account additionally, will be proposed by the Member States, and the Commission will investigate in partnership how far these correspond to the objectives and effects which are aimed for."
"Third question: when?"
"The Commission proposes to submit the new Structural Fund orders next year around Easter, and all further decisions then depend on the decisions of the Council, not just about the financial prospects, but also about the Structural Fund order."
"Here the Commission is not the sole mistress of the procedure."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for her answer, and ask her to say something, if possible, about the criteria for choosing these significant areas for objective 2 - the industrial zones mentioned in Agenda 2000."
"I should like to know whether the Commissioner thinks any of the following are going to be among the selection criteria for these significant areas for objective 2: high unemployment; the relative contribution of industry to the economic structure of these areas; the proportion of jobs which have been lost in the older industrial sectors; and additional problems such as social exclusion."
"I will willingly do that, Mr President. We are currently working out the criteria."
"I can therefore not give a final answer."
"But it is correct that all the criteria which you have listed must certainly be taken into account, e.g. for industrial areas, dependency on a particular branch of industry and associated exceptionally high unemployment, for city areas, the extent of social exclusion, for instance, and for rural areas, not just dependency on agriculture, but also the danger of emigration associated with the decline of agriculture."
"We shall therefore develop criteria for eligibility for support which are based on the origin of the problems - industrial regions, rural regions, parts of cities."
"But we want the actions to be taken to be based on a programme and an integrated development concept, because it is important now not to be always looking at the past, but to develop prospects for the future."
"We shall make proposals about this in the structural fund orders, and I am certain that we can discuss the individual criteria then."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, for joining us here today."
"Since the time allocated to questions to the Commission has now expired, Questions Nos 40 to 79 will be dealt with in writing."
"That concludes Question Time."
"Mr Howitt wishes to speak on a point of order."
"I congratulate you, Mr President, on preserving the integrity of Question Time by sticking to the time and even overrunning;"
"I fully support your decision."
"Could you comment briefly on the implications for the agenda this evening."
"At the moment there is a debate scheduled between midnight and 12.30 a.m."
"By overrunning that could be even later."
"Can you give some guidance to members on the implications for tonight's session."
"Will the agenda be finished or will some reports be postponed?"
"Parliament's administrative staff inform me that they expect us to be able to complete all of the scheduled programme tonight, and finish by 12.30 a.m."
"That is the information I have been given."
"Of course, it will also depend somewhat on the discipline of those Members who speak, and the extent to which they respect their allocated speaking time, which occasionally leaves something to be desired."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.10 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Part-time work - Employment (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on the following reports:"
"(A4-0352/97) by Mrs Jöns, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commissionproposal for a Council Directive concerning the framework agreement on part-time work concluded by UNICE, CEEP and the ETUC (COM(97)0392 - C4-0551/97); -(A4-0353/97) by Mr Hernández Mollar, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission's report ""Employment in Europe - 1997' ."
"Mr President, I would just like to make an addendum so that the Minutes of the proceedings are correct."
"A Swedish member claimed earlier that I was not here during his previous speech."
"I was here, and I heard his attack on me."
"However, there is no point in replying to it now since he is not here himself now."
"Thank you, Mrs Carlsson."
"But how could he have overlooked you?"
"Mr President, I congratulate the two rapporteurs - and not just as a formality, because they really have done the best that could possibly be done on this theme."
"Whether the Commissioner will be able to use these arguments, or the Commission's own, to convince the fifteen young people who have been invited to attend the second day of the Luxembourg summit is another matter."
"We will probably have to get used to accepting - at least in this Parliament, Mr President - that in matters of employment we have lacked a theoretical standard for a long time. We have learnt some lessons from benchmarking, that is, from the comparison of European industry with industry in the United States and Japan, who have been gradually depriving us of our market shares in the industrialized countries, and have been doing rather better than us in creating jobs."
"From that experience - not from a theoretical standard - we know that the services which affect companies' competitiveness are more expensive here than on the other side of the Atlantic, and that we have to progress - to continue to progress - towards liberalization."
"We know that our infrastructure is weaker, but we also know that the European Union can never find enough funds to tackle the infrastructure we need to create jobs."
"We also know that we have to make the labour market more flexible."
"Furthermore, we know that we spend less on research and development here than is spent in the United States, and that the involvement of private enterprise in this area is less. Also, the methods we have chosen, of direct assistance, do not work as well as earnings-related fiscal advantages."
"I repeat that taxation on labour has gone up enormously, while taxation on capital has been reduced."
"The solutions being suggested here do not fit this diagnosis."
"It is clear that a tax on energy will not resolve the problem."
"It is obvious that to reduce social security contributions - and that is the specific idea, Mr President - we have to start thinking whether the VAT we have, which is deducted immediately from capital goods, is appropriate in this employment situation."
"It was when it was brought into effect."
"We will probably have to start thinking about a form of VAT in which the tax on capital goods is not deducted immediately, in order to make capital relatively more expensive than labour, and to favour the replacement of capital-intensive methods by labour-intensive methods."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the two rapporteurs on the excellent work carried out and speak in particularly about Mr Jöns' report on the agreement on part-time work within the social protocol."
"For some time now, a magic word has appeared in all the documents: flexibility."
"The Council uses it a lot, the Commission uses it in its guidelines, the social partners also use it, and the European Parliament considers it to be one of the means of dealing with the problem of employment in its resolutions."
"To really be effective, flexibility has to be of interest and convenient for everyone: workers and employers."
"It has to favour a solution to the problems; that is, it has to be able to increase employment, favour a reconciliation between work and family commitments for men and women, it should not discriminate with regard to working conditions, pay, social security and welfare, it should not penalize professional careers."
"From this point of view, the Council's position is highly contradictory - on the one hand, in fact, it calls for flexibility as an efficient means but, on the other, it is not prepared to sign commitments or to define rules governing flexibility and the way it should be applied."
"The Commission's first documents dealing with the regulation of atypical employment go back to the '80s."
"Today, at the end of 1997, we are dealing with a partial problem on the regulation of atypical employment, part-time work, within an agreement drawn up between the social parties which we certainly welcome, because we believe that social dialogue should be developed, but we consider it very partial."
"We approve of Mrs Jöns' report and believe her words to be enlightening; we approve it because the agreement is actually harmless, but we realize that it does not take significant steps forward."
"The employers are even more contradictory;"
"I think that they have been the fundamental reason for the agreement being very timid in dealing with the problem; often in fact, as in my country, employers understand flexibility in one way only, as the freedom to do what you want in the company, without taking any rights into account."
"This agreement is therefore partial because it only deals with part of the problems; together with Mrs Jöns, we ask the Commission to finally take up its position, propose a directive on atypical employment and lay down regulations on all its aspects, because otherwise flexibility will remain an empty or even more dangerous word."
"Mr President, there is an unfortunate tradition in the European Community that, when dealing with problems relating largely to women, a great deal of patience is required, for it will be at least several decades before you manage to get a legislative text adopted."
"This has been the case concerning the implementation of article 119 on equal pay, equal social security, adjustment of the burden of proof and so on."
"And too often, the mountain gives birth to a mouse."
"This is once again effectively the case with part-time work."
"In order to eliminate the discrimination which part-time workers face, the great majority of them - more than 80 % - women, the Commission made a good proposal for a directive regarding voluntary part-time work nearly twenty years ago."
"It was, furthermore, on this basis, that a few years ago in my country, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, a law was established, after having decided to wait no longer for a European Directive as we were fighting a losing battle."
"We are now confronted with a framework agreement concluded by some of the social partners - SMEs are not represented - on part-time work, an agreement that I would qualify as ""watered down' in comparison with the initial proposal for a directive and even in comparison with the amended version of 1983."
"First of all, it is missing an important word in the title: voluntary."
"For what needs to be sorted out at European level is ""voluntary' part-time work."
"This work is not atypical, far from it."
"It will furthermore become less and less so, and the logical and non-discriminatory solution would be to simply apply to part-time workers the same conditions of salary, work, promotion and social security as applied to full-time workers, it of course being understood that they would be paid and covered in proportion to the hours worked."
"But this logical, non-discriminatory principle, which could be easily implemented, does not seem to be easily understood by everybody."
"I understand that with regard to social security, for example, pensions, you need to have worked a certain length of time to be able to benefit from the right to a guaranteed minimum pension."
"I understand that with regard to health insurance it could seem unfair to work, for example, one hour per week and be insured by paying derisory contributions, when the illness or the operation costs the sickness fund as much as for a full-time worker."
"We know there are these problems and I hope, Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ..."
"(The President interrupted the speaker) I wanted to say that we intended to ask for the withdrawal of the proposal."
"But I will vote for it, whilst hoping all the same that it will bring an end to discrimination."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by saying to the Commissioner how pleased I am to see him at this late hour."
"One thing should be said: much is being said about flexibility here, but the Parliament gave another demonstration just now of how inflexibly we venture to manage our own Regulations."
"Anyhow, I would still like to congratulate Mr Hernández Molar on his report, especially as I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that it adds something to what Mr van Velzen raised in his report."
"This report contains a number of points of special interest which look like they might quietly disappear from the table of the summit in Luxembourg."
"I would like to cite three points."
"Firstly, and especially the importance which is attached in this report to income policy and social protection, within the scope of employment policy as well."
"As a matter of fact, Mr Commissioner, that was one of the most important themes at the employment week last week."
"I received a study recently, which I recommend my colleagues to read, which demonstrates with crystal clarity that classic OECD recipes are completely irrelevant to the European Union countries."
"A larger wage range, more wage flexibility, less generous benefits make very little difference to employment levels, Mrs Carlsson, and certainly make no difference to unemployment."
"Such a policy does, however, lead to the erosion of low wages, and most certainly to an undermining of the standard of living of the people. And that is therefore not a choice that the Luxembourg summit should make."
"It is neither social protection n or employment."
"They have to find ways to combine both."
"Local employment, community service, fine."
"We support these, but with respect for decent wage conditions, and not in the shape of compulsory workfare."
"Mr Pronk, we as socialists support the promotion of part-time work and career breaks, if possible, for men and women, but only with good social security cover, so that people are not pushed into precarious circumstances."
"Mr President, a second point I wanted to cite, is that this report brings up another buried topic, namely the reduction of working hours."
"I am delighted with that."
"We, as the European Parliament, Mr President, asked the Commission as far back as in 1996 to produce a study, a comparative study into good examples of how the working week can be reduced; into how the reduction of social security contributions can give a new impulse to shorter working hours."
"Sadly, I have not been able to find a trace of this in the Commission's new report - an employment agenda for the year 2000."
"I know that this issue is perceived very differently in the different European Union countries, and I also understand only too well that the employment organization UNICE is none too keen on this topic."
"But all the more reason, Mr President, for the European Union to put the debate on shorter working hours on the agenda once more."
"I know that not all of these topics will be discussed, or else they will be discussed insufficiently, at the Luxembourg summit, but I hope that the ministers will at least make a start with these important debates."
"Mr President, let me thank Mrs Jöns for her report."
"I agree fully with her assessment, and indeed with the original version of the document, and for this reason I wish to make a number of general comments on the subject of social dialogue."
"Of course the latter has a valuable contribution to make. However, the achievements of the social partners in Europe, whether in respect of career breaks or part-time work, are sadly minimalist in the truest sense of the word."
"We cannot be satisfied with this. For this reason, Mr Commissioner, I do not share the euphoria which has so far surrounded the results of social dialogue."
"We have but one foot in the door, and we will have to push much harder if we are to achieve anything."
"I hope that we can count on your support here, though I personally am not convinced that your support will prove strong enough."
"If we are to be presented for a third time with an agreement of such minimal value, then I believe, with some regret, that we must reject it."
"I also wish to express my thanks to Mr Hernández Mollar."
"His contribution to the employment summit has been significant and I would like to give it my wholehearted support."
"However, I fear, Mr Hernández Mollar, that like the social partners in Luxembourg, the Council will adopt the minimalist approach and the peoples of Europe will ultimately blame us for this, since we in the front line may well have aroused more expectations than the Council is prepared to fulfil."
"I only hope that my prophesies in this respect do not come true."
"I would like to thank all those who have contributed and all those who have come back for the end of the debate."
"There are two distinct topics here and I would like to address the two reports separately."
"Firstly, the 1997 Employment in Europe report is part of the package on employment adopted by the Commission on 1 October along with the joint report and the Commission's proposal for employment guidelines."
"Honourable Members will recall that we had an excellent debate on the guidelines at the last session here when we discussed the van Velzen report."
"Indeed Mrs Van Lancker contributed eloquently on that occasion as well."
"On the subject you are talking about now I would just like to say to you that this matter is covered in the Green Paper on work organization and the deadline for submissions is 30 November."
"It is an on-going debate and certainly we are going to hear more about it."
"The Employment in Europe report is the Commission's analysis of the employment situation and its presentation of the policy messages which come out of that analysis."
"Similarly the report by Mr Hernández Mollar puts forward Parliament's view on all of these matters."
"I am very reassured by the degree of convergence between the two views."
"We all agree on the importance of the overall economic situation."
"Achieving and maintaining a substantial rate of growth is a fundamental element in our ability to meet the objectives that are set out in our guidelines."
"This was very much highlighted by several of the speakers."
"We also agree that tax and benefit systems should be employment-friendly, providing the necessary incentives for employment while still providing the income support which is the hallmark of the European social model."
"Among the many interesting points put forward in Mr Hernández Mollar's report I detected two areas on which I think he is trying to place somewhat more emphasis."
"I would like just to pick up on these points because I believe that this emphasis is shared by the Commission as well."
"The first is that there is the need to address the skills gap and the strategy for education and training that is required to fill and plug that skills gap."
"In the draft guidelines submitted to the European Council the Commission has identified three areas of attack that we need to improve: the basic education of young people setting out on their working life, because that lays the foundation for the adaptable and employable workforce of the future."
"We need to provide a system of life-long learning to enable people to upgrade their skills throughout their working life."
"We need to address the problem of the skills of the unemployed to help to get them back into a position where they are able to compete once again on the labour market."
"Parliament and the Commission are in complete accord."
"We hope that the Member States will take this on board."
"The other issue is the problem of the gender gap, which has been highlighted as well."
"We need to help women to participate in the labour market."
"Despite the growth in jobs for women over the past ten years - and there have been many new jobs - we still have a major gap in the employment rates of men and women and a somewhat lesser one in the unemployment rates."
"Promoting better reconciliation between home and work is but the first step in dealing with this problem."
"You will be very interested to know that the joint meeting that took place yesterday evening of the Ecofin ministers and the employment ministers was a very good one."
"My impression, after spending the whole day listening, is that there is a lot of common ground there."
"We eased out a lot of the misunderstandings as well."
"The joint meeting had a very high level of representation."
"In fact it is the highest level of representation that I have seen in my four-and-a-half years here."
"So this says something for the possibilities for a very successful job summit."
"Our guidelines - the ones we discussed just recently - and the joint report have provided the main basis for the discussion as far as the preparation for this summit is concerned."
"It is my estimation now that there was overwhelming agreement at the jumbo Council meeting for the procedure to be followed: that is, on the action plans of the Member States, the joint surveillance, the recommendations if warranted, and, on the substance, the four pillars that I outlined here on the last occasion are agreed by all."
"Also agreed is the need for both quantified and qualitative targets."
"The European Union targets on the long-term unemployed - we have all spoken about youth and employment - and also on the question of training; training is not quite as settled yet."
"There is going to be some other representation on the text."
"My opinion is that the whole thing now has reached a watershed as a result of Amsterdam."
"That is what is different."
"I would think that we are set fair just now for a major breakthrough in the progress and development of the European employment strategy."
"Everything is in place for this to be a success."
"That is my estimation of what went on yesterday."
"I hope it will convert."
"If it does I will be coming back here to say very strong, favourable things in regard to what you recommended and the Commission put forward to make all that a success."
"Regarding Mrs Jöns' report, the importance of the new forms of flexible working, especially part-time work, has increased very substantially over the years and the trend continues on national employment markets."
"In June 1996, UNICE, CEEP and ETUC expressed their common wish, as you know, to enter into negotiations on the parttime aspects of this issue."
"After a very long and detailed negotiation these three organizations agreed on 6 June 1997 the framework agreement on part-time working."
"On the same occasion they requested the agreement to be implemented through a Council instrument."
"We all know that."
"The Commission is bringing forward this proposal to the Council pursuant to article 4(2) of the agreement on social policy."
"To our mutual regret this article does not provide for involvement of the European Parliament."
"However, the Commission has kept its promise to Parliament and informed it about the various phases of consultation of the social partners."
"It has also provided Parliament with the proposal in order to enable it to deliver its opinion."
"I would like to take the opportunity to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Jöns, for her report and for all the efforts she has made to get a general consensus here."
"I appreciate it personally."
"But having said that I would like to underline that I do not share the overall criticism of the social partners agreement contained in the report for this reason: I will not conceal from you that the Commission finds itself in a difficult position vis-à-vis one single amendment which affects the material content of the agreement."
"In order to respect the autonomy of the social partners under the social protocol procedure, the Commission made it clear in its communication on 14 December 1993 concerning the application of the agreement on social policy that the Council could not amend the social partners agreement."
"For this reason any amendment which alters the terms of the agreement and, in particular, the terms concerning objective reasons and casual work cannot be accepted."
"In this context the compromise Amendment No 3 added by Mr Pronk and Mr van Velzen cannot be accepted in so far as it involves a definition of the above-mentioned terms."
"The Commission will, however, monitor the implementation of the directive to ensure, in particular, that derogations concerning objective measures and casual work are strictly limited to those notions."
"The Commission does not favour the inclusion of such a proposal which imposes new obligations under Amendment Nos 1 and 2 on the Member States and the social partners."
"However, the Commission will monitor the implementation of this directive and will address, therefore, the issues referred to by Amendment Nos 1 and 2."
"Concerning the more general question of Parliament's role during this specific procedure, the debates both in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Women's Rights have shown that this is one of your major points of concern."
"In this regard the Commission is currently reflecting on the possibility of the European Parliament playing a somewhat more active role in this process while respecting both the terms of the Treaty and the autonomy of the social partners, as we are bound to do."
"Part-time work is only one aspect of the broader issue concerning the protection and promotion of other flexible forms of work."
"In fact the Commission consulted the social partners in a much wider context which included other forms of non-standard employment contracts."
"This agreement is to be seen, therefore, as a very important first step forward."
"In the preamble to the framework agreement the social partners have already expressed their intention to consider the need for similar agreements on other flexible forms of work."
"In their joint contribution to the employment summit adopted last Thursday, 13 November, the partners state that they are considering the possibility of a new negotiation."
"So the Commission hopes that the social partners will soon be able to agree to open the relevant negotiations and would welcome an early announcement in this regard."
"Finally, since the question of social security has been mentioned by a few contributors, I should say that the adaptation of social security rules to stimulate more innovative forms of work organization is one of the issues covered by the Commission's Green Paper on work organization."
"We cannot prejudge the outcome of the ongoing debate by making proposals for action at this stage."
"However, the question will certainly be addressed in the social action plan for the Commission that we are going to adopt next year."
"Mr President, on my Amendment No 3, is the Commissioner not misreading it?"
"We do not ask in that amendment to take care of that in this directive."
"We ask to take care of it in general."
"This is the essential difference between the Amendment No and the original text of the resolution as passed by the Social Affairs Committee."
"Did the Commissioner take this difference into consideration in his answer?"
"The answer is yes."
"I said that we would be considering the matter he has referred to."
"Thank you, Mr Flynn"
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Aircraft safety"
"The next item is the report (A4-0335/97) by Mr Gonzalez Triviño, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a Council Directive establishing a Safety Assessment of Third Countries' Aircraft using Community Airports (COM(7)0055 - C4-0140/97-97/0039(SYN))."
"Mr President, as rapporteur for this report on the safety of aircraft from third countries using Community airports, I am very pleased with the progress we have made in the Committee on Transport and Tourism. We have been able to reach a unanimous opinion on the improvements which can be made to the text of the Council's proposed directive."
"The terrible air accident in the Dominican Republic in February 1996, in which nearly 200 people lost their lives, alerted us to the need to improve the inspection procedure for aircraft from third countries which use our airports."
"The text of the directive, which seems to enjoy the Member States' unanimous support, represents an important step forward in improving safety levels, by means of equipment being inspected and its operation being forbidden when there are reasonable doubts about its safety."
"Of the fourteen amendments approved by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, there are three which deserve special mention."
"First, I would like to draw your attention to the amendment to article 3, allowing the scope of this directive to be extended to cover aircraft which, while operating with a company from within the European Union, are to all effects and purposes chartered from third countries -sometimes even with the crew included - to operate from Community airports."
"This was the case with the unfortunate accident in the Dominican Republic to which I referred earlier."
"Secondly, I should like to mention that the Committee on Transport and Tourism has approved an amendment to allow the inspection of most aircraft showing potential signs of a defect with safety implications. article 5 of the original text envisaged the inspection of just 10 % of such aircraft."
"Thirdly, I think it is important to mention the amendment which will make it possible to publish the names of companies whose aircraft have been grounded for safety reasons."
"We think publicity is an indispensable means for further dissuading companies from operating inadequately maintained equipment."
"Finally, I should like to explain the purpose of another of the amendments. It is designed to clarify that when the directive talks about the safety of people on the ground, it does not just mean airport personnel, but also people living near airports."
"In the next few months, we will have the opportunity to improve the text of this directive even more, but the most important thing at the moment is to speed up the timescale for its implementation as much as possible, and guarantee the technical, economic and administrative resources which will be needed for it to be put into practice rigorously and effectively."
"This directive will also be a step forward in the creation of the single market. At present, an airline company can have its permission to fly withdrawn for safety reasons by one Member State but can nevertheless continue to operate in a neighbouring country without correcting the original defects."
"Finally, my own personal opinion is that sanctions against companies with defective equipment would perhaps be more effective if the European Commission were the competent body, rather than the individual Member States."
"If we are to have a directive which applies to all the airports of the European Union, and in such a sensitive area as safety, it would be a good idea to have a body of technicians who could apply the regulations in a consistent and rigorous fashion."
"I would like to end, Mr President, by expressing my gratitude to Commissioner Kinnock, and to his whole technical team at the European Commission who once again, arm-in-arm with this Parliament, have made it possible to modify the original Council text. I believe that between us, including the members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, we have achieved a good directive, which will greatly improve aircraft safety."
"Mr President, the contents of the directive and of the report on safety inspections for third country aircraft were not at issue in the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"Though this may seem like a purely administrative process, it has to be said that the fate and lives of many people will depend on this particular resolution."
"In February 1996 a Boeing 757 operated by the Turkish company Birgen Air crashed in the Dominican Republic."
"All 189 people on board, most of them tourists returning home to Germany, were killed."
"This accident involved a third country aircraft manufacturer, a third country airport of departure, a third country flight operator and a third country pilot."
"This complexity was reflected in the accident investigations which followed."
"In Germany the accident triggered a fierce public debate on safety standards, landing and take-off bans, blacklists, etcetera."
"The search for the cause of the accident and for those responsible for it saw some real buck passing, with the tour operator blaming the airline, the airline blaming the airport maintenance crew, then the plane makers and even the German government."
"At the end of the day it was apparent that because of competitive pressures and the liberalization of air traffic procedures all those involved had adopted sloppy working practices and that the almost voluntary system of aircraft inspections worldwide were simply inadequate."
"If in Europe a third country aircraft is banned from landing in EU country A because of some particular technical fault, it simply diverts to EU country B. For this reason alone I believe that we must introduce common regulations to ensure the safety of aircraft passengers and crew."
"Such a directive would allow all information on pre-flight ramp inspections to be centrally compiled and would lay down standards for aircraft inspection work."
"The Commission could then issue flight bans on certain aircraft or could even prohibit certain airline companies from taking-off or landing at all EU airports."
"We in Parliament call for a safety check on all aircraft which have been reported for technical faults, or which are suspected of such, and not just the 10 %."
"We also demand that the flight ban list be published every 3 months."
"This directive will certainly lead to better standards in aviation safety."
"However, binding regulations are still required on cabin crew working hours, in order to reduce the number of human errors attributable to excess fatigue, and on training standards for maintenance crews, in order to cut the number of technical malfunctions on a more consistent basis."
"There is therefore still much to be done by the Commission, by the Council and by this Parliament, before these vital regulations can become a reality."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament's concern for aviation safety goes back to before the crash of a Turkish aircraft in the Dominican Republic in February 1996, which Mrs Schmidbauer has reported on so fully."
"Our concern here is now focused on the safety of aircraft from third countries."
"We already have adequate regulations to cover aircraft from EU countries, though if I may say from personal experience, there are still some areas requiring definite improvement here."
"Like the directive on port state control in the maritime transport sector, we must introduce regulations to ensure that our standards are imposed on third country aircraft wishing to land at EU airports."
"We in the European People's Party therefore support the proposal of the rapporteur, which constitutes a major improvement in many areas."
"The EPP does however have a problem with one aspect of the proposal."
"Can it really be logical to consult the opinions of non-governmental organisations in this connection?"
"Passengers, people living close to airports, pilots, maintenance services, incident reports - yes, but non-governmental organizations, whatever they may be?"
"We in the EPP cannot accept this proposal, let me make that absolutely clear."
"Pre-flight ramp checks are without doubt the best way to improve safety."
"Information exchange and cooperation also constitute a important element."
"On top of this, sanctions must of course be available, otherwise the proposed measures will lack the necessary bite."
"Some of the proposals contained in the report are excellent."
"Publication, for example, is a very important means for ensuring greater transparency in this area."
"I would ask the Commission to take a long hard look at Parliaments proposals and not simply to dismiss them from the agenda with the slogan ""We are in the process of collaboration' ."
"There is no doubt that these measures would have a major impact on passenger safety in Europe and beyond."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the Commission on this valuable proposal and the rapporteur on his excellent report."
"In his explanation, the rapporteur points to the fact that, under commercial pressure, lesser airports are more inclined to turn a blind eye to an aircraft which is in a less than perfect state of repair."
"The inertia of the regional authorities in the presence of the frequent risks which hang not only metaphorically, but literally over the people living around the airport of Ostend is unacceptable to me."
"I will be relying fully on this legislative initiative to see that the attitudes of the authorities and the airport itself change."
"Not only passengers but also people living nearby can be the victims of an aircraft which is in a less than perfect state of repair."
"In the case of cargo planes, with few people on board, it is the people on the ground who are most vulnerable."
"I have submitted two amendments on behalf of the Committee on Transport to include explicitly in the risk categories people living near airports."
"At the same time I think that they, and not only the passengers should be able to lodge a complaint in the event that they find an irregularity."
"I hope that this guideline will be given early approval."
"Mr President, the accident in the Dominican Republic in February 1996 clearly highlights the problem before us today."
"That particular case involved a Turkish aircraft chartered by a German tour operator in which all 176 passengers were killed."
"There it would appear that insufficient pre-flight ramp checks and pilot errors could be said to have turned a minor technical problem into a major disaster."
"I congratulate the Commission on introducing this proposed directive and the rapporteur for his excellent work in preparing this report."
"This is the first of a series of measures recommended by the high-level group of experts charged with defining the Community aviation improvement strategy which formed the subject of an earlier report in my name."
"In that opinion the European Parliament wanted to introduce a similar system of safety checks for third country aircraft using European Union airports to that used in port state control in the maritime transport sector."
"That is to say that ICAO safety standards should be applied in relation to all third country aircraft to create a blacklist of those third country carriers not meeting European Union safety standards."
"Clearly the standards required by ICAO ought to be imposed on third country carriers carrying European Union passengers or using European Union airports."
"I welcome here the fact that for the first time JAA is to centralize all information relating to ramp checks, specific conditions under which ramp checks must be carried out and set down in specific EU measures for action to ensure that these standards are applied."
"These are a very welcome first step and I hope they will lead to even greater safety throughout the European Union."
"Mr President, firstly I thank the rapporteur for his excellent report on our proposal to improve aviation safety by providing for a system of inspection of third country aircraft that are suspected of non-compliance with internationally agreed safety standards."
"Naturally I am pleased that the rapporteur and other Members who have spoken tonight are supporting us on this very important issue and also that many of the 15 amendments which are proposed are useful additions or suggestions which complement the Commission proposal."
"The House will recall, as Mr González Triviño and others said, that after the tragic accident at Puerto Plata in February last year in which 176 European Union citizens were killed, both the European Parliament and the Council asked the Commission to study possible measures to improve safety."
"Consequently, in June last year the Commission published its communication on a Community aviation safety improvement strategy which included a programme of action."
"The first element of this programme to be presented as a formal proposal is the one being considered by the House tonight."
"That was issued in February of this year."
"The Commission is happy to accept all the committee's amendments as they stand with the exception of two, as well as the new Amendment No 15 which covers issues similar to those of Amendment No 2."
"With regard to Amendment No 14 which requires the Commission to draw up a report on the application of the directive no later than two years after its entry into force, I would say that if the proposal is adopted along the lines of the rapporteur's opinion, I do not believe there would be any need for a further proposal in the near future."
"However, I am willing to accept that circumstances may change and maybe a new proposal would then have merit."
"Consequently, the Commission will incorporate the substance of Amendment No 14 in a modified proposal."
"Finally, there is one amendment that the Commission cannot support."
"Amendment No 13 to the proposal as it now stands calls for the deletion of article 12 which requires Member States to lay down a system of penalties for breach of the national provisions adopted to implement the directive."
"We consider that article 12 is a necessary instrument to guarantee the proper application of a Community legal instrument in the member states and we therefore want to keep it in the text."
"I hope that on further reflection, especially since there is very clear and strong support for our proposal, the House will come to share our view of article 12 as a necessary provision for enforcement."
"I am pleased to see such a positive common effort in attempts to improve air safety."
"That common view is completely consistent with the approach of this Parliament over many years."
"I look forward to the future adoption of this proposal which should contribute to improving the security of European citizens and, indeed, many other air passengers, as well as providing additional protection for people living near airports."
"I am therefore very appreciative of the efforts yet again of Mr González Triviño."
"Many thanks, Mr Kinnock"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Economic and social cohesion"
"The next item is the report (A4-0329/97) by Mr Izquierdo Collado, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, on the First Triennial Report on economic and social cohesion (COM(96)0542 - C4-0016/97)."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, this report was submitted by the Commission before the Members of this House had ever heard of any Agenda 2000 document, even in draft form."
"Nevertheless, many of its concepts and criteria have now become commonplace, because as time passed, the report on cohesion came to virtually overlap with other important reports, including Agenda 2000."
"The cohesion report which Parliament is presenting starts out by challenging the philosophy of cohesion. Cohesion is not the Red Cross; it contributes to fairness within the Community."
"Cohesion is the other side of the coin of the single market. It does not consist of indefinite and indiscriminate subsidies, but of efforts to achieve competitiveness in the different regions of the European Union."
"The Commission's report pointed out to us something obvious: there had been uneven progress in matters of cohesion."
"The Member States had moved closer in this respect, but cohesion had nevertheless failed to affect the regions in the same way."
"Variations in employment, research and many other areas also showed that we were a long way from achieving the European Union's cohesion objectives."
"We state quite clearly in the report that Parliament is satisfied with the European Union's political structure."
"We are happy not only with its policies, but also with those who are responsible for them, and I am glad that the Commissioner can be with us here today."
"I have heard her speak in Germany and other Member States with the same language, and I must say, Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy feels honoured to have been able to work with her. Any positive features of Parliament's report owe a great deal to the Commissioner's help and judgement during our discussions with her."
"So, we agree that the structural policies have to change many things."
"But we want to state clearly and explicitly to Parliament, and to the institutions and people of the European Union, that we are very critical of the remainder of the European Union's policies, insofar as they relate to cohesion."
"Article 130b of the treaty calls for policies to contribute jointly to achieving the objective of cohesion."
"We cannot afford to let our efforts be wasted."
"We cannot take away from the regions with one hand what we have given them with the other."
"All the European Union's policies need to work together before we can really achieve the objectives of cohesion which Parliament and the whole of the European Union are aiming for."
"Therefore, we think there must be substantial improvements in the way all Community policies are adjusted to the objective of cohesion. We do not want research to be limited to the most well-developed regions."
"We want the trans-European networks to be laid out logically and cohesively. We want competition policy to wake up to cohesion, and focus to an increasing extent on the cohesive aspects which it needs to respect."
"We want the common agricultural policy to carry on progressing and introducing cohesion. That is our message."
"Mr President, we have had long discussions about whether or not 1.27 % of the European Union's GNP is a sufficient allocation for questions of cohesion, and whether repeating the objectives already agreed at Edinburgh might give a negative image of the European Union by suggesting that we have not made any progress."
"We are in favour of realism - of admitting that this is not the right time to demand that Member States should contribute more, while we are preoccupied with monetary union. However, Mr President, before we embark upon enlargement, a new financial approach will be needed, in order to really tackle the enlargement process seriously."
"I should like to thank all my colleagues, Mr President, for the enormous amount of work they have contributed to this report, and for the help they have given me personally. I should also like to thank you for allowing me to overrun a little."
"Mr President, I am delighted that we are having the opportunity tonight, even at this very late hour, to discuss cohesion policy."
"The Commission's first triennial report on cohesion policies and their impact has been an essential part of the evaluation reflection on future priorities for cohesion policies."
"It takes place at an important watershed with the reform of the structural and regional policies and the Agenda 2000 package."
"We can begin the process of taking stock, reviewing the achievements and success and, as our rapporteur has done very effectively in his comprehensive analysis of cohesion, set down markers for the future that we can use as our reference manuals."
"But there can be no doubt about our commitment to cohesion."
"In fact, we have it in every Treaty, including the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Everyone agrees that it is important just like motherhood and apple pie."
"Of course the proof is in the commitment in translating those obligations into practical policies."
"The rapporteur stresses the equal value - and I agree with him - of cohesion policy alongside achieving the single European market and economic and monetary union."
"Sometimes you could be forgiven for getting the impression that economic and social cohesion is a flanking policy."
"It is not."
"It is a key priority of the EU to make the European Union more than a single market, a free trade zone or a currency zone."
"Cohesion policies are vital to delivering a citizen's Europe and giving tangible support to regions and communities, to open up access to the opportunities of the single market for jobs and training."
"The visible projects that I see in my constituency, such as the computer training suite that I launched yesterday, is the human and proactive side of European Union policies."
"Support for coalfield communities, learning projects are an essential component of achieving economic and social cohesion."
"Member States at the extraordinary summit this week on employment would do well to remember that."
"Quite frequently they do not remember or think about the role that cohesion policy has."
"We know that inequalities persist and it is the objective of cohesion to continue to try to overcome these."
"I have to say that my comments are not addressed to Commissioner Wulf-Mathies, because we know of her commitment to cohesion policy, but to the whole College of Commissioners."
"We need to see more evidence of other policies contributing to, or addressing, the cohesion imperative."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner if she thinks it might be useful for us to have a cohesion audit on an annual basis and try to build that into the Commission's work programme."
"The other Commissioners would do well to review their own policies and see how they are supporting cohesion."
"One of the few criticisms I have of this excellent report is that the Commission has not dealt with EMU in a very effective way."
"The future is running fast to meet us and we still have no clear analysis of the impact of EMU on our regions."
"It is high time we looked at those issues."
"Finally, we have to have the means to match our ambitions for our cohesion policies as Jacques Santer said."
"Regional and cohesion policies can be successful if everyone works together - the Member States, the regions and the local authorities."
"The key priorities are: to be effective, to have a fair and equitable distribution, to have affordable policy, because less sometimes can be more, and to have a sustainable cohesion policy that will take us into the new millennium."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. The report which has been presented by Mr Izquierdo Collado is very comprehensive indeed and goes far beyond the remit for a critical analysis of the achievements of the structural fund over a period of three years, in respect of economic and social cohesion, and the resulting conclusions."
"We are in full agreement with the rapporteur on a number of points, namely the call for a greater concentration of resources, better coordination of community policies, improved economic competitiveness, sustained development and the creation of competitive jobs, since these are in fact priorities in the Union's structural policy."
"However, detail regulations pertaining to agriculture, Union financing for the whole of the next planning period, and the enlargement process due to take place during this period, do not belong directly to the motion for a resolution contained in Mr Izquierdo Collado's report."
"Now that these items are included, in spite of considerable opposition to some of them in the Committee, we are now obliged to examine them in this House, whereas the best solution would still be to delete them altogether."
"Here the rapporteur is becoming entangled in his own contradictions."
"On one hand it is said quite correctly that the limited instruments and resources should be deployed deliberately and purposively to reduce inequalities in economic development in those areas which require them most."
"At the same time we are focusing too much on ownership, the cohesion funds, the questioning of the upper limit for own resources and precautionary adjustments upwards, and paying too little attention to one of the fundamental principles of cohesion - namely the promotion of less-developed regions to the point where support of this kind is no longer needed."
"From the conception of the European structural policy it therefore becomes clear that the available aid is always to be of a temporary nature and is intended to make the recipient region independent of financial support of this kind in the medium and long term."
"Here, transitional instruments can serve as an effective bridge for those who are emerging from the benefit stage."
"Economic and social cohesion should not be a one way street."
"Giving and receiving cannot become too much of a one-sided arrangement, otherwise solidarity can all too easily become just the reverse."
"Put another way, financial agreements are always set-up for a specific period of time, and correctly so."
"At the end of this period the cards can be reshuffled to correspond with the new economic situation in the countries of the Union, this applying to both givers and receivers alike."
"The rapporteur quite justifiably calls for criteria for the promotion targets, but these criteria must be objective and easy-to-calculate, such as objective 1 regions receiving 75 % of GDP under the NUTS II scheme."
"Though the report may be controversial, various compromises have been reached in the preliminary debate."
"Its acceptance by the majority of the House will depend on the adoption of important amendments."
"Mr President, the structural funds have played a positive role in helping the less developed regions on the periphery of the Union to develop their economies closer to their full potential and to close the gap with the well-off regions in the core of the Union."
"This is particularly true in Ireland where the structural funds have been concentrated on constructing new improved roads, airport facilities, industrial modernization and vocational training for young people."
"The results of this concentration of resources are beginning to bear fruit as the Irish economy records consistently high economic growth rates and new employment opportunities emerge throughout the country."
"However, the objective of improving average living standards in Ireland to the levels existing in the better-off regions of the centre of the Union is still a long way from being achieved."
"There are continuing structural problems in the economy which must be removed if our economy is to achieve its full potential and be able to maintain a GNP level similar to that of the better-off regions of the Union."
"The structural funds have played a central role in encouraging the advances of recent years."
"I believe the use that Ireland has made of these funds can serve as a model for other regions and countries of the Union."
"It is vital to continue the programme of capital investment now under way, not just in order to finish the many important projects that have already begun, but also to maintain the impetus which has resulted in the economy recording consistently strong growth levels in recent years."
"These strong growth levels have led to many commentators suggesting that the need for structural fund investment in Ireland is declining."
"I would strongly disagree with this view."
"The criteria for assessing whether or not a country or region qualifies for maximum structural fund levels can mask continuing, underlying problems."
"For example, the use of GDP levels suggests that Irish economic development has made stronger advances than is the case if use is made of GNP levels."
"Consequently our level of development as compared with better-off regions of the Union is also exaggerated."
"This is because of the amount of foreign investment in our economy which distorts the situation to our advantage."
"The issue should be addressed when the next round of structural funds is being divided between qualifying regions."
"Secondly, unemployment levels must be given a prominent place among the criteria being used to determine qualification for Objective 1 status."
"Finally, the Irish authorities, like those of many other less-developed regions of the Union, have a particularly serious problem trying to find employment opportunities for the long-term unemployed who are often without even the most basic skills which they could offer potential employers."
"This problem should be taken on board when determining eligibility."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, the first thing I want to do is congratulate Mr Izquierdo Collado on his report on the triennial report on economic and social cohesion."
"Obviously, this report was produced at a time when the earliest information about Agenda 2000 was just becoming known."
"I think the rapporteur has done the right thing in basing his report on all the information available to him at the time, because the reports which we produce in Parliament are living documents which are in touch with reality, and we should not restrict ourselves to watertight compartments."
"There will be time to modify, if need be, the opinions which Mr Izquierdo Collado is expressing today in the current report."
"Economic and social cohesion is the basis of the European Union. I should like to remind you that although it was not one of the themes of the Treaty of Rome, nevertheless somebody - in fact, it was Minister Spaak - was already predicting the future need for instruments to promote economic and social cohesion in the various regions and zones of Europe."
"I believe the European Union has progressed in some ways in this respect, as regards the instruments, the structural funds, the cohesion fund, and the common agricultural policy itself, in order to strengthen this economic and social cohesion."
"And it is clear - one of the speakers said so - that the assistance provided for this strengthening of economic and social cohesion cannot consist of unlimited aid granted for an indefinite period of time, but has to be properly controlled - which it is."
"I would even say that it is controlled precisely because it is measured in terms of the domestic product of those regions which receive help in the form of structural funds."
"Of course, even if this aid is for a limited time, I should say that the period is a long one, because a region cannot be developed, nor its situation improved, in a short time."
"Therefore, this should be thought of as long-term aid."
"In this sense, I agree with the rapporteur when he calls for more coordination in implementing these policies. I would say we need the subsidiarity principle to be applied to a greater extent, giving regional and local bodies their proper role and allowing them more responsibility in executing these funds."
"I do not think we have the right legislation for applying this principle of competence to the regional bodies, in order to allow them to manage the cohesion funds and the structural funds."
"I therefore think this is a good report and that this structural fund policy should be maintained."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, none of us can be satisfied or comfortable with the Commission's report on the development of economic and social cohesion in the European Union."
"If a few Member States' GDPs do approximate to a very limited extent to the Community average, that cannot conceal the fact that such progress is clearly insufficient in itself and, as such, incompatible and out of line with the fundamental objectives established by the Treaty of Europe in that respect."
"We also note a clear aggravation of the inequality between the richest and poorest regions, and the real and obvious inappropriateness of many policies to the objective of cohesion is confirmed beyond doubt, particularly the common agricultural policy, whose lack of structural and regional balance results in the richest farmers receiving over 80 % of subsidies and cohesion countries such as Portugal, for example, being a net contributor to the common policy."
"Yet these clear limitations and insufficiencies were quite clearly foreseeable, since, the budgetary resources provided for the period from 1994 to 1999 were and are insufficient, thus confirming the appropriateness of the ceiling for the Community Budget in 1999 as proposed by Jacques Delors in Edinburgh, or the essential need for the even greater sums suggested at that time by various economic fact-finding studies, which proved that such sums were vital to ensure a real convergence rate that could deliver genuine internal cohesion."
"And also because resources were paltry from the outset and therefore national capacities for financial absorption were and still are limited, not for lack of projects or needs, but because of budgetary restrictions designed to achieve the purposes of the single currency, which are thus in clear conflict with the objectives of cohesion."
"On the eve of decisions on the future financial framework of a Union with more members and new and growing needs for structural and other forms of support, it is becoming increasingly obvious -despite what Mr Berend has just said, in the light of what we know about the proposals contained in Agenda 2000, and we and the rapporteur prefer not to hide our heads in the sand like ostriches - it is becoming increasingly obvious, as I was saying, that certain aspects put forward in Mr Izquierdo Collado's report are highly relevant."
"We must maintain the cohesion fund for its present beneficiaries with a GDP of less that 90 % of the Community average; we need to ensure that the present levels of aid to existing Member States continue in force; it is absolutely essential to match policies to principles and practise real cohesion; and it is vital that we face the new problems arising from enlargement with our financial capacity strengthened."
"The consensus of opinion on these central issues inevitably brings us back to the need to reconsider the level proposed by the Committee for future financial perspectives (1.27 % of Community GDP, the same proportion as before, which has been shown to be too low a ceiling for 1999). This makes it necessary to alter the proposed figures, or at least to revise them appropriately before the first enlargement takes place."
"Mr President, the European internal market has produced remarkable gains for national economies, but has so far failed to bridge the gap between rich and poor."
"Unemployment in the ten poorest regions is almost seven times higher than in the ten richest regions."
"The concentration effect of the internal market is clearly bringing greater wealth to the industrialized areas, but at the expense of the disadvantaged regions."
"In spite of substantial structural funding we have yet to redress this inequality."
"Are we to allow this to continue?"
"While the initial trend was to do away with economic and social cohesion as the European Union's own solidarity policy, the cohesion report is becoming a symbol for the preservation of the European social model."
"Yet there are still finance ministers in individual Member States who are haunted by visions of fantastic sums being paid out by Europe's net contributors."
"On a number of recent occasions the German Finance Minister has forgotten that the structural fund is not there simply to transfer financial resources between Member States, but rather is designed to use the EU's economic potential in the best possible way for the good of the Community."
"Does the Commission really want to change the message of the cohesion report and to make greater use of the structural policy for the harmonious development of the Community?"
"Here I fail to see the substantive embodiment of sustained development in Agenda 2000."
"In this context sustained means restoring the balance between ecology, economy and social security - not only for the industrialised areas but also for the disadvantaged regions."
"At the moment, and for the foreseeable future, the latter tend to be the rural areas."
"But an effective cohesion policy is only possible with the cooperation of the people on the ground."
"They are entitled to a development policy which meets their needs and should not have centralized projects, such as the current plan for trans-European networks, imposed upon them from above."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, firstly I should like to congratulate Mr Izquierdo, as my colleagues have done, for producing this complicated, difficult, important and interesting report."
"We have repeatedly discussed this report during long meetings in the Committee on Regional Policy. The report evaluates the results of Community cohesion policy during the last few years, and considers it to be a basic and fundamental element in the building of the European Union, and its future."
"In discussing and voting on this report, we need to think about certain points which have not only been vitally important in the recent past, but will continue to be so in the immediate future, because of enlargement."
"It must be stressed that cohesion policy has had the positive effect of reducing the existing disparities between the Member States, as regards cohesion and other aspects."
"However, there are still regrettable regional differences in income, while differences in unemployment rates have increased."
"This fact reveals the lack of coordination between the various Community policies, and demonstrates the need for a global approach to ensure that they are consistent with the objective of economic and social cohesion."
"Another worrying aspect which has arisen during the debate on this report, Mr President, is the attempt to withdraw the cohesion fund from those countries which join the first phase of economic and monetary union."
"This idea, which in itself displays a lack of solidarity, contradicts the spirit and the letter of the treaty, where the cohesion fund and the method for its application are set out explicitly."
"Projects to do with the environment and with transport infrastructures are vital for these Member States, and these projects take a long time and require a lot of funding."
"Nevertheless, access to economic and monetary union is absolutely appropriate, and is not at all contradictory to or incompatible with what I have just said."
"That is what the European Commission said in Agenda 2000 because, among other things, its legal department has set out the basis for applying the cohesion fund, and this is absolutely independent of whether or not the convergence criteria have been met and whether monetary union has been accomplished."
"As Mr Izquierdo's report says, a country's efforts to join the third phase of economic and monetary union will be of no value to that country if it is immediately punished by having the cohesion fund withdrawn. This fund is essential at all stages of the process."
"Therefore, Madam Commissioner, we think it would be a good idea for you to convey to this House the content of your legal department's document on this question, so that we can learn what is in it, and devote some thought to it."
"It is up to us in the European Parliament to emphasize why cohesion was included in the treaty: to define a fair Europe, characterized by solidarity and social commitment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is more than a common internal market."
"It is more than a common currency, which will soon be introduced, it is a Community because of its constitution and because of its composition and it is cohesion which sustains it."
"For the benefit of those who do not meet it every day, it is worth explaining exactly what is meant by the term cohesion."
"Cohesion is a characteristic trait, that means, we look at one another and together try to get this European Union going, the stronger working with the weaker and the weaker with the stronger."
"For this purpose we have at our disposal a great European instrument, and that is the structural fund."
"I will talk about this later."
"Returning to the subject, however, it has to be said that individual national policies also form part of the European policy of cohesion."
"Mr Izquierdo Collado and the cohesion report itself drew attention to this fact and we should be thankful for it."
"Policies should not undercut or counteract each other."
"Here the first step is to ensure that National States do not introduce policies which block what is being done at European level - otherwise the policies we apply here become completely nonsensical."
"This also means, however, that we must coordinate our policies, while at the same time guarding against a policy in which everything is submitted to absolute diktat, since this would render us incapable of focusing on individual objectives."
"Research is one such area. Here quality is the most important factor and this must be upheld."
"I am truly grateful to Mr Izquierdo Collado, and this contrasts with the remarks made by Mr Berend, that he has dealt with the subject on a much wider basis."
"It is a matter which also includes the structural fund."
"In our discussion we had to ensure that we were not tying ourselves to the present."
"The debate on the structural fund will take place next year."
"There is no doubt whatsoever that guidelines are required for this debate and it without doubt also right to draw lessons from the cohesion report."
"In the committee and in the following discussions we encountered difficulties when agreeing the cohesion fund for the coming years."
"This is to be my final remark on the subject."
"We did not want to make any commitments as far as subsequent debates on the structural fund are concerned."
"We do not wish to introduce a fund which at the end of the day only results in a transfer of revenue."
"For this reason we have made it clear that the compromise which has been found is for us, in its wording, both binding and reasonable."
"In this respect I want to thank Mr Izquierdo Collado, who has devoted an enormous amount of time and effort to the project."
"He has done great service to the subject matter, namely economic and social cohesion, and I would like to congratulate him on his report."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, the realization of cohesion is affected by the globalization of economies which has been very progressing very quickly, and which the activity of the EU should act as a counterweight to."
"In its essential internal policy, however, the EU had not acted in the spirit of article 130b. For example, EU policy on traffic, competition, science and research has focused its influence more on the economy than on the enhancement of solidarity."
"Likewise with energy policy, there should be alternatives for the promotion of cohesion, rather than centralization."
"One example of this is the bio-energy resources of the Nordic regions and their effective exploitation."
"The EU seems more concerned these days with the blending of economic policies and monetary systems than the preservation of the essentials of life in remote areas."
"This is also seen in the decisions on cuts in Member States' budgets for miserly hand-outs in the future."
"The EU should, in the name of cohesion, ensure that the complimentary principle takes root in Member States."
"As it is now, EU funds are often used as a substitute for former national regional policy funds."
"Of great importance to cohesion in the EU is, furthermore, the viability of agriculture throughout the entire EU region."
"The present system of agricultural aid does not account sufficiently for production difficulties due to factors of climate and other conditions in nature in both the northern and southern peripheral regions."
"Cold or drought, sparsely-populated areas and long distances from main markets are major drawbacks that require compensation."
"This is one of the main issues of cohesion policy and this report merely glosses over it."
"A workable and efficient cohesion policy requires the EU to aid the development of the regions, given their particular conditions, and to operate more flexibly than it does now."
"Mr President, cohesion policy will soon have to face two challenges: economic and monetary union, and enlargement."
"Either of these could result in the existing regional inequalities becoming more pronounced, as previous speakers have repeatedly said."
"The fact that it is possible for these differences to become more pronounced shows that the application of the cohesion fund has been relatively unsuccessful."
"Recognizing this failure should be the starting point for any thinking about its future."
"For one thing, the budgetary rigour imposed by the stability pact can endanger even the objectives which have been achieved."
"The imminent dangers demonstrate that the cohesion fund has to be made more redistributive than it is at present."
"In conclusion, I should like to say that we support the measures which this report proposes as regards coordinating Community policies, administrative transparency, job creation, and so on. However, all these measures become meaningless if the cohesion fund is not supported as an end in itself, rather than as a subordinate measure of less importance than other policies."
"Mr President, the short time available forces us to make choices and omit aspects of context or appraisal of the Commission's report."
"This report shows how dangerous the theory of a fair return is, developed by several Member States, when the policy of cohesion is applied, and show that the other policies only make a relative contribution towards achieving the objective of cohesion."
"I want to concentrate on the essential message Parliament wishes to send through the Izquierdo Collado report, because we are about to reform the funds and the enlargement process, to achieve monetary union and hold the Extraordinary Council on Employment."
"These all deadlines which, in our opinion, will be affected by the follow-up to this report and, in particular, by the items taken from Parliament's report: the difficulty of overcoming regional differences; the fact that other Union policies, but also many national policies, do not contribute towards cohesion and the fact that the report has some gaps in it, for example that of not dealing entirely with the consequences of expansion and the achievement of the monetary union and particularly post monetary union."
"I would like to conclude by asking the Commissioner whether he can tell us in his reply what value the Commission will place on the report but also on Parliament's opinion so as to enlighten subsequent choices."
"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if the first triennial report on cohesion was good, and the Commission, and particularly Directorate-General XVI, deserve our congratulations for the analysis and thought that went into the document, then the report on that document presented by our colleague Juan de Dios Izquierdo Collado is a balanced and well-structured text, containing rigorous and thorough analysis, and just to read it gives an idea of the huge efforts which such an undertaking required."
"I should like to draw attention to two statements which appear in the report: firstly, the inequalities within the European Union have hardly been reduced in the last ten years, despite the progress which has been made and the effectiveness of structural policies; secondly, nearly all Community policies have effects which are clearly counterproductive to cohesion."
"These statements mean that neither article 130a nor article 130b of the Treaty are being rigorously applied."
"On the one hand, structural policy does not receive sufficient funds to allow regional inequalities to be reduced quickly in the medium term. On the other hand, Community policies are not formulated in such a way as to include the basic aim of reducing regional inequalities."
"Agenda 2000 can correct these shortcomings."
"Regional policy reform; concentrating the effects of the structural funds; rationalizing regional programming; preserving the cohesion fund in its present form; and maintaining the relative position of the designated objective 1 regions: these measures, if applied using strict criteria, can be a golden opportunity to make progress in reducing regional inequalities."
"Reform of the common agricultural policy can allow the European Union's agriculture to regain its balance, if we do not follow the Commission's status quo policies, and achieve a balance between continental and Mediterranean farming, so that the best-funded policy in the Community budget is also ruled by criteria based on economic and social cohesion."
"I end by expressing once more my sincere congratulations to our rapporteur for his excellent work."
"Madam President, we regard Mr Izquierdo Collado's report as essentially constructive because it does indeed get to the heart of the crucial issue of economic and social cohesion."
"However, I would like to make a few comments concerning certain omissions, gaps and inconsistencies contained in the report."
"Nowhere does it mention that problems of foreign policy or of obstacles faced by various peripheral regions of the Community have an adverse effect on their cohesion and development and also on their progress towards equal ranking with other regions."
"First, I will take Greece as an example, where the situation in the Aegean, Turkish aggression, the stocking of stupid and dangerous weapons, adversely affect the development and growth of certain regions, especially the Aegean islands."
"Secondly, the report does not mention the unequal distribution of the, rather limited, funds."
"Madam President, while funds for Germany and Spain for 1994-1999 are increasing, they have been reduced in the case of Greece and Portugal, two of the poorest countries of the Community."
"Thirdly, I am rather surprised that there is no mention in the report of where those funds go, because, in the case of Greece, and Madam President is aware of this, they go on stupid things, on doing up music halls which do not contribute to growth or to employment, and which cannot be regarded as productive investments."
"Consequently, Madam President, this report must be supplemented, either by means of amendments or, on another occasion, to correct what the report emphasizes, namely the fact that the funds that are available do not meet the needs of real economic and social cohesion."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, may I begin by saying that cohesion is vital for a Union which is becoming increasingly integrated and will very soon be adopting a federal monetary system."
"The historical experience of federal or proto-federal states clearly shows that budgets must be designed with a view to redistribution, dispensing equity and justice."
"In addition to responding to enlargement, the European Union budget cannot evade that essential issue."
"Mr Izquierdo Collado's report makes an excellent critical analysis of the Commission's three-yearly report, which in itself is a report of high technical quality and great analytical rigour, but, not wishing to be constantly reiterating what has already been said, Mr Izquierdo Collado skillfully bridges the gap with Agenda 2000, introducing essential ideas on the future of the Union."
"Three comments seem to me to be necessary. The 1.27 % ceiling proposed for financial perspectives should be rejected."
"It is a dangerous strait-jacket."
"Once upon a time, in the Delors package, it was a stimulus; now it is a hindrance."
"Secondly, the cohesion fund must be maintained in view of its efficiency and relevance to the present situation."
"Thirdly, the present cohesion countries and regions cannot as a matter of principle pay the costs of enlargement, even partially."
"So it would be deplorable if aid to the cohesion countries were reduced."
"Portugal, for example, should not be penalized for the fine results she achieves by being a good pupil of the European school."
"If Portugal has achieved the feat of meeting the eligibility criteria and if she succeeds in maintaining a genuine convergence line - in 1995 Portugal achieved 67.4 % of the average Community GDP; in 1996 it went up to 68.3 %; and in 1997, with a calculated 4 % growth rate, it may rise to around 70 %, and, moreover, with unemployment under control - it would be serious, unjust and paradoxical if Portugal were penalized for her success."
"It would be like punishing virtue."
"This sort of confusion has happened before. In committee I have already suggested that we use first names when addressing each other."
"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, the previous speaker, Mr Lage, gave us the cue when he said it was all a matter of redistribution."
"I am of a quite different opinion and I believe that this is a subject which we must tackle and discuss in detail in the months ahead."
"It is something which is going to occupy us for some time to come."
"What does economic and social cohesion mean? To my mind it does not mean the creation of equal living standards, since the socialist model of wealth redistribution has failed in practice."
"It is a policy which cannot be implemented."
"What we can and should try to do is to create comparable living standards, and I am not just playing at semantics when I say this."
"What this wordplay conceals is that we can fully accept the differences which exist within the European Union, and that this actually allows free competition and indeed makes it necessary."
"My second comment is that economic and social cohesion is not, and never has been, primarily the responsibility of the European Union, but rather is a matter for the Member States, since the instruments and resources available to the Union can only act as an accessory to the main event."
"Madam President, the Commission's report is an important analysis of what has happened in the area of cohesion in the European framework."
"Furthermore, Mr Izquierdo Collado's report is an excellent analysis in connection with this."
"But as important as it is to analyze, we have to know what is going to follow on from this analysis."
"How is equality going to be enhanced among the regions?"
"How can the less developed regions gain access to the more developed regions, to tap their resources?"
"We must have a background strategy on this."
"Without any clear thinking on the influential forces that obtain in regional development we will not get beyond the situation where we only have projects scattered about here and there, all of which are unconnected, which threaten to take up enormous sums of money."
"We must also bear this in mind when we consider what is going to happen in the future to our cohesion fund."
"This kind of strategic view might be guided by Arlene McCarthy's idea that we should regularly check how cohesion is progressing."
"Then we would definitely have to give consideration to the real results."
"Neither can we underestimate the effects of national economic policies, national structural policies, and EMU."
"It is actually quite true that structural funding and cohesion funding are small items compared to national economic policy and what EMU is going to bring along with it."
"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, European economic and social cohesion is an essential principle and a prime objective in the building of Europe, and is just as important as monetary union or the single market."
"Nevertheless, the objectives of articles 130a and 130b of the treaty have not been achieved."
"The Commission's cohesion report shows this clearly."
"The inequalities between Member States have been reduced, but there is still a gulf separating rich and poor regions."
"The per capita income in the 25 best-off regions is three times greater than in the 25 least-developed regions."
"Therefore, we need to strengthen cohesion policy and European solidarity. We must not forget that this benefits everybody, not just those to whom it is specifically directed."
"We are not designing different sectoral policies: we are building a continent."
"We are providing Europe with territorial cohesion, in the face of the historic challenges of monetary union and the achievement of a great Europe."
"Therefore, we need to rise to the occasion we are living through, and plan financially for the challenges we face, by contributing the means to achieve our ambitions."
"Our inevitable enlargement cannot be achieved at the cost of our current European cohesion."
"We should simplify the programmes and concentrate resources in the less-favoured and peripheral regions of the European Union, maintaining - as we have done so far - two-thirds of the structural funds for objective 1, as the Commission has proposed. We should obey the treaty, and make sure that all policies tend towards economic and social cohesion - not just structural policies, but policies on agriculture, fisheries, research and development, transport, competition, state aid - from which, in the last analysis, the rich regions benefit more than the poor ones."
"The Izquierdo Collado report considers all these questions, or nearly all of them."
"Reports do not always contain everything we would like them to, of course, but in this area we need consensus. I know very well, however, that consensus is difficult to achieve, because as Mr Izquierdo Collado knows, I was the rapporteur for the Committee on Regional Policy's first report on the future of economic and social cohesion."
"However, I want to finish my speech, Mrs President, ladies and gentlemen, by expressing my sincere congratulations to Mr Izquierdo Collado for his magnificent piece of work, for its thoroughness and rigour, and everything that has been achieved in it."
"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I totally share the views that have been expressed on the report under debate and I would like to stress that the assertion that, after ten years of action of the structural funds there continue to be enormous economic and social inequalities between the various regions of the European Union, means that the objective of economic and social cohesion is part of a long term, steady process."
"The policy of convergence and cohesion, this key policy without which European integration would be impossible, must be pursued in order to consolidate what has been gained and to ensure steady progress towards growth, competitiveness and convergence throughout the coming years."
"The financial restraints that have been imposed by the pact of stability and growth, the anticipated realignments in the European market following the imminent enlargement of the Union, and the possible adverse effects on the less developed regions of the Union, such as Greece, underline the urgent need to intensify community efforts and to push forward the cohesion policy with adequate financial backing, during the new programming period."
"Madam President, there is no doubting the fact that economic and social cohesion is a fundamental part of the European Union's policy."
"The aim of this cohesion policy is to reduce the inequality which exists between EU regions."
"Europe is regarded thus, and solidarity too, but solidarity naturally has its limits - and even rich countries have poverty and structural problems within their boundaries."
"Looked at this way, net contributors want to be more than just payers."
"They therefore insist that the absolute limits of 1.27 % of GDP below 0.46 %, as far as the budget and structural policy is concerned, should remain as real limits."
"In this context the question which arises for me, and probably for others too, is whether a report which covers the period 1994 to 1996 really has to include subject matter relating to the future of the cohesion fund and to the future financing of the Union."
"As I have already said, there are still a number of question marks hanging over the whole thing."
"In other respects we can accept this report and its contents in full."
"Support for SMEs and greater inclusion of private initiatives in EU structural and reform policies should be considered important, particularly when this means the creation and/or preservation of jobs, and consequently a reduction in unemployment levels."
"Here Europe really is living not just in abstract solidarity, but in the kind of solidarity which matters to individual job seekers."
"On the subject of enlargement, which Mr Izquierdo Collado's report also covered, one can only emphasize that the preparatory phase must be supported by a special financial instrument so that new Member States can really be brought into the European community of nations."
"Madam President, this report by my compatriot and political rival, Mr Izquierdo Collado, is not good: it is magnificent."
"It is magnificent because he has managed to approach the theme, not from a national viewpoint, not from a party-political viewpoint, but from a thoroughly European viewpoint - from the point of view of the philosophy and social model which should dominate the process of the building of Europe."
"Mr Izquierdo Collado's political group and my own, which are the two most important groups in the building of Europe, both agree that Europe will only be possible if it is based on two elements: a functioning market, and the strict application of the principle of social compensation."
"That is why everybody has so often said that the building of Europe rests on three equally important pillars: the internal market, economic and monetary union, and economic and social cohesion."
"How did cohesion perform during the period we are considering?"
"The conclusions are clear: if you add together the effects of domestic aid (state aid), non-structural Community policies (basically, research and development policies) and truly structural policies, there has been a loss of cohesion."
"This is because the differences between the 25 best-off and the 25 worst-off regions is the same at the end of this period as at the beginning, and because the differences between the states have increased."
"There has been a loss of cohesion, furthermore, because the amount of per capita aid (adding the three types together) is much greater in those countries not included in cohesion policy than in those countries which are included."
"There are three reasons why we should not decrease our efforts towards cohesion. Firstly, because it has not been enough."
"Secondly, when the internal market and economic and monetary union are complete, they will increase the extent to which activities are concentrated in the richest countries. Thirdly - and this is an aspect the report does not take into account - once we no longer have exchange rates and monetary policy as a way of dealing with crises of asymmetry, funds to address the principle of cohesion will be needed more than ever."
"Congratulations, rapporteur; my only regret is that you do not belong to my political group."
"Madam President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. This report, and the matter under discussion, focuses attention on two particular areas, namely structure and agricultural policy."
"Here I must contradict Mr Rack."
"What is the point of examining the past without also drawing conclusions for the future."
"Mr Izquierdo Collado tries to train his argument on the future, knowing well that the EU is in constant flux and that we are right now faced with major changes if we are to include European enlargement in our considerations."
"Yet this approach is the correct one, since enlargement is coming and in political terms it is both necessary and desirable."
"We also have to ask how much this will cost."
"Can the European family continue to manage its affairs in the same way as before when it has to look after a number of new members?"
"Is it not time for some reorganizing here and there?"
"Should we also be tightening our belts?"
"Here talk of ownership is simply out of place."
"The structural fund has been introduced to enable the EU's poorer regions to adapt."
"I am assuming here that these regions will in fact be able to adapt over a period of years by the efficient use of resources."
"There are in fact some early indications of success in this respect."
"Were this not to be the case, then the resources in question will have been misappropriated."
"It is simply premature to be discussing increased levels of self-generated resources."
"Of course we will have to think about this again in five years time and review the situation. I advocate this, as does my group."
"I believe that the same applies to the cohesion fund, which was set up to help Member States move towards monetary union."
"When this has been achieved, then I would say that the cohesion fund will have fulfilled its role."
"Should further support be required, then we should consider some other arrangement, possibly also involving a structural aid scheme."
"Economic and social cohesion cannot only be measured in terms of financial resources."
"But cohesion must also come from within."
"I regret that we have had so few positive things to say this evening, but I too am running out of time."
"Let me just say one final thing: structural policy and regional policy have both scored successes and that is something we should not forget."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen. Let me first thank the rapporteur, Mr Izquierdo Collado, for his excellent report, and let me also thank him for saying that the European Parliament was satisfied with the structural policy."
"I think his remarks also include a degree of criticism, but nevertheless, one is pleased to hear a positive comment on the subject."
"In this respect I also wish to express my sincere thanks to Mrs Klaß for recognizing the success of the structural policy."
"On behalf of the College of Commissioners may I say unequivocally that the cohesion report carries the full conviction of the Commission that cohesion policy is a mainstay of the European integration model."
"I think that this is borne out by a number of decisions, not only in the area of cohesion policy."
"Economic and social cohesion as the guiding principle for a common policy therefore extends far beyond the economic dimension."
"The aims of the structural policy and its practical implementation on the ground are extremely important when it comes to understanding and accepting the European Union and reinforcing the social dimension in Europe."
"I believe that the cohesion report also brings this clearly to the fore."
"A number of you also mentioned other EU policy areas which were first looked at in conjunction with the cohesion initiative."
"I would like to emphasize once again that here we should not lose sight of the primary objectives of community policy."
"From our point of view its contribution as far as cohesion is concerned is much more positive than has been suggested in the report and by a number of speakers in the debate."
"The reform of the common agricultural policy, for example, has had a positive effect on cohesion since 1992 because it has guaranteed higher transfers of funds to the poorest Member States and regions."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has also referred to this in its opinion statement."
"It is important, in my opinion, that we pursue this through the Agenda 2000 package."
"The main objective of European research policy, if I may comment briefly on the subject, is to strengthen the EU's competitive position as a supplier of flagship technologies, primarily vis-à-vis the United States and Japan."
"Nevertheless, one of the key roles of the research framework programmes is also the dissemination of research results and technology transfer projects; this new knowledge will be of benefit to everyone and indeed they will find a wealth of information in the framework programmes."
"Yet the Commission still sees its future role in helping develop the use of synergies and improving the coordination of all Community policies."
"The Committee welcomes the support for its reform proposals and, if I understand the situation correctly, there seems ultimately to be a consensus, if one reads between the lines, in favour of reforming the structural funds regulation, both in the budget framework as well as in terms of its priorities and necessities."
"The Commission is convinced that the proposals of Agenda 2000 will guarantee unlimited solidarity with the poorest regions of the Union for years to come and will provide a progressive access route for new member countries."
"We therefore consider that changes to the budget plan or even to the financial forecast are unnecessary."
"I believe that we can also sense agreement on the need to concentrate objectives and programmes."
"I think that we also agree on basic objectives, such as the reduction of development disparities, the fight against unemployment and of course the need for sustained development."
"Allow me again to clarify the Commission's proposal for the cohesion fund, since this was a key part of the discussion."
"The proposal is designed to ensure that Member States whose GNP is below 90 % will continue to receive assistance after joining the monetary union, the reason for this being that there are still considerable infrastructure backlogs, even in the most successful cohesion countries."
"Certainly, the 90 % criterion will have to be reassessed half way through, and if it is no longer applicable, then we should still be in a position to draw conclusions from the success of our previous policy."
"I cannot support the call for an additional structural policy support instrument in respect of economic and monetary union."
"The structural funds were not designed as a short-term response to regional economic crises, neither were they intended to be a long-term instrument for fiscal adjustment."
"Maintaining the cohesion fund will, in my opinion, promote the continued extension of Europe's infrastructure, even under the difficult conditions imposed by the stability pact."
"Neither should we forget that Member States and regions with weak infrastructures are the very ones who stand to profit most both from increasing levels of growth and from falling interest rates, which even now are evident as a result of stability initiatives."
"Nevertheless, I believe that it is correct for us to keep a close watch on development within the Union and to report on it at regular intervals."
"I think that I will do this anyway in the Committee on Regional Policy at very regular and frequent intervals."
"Finally, the Commission also welcomes the broad consensus on the guideline principles for the reform of the structural funds Regulation."
"Simplification and transparency are basic pre-requirements for the success of decentralization."
"But the Commission wants not only to decentralize but also to ensure that local and regional actors and social partners have a greater involvement in the framing and implementation of the programmes - otherwise decentralization can quickly turn into renationalization."
"And that is something which we all want to prevent."
"Let me conclude by thanking you once more for the extremely constructive dialogue which has taken place between Parliament and the Commission."
"You can be sure that we continue to regard Parliament as an important ally when it comes to safeguarding the economic and social cohesion of the Union."
"Contributions to International Fund for Ireland"
"The next item is the report (A4-0317/97) by Mr Gutiérrez Díaz, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, on the proposal for a Council Regulation on Community financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland (COM(97)0130 - C4-0233/97-97/0116(CNS))"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin my presentation of this report by once more pointing out how important we in this House think it is to undertake initiatives to support the process of peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland. We respect that region's ability to provide its own solutions, but we also have a firm wish to cooperate in their implementation."
"In the European Parliament there is unanimous support for peace, reconciliation, recovery and development in a territory which, since it is part of the European Union, we all feel part of."
"The Committee on Regional Policy has repeatedly expressed this wish for solidarity, in the form of concrete proposals, and is doing so again today before the European Parliament with this report which I am honoured to present."
"Opinions and votes have been contributed to this report by the representatives of all the political groups who sit on the committee, and I must also mention the important role played by those Members of the European Parliament who are directly related with Northern Ireland, whose names we are all familiar with, and whom we thank once again for their efforts."
"The proposal for a regulation which the Commission is presenting to us is along the same general lines as the existing 1994 regulation. The European Parliament contributed to that regulation, by means of an excellent example of collaboration with Council, who incorporated all our amendments into the text."
"The new element of the current proposal is the reference to the Community initiative programme Peace. It is essential to take this into account, since it pursues the same objectives."
"The proposal rightly seeks to ensure consistency between projects financed by the fund and those supported by the Peace initiative. Such consistency is vital, but proper coordination is also needed between measures financed by the fund, and those financed by the structural policies."
"That is the purpose of our Amendments Nos 1, 3 and 5."
"We also think, Mrs President, ladies and gentlemen, that it is important to stress that financing from the fund must be exclusively additional in nature, being directed towards objectives which will increase the region's innate potential. That is what we intend with Amendment No 2."
"Finally, bearing in mind that the European Union is the leading donor to the International Fund for Ireland, we think it is right - and important - that the citizens of Northern Ireland should be made aware of our efforts to express our solidarity with them as fellow Europeans. This is the purpose of Amendment No 4."
"It is our constant wish to help to break the vicious circle of violence, economic problems and exclusion which hinders the peace process. Therefore, we are in favour of the fund's continuation, and we hope that our amendments can help it to become better coordinated, to be used in a way which will complement and assist other initiatives, and to be better known and appreciated by the public."
"Madam President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for his tremendous work and cooperation on this report."
"The future of social cohesion in the two communities in Northern Ireland is inextricably linked to the future of the International Fund for Ireland for such is the importance of the fund as an instrument for reconciliation and development."
"The key to lasting peace on the island of Ireland lies with the process of reconciliation at ground level in communities and in neighbourhoods."
"This is work that is carried out away from the public eye, far from the high-profile peace talks currently taking place."
"However, it is this work at community level which will bring people together to recognize what they have in common rather than that which divides them."
"It is vital that this work underpins the continuing quest for a lasting and just peace in my country."
"The International Fund has played a uniquely valuable role in facilitating and promoting the community level process."
"However, this is work for the long haul; it will take many years for the scars of the past to heal and to banish the mistrust and suspicion."
"It is vital, therefore, that the fund continues to prosper and grow."
"The emphasis that the fund places on cross-Community projects is particularly important and must be given every support."
"I welcome the strong contribution and continuing support from the European Union but, in particular, from Parliament here towards searching for that reconciliation and that peace."
"The continued existence of poverty and disadvantage in Northern Ireland and in the border counties serves only to exacerbate the challenges of the peace process."
"In this regard the focus of the fund on disadvantaged areas is of particular importance."
"If people feel discriminated against, it is much harder for them to feel they belong to part of a community or to be part of that process."
"As well as that, the key work and cooperation that can be created at cross-border level has been neglected for too long and the fund has brought together communities on both sides of the border to create greater understanding and a greater belief in what they can do for themselves."
"Madam President, on behalf of my political group and my Prime Minister and the British Government, I very much welcome the contribution the EU is making in this area."
"I want to say a special thank you to Mr Gutiérrez Díaz for the commitment he has shown on this issue, both as a former chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, a Vice-President of our Parliament and someone who has keenly followed these issues from the beginning of the peace process."
"He has demonstrated a great deal of sensitivity in this area and for that I thank him."
"I consider the International Fund for Ireland to be an essential part of the confidence-building process for the communities, alongside the peace and reconciliation programme."
"It is very important to engage local communities in groups, outside the institutional level of the current peace talks."
"These are their channels and their programmes and they have the ownership of this community-building peace programme."
"My government welcomes the continuing efforts being made by the Commissioner and the programmes she has launched."
"It is particularly important in this critical phase of talks for the EU to continue its commitment and for the International Fund to give a signal to our international partners that we still need to underpin the peace process with grass roots projects."
"I agree with the rapporteur that as the single biggest donor we would like to see the Commission fly the flag more often."
"Indeed, we would like to see Commissioner Wulf-Mathies there backing these projects and launching them."
"Equally, we need to have budgetary rigour."
"We want to see more effective use of funds and we do not want to see them duplicating what we do in mainstream funds or in the P & R programme but giving added value to work that is going on."
"Finally, I wish that all Members of this House could come and see the difference this makes to grass roots communities."
"Our Northern Ireland colleagues know this very well working as they do among the local communities."
"They will have seen the efforts made by groups to work in partnership, to rebuild communities."
"I pay tribute to the efforts of those local people, sometimes in impossible circumstances."
"In particular last year, when there was a breakdown of the peace process, these projects were vital peace lifelines."
"I should like to relate an anecdote."
"We conducted hearings on how these funds work."
"I was very impressed when a local community worker came up to me and I felt as if I had brought a case of money to him he was so grateful and so pleased for the support that the European Union was giving."
"He said: ' The people, the areas, the community groups at the heart of the problem must be at the heart of the solution.'"
"There are no quick fixes and we cannot overstate the importance of the alliance-building that has been done to date with the support of the International Fund for Ireland."
"Madam President, first I should like to compliment the rapporteur, Mr Gutiérrez Díaz, on his report and in particular for the sensitive appreciation of the situation in Northern Ireland that his explanatory text displays."
"Let me say straight away that I welcome the proposal by the Commission to extend European Community support for the International Fund for Ireland for a further two years."
"Although the proposed level of funding is lower than the last two years, we must recognize that it represents an increase on the original amount subscribed prior to 1995."
"I support the thrust of the amendments by Mr Gutiérrez Díaz, in particular with regard to the need for proper coordination between the fund's activities and projects financed under Community structural programmes: with regard to ensuring that assistance from the fund is additional to and not a substitute for other public expenditure; with regard to pursuing objectives that are consistent with the peace fund programme and with regard to ensuring that appropriate measures are taken by the Commission to publicize the Community participation in the activities of the fund."
"Let us get some credit for our support and if, in the process of attracting publicity, we also subject the workings of the fund and its governing body to more scrutiny then so much the better for transparency."
"This fund was established under the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which was not a treaty as suggested in the explanatory statement, with the objectives of promoting economic and social advance, while encouraging dialogue and reconciliation between the two communities of Northern Ireland."
"That is to be warmly supported and it is worth noting that it has been supported by countries of the Commonwealth as well as the United States, in addition to Member States of the European Union."
"However, we must remember that it is not easy to apply the consensus and conciliatory approach that characterize this Parliament to the deep historical divisions of Northern Ireland society."
"I hope very much that the new government in my country will not trample on Unionist wishes in its own desire to achieve a settlement but will remember that political solutions can only work if there is consent."
"Madam President, I also wish to pay tribute to the rapporteur and also to the Commission and Parliament for their continued support for the International Fund for Ireland."
"We are now at a crucial juncture in the peace process and I hope that in the months ahead we will see the forging of a lasting peace and the establishment of a historic accommodation between the communities on the island of Ireland."
"The work of peace is slow and much of the real work will be carried out behind the scenes to bring communities together in a spirit of openness and friendship, after generations of conflict and suspicion."
"The fund plays a vital role in this process and the purpose of the fund is to promote economic and social advance and to encourage contact, dialogue and reconciliation between nationalists and unionists throughout the island of Ireland."
"The fund has made great strides in fulfilling this objective and much has been achieved."
"The US has of course contributed ECU 270 million to date and the European Union ECU 150 million."
"This is a significant practical contribution on the part of the European Union to forging of peace."
"When the fund was put in place in 1986 many areas of Northern Ireland and the six border counties were experiencing business difficulties; high unemployment was the norm."
"Things have improved since then."
"Unemployment is down but still remains unacceptably high."
"The IFI jobs impact is estimated at an impressive 27, 800."
"Most importantly, support has been given to 639 organizations engaged in promoting social and economic development, involving 7, 600 community leaders."
"I would like to pay tribute to the chairman of the fund who has brought great experience to his role and has been particularly successful in securing much needed employment in Northern Ireland and the border counties."
"There is an important role for the International Fund for Ireland in supporting the development and in catalyzing the economic potential of the border counties."
"All those involved in the peace process have an onus to put in place a lasting peace and the International Fund together with peace and reconciliation, a major contribution for the European Union, and Interreg all play an important role and I hope that in the years to come we will see tremendous developments in Northern Ireland and the border counties where we will have a just and lasting peace."
"Madam President, the objective of the International Fund for Ireland to break the vicious circle of violence in Northern Ireland by contributing to peace and reconciliation is more important than ever at the moment."
"The European Union is now a major source of finance for the fund."
"I agree with the rapporteur, and I pay tribute to him here for his interest tonight, that it is vital to ensure proper coordination between the fund's activities and those financed under Community structural policies."
"I admire the way that Commissioner Wulf-Mathies has engaged with Northern Ireland."
"I know her commitment to direct participation by the citizens."
"In order to achieve this properly in this very difficult situation, careful monitoring of the funds and how they are disbursed is most important."
"The objectives of reconciliation and peace, establishing contacts between the two communities and forging links between them have an impeccable record in the fund."
"The number of community and cross-border groups brought together in projects financed by the fund reaches into the hundreds."
"We hope to increase it further."
"Madam President, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report."
"I think he was the right man picked for the job for he has a depth of knowledge of Northern Ireland."
"I am very pleased to see the Commissioner here tonight as well because she also has acquired a good knowledge since she took office."
"The IFI has had a credibility problem in the community I represent since its inception in 1986."
"When I compare this fund to the Peace and Reconciliation Fund for effectiveness, I am afraid I have to say that the IFI disappears totally into oblivion."
"This, to me and the people I represent is unacceptable."
"The rapporteur has called for increased transparency."
"We need more accountability."
"There is little doubt about that."
"The IFI continues as if nothing is wrong."
"It seems to me that whatever representation is made is overturned, overlooked and never given any credence."
"They seem to be able to come out to Brussels and brainwash the people there."
"They do not look to see where the problems actually lie in the fund."
"They have made no attempt to make the fund more acceptable to the broad Unionist community."
"In the next two years there must be a root-andbranch change."
"Instead of hiding behind box numbers as they do at present in Belfast, they have got to come out into the open."
"We need to see real transparency."
"I would like to be more positive but I would be misleading this House and the Commissioner if I did not spell out the weaknesses I see in this fund at the present moment in time."
"I hope we will question why the chairman and the secretariat have not been more pro-active in ensuring the IFI achieve that which it was designed to do, and that is to lend support."
"Unfortunately I cannot hold out the same degree of hope for the chairman of the fund and the secretariat."
"We need to get a total clearance of some of the people that are there at the moment."
"We need it now, and we need the fund to achieve what it was originally designed to do."
"Madam President, I want to thank the rapporteur, the Commissioner and other colleagues who are here tonight."
"I think it is symptomatic of the goodwill that has been shown towards the peace process in Northern Ireland."
"The International Fund, as has been said here, has played a very positive role in the quest for a lasting and peaceful settlement to the Northern Ireland conflict."
"Since its inception, this particular fund has supported more than 3, 400 individual projects and has helped in the creation of roughly 28, 000 jobs."
"There might be a perception that the IFI is an American programme while the Special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation is a European one."
"I think it is time we dispelled this perception because Europe, in fact, is now the main contributor to both of these programmes."
"Today we can see that we provide here, in Europe, almost half of the IFI's annual budget."
"As the managers of the fund themselves acknowledge, the European Union's contribution represents a major international recognition of the efforts by both the Irish and British Governments to seek a peaceful solution to the Northern Ireland conflict."
"With regard to what Mr Nicholson has said, I know there has been a perception in the past that the nationalist communities have benefited to some extent over the unionists, but I think that criticism has now been redressed."
"I hope that the fund continues to treat, and will be seen to treat, all sides fairly."
"That is very important."
"Also, it is very necessary for MEPs - and not only MEPs, but the public at large - to be able to find out more about what is going on there."
"Monitoring is very important."
"This point has been made and I want to endorse it."
"Finally, the funding must be additional."
"It must not replace other public or private sources of finance."
"Madam President, I want to support the rapporteur's point that there could be a greater awareness of the European contribution to this fund."
"The Delors package has not been so long in existence."
"It has, thanks to the efforts of the Commission and Parliament, been better publicized in Northern Ireland."
"To date the European Union has given ECU 150 million, as people have said, and has involved itself with more than 3, 000 projects."
"Given the relatively small size of the area that is Northern Ireland and the border counties, it has touched a large proportion of the population."
"What is most in evidence is that it has brought voluntary organizations together and these organizations in turn have brought their public representatives into closer contact and greater cooperation with each other."
"There is one big lesson to be learned from this fund operating together with the Delors package: this is that small amounts of money can very often have a bigger political impact than the investment would suggest."
"That has happened in this case."
"As a representative of the border region of Ireland I want to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur, Parliament, the various groups and the Commission for the consideration and sympathy that they have always shown with the problems in Northern Ireland."
"I want to thank too the Commissioner whose name is well known in the border regions and in Northern Ireland and who has made a remarkable contribution to bringing the spirit of European goodwill and cooperation into that divided community."
"The goodwill has been translated into three packages: Northern Ireland got Priority 1 status when its economic development stage would not have justified it; the Delors package and the International Fund for Ireland all together have made a fairly remarkable contribution to getting voluntary workers to come together."
"I regret it if there are people in Northern Ireland who have a feeling that one community has benefited more than the other or that the transparency that should be there is not there."
"It takes a while to break down prejudices, but I will certainly support any case that is brought to me on behalf of the Unionist community, just the same as the nationalists, if it is shown that they have not got their share of this money. I am sure the Commissioner will do the same."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me first express my thanks to Mr Gutiérrez Díaz for this very important report."
"The Commission also thanks Parliament for its commitment to the peace process in Northern Ireland and in particular for its support of the International Fund for Ireland."
"The IFI has a vital role to play in promoting dialogue and reconciliation between Nationalists and Unionists, and through this it complements the measures provided under the structural fund for the whole island of Ireland and the considerable efforts which the Commission has made through its programme for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland."
"It is especially important, in my view, that those who are acting for the IFI should be based in both population groups and should make every effort to involve both groups in the various projects."
"The draft regulation now before you clearly states that European resources should be used primarily for projects which are in accord with the Peace programme and that in this case priority should be given to projects which extend across the political and religious divide."
"The Commission is therefore pleased to accept the rapporteur's proposals, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, for coordination between the IFI, the structural funds and the Peace programme."
"The same applies to proposals for giving greater publicity to the work of the IFI."
"This may also help to break down mistrust."
"I believe it to be in all our interests that everyone should regard not only these projects but also those introduced at European level as measures designed to help both groups - and primarily those who have suffered most from the violence of recent years and months."
"The Commission has already agreed with the IFI that it will give greater prominence to the involvement of the European Union in projects which are promoted jointly by Peace and the IFI or by one of the structural funds and the IFI."
"As an initial step in this direction flagship projects which have a high proportion of cofinancing from EU resources shall in future be known as IFI/EU flagship projects."
"I hope that this is given due attention in our publicity campaign."
"Allow me yet again to express my thanks to Parliament for its support of the peace and reconciliation process in Northern Ireland and in Ireland as a whole."
"Our most ardent wish is for a lasting peace in Ireland, something which will also highlight Europe's role in the application of the principles of the Union, which are to establish, and provide long-term support for, a process of peace and reconciliation by working together for the benefit of the common good."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Wulf-Mathies."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Practice of the profession of lawyer"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A4-0337/97), on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Directive to facilitate practice of the profession of lawyer on a permanent basis in a Member State other than that in which the qualification was obtained (C4-0440/97-94/0299(COD)) (rapporteur: Mrs Fontaine)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, here we are at the happy end of a long journey because, as I have been told, the legal profession has desired this directive on freedom of establishment for more than twenty years."
"But if everyone apart from the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, for reasons of their specific situation, were agreed on the principle, then discussions on the content led to a ferocious clash of two philosophies, I would even say two cultures."
"In brief, I would say that the liberal concept came up against the integrationist concept and the positions taken by both sides appeared so entrenched that some said it would be impossible to reconcile them."
"It was in May 1995 that the Commission submitted a first proposal for a directive to our Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights."
"It was the fruit, Mr Commissioner, of worthy efforts which attempted to resolve, it has to be said, the squaring of the circle."
"But this exercise in compromise had its limits."
"Some could not accept that an aptitude test should be maintained for joining the Bar of a host country, even in a toned down form, because who says test says potential lock-out, with no recourse to appeal."
"Others could only accept that, after practising for five years in a European Union country, a lawyer who wished to continue to practise under his home-country professional title would be abruptly sent home."
"So the Committee on Legal Affairs set about taking up the challenge."
"Drawing considerable inspiration from the proposal which the Advisory Council of European Barristers managed to achieve through the impetus of its chairman, Maître Weil, whose patience and talent I applaud, we proposed an ambitious approach, based on the mutual confidence already long maintained between European lawyers, in the practice of their profession."
"This approach has led us, on the one hand, to replace the aptitude test by a rigorous verification procedure of the effective and regular activity of the lawyer in question over a period of three base years, added to this the possibility of recourse to the domestic courts in the case of a refusal and, on the other hand, to guarantee, for those who want it, the permanent nature of establishment under their home-country professional title."
"The scope of this text must be clearly specified."
"It is in no way a question of undermining the national regulations which, in each of our countries, govern access to the profession, nor the procedures for individual or group practice."
"Subsidiarity rightly imposes on us respect for these rules."
"It is simply a matter of facilitating the movements of lawyers within the community and of enabling them to practise their profession in a Member State other than their own, either individually or collectively."
"Furthermore it is a shame that this second aspect of group practice, which is extremely promising for the future, has been somewhat overshadowed by the liveliness of the debate on individual practice."
"It has not been easy for your rapporteur, or for the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs, and I would like to say to my colleagues how much their 100 % commitment to this difficult but fascinating affair, their openness, driven on by the search for a fair balance and the wish for a successful conclusion, have been a strong encouragement to me."
"I would today like to thank the Commission and the Council, who have agreed to concur with our new approach and this seems to me, Mr Commissioner, an exemplary model of the fruitful cooperation between our institutions."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs has attentively studied the Council's proposal for a common position, dated 24 July last."
"We are happy to note that most of the amendments voted for at the first reading have been taken up, the few differences observed having the sole objective of making certain points in the text more clear and precise."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we propose that this House approves the common position as it is presented, so that its rapid conclusion may enable the legal profession to move further towards its opening up within Europe, for which it has hoped and prayed for so long."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, in June of last year, at the time of the first reading, I congratulated Mrs Fontaine, as I do this evening, for her work and I urged the Council, without too much hope, to crystallize this work as soon as possible, for I was convinced, as were my colleagues, that if we did not seize this chance, we would run the risk of finding it extremely difficult to recommence once more the work of concluding an acceptable result for our ""lawyers' directive."
"And this is what has happened today."
"The Council has been able to seize this opportunity."
"It has been able to take up the delicate balance proposed by Parliament, with certain acceptable nuances and with some useful clarifications."
"Our rapporteur proposes we accept the common position without amendment, supported in this by the Committee on Legal Affairs and tomorrow, I am sure, by the House."
"I congratulate them and I am very pleased."
"We must also now look further, Mr Commissioner, and ensure the faithful implementation of the future directive."
"I therefore turn to you, Mr Monti, in order to express a certain concern of the professional sector and to ask you for some assurances."
"I remember the terms of the exchange, if I may repeat them: freedom of permanent establishment, under one's home-country professional title on the one hand, and acceptance at the Bar of the host country without an aptitude test on the other."
"The hope is that freedom of establishment will enable the development of the profession of lawyer at a European level; the fear is that hindrances will remain through a too rigorous implementation of the demands of the directive, in particular the verification of effective and regular activity by the appropriate authority."
"The anticipated interview must not become an examination, a filter, a barrier imposed once more."
"Furthermore, Commissioner Monti, I ask you to vigilantly ensure, on behalf of the Commission, the faithful implementation of the directive in this regard and to assure us that you will not hesitate to note failures in the implementation and to punish them, if necessary, for we also have to convince lawyers, often young, that this directive is an opportunity for them and that it is an opportunity for Europe."
"I believe it; it is still necessary for it to become a reality, and that depends largely on you, Mr Commissioner."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen. Freedom of settlement has long been enshrined by European treaty."
"There are certain occupational groups, however, which have until now been excluded from this right due to specific de facto circumstances."
"European lawyers constitute one such group."
"The reason for this must surely lie in the fact that legal training differs considerably from one Member State to the next and that differences have always existed between our various national laws and legal arrangements."
"However, and this is a matter which I am keen to raise here, academic studies undertaken in the area of commercial law have indicated that almost 60 % of the laws which are in force in the various Member States have their origins in European legislation."
"In this respect the harmonization of legislation within the internal market is now so well advanced that the fundamental differences which many legal experts say still exist are in reality no longer there."
"In some cases it is simply the paragraph numbers and legislative machinery which differ, while considerable convergence has already been achieved in respect of the content of European regulations."
"On this basis it makes absolute sense to apply the principle of freedom of settlement to European lawyers and ultimately to introduce this basic European right for the benefit of this particular professional group."
"At this point may I congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Fontaine, on the successful outcome of her efforts."
"It is mainly down to her that compromise has been achieved."
"This matter has been the subject of great contention between the different national interests."
"I still recall the arguments which took place in my homeland where early on the relevant technical committees in the German Bundestag refused point blank to approve the directive."
"The compromise solution which has now been adopted is so well thought out that with one exception, namely the small country of Luxembourg, all Member States have agreed to it."
"The professional groups concerned, which are represented by the CCBE - the European lawyers' association -, are satisfied with this arrangement and support it unreservedly."
"For me this is an excellent example of how Parliament, through its own initiative, has been able to take steps to achieve a compromise and to actually get the Council to accept its proposals."
"I believe that we can regard this as a major success for this House vis-à-vis the Council and its role as a legislator. It is an achievement which should not be underestimated."
"The new agreement will make it possible for those of my profession - for I too am a lawyer - to make full use of their rights and opportunities within the European internal market, under certain conditions of course."
"But it will also benefit other professions and sectors in which legislative assimilation has become necessary."
"I therefore leave this House tonight feeling extremely satisfied because I believe that we have achieved real progress towards European integration and the creation of the internal market - albeit only in a small sector."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, Parliament is once again examining the draft Directive on the lawyers' right of establishment, which is of extreme importance not only to European lawyers but also to all European citizens, as potential users of the legal service."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights recently pronounced judgment unanimously in favour of the adoption without amendments of Council's common position that accepted most of the amendments proposed by Parliament and caught the spirit of them."
"On behalf of the Group Union for Europe, I hope that the part-session House will take up that position this week."
"The work of the rapporteur, Mrs Fontaine, has in fact been persistent and useful and has enabled intelligent compromises to be reached between positions that often seemed irreconcilable."
"If this House approves the motion as it left the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights and in accordance with the requests of the Council of European Forensic Associations, European lawyers will be given two considerable opportunities: that of setting up, for an unspecified period, in a state other than their own, keeping their original name and providing advice on all European rights except for that of the state of establishment, and that of being equivalent for all purposes to their colleagues in the state of establishment, following the favourable appraisal of their legal competence made by the competent authorities of the host country."
"This directive takes an important step forward on the path to the actual achievement of the internal market, with regard to a highly important professional sector."
"I am grateful to Mrs Fontaine, both as a lawyer and as an MEP."
"I would like to recall here that this year sees the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the first directive on the freedom of European lawyers to provide services, subsequently completed with few results in 1989."
"The approval and actual implementation of the new directive, for which I too call warmly upon Mr Monti, will be the most useful way of celebrating this anniversary."
"Madam President, I could repeat my arguments from the first reading, but I have to say that my group, for the moment, concedes defeat."
"Nevertheless, we have presented some amendments to our rapporteur's compromise, for which we congratulate her."
"I ask with insistence, Mr Commissioner and Madam Rapporteur, why, for a profession that is exactly the same as many others, for example, the medical profession, we need either a work placement or an examination?"
"It is effectively because, in our Member States, professional groups want to protect themselves and have wanted to do so since the very beginning, when we demanded the freedom of establishment for lawyers as for any other group of professionals."
"Now we are accepting a compromise, a rather dull one I would say, which certainly offers some possibilities, but possibilities only for a professional group which has done so much to promote the idea of Europe in the Court of Justice and in the national courts of law."
"Now they are protecting themselves just like all the others, with quite weighty requests and demands."
"But whilst sharing the pleasure of finally finding, once again, a certain leeway in the freedom of establishment, I still wonder why a lawyer would register at the Bar of another Member State whose law he does not know."
"It is because he believes he has a future in this other country and that he has the knowledge to enable him to do so."
"The fact that we now admit that the national Bar must itself impose conditions is also a form of defeat."
"I am not particularly proud of this or happy about it."
"But I congratulate Mrs Fontaine on having found a compromise."
"Madam President, this process, which I believe is coming to an end with this evening's debate and tomorrow's vote, has indeed lasted many years."
"The possibility of practising the profession of lawyer in a Member State other than that in which the professional qualification was obtained is indeed provided for by this draft directive, which is finally taking shape through the recommendation for second reading."
"Twenty four of the twenty eight amendments that the European Parliament submitted during the first reading are already included in the common position of the Council of Ministers, since they had previously been accepted by the European Commission."
"It is this Parliament that not only sketched out the more general direction but also determined the more specific solutions to most of the problems."
"It would have been difficult to achieve this without the persistence, the steadfastness, and the ability of Mrs Nicole Fontaine to reconcile those things which initially appeared impossible to reconcile."
"I think that my colleagues on the Committee on Legal Affairs helped her to overcome opposition and, working closely with Bar Councils in most of the Member States, to arrive at today's report, which satisfies most people."
"But the work is mainly her own and she is worthy of our heartiest congratulations."
"This special directive was demanded by the profession, which had never been satisfied with the general system of Directive 89/48/EC."
"The solution that is presented today is linked to three significant innovations: the permanent nature of establishment with the original professional qualification; making it easier to obtain this qualification; the practice of the profession in the welcoming Member State and the regulations concerning the collective practice of the profession."
"However, more than all this, it ensures the dignity with which lawyers who establish themselves in another Member State deserve to be treated. Citizens of medium-sized and smaller States, such as the country I have the honour of representing here in this Chamber, or even of the larger States, such as Germany, France and Great Britain, may, in this way, look to equality of treatment in other countries."
"In this way the freedom of movement of persons and the freedom to establish oneself acquires much greater substance, and the European Union gains one more reason to justify its existence."
"This is no small step, Madam President."
"We are, of course, conscious of the fact that this directive will not automatically solve all the problems created by certain companies of lawyers."
"Nor do we ignore the fact that the moment we arrive at a European solution which is more generally accepted, the problem assumes an even greater dimension through the globalization of the economy and the guidelines of the World Trade Organization which ensure the freedom of related professionals, chartered accountants and chartered surveyors, to establish themselves in almost all countries."
"However, these facts do not undermine the importance of the achievement of Mrs Fontaine, and they show the way for us to address other similar problems."
"Parliament, the Council and the Commission have done their duty."
"Tomorrow it is the turn of the Member States."
"It is now their duty, with the assistance of Bar Councils and the ever watchful surveillance of the Commission, to fully implement and exploit this forward-looking directive, which will provide opportunities and freedom."
"Madam President, at this late hour and in this almost intimate atmosphere - almost like a chat between friends - allow me to begin by recounting an anecdote. When I first came to this Parliament in 1994, the only piece of internal Community legislation with which I was familiar was a single directive."
"Specifically, it was this directive about the free practice of the profession of lawyer. I was familiar with the discussions which had taken place in legal circles in Lisbon and Bremen, and I knew the directive had poor prospects."
"Then I remember, in the spring of 1995 we finally received the text of the Commission's proposal, and when discussions on it started in the Committee on Legal Affairs, in October or November of that same year, I said to my colleagues in the General Council for European Lawyers, ""I think it is going to happen; it will be approved within two years' ."
"And they smiled at me, as if to say, ""Honestly, her Euro-enthusiasm knows no bounds' ."
"Nevertheless, Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Fontaine, that is what we have achieved, thanks to the particular work of those people I have mentioned - especially you and your team, Commissioner. I see that Mr de Visee is looking at me with that calm manner of his, which has been so important on many occasions."
"And the rapporteur has mentioned Mr Hans Weil, to whom we all owe a great deal."
"Mr Weil is the epitome of a truly European lawyer: a German by birth, living in France, and practising law of a standard and worthiness that is a source of pride to us all."
"So, we have managed it, and today's result is doubly valuable for me: we have demonstrated what the codecision process can achieve; there has been the highest degree of cooperation between the institutions; the Commission had the courage to issue a proposal at a time when everybody thought it was bound to fail; this House shouldered its responsibilities and, often confronting its groups in the Member States, ensured that reason prevailed over people's fears."
"For I do not subscribe to the opinion, Mrs Fontaine, that this matter should be seen as a confrontation between a liberal view and a protectionist view."
"We have faced up to the fears of the various Member States, manifested in different ways - in one way in Spain, another in France, and yet another in Germany."
"Madam President, there is not going to be a flood of immigrants from one country to another. That is not where the political value of this directive lies."
"The political value of this directive is of a symbolic nature."
"This matter lies at the very heart of the building of Europe."
"The labelling of toys is very important, common agricultural policy subsidies are very important, but even more important is the ability of lawyers - the people who manipulate that instrument which in the final analysis is the grand instrument of integration - should feel involved, should feel European. Recalling once again the words of the Spanish king, Alfonso the Wise: they become the true spokespeople of that European Law which we are all building."
"Madam President, the Commission is pleased that the European Parliament has accepted Council's common position and the results of voting on that wording within the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights which approved it without adopting amendments."
"I too wish to congratulate Mrs Fontaine in particular, who managed to draw up a text constituting an acceptable compromise for the Commission and for Council, as well as for almost all associations of lawyers."
"Her task has not been an easy one as the need for the motion had initially been strongly opposed."
"I wish to pay homage to Mrs Fontaine, to the great determination and balance we have been able to admire in her once again."
"The directive is important, not only to the lawyers who are playing a decisive role in implementing Community law and affirming this lawful Community, but also to their clients, such as the companies operating in the single market and individual citizens."
"This also represents progress with regard to recognition based on reciprocal trust between Member States, as indicated in the report on the freedom of movement of persons drawn up by the senior group chaired by Mr Veil; the directive we are dealing with this evening is, in fact, the first to authorize establishment for professional purposes, without checking qualifications and experience."
"I think that this has been an exemplary case of cooperation between the institutions. And as an extension to this cooperation, Mr Cot and Mr Florio, as a way of ensuring that the legislator's wish is actually implemented, I undertake, on behalf of the Commission, to do what you have asked."
"I believe that the application of the rules of the single market, the enforcement, is just as important as the legislative production of the rules themselves."
"I should mention here the Commission's commitment to your request."
"The Commission will pay careful attention to the correct implementation of the directive; for this purpose, my services have already met the national delegations asking for explanations in this connection and are available for further meetings."
"The Commission will take any complaints made by lawyers into account."
"I too congratulate this Parliament, the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights and you, Mrs Fontaine."
"Madam President, I asked the chairman a clear question and he has not deigned to reply to it."
"What I mean is that I truly wonder why someone who is a lawyer would change countries without having a deep knowledge of the legal system of the country in which he is going to practise."
"The Commissioner continues to support the demands of lawyers who ask for either an examination or a work placement, yet cannot answer me."
"It is perhaps his right to say he has no answer, but he cannot be allowed to ignore justifiable parliamentary questions, that is not done!"
"I am happy to try and answer, Mr Wijsenbeek."
"As you will certainly know, in the case of doctors, training is coordinated, which is not the case with lawyers."
"The problem therefore arises in a different way."
"In the case of lawyers, we were faced with an initial situation that needed a directive which today is luckily nearing final adoption."
"Thank you, Mr Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Gender issues in development cooperation"
"The next item is the report (A4-0318/97) by Mrs Junker, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a Council Regulation on integrating gender issues in development cooperation (COM(97)0265 - C4-024/97-97/0151(SYN))."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, one of the consequences of the Fourth World Conference on Women, which was held in Beijing in 1995, was the submission by the European Commission of a proposal for a regulation on the integration of gender issues in development cooperation."
"This is meritorious, but it is also inadequate."
"In order to develop the concept of mainstreaming to include development cooperation, we need more than a regulation which is restricted to sensitisation measures and has only been allocated a modest budget."
"Of course it is good to see something being done to promote targeted projects with a high multiplier effect."
"But we can only talk of a successful concept when it is immediately succeeded by measures which correct the current deficit in practical development cooperation in favour of women."
"In practical terms this means defining salient points on the basis of which the living standards of women in the poorest countries can be improved by integrating gender issues in development cooperation."
"By and large there has been a distinct improvement in the lot of women in recent years, even in the developing countries, though it has to be said that this has varied enormously from one region to another."
"However, the gap between men and women has scarcely narrowed."
"There is still much room for improvement, especially as regards the participation of women in politics in general and their involvement at governmental level in particular."
"In the developing countries equality for women is also about the redistribution of labour, wealth and power."
"The worldwide processes of transformation, which have also thrown the developing countries into turmoil, and the increasing globalization have together given rise to two trends which European development cooperation fails to take fully into account - namely, the feminization of the workplace, on one hand, and the feminization of poverty, on the other."
"Feminization of the workplace is the result of growing adaptability in the labour market and the transfer of jobs to the developing countries, where they are being increasingly taken up by women."
"This often means exploitation under the most deplorable conditions, but it also means new opportunities for women."
"Their productive capacity is an increasingly important factor for economic growth and must be considered as such."
"The feminization of poverty stems from the fact that women who find themselves in materially difficult situations are responsible to a significant extent for the survival of the family and are also dependent on income from their male partner, or must often do without this altogether."
"The figures bear this out."
"In 1970 there were only 37 gainfully-active women for every 100 working men."
"By 1990 this figure had risen to 62 per 100."
"In the developing countries there is a demand for cheap, adaptable, unqualified and non-Unionized labour."
"In most cases this means women."
"However, as living standards increase, witness Hong Kong and Korea, women again become threatened by unemployment, particularly when there is a demand for technical and educational qualifications, which are often denied to women."
"Sustained development as far as the female population is concerned also means that women must be imbued with skills and knowledge which are geared to the future and which create permanent employment opportunities."
"The worldwide extension of the services sector creates job opportunities for women, though these are often socially unsecure. We should therefore oppose this trend."
"How far women in developing countries still have to go to achieve equality of opportunity can be dramatically illustrated by taking as an example the food production and supply sector."
"In the developing countries women produce more than 55 % of the cultivated food, and in Africa this rises to over 70 %, yet only 5 % of the advisory services provided to farming through international development aid goes to women."
"Only 13 % of the agricultural consultants in development countries are women. In Latin America the figure is 8 %, in Africa 7 % and in the Middle East a mere 1 %."
"Negative statistics of this kind can be reeled off ad infinitum."
"These figures must be borne in mind if we are to put a stop to this unfortunate trend, instead of just bemoaning the situation."
"The international women's movements have put the spotlight on women's lives and have contributed much to the development of a global civilized society."
"Empowerment is the watchword here. This means the participation of women in political, economic and social activities so that structural changes can be made to the economy and to society in general."
"The present regulation, which to my mind still requires a number of improvements - and which I am asking you to support -, is a step, albeit modest, in the right direction."
"I hope that it will lead to a general programme for promoting the political development of women, and one which is really capable of making progress."
"This does not mean spending vast sums of money, in fact it would constitute a major achievement if the needs and objectives of women could only become a yardstick for all development-policy measures."
"Real democracy cannot exist where women are denied legal, economic and socio-political equality, and this applies just as much to the developing countries."
"Madam President, Mrs Junker says in her report that men must take greater responsibility for social and reproductive behaviour if we are to truly promote the aim of equality for women in developing countries and therefore it is right that the male Members of the European Parliament take part in this debate and support her excellent report to protest against the denial of adequate reproductive health facilities to women across the world."
"One-third of illnesses amongst women aged 15 to 44 in developing countries are caused by sexually transmitted diseases, back-street abortions or pregnancy."
"Around 350 million women are still denied access to safe family planning."
"We should protest against the impact of poverty which is felt disproportionately by women."
"Seventy percent of the world's 1.3 billion poor are women and lone women heading households are increasing dramatically across the world."
"We should protest against all forms of discrimination against women, which at its most extreme is represented by sexual violence and the female infanticide practised in India and China, which has not only perverted the gender ratio but has created a social atmosphere in which girls are seen as a curse."
"Two years after the Council regulation was passed I do not think there is mainstreaming of gender issues in Europe's development policies."
"If so, Commissioner, why was gender analysis so abysmally omitted from the Lomé Green Paper?"
"Let us do better in the future."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, women are not being asked, but they are the answer."
"Non-governmental organizations and executive bodies have known this for a long time and act accordingly, when they are allowed to."
"An effective development policy cannot be implemented without the participation of women."
"They are the driving force not only for their families, but also for any future development in this area."
"One must in principle welcome the fact that the Commission has recognized this in its regulation and has drawn up a certain code of behaviour for practical policy implementation."
"At this late - or indeed early hour, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Junker, whose appraisal of the present regulation has clearly set out the objectives and requirements of development cooperation from a woman's viewpoint."
"Our group approves the report."
"Naturally, we hope that as many as possible of its noble objectives will become a reality."
"This will depend on the political will generated at all levels and also on cooperation from reliable partners in Europe and in the recipient countries."
"It is the women of the world, particularly in the poorest countries, who bear the burden of life and who have to endure the stresses and strains of their circumstances."
"Giving them aid in the form of self-help implies more than simply assisting individual women and their families."
"The promotion and participation of women in the economic, political and social process means giving the developing countries a chance for the future."
"We must therefore give all due attention to this report and this Council Regulation and wish them every success."
"Allow me finally to say something about the general scope of this debate."
"In fact it is not really a debate at all, but rather something undeserving of the few speakers and reporters who have to be present, and I wish at this point to express particular thanks to the interpreters and other ministering angels who have endured with us to the bitter end."
"No-one is listening to us here, apart from the minute-takers and the tape-recorders."
"It is unworthy, especially since the important subject under discussion is one which requires our full attention if we are to find a solution, or even to begin the search for one."
"I propose that we put an end to debates of this nature."
"After 10 p.m. we could, for example, state that we are giving the written text of our speeches to the secretariat."
"Who is listening to us anyway?"
"Certainly not the world, certainly not Europe, not even our fellow MEPs."
"There is no-one here but ourselves."
"We all know what our opinions are."
"Such debates do no justice to us, let alone to the subject matter."
"Madame President, the Commission's proposal to integrate the gender aspect as an important factor in development cooperation has the right aim."
"As far as the implementation is concerned, not much has been done so far."
"Karin Juncker talks about equal rights, but with the gender role pattern in the developing countries, what we need is rather positive discrimination in favour of women."
"In other words, the aid must be tailored directly to women to do the most benefit."
"We must support women directly through allocating ground, loans, better equipment and technology."
"Women must be brought in at all stages of development work and in all policies."
"The Commission's general mainstream approach could be part of this strategy, if the principle is otherwise put into practice and does not remain empty words."
"When it comes to evaluating development aid, gender-based statistics should also be used all round."
"Without such statistics, there is no way of measuring the effects on men and women respectively."
"The EU does not appear to be serious on gender policy."
"We saw this in the Green Paper on Lomé and in the lack of priority of staff in the field, which must be increased from its present three and appointed at high level to give them some effectiveness."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, let me first express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for her presentation, which I hope has helped us make some headway."
"In the last part-session we discussed reports dealing with the depiction of women in advertising and with violence against women, and I thought to myself that many women in developing countries would be only too glad to have our problems, rather that the burden which they have to bear."
"They still have a very long road to travel."
"When we call for women to have their fair share of power, income and so on, we are setting objectives which are still a very long way off indeed."
"I would like the Commission to tell us if it is planning short-term measures to promote these objectives, such as moves to improve women's earnings and projects aimed at easing the daily toil of women who are responsible for supporting their families and who are certainly in no position to change their traditional circumstances overnight."
"The report again raises the issue of a special committee."
"I now ask the Commission to ensure that this committee continues to examine the matters referred to by Mrs Junker and that it does this in close collaboration with the Parliamentary Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"I hardly dare express the hope that our amendment, which proposes the participation of Parliament in this committee, will become a reality."
"I therefore ask that we cooperate as closely as possible with it so that we can improve the situation and take another step towards the complete achievement of our goals."
"What interests me above all, however, are the methods which the Commission is intending to adopt in order really to include those who are suffering hardship in this respect, without using the standards of our society as a yardstick for what we believe to be good for women in developing countries."
"Madam President. Two years have elapsed since the World Conference on Women in Beijing and a lot has happened - but it is still not enough."
"I also see that the Commission's proposal and the proposed regulation are a step in the right direction, namely mainstreaming, and that they focus on gender issues in development cooperation."
"However, while we have made a number of starts, we have seen very few practical proposals."
"The Commission's administrative services are understaffed."
"There is no real support for those nongovernmental organizations in the developing countries which are providing direct aid to women."
"Traditions have become ingrained and the regulation contains little about combatting violence."
"We have scarcely touched on trafficking in women - a new phenomenon in our society and one which has assumed alarming proportions."
"I must reiterate that if we are to achieve sustained development here, we will have to include women much more in the drafting, planning, implementation and evaluation of the projects in question."
"If we are to take the findings of the World Conference on Women seriously, then we need to come up with some real results."
"Let me conclude by emphasizing that women are the vital ingredient for future development."
"We have already brought this out in the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights."
"Women are the key to sustained development because with them you always have the next generation on board, so to speak."
"All current findings, such as the experience with micro-credits, indicate that women must be regarded as the key to future development."
"Madam President, the Commission welcomes the draft report by Parliament and expresses its appreciation of the support given by Parliament to the creation of this budget line in 1990 and to policy developments since the Beijing Conference in 1995."
"The Commission's position on the 18 amendments submitted for consideration and voting is as follows."
"We can accept fully seven Amendments: Nos 1, 2, 4 (as concerns articles 1(2)), 5, 7, 8 and 11."
"The Commission much appreciated in particular Parliament's support for the regulation's overall approach."
"This seeks to prioritize strategic sensitization functions, which can improve the overall quality of the Community's whole development/cooperation concerning gender issues and focusing particularly on the major development budget lines rather than financing small-scale initiatives for women in isolation, which will not have an impact on the scale required."
"We can also partially embrace Amendment Nos 3 and 9."
"In both these cases there seems to be substantial policy agreement with the objective of the amendment but we would suggest rewording in order to clarify the text."
"We are unable to accept the following amendments: Nos 4 (as concerns article 1(1)) and 12 to 18 inclusive."
"The Commission's detailed comments on the amendments which we cannot accept or where a rewording is suggested are as follows."
"In Amendment No 3 to recital 17, the amendment's wording needs revision to retain clear criteria for the budget line."
"We would suggest deletion of the word 'small-scale' from the amended text, and that the last phrase should read as follows: ' European Union funds for operational development projects should be used more for interventions which integrate gender issues or specifically target inequalities between women and men' ."
"In Amendment No 4 to article 1(1), consistency with existing policy and the outcome of the Beijing Conference necessitate retaining the references to mainstreaming and to intervention, as well as policies."
"In Amendment No 6, we wish to retain the reference to the need for action against gender disparities 'on an appropriate scale' ."
"The extent of gender gaps in fundamental areas such as literacy, access to health care and nutrition is clear from the Beijing Conference, which also emphasized the need for large-scale action."
"This does not necessarily imply additional funding but rather a reallocation of existing funds."
"In Amendment No 9, we welcome the amendment's proposed intention but find the extension of scope too ambitious for the human or financial resources available so far."
"We could accept a reference to decision-makers, and I suggest 'within the Commission and in developing countries' as an alternative."
"In Amendment No 10, the regulation is concerned with development cooperation and cannot easily address issues of trade - at least of international trade."
"In Amendment No 12, we prefer to retain the flexibility of the references to services."
"This is a standard text approved in many other recent regulations."
"Restriction of cover for operating costs would cause problems for some projects covered by these budgets, particularly support for institution building which often requires some support for these items throughout the project before reaching viability."
"The proposal for a new subarticle referring to the budgetary authority's powers seems to us premature."
"This question should be considered at a second reading as it is normally addressed only in response to specific Council proposals for indicative budget figures."
"In Amendment Nos 13 and 14, we prefer for reasons of consistency and legal clarity to retain the framework established in a series of recent regulations of this type."
"In Amendment No 15, we support Parliament's desire to reduce costs to the EC budget but think that the Member States might reasonably wish to retain an option of additional representation for important or specialized projects."
"We find the additional reporting requirement unnecessary as full annual reporting to Parliament is already provided for in article 9(1)."
"The proposal for the committee to coordinate bilateral and Community cooperation, is too ambitious and exceeds the competence of the committee."
"Concerning the declarations of interest, the Commission does not think that inserting references in legislation is the most effective or appropriate approach."
"Generally concerning comitology, and particularly in Amendment Nos 12, 15 and 18, we favour retention of agreed comitology for reasons of consistency, practicality and clarity."
"Changes of minor detail to their organization and competence in every regulation are impracticable, particularly as these committees in practice deal with projects under numerous different regulations at each sitting."
"In Amendment Nos 16 and 17, we appreciate Parliament's intention but these are internal administrative questions which cannot be appropriately addressed in legislation."
"Let me add that the Commission's proposals, made just a week ago to Council and also to Parliament, for the political framework for the future Lomé Convention, identify quite clearly the strategic approach in the future Lomé Convention."
"I am very pleased to say that if something is underlined as a top priority, it is the mainstreaming on gender issues and, not only that, of taking it into account in the strategic approach for development that the Union should adopt according to the proposals of the Commission."
"Finally, this is just a simple regulation but I think this topic merits a major debate."
"I fully agree with the honourable parliamentarian who regretted so few Members were here, because this is important and deserves the full attention of this House."
"Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 0.25 a.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"Very briefly, Mr Killilea raised a point of order yesterday, which in my opinion is indeed a point of order, and I would kindly request that the Bureau take note of his complaint, which says that the standing of this Parliament is damaged by some colleagues, and to respond to that."
"Under Rule 108 I should actually have three minutes to reply, if my name is mentioned, and in that connection I would just like to read out a letter from the State Prosecutor of Belgium: 'In reply to your letter of 10 July 1997..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Madam President, yesterday the Dutch member of the Court of Auditors, Mr Engwirda, gave a press conference in the Netherlands about the Court of Auditors' report."
"Dutch radio, it was conveyed to me indirectly, reported that Mr Engwirda was alleged to have said that 70 % of members of the European Parliament misuse the travel expense arrangements; 70 % of the members of the European Parliament are alleged to misuse travel expenses."
"The report of the Court of Auditors states that 69 % of the members of the Committee on Social and Economic Affairs are alleged to have committed irregularities with travel expenses, not the European Parliament."
"One or the other; either Mr Engwirda has expressed himself incorrectly, or he was quoted incorrectly by Dutch radio."
"In any case, the damage in the Netherlands is yet again vast."
"I would therefore like to ask, Madam President, whether the President of the European the Parliament could contact Mr Friedmann of the Court of Auditors to obtain clarification about what Mr Engwirda said, and issue a statement in which it is made clear that the Court of Auditors did not make a pronouncement about this House."
"That was my first question."
"The second question."
"Perhaps the President can tell us why members of the Court of Auditors give out press statements in our Member States when the debate has not even begun in the European Parliament."
"Madam President, I cannot say I find that very elegant."
"Thirdly, Madam President, I think that we all know that the Court of Auditors is also investigating the travel expenses of this House."
"I would therefore urge again, that the Bureau carries out the decisions taken by the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents in July, according to which the travel expense arrangements of this House need to be reformed."
"The principal decisions have been taken."
"Now they must be implemented."
"It is, I think, in the interest of this House that these decisions are implemented before 1 January."
"Thank you, Mr De Vries."
"I can assure you that the President will do everything necessary to throw light on these matters, as you ask."
"Madam President, after the excellent remarks by Mr De Vries I can be very brief, because I had wanted to speak on exactly the same point."
"I totally agree with Mr De Vries, and I ask the Bureau of Parliament to make a statement about this issue which is increasingly damaging this Parliament as soon as possible."
"Madam President, I believe you interrupted Ms McKenna when she was speaking."
"She was properly quoting a rule which allows her to speak as her name has been mentioned."
"Why did you then interrupt her and allow Mr de Vries to speak?"
"I am not complaining about Mr de Vries speaking, but I think you very rudely interrupted Ms McKenna."
"Mr Smith, I shall most willingly give the floor to Ms McKenna, in application of Rule 108."
"I thought it was preferable that she should be informed of the letter of the President in order to prepare her defence."
"But if Ms McKenna wishes to present her excuses publicly, I shall give her the floor most willingly."
"Madam President, thank you for your support on my right under Rule 108."
"I was quite surprised that I was going to be censored like this."
"I am not going to apologize, I want to put on record..."
"I have a right to defend myself under Rule 108 and you are wasting my time by interrupting me."
"The problem is, firstly, that I still stand by the allegations I have made as regards the fact that you cannot justify the expenditure on the new building and it has to be investigated."
"What I said in the newspaper was that, unless these investigations were carried out, the public were going to assume that there was corruption going on, and we have a duty in this House to get things investigated."
"In that regard, I just want to read out a letter from the State Prosecutor in Belgium: ' In reply to your letter of 10 June 1997, 020211, I hereby inform you that a criminal investigation is under way into matters, including the possible misappropriation of funds belonging to Belgian public works contractors which took part in the construction of the European Parliament's property complex in Brussels D1, D2 and D3 buildings."
"The investigation is focusing in part on the possible payments of secret commissions to intermediaries with a view to securing contracts."
"It may therefore call into question the actions of individuals, officials and politicians, some of whom enjoy immunity."
"However, at this stage in the procedure, no such persons are involved."
"Should incriminating evidence emerge, it goes without saying that the relevant procedures would be implemented."
"I hope I have allayed your concerns."
"(Closing formula and signature)' ."
"I think that it is the duty of this House to realize that what is going on here is that the public perception of this House has to be taken into account, that we have to support any investigation, and even Members of this House have called for an independent investigation on what is going on."
"The cost of the new building is unjustifiable."
"We are going to be using that new building and therefore we have a duty to have these questions answered."
"I cannot be totally responsible for the way tabloid newspapers report things but I am still saying that I stand by what I said."
"I also contacted the journalist involved yesterday and I told him that there were inaccuracies and I followed it up with a letter of which you can have a copy."
"But you are doing yourselves and this House a disservice by shooting the messenger, which is what you are doing here."
"(Applause from the Green Group and non-attached Members)"
"Ms McKenna, I would really like to appeal to your conscience."
"Do you have any consciousness of the gravity of repeating such words which cast suspicion on all the officials of the European Parliament?"
"This is extremely serious."
"People say either too much, or not enough."
"Let the legal proceedings run their course."
"If there really are people involved, they must be cited, but here, you are making unsubstantiated accusations, and you are passing on the content of this letter to the newspapers."
"This will throw discredit upon the institution. It is very unjust."
"I do not think we can get into a debate on this point."
"We are at the heart of something very serious taking place in this Parliament. I really wanted to say that."
"(Interruption from Mr Cohn-Bendit) No, Mr Cohn-Bendit, we cannot extend..."
"(Mixed react ions) But I am not attacking him!"
"Ms McKenna will receive the letter from the President. She will decided what response she needs to make to the President, and then we will see."
"I do not think we can prolong this debate."
"Madam President, I would like to thank you and the Bureau for the swift action that you have taken in relation to this matter in inviting Patricia McKenna, as a Member of this House, to produce the evidence to substantiate the case that she alleged yesterday in an Irish newspaper."
"You will know, as a Member of the Bureau, Madam President, that I wrote to you and to all of the Members of the Bureau yesterday, and in that letter I cited some direct quotations from the Member in question."
"She adds today a preface which says that if these matters were not investigated then the public might feel certain things."
"Regrettably that proviso did not appear in any part of yesterday's article, nor in quotations."
"Indeed if she was misrepresented or misreported in the newspapers I would suggest that, on the issue of substance on which she was actually quoted, she should withdraw or substantiate."
"Can I quote for the House, because many will not know what the direct quotes said."
"They said in relation to the buildings in Brussels: ""There are people in Brussels getting massive backhanders' ."
"Second quote: ""There is serious racketeering going on here' ."
"These are extremely serious criminal offences and in making these observations either one produces the evidence or one has the decency to withdraw."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit, you should not be contemptuous of a colleague!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you have heard, and I note it myself with satisfaction, Mr Cohn-Bendit has just corrected the words that were attributed to Ms McKenna in the press."
"I now believe that Ms McKenna needs do no more than correct her words in similar manner, in response to a request from the President, and then we will see more clearly into the whole business. It has escaped nobody that there is a world of difference between what has Mr Cohn-Bendit has just said and what we all read in the press."
"We will now move on to adoption of the Minutes."
"Are there any comments?"
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Madam President, I would like to ask if you could request the Commission to give a statement tomorrow on the situation in Iraq in accordance with Rule 37, paragraph 7."
"Why do I ask for this statement?"
"Because we believe that the situation in Iraq could, in fact, change at any moment, and any resolution we submit tomorrow could be superseded within an hour; however, we think it is necessary for us to be well acquainted with the Security Council resolutions, in unabridged version."
"That is why we would like you to ask the European Commission to make a statement tomorrow during the period which is available for urgent matters."
"Thank you, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten."
"That is a request under Rule 37."
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"I want to rise, on behalf of my group, to support that request."
"You may know that there was considerable discussion in the Conference of Presidents about this last week and at the time one of the questions which I and others raised was: what exactly does one say at this point in time on a very complex and sensitive issue?"
"It is appropriate that, if we can get a statement from the Commission, we should have thirty minutes of questions under Rule 37(6) of our Rules of Procedure."
"This will allow us to examine and hear the views on this issue in an atmosphere which does not mean that we are adding to and exacerbating the problems."
"I would endorse the request."
"It is important that we deal with this before urgencies and objections because there are at present only four items on the urgency agenda."
"We could indeed take this as the first item with half an hour set aside for questions specifically on Iraq."
"Madam President, on this matter, I believe that a statement from the Commission would be welcome, but above all, we need a statement from the Council, as the Council has responsibility for the CFSP, not the Commission."
"I do not believe the Council will be present tomorrow. And I regret that."
"Ladies and gentlemen, a proposal has been made, from two political groups. It complies with the rules."
"This half hour of questions to the Commission would fall within the timeslot allocated for urgent matters, and preferably before then."
"The statement would then take place from 3 p.m. to 3: 30 p.m. tomorrow."
"Are there any objections?"
"There being no objections, that decision stands."
"Madam President, please allow me to object to this procedure."
"You know the Rules better than I do."
"The proposal put forward has, it appears, come from two major groups who last week refused to accept a specific point on Iraq being put on the agenda."
"You have taken up the proposal on your own initiative, because you know the Rules."
"Indeed, only the President can make a proposal during the sitting itself."
"However, the first urgent matter before you was raised by our group, with a view to raising the question of Iraq as the first urgent matter of major importance."
"Mr Pasty is quite right."
"Asking the Commission questions does not mean much."
"Let us have a political debate on Iraq, and let us vote, and let everyone declare where their responsibilities lie with regard to this crisis."
"Mr Dell'Alba, in reality, we are all fundamentally in agreement about having a debate on the question, which is indeed a topical subject of major importance."
"I shall put my proposal to the vote."
"(Parliament approved the President's proposal)"
"Topical and urgent debate"
"Pursuant to Rule 47, I have received objections in writing giving reasons for the objections to the agenda for tomorrow morning's debate on topical and urgent subjects of special importance."
"Mr Dell'Alba and Mr De Vries, the objection that you raised to putting the subject of Iraq on the agenda as an urgent matter is now void, given the decision we have just taken ."
"Before subject I"
"Madam President, I would like to speak on the subject of Togo."
"In fact, we all know that..."
"Mr Aldo, I cannot let you continue."
"The Rule is, objections regarding topical and urgent subjects are raised but cannot be debated."
"This is not a point of debate, this is a point of order, Madam President."
"A point of order under what Rule, Mr Aldo?"
"Rule 127a, Madam President."
"I request thirty seconds."
"Togo is part of the Joint Assembly of the ACP and European Union, which operates under rules of procedure approved by us."
"However, today, we are asked to take a vote which is in violation of the procedures of the Joint Assembly of the European Union and ACP."
"This is why our group, Madam President, is opposed to any debate or vote on the Togo dossier, which was the subject of a debate and a vote in the Joint Assembly fifteen days ago, and the result of which was a rejection of the dossier."
"As you have presented matters, Mr Aldo, you can be deemed to have remained within Rule 127."
"Treaty of Amsterdam"
"The next item is the report (A4-0347/97) by Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Tsatsos, on behalf of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, on the Treaty of Amsterdam (CONF 4007/97 - C4-0538/97)."
"Madam President, this debate is the final act in a long process which began last June, when Parliament appointed Mr Tsatsos and I co-rapporteurs for the report on the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Seventeen parliamentary committees, the representatives of the national parliaments - with whom we held a meeting last October - non-governmental organizations, and, especially, the Committee on Institutional Affairs have taken part in this process."
"I believe that any assessment of the Amsterdam Treaty must be made from two points of view."
"The first is the political circumstances surrounding the treaty."
"And the political circumstances of last June were not as favourable as they could have been."
"The Members will recall that various elections were taking place, and that - especially - the Member States' attention was concentrated on maintaining the timetable for the introduction of the euro."
"That was a good thing, in my view."
"I believe that the euro will provide an extremely important focus for the progress of European integration, but I wish to make clear that the political circumstances for revising the Treaties were not as favourable as they could have been."
"Secondly, the Amsterdam Treaty must be assessed from the point of view of its content."
"And its content cannot be evaluated in relation to the expectations that existed, or even in relation to whatever aspirations Parliament may have had."
"It must be evaluated in relation to what was there before: that is, the Treaty on European Union."
"And, in this regard, from the very beginning, Mr Tsatsos and I wished to send a clear political message: the Amsterdam Treaty represents substantial progress for the process of European integration."
"Firstly, there is progress with regard to what we term the Community pillar."
"These advances are summarized in former article F, in which there are new points on the fundamental rights of European citizens and the affirmation that the Union is a Community based on the rule of law in which the principles of liberty, democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are paramount."
"At the same time, however, it is a Community based on values."
"It is not simply a common market: it is a Community based on values."
"And the proof of this is the introduction of new policies for the environment, consumers, public health and - especially - social protection."
"I recall, Madam President, that when I entered Parliament I was surprised that there were no Community measures to combat employment. A good friend and eminent Member of this Parliament explained to me that Europe was an Economic Community, and that there would never be Community social policies or measures to combat employment."
"Well, five years is nothing in politics."
"Now there are Community measures to combat employment."
"It is true - as is frequently mentioned in this House - that they are inadequate."
"That is true."
"But the important thing is that the seed, the possibility, exists."
"Those who say that the available funds are insufficient are right."
"But there is the possibility of increasing those funds."
"And experience shows that once a road begins, it widens and more progress is made."
"As far as the common foreign and security policy - the second pillar - is concerned, the Amsterdam Treaty rationalizes the existing legal instruments and creates new bodies of a political nature, such as the strategic planning and early warning unit; and the new role for the Secretary-General of the Council will increase the operational ability of the troika."
"All this is positive, but, in the field of foreign policy, the most important thing is political will."
"There will be no common foreign policy until the Member States' governments feel the need for one."
"And, undoubtedly, until the people of our countries feel the need for one too, the legal instruments which we desire will be worthless."
"There is a need to create that political will."
"Perhaps far less progress was made in the field of security and defence than we would have wished, but we have to make use of what there is."
"The Petersberg Tasks can become the launching pad for a European security and defence identity."
"With regard to the third pillar - justice and home affairs - nothing is so deeply rooted in the sovereignty of the Member States."
"Under the Maastricht Treaty, matters of justice and home affairs are discussed in the framework of intergovernmental cooperation."
"But the Amsterdam Treaty takes a giant leap forward by recognizing that these matters belong under the Community pillar, that they are best dealt with by the Community method, not the intergovernmental method."
"It is true that there are limitations."
"But, instead of lamenting the fact, we must try to restrict those limitations."
"There are means with which to do this, and the annexed declaration along these lines introduced by Germany is, of course, a step in the right direction."
"The Amsterdam Treaty also lays down important rules concerning the subsidiarity principle and the participation of the national parliaments via COSAC - and I wish to pay tribute to Mrs Fontaine, who chairs that conference so effectively."
"Nevertheless, there is a major omission in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"And that omission is institutional reform: the institutional reform that is necessary for the Union to be able to function effectively and democratically with 15 Member States, and is absolutely vital for it to be able to function at all after enlargement."
"And this method is a Community method."
"We are suggesting that the system of intergovernmental conferences has reached the limit of its usefulness, and we are calling for the Community method to be used to solve this problem, whereby the Commission draws up a report with proposals for the essential reform of the Union's institutions, which is then debated by Parliament and forwarded to the national parliaments in accordance with the COSAC protocol."
"At our last COSAC meeting - which took place just a few days ago, in Luxembourg - the responses of the representatives of the national parliaments were extremely positive."
"They are interested in taking the Union forward politically, and I believe that we can depend on them and work together with them."
"And if we - the Commission, the European Parliament and the national parliaments - succeed in drawing up a joint text, that text could be put on the table at the Intergovernmental Conference and serve as the basis for the final agreement to be adopted by the Member States' governments."
"Parliament does not wish to alter the meaning of article N. It does not wish to do anything outside the strict framework of the treaties."
"What it wishes to do is contribute to resolving a problem that is currently outstanding in the European Union."
"And the way for it to do that is for it to move from playing the promotional role that it has played in the past to playing the codecision role envisaged for it in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"In continuation, Madam President, I wish to thank Mr Tsatsos - with whom I greatly enjoyed drawing up this report; and I think that our duo worked extremely well - for his patience with me, as well as thanking the Committee on Institutional Affairs, the secretariat, which did a marvellous job, and all my collaborators."
"I should like to end by referring to the vote this afternoon."
"I do not wish to address those who are going to vote against, because they will always oppose the progress of Europe."
"Rather, I wish to address those who are good Europeans, who have always been in the vanguard of European integration, but who are currently tempted to abstain or vote against because they believe that the Amsterdam Treaty is inadequate."
"I would recall the words spoken by Ortega y Gasset, in a speech that he made in Berlin, with reference to Miguel de Cervantes, who said, when he was old and tired of life, that there are times in a man's life when he has to choose between the inn and the road. Choosing the inn means not moving, standing still."
"Choosing the road means moving forward. The Treaty of Amsterdam is a road."
"Undoubtedly, it is a road which is too short for our ambitions."
"Undoubtedly, it is a road which is too narrow - many of us would have wished that road to be a broad avenue."
"But it is more important to choose the road and move forward than to choose the inn and stand still. I would therefore urge all those who have always wanted to take Europe forward, who have always been in the vanguard of European integration, to reflect on this and join in building that road."
"Madam President, I will limit myself to the structures and logic of the resolution."
"The draft resolution that we are being asked to decide on refers to the past, the present and the future."
"First of all, Mr Méndez de Vigo and I have attempted to assess politically the vital elements of the past."
"In this respect we have stressed the pragmatic and decisive influence that the European Parliament has had on the content of the new treaty."
"This influence, although it cannot rely on its - unfortunately non-existent - consolidation, has been won through the tenacious political activity of the European Parliament, chiefly through its previous resolutions."
"Secondly, the draft resolution makes a political assessment of the historic present."
"The people of Europe must be informed of the reasons why the European Parliament considers the albeit qualified ratification, but the ratification nevertheless, of the treaty, to be a historic duty."
"On this point the report underlines the crucial steps that have contributed to the European issue without, however, suppressing omissions and errors."
"Thirdly, we politically assess the draft resolution with regard to a historic future."
"Our criticism of the treaty is not only by way of a protest but is chiefly constructive in nature. With our eyes firmly fixed on the future, we are demanding that those steps be taken that have not yet been taken and we are proposing a new methodology for the future, as my colleague and friend, Mr Méndez de Vigo, has already mentioned."
"I shall now come to the basic philosophy of the resolution."
"Our first objective was to put before you a consensus view on Europe."
"We believe that Europe is not only a union of peoples but also a union of states."
"Processes of unification must, of course, lead to deeper understanding, which, however, must respect national constitutional governments."
"Only as long as the peoples of Europe are actively reconciled with the idea of a European Union, only as long as the peoples of Europe do not consider the process of integration to be a danger to their national and cultural identity, only then will Europe successfully move forward."
"Anyone who imagines European integration to be outside and beyond the will of the people, is guilty of fundamentally misunderstanding the European question."
"For this reason, we strongly welcome the fact that the treaty transfers a number of chapters from the third to the first pillar (the social package, a large section of the Schengen report, coordination of employment policy) and also the fact that the treaty treads with care in areas where national identity is a particularly sensitive issue."
"In the Amsterdam Treaty the issue of unemployment is of primary importance for the European Parliament."
"Of course, as rapporteurs, we know that what has been agreed does not constitute a political reality just because it has been agreed."
"As my co-rapporteur has stressed, we need the corresponding political will for it to take shape."
"The draft resolution takes a critical stance on institutional reform. Institutional reform has not, in essence, come about."
"For this reason, I move that the European Parliament clearly states that, before each enlargement of the European Union takes place, there has to be corresponding institutional reform."
"Allow me to mention two examples: the transition from the principle of unanimity to the principle of majority voting during the taking of decisions in the Council is necessary chiefly because of the projected enlargement, At the same time, however, this transition is meaningless if we do not maintain some basic exceptions in support of the principle of unanimity in constitutional matters."
"The realigning, or reweighting, of votes in the Council is generally considered to be necessary."
"For this precise reason, a method of implementing this must be studied and debated to ensure that it will not disturb the balance between small and large States, which is the outcome of the fundamental principle of equality among Member States."
"I shall now come to the historical perspective, which my co-rapporteur, Mr Méndez de Vigo, has already given a thorough account of."
"The development of European institutions must cease to be, chiefly and exclusively, a matter of diplomacy and bureaucracy."
"It must form part of the political process."
"The basis of a new revision procedure that we are proposing will be the initiative of the European Parliament, of national governments, and of the European Commission alike."
"This means that the visions of the citizens that we represent will be those that will form the basis and the framework of the decisions of the next conference."
"Only in this way can we entrust the fate of these institutions to their natural channels."
"With our proposal, however, the ability of the national governments to pass legislation will be fully exploited and, at the same time, the cooperation of national parliaments will place the issue of Europe at the centre of national political debate, which is something that we have sought for years, but without success."
"Madam President, my colleague, Mr Méndez de Vigo, and I have aspired to push for a new role for the European Parliament, a role it will share with national parliaments and which will justify its place as the vehicle and the champion of a new democratic idea in Europe."
"Madam President, in presenting my opinion on this Treaty to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, I said that it was like a glass of water: you could describe it either as half empty or as half full."
"In terms of the common foreign and security policy, this treaty does not give us as much as we would want, and certainly not as much as Europe needs."
"I do not believe that we have passed the crucial point at which we will have a coherent ability to influence world affairs."
"I and my committee are suspicious of the decision-making formulas generated in Amsterdam."
"But on the other hand there is some progress on which I believe we can, as a Parliament, build pragmatically and help the Union forward."
"We welcome the establishment of the Analysis and Planning Unit."
"It gives us continuity and it is based in Brussels."
"It may help us to escape intellectually from the 'tripartite ad-hocery' of the existing system."
"Similarly, I welcome the new role for the Secretary-General of the Council, again an individual specifically located and identifiable, and someone with whom we can build an intellectual and an ongoing relationship."
"I echo what Mr Tsatsos has just said about working with national parliaments."
"That is particularly important in the development of a common foreign and security policy because between us - between all the parliaments of Europe - we need to destroy the myth of executive exclusivity that has too long dominated discussions of foreign policy."
"I believe there is much that this Parliament could do, but we will only be able to do it if we build on the quality and the consistency of our own comments on foreign policy."
"I believe we took a good step forward in our decision taken earlier this morning to ask for a Commission statement on Iraq."
"The weakness of the system is shown by our inability to obtain a Council statement on Iraq."
"We can welcome the inclusion of the Petersberg Tasks in the treaty, while regretting the delay in the architectural restructuring of our defence in terms of the involvement of Western European Union with the European Union."
"In summary, I would say that in its common foreign and security policy aspects the treaty is pedestrian."
"It is to an extent disappointing. But it is worth having."
"To echo Mr Méndez de Vigo, this is a road worth travelling even if it is a road that we still travel largely in hope."
"Madam President, in its opinion annexed to this report, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development makes a negative assessment of the Amsterdam Treaty, specifying the inadequacies of the draft treaty's agricultural provisions and making clear its disappointment."
"Our committee considers it a very serious matter that the European Parliament's legislative and supervisory powers in the agricultural sphere have not been widened."
"It believes that the fact that a Community policy like the CAP remains excluded from adequate democratic control by Parliament means that a serious democratic deficit still exists in the Union, requiring the extension of the codecision procedure to include agricultural policy."
"Nevertheless, this report manages to steer this criticism and these demands in a positive, forward-looking direction, enabling the Committee on Agriculture to change its initial ""No' vote into a ""Yes' vote for the Tsatsos-Méndez de Vigo report, which genuinely serves to mitigate the inadequacies of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Thus, ironically, what is actually a critical report by Parliament becomes the best tool for rectifying the shortcomings of this new treaty."
"The co-rapporteurs and Parliament have produced an excellent piece of work which will enhance the value of this problematic treaty."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it was easy for the Committee on Budgets to examine the Treaty of Amsterdam, as nothing came out of the treaty which met the expectations raised by and commitments entered into by the governments themselves when they signed the agreement on institutional affairs in 1993."
"They undertook jointly with us to deal with budget matters, the revision of the budget rules and principles so as to achieve a clarification of procedures, simplification, better concertation, and so far as possible the disappearance or at all events the elimination of this archaic practice of differentiating between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure."
"They had undertaken to examine all these matters, undertakings which were repeated at the opening of the Turin Conference, and as was time and again requested by the Parliament."
"In spite of that, nothing took place at Amsterdam."
"Commissioner Liikanen knows this very well, we all know this, and that is why, from that point of view, our task is easy."
"We have of course stigmatized the attitude of governments and the results of Amsterdam, and have requested the measures contained in the report of Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Tsatsos, namely the paragraph which raises the demand that, in the budget field - and that includes the European development fund - there be a jointl, properly operating and democratic relationship between the two branches of the budget authority, and that the system of own resources be reviewed and subject to the approval of Parliament."
"This is in my view an important point of the Tsatsos report, which reflects the concerns of the Committee on Budgets on this point."
"Of course the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy must be very disappointed - to put it mildly - that no energy chapter has been included in the treaty, especially if you consider that energy will be a priority in the internal politics of Agenda 2000."
"We now have the single market for energy, after all."
"And, of course, you have to criticize the fact that Euratom has been totally overlooked too."
"The issue here has nothing to do with Safeguard, but the entire nuclear industry, and in this area Parliament has absolutely no participation rights, a fact we deplore and are constantly complaining about."
"All that happens is we are kept informed - and this in an area of policy that provokes very different reactions in all the Member States!"
"We would have, therefore, found it very beneficial - and we must continue to insist on this - if these two key policy areas which we are all so dependent upon had been incorporated into the treaty."
"It is becoming urgently necessary that Parliament receives full participation rights here and that we do not just have the appropriate funds at our disposal."
"Otherwise, democratic control is impossible, and without democratic control there can be no acceptance and still less any credibility."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the principal demands on foreign trade have been laid down in several resolutions of the European Parliament: the object being to bolster the links between foreign and security policy, foreign trade policy, and development and cooperation."
"We demanded the introduction of a common foreign trade policy, including commerce, trade, services and capital transactions, intellectual property, investments, freedom of establishment and competition."
"We demanded a definition of the provisions made for the Union's participation in international economic organizations, especially the World Trade Organization."
"We further demanded that Parliament's powers be strengthened when it comes to formulating new strategies, negotiating mandates and monitoring talks in the area of foreign trade."
"What is the outcome?"
"I personally am of the opinion that the European Parliament has achieved a lot."
"In terms of foreign trade policy, however, we have been disappointed to the point of humiliation."
"The Commission in particular has been humiliated."
"I hope the Commission for its part will do something about the miserable effect of applying article 113."
"In international negotiations - as occur within the framework of the world trade organizations - it will not be possible in future for the Commission to speak with one voice for the European Union on the question of telecommunications and services, I regret to say, since the attempts to implement this have been rejected."
"The main problem was with extending article 113's area of application so as, if need be, to clear up any ambiguities that might exist as to the respective jurisdiction of the Union and the Member States, and to place the Union in a position to speak in unison at the negotiations of international organizations."
"The original motion was initially weakened and finally dropped entirely."
"The reasons for this are no doubt numerous."
"In conclusion I would like to say that for the European Parliament the demand that we adapt to new challenges will be the most important point on the agenda."
"The politics of international competition require a unanimous approach in the relevant negotiations."
"I hope that this can be implemented in practice."
"Thank you for your patience."
"I want to start by congratulating Mr Méndez De Vigo and Mr Tsatsos for their excellent, comprehensive report on the Treaty of Amsterdam. I recognized much of what the Social Committee has wanted to raise in the past."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I believe that the Treaty of Amsterdam is a success, and that it offers new opportunities for a social Europe."
"Whether the treaty will succeed will depend primarily, however, on the way the Member States and European institutions implement it."
"We are particularly pleased with the inclusion of the social protocol in the treaty, as well as with the inclusion of a number of other social provisions."
"This signals that social policy in Europe will be raised to the same level as economic policy. Even though there are still too many issues which will need unanimous decision."
"Instead of an economic and monetary union we will now get a social and monetary Union."
"In other words, not EMU, but SMU."
"The inclusion of social protocol means social dialogue now forms part of the treaty."
"We submitted an amendment for this, which has also been included in the report, as interinstitutional agreement on this needs to be reached very urgently."
"A second important improvement is the inclusion of the employment chapter in the new treaty."
"This means that guidelines can be adopted, and that trial projects can be set up."
"Madam President, what matters now is that what we have achieved in social and employment policy is actively implemented."
"Parliament, together with other institutions, will have to do a great deal to get his going."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I would first like to say that I believe that the Amsterdam Treaty has positive aspects and represents a victory for Europe, progress for Europe."
"People might say that it is a Pyrrhic victory, a limited victory, but the time of great leaps forward has passed and this draft treaty represents a significant, though modest, advance."
"I shall restrict myself to referring to the regional policy aspects."
"First, the draft treaty recognizes the fact that the outermost regions present the European Union with significant and unique problems."
"It also refers to the specific problems faced by certain regions because they are islands - even regions which could be classed as rich, such as the Balearic Islands, which I represent."
"I also welcome the fact that importance has been attached to crossborder problems."
"For the first time, a reference to cross-border cooperation - which, let us not forget, is one of the building blocks of European integration - has been incorporated into the Treaties."
"As Robert Schuman said, borders are the scars of Europe's history."
"It is important that Parliament should consult the Committee of the Regions on cross-border problems, because this means recognizing that it is at the level of the regions, at the level of the institution that is closest to the people, that such problems can be dealt with most effectively. I therefore welcome this reference to cross-border problems in relation to the Committee of the Regions."
"On the other hand, I too regret the fact that the draft treaty does not provide for the right of regions with legislative powers to bring proceedings in the Court of Justice."
"Nevertheless, I consider that this draft treaty represents a positive step forward as far as the European Union's regional policy is concerned."
"Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs, Mr Tsatsos and Mr Méndez de Vigo, on their excellent work."
"On behalf of the Committee on Development, I would like to make the following comments."
"First, we welcome the extension of the codecision procedure to the common development policy and we regard this as being a positive innovation of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Secondly, we regret that the European development fund has not been incorporated into the Community budget, and also that Community competence in the area of developmental cooperation remains limited and outside the policies implemented by the Member States."
"Thirdly, we consider that the new treaty has not made sufficient progress with regard to the expansion of the cohesion and the coherence of external activities, which include, of course, developmental policy."
"Fourthly, we consider that the new treaty unfortunately does not contain adequate means and recommendations for facing many of the enormous challenges of the twenty first century, a large number of which are mirrored in the developmental policy."
"Finally, notwithstanding all the above, since we agree with the view expressed by both the rapporteurs that, despite all its problems, the Amsterdam Treaty is a step in the right direction, we declare ourselves in favour of the ratification of the treaty."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the treaty has become a legal Frankenstein's monster. Everyone adds to it as they see fit, everyone gives it the shape and interpretation that suits them, and that is particularly evident and disturbing with the third pillar of the common justice and home affairs policy."
"The powers of the European Court of Justice have as many holes in them as a Swiss cheese."
"The Schengen Agreement is a source of imponderables, and the new treaty fundamentally changes the constitutional order of the European Union because it massively strengthens the position of the executive over that of the legislature."
"To talk about this in the one minute allocated to the advisory committees is frivolous."
"Hence I invite you to read through the unanimously approved report of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs because in the report of the Committee on Institutional Affairs there is not one line from it."
"I have experienced a lot in my time, but nothing quite like this!"
"The special committees have been advising for months on the Amsterdam Treaty, which has been under negotiation for years, and then the Committee on Institutional Affairs dismisses all the amendments with a wave of the hand."
"All of them!"
"Parliament could conduct itself ad absurdum in this way."
"I am very sorry to have to say so, but the outcome is fixed from the start."
"What is not allowed to be, does not happen!"
"This attitude does nothing for our credibility."
"The Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs has decided unanimously that we cannot declare ourselves in agreement with the result."
"In doing so it is correct in both form and substance."
"Madam President, the Amsterdam Treaty could not make friends with Blue Europe."
"Even forty years after signing the Treaty of Rome, only legal scholars and other experts in Community law are likely to find the fishing policy in the treaty creating the European Community, and then to find it hidden, in fact, once in article 38 and a second time in annex II, chapter 3 between edible slaughtered waste, birds' eggs and natural honey."
"From a purely legal point of view, fishing is included in agricultural policy."
"Anyone who has been carefully following the debates in this House will understand that we do not have to wrestle with surpluses as farming does."
"On the contrary, we have to contend with the catastrophe of oceans being fished empty."
"Consequently, in their Intergovernmental Conference resolutions, the Committee on Fisheries and the European Parliament have called for the inclusion of a separate chapter on this issue in the new treaty."
"A chapter that sets out the fundamental objectives of a responsible fishing policy."
"Sadly, the Heads of State and of Government at Amsterdam have failed to comply with this."
"The same applies to codecision."
"Fishing was unable to benefit from the extension of this procedure."
"That is why I am grateful to the rapporteurs and the Committee on Institutional Affairs that the resolution calls for this procedure to be extended to fishing policy."
"One final point: international agreements are a most important part of the common fishing policy."
"Hence, this coming Friday, for example, we will be debating four international agreements at the part-session here, yet despite this - contrary to our demands at the Intergovernmental Conference - only the consultation procedure will be used."
"Here, too, I am grateful that the resolution demands that the procedure for approving key international agreements be extended."
"The next intergovernmental conference will not be far away, and our demands for a policy on fishing will not be far away either!"
"Madam President, the Committee on Women's Rights is convinced that the draft Treaty of Amsterdam represents a step forward politically, since it codifies the principle of non-discrimination according to sex as a fundamental principle of Community law, and quotes equality of the sexes as one of the objectives of the Treaty on European Union."
"It should especially be congratulated on its promotion of equality between men and women in Community posts and on recognizing the importance of mainstreaming and active equal opportunity policies in all Community actions."
"The Committee on Women's Rights also considers that the distinction it makes between employment and the wider concept of work shows that it has attempted to include all aspects of women's activities, in addition to paid employment."
"It appeals to the Commission, and especially Commissioner Oreja, to aim its information campaigns in favour of ratification in all Member States specifically at women, thus raising levels of awareness of what they have to gain under the proposed treaty."
"Finally, the Committee on Women's Rights calls for a conference, to be organized jointly by the Commission and the Parliament, to inform and mobilize the greatest possible number of women on elected bodies and NGOs in all Member States to campaign for the ratification of the treaty."
"Madam President, the Treaty of Amsterdam contains significant advances on issues relating to fundamental rights, non-discrimination, freedom of movement and citizenship and also guarantees of those rights through control by legal institutions and the right of petition itself."
"Our main concern is to ensure that these rights can be effectively exercised, and we therefore fear that insufficient institutional reforms in Amsterdam will prolong the ineffectiveness of the decision-making process designed to implement the rules of the treaty."
"Our approach therefore has been to read the treaty objectively, without either wildly over-stating its advances or being hyper-critical of it as a whole because there is insufficient evidence of institutional changes in the light of the proposed enlargement of the Union."
"The treaty takes some positive steps towards meeting the specific interests and aspirations of its citizens."
"The Parliament should therefore give a it a positive signal that will make it easy for the public to back it at a time when they are preparing for the great qualitative change represented by the single currency."
"The institutional strategy we are now proposing, especially regarding a new method of reviewing Treaties, less intergovernmental and closer to the processes by which they are created, through more effective intervention by the European Parliament and, I might add, national parliaments, deserves my full support."
"I cannot however say the same, nor should I do so, of the objectives of the institutional reform which is recommended, since these are limited to the decision-making powers of governments, raising the spectre of a Directoire of major states in the face of public opinion and regrettably overlooking other major institutional issues which are relevant to enlargement, such as the reform of the Community budget and the role and resources of economic and social cohesion policies."
"Nor can I approve of the recommended strategy of making enlargement conditional upon those institutional reforms, taking the peoples of the candidate countries as hostages in the power- struggle strategies of the existing Member States."
"Madam President, any opposition to the treaty on the grounds that it is not sufficiently pro-European and prointegration may contribute to the strengthening of anti-European criticism and mistrust regarding changes which, although limited, are moves in the right direction; a more democratic Union, better able to regulate its economic processes with the object of ensuring equity and cohesion, more closely bound to the values of states that are governed by the rule of law, and closer to their citizens."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the draft treaty rightly involves extending joint decision-making to the European Parliament."
"This is to be welcomed from a democratic point of view."
"I must, however, point out that, in essential areas which are important for the functioning of the single market, the codecision procedure is not guaranteed."
"This applies particularly to industrial policy, to the banking and finance sector, and to questions of taxation."
"It would really be significant if coordination were more efficient in this area, if only in the interest of employment."
"There is a need for improvement here."
"What is most regrettable is the fact that very definite instruments are not provided for in the draft treaty."
"As with monetary union, there should also have been instruments coordinating economic policies better."
"That is why the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy believes it to be especially important that we still manage to arrive at a European strategy for cooperation and coordination in the interim."
"We need to give tangible shape to the economic union and safeguard its method of operating."
"This will very much require the involvement of the European Parliament, and we will need to insist that article 103 is given concrete form, if need be by interinstitutional agreement by the time the treaty is next amended."
"After all, we want an economic policy within the European Union which is both efficient and democratically secured, while equally oriented towards employment objectives."
"We should not forget that non-coordination of economic policies in the years from 1991 to 1995 caused a drop in growth of 3 %, to the detriment of employment in the European Union."
"We cannot afford this!"
"Even if the Amsterdam Treaty, fortunately, has not involved any retrograde steps in economic policy, we nevertheless have to say that the key policy areas of business, employment, and fiscal and monetary policy lack bite."
"Hence it is vital that an extension of the Community's powers, the concretization of its political instruments and the principle of majority voting are implemented at the next amendment to the treaty."
"Madam President, the Socialist Group will today vote in favour of the Amsterdam Treaty and urge national parliaments and, where appropriate, through referendums, the people of the Union to vote in favour."
"For my group there have always been two priorities with regard to this treaty change: firstly, that it must meet the needs and aspirations and the hopes of the people of the Union more appropriately; and, secondly, it must prepare the Union for enlargement."
"We in this House know and are deeply involved in the complexities of European Union decision-making."
"We in this House crave institutional coherence and common sense and the present treaty, we also recognize, is not sufficient in that context."
"Whilst we recognize the changes that Amsterdam brought to the treaty by extending in some areas qualified majority voting and codecision and by introducing other minor institutional changes, we, who are so deeply involved, also recognize that not enough was done to create a decision-making structure for twenty-plus Member States."
"That is why we insist in this vote today that enlargement is impossible without further institutional change."
"That is not just our view in this Parliament, it is also the view of the Commission, it is also the stated view of several Member States of the European Union."
"We should be clear as well about the advantages which this treaty brings and the significant progress it makes in reconnecting Europe with its people."
"Since June we have been involved here in an unbelievably intricate argument about how we can force a new round of institutional changes."
"This is important, I do not doubt, but it is hardly the stuff to convince those outside this Parliament that we care about the agenda which most people are talking about."
"So if we want ratification of the treaty across Europe, and I believe we do, then let us at least make clear what its benefits are."
"Let us be glad of the employment title which I hope will be given its first basic framework this very week at the Luxembourg Special Summit on employment."
"Let us be glad of the new competence to combat discrimination which, I must say, as I have gone round the Union in the last few months, has been widely welcomed, particularly in this European Year Against Racism."
"Let us be glad about the steps forward on equal opportunities, the environment, public health, consumer protection."
"Let us be glad of the developments on transparency and openness, the reduction in the number of decision-making procedures, the enhancement of the fight against fraud and the improved customs cooperation."
"This is a long and significant list."
"Some argue that the public are gravely disappointed about the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Some argue that the deafening silence on the treaty since June demonstrates it is a non-event."
"Perhaps rather, it demonstrates that the treaty does not frighten them."
"As we know to our cost in this House, good news is often not regarded as news."
"I hope that the people of the Union will see the treaty as yes, institutionally modest, needing change before enlargement, but largely dealing in a serious though undramatic way with their major concerns."
"The search for jobs, the coherence of our society, the protection of our planet, the extension of citizens' rights, openness and democracy - my group votes for that agenda."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their erudite report which has united this House."
"We will support this report and, with it, the recommendation to ratify the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"This treaty, however, has failed to meet the aim of providing the groundwork for enlargement."
"It satisfies the condition that we should begin negotiations, but not that we can conclude them."
"This has mainly to do with the fact that the efficiency needed to increase the size of the Union by 5, 10 or 11 Member States is lacking as a result of not extending the principle of the qualified majority vote far enough."
"If the Ecofin Council says there should be no competition in taxes, then it is correct."
"Yet better still would be to apply the majority principle to fiscal policy to achieve the harmonization necessary in the areas needed."
"The same goes for structural policy and for the impossible situation found in the area of foreign trade policy, to name but a few key points."
"We should not only press for these institutional reforms at the next intergovernmental conference to be held prior to the next enlargement, but instead we should make it a priority that those legal and domestic policy areas which have become Community responsibility are given over to majority voting or codecision five years into the treaty."
"It is not so much that we need new powers within the European Union."
"What we do need are the instruments to make sensible use of the powers we already have."
"We want to make this clear and carry it through by using the treaty appropriately."
"Clearly, we should not just talk about the negative aspects."
"We should look to the arrangement that, in future, Parliament enjoys codecision in those areas of the first pillar in which the Council decides with a majority."
"And I consider this a major breakthrough for the rights of Parliament."
"Parliament has finally appeared on the European stage where legislation is concerned."
"The only exception is agriculture and fisheries policy, both in legislation and budgetary policy, and this will need to be revised in the next round, so as to achieve parity in this area."
"We need to realize that the relationship of the institutions will change in the long term through the right of the European Parliament to elect the Commission President."
"In future the Heads of State and of Government will consider which candidate has the majority here."
"This will lead to a politicizing of this organization and will also affect the future relationship of Parliament and Commission in a particular way."
"I believe this is something we should be working on."
"Some of the things I have heard from the reports of individual committees should be reconsidered."
"It is not a case of incorporating each particular area into the treaty by means of special rules; we actually need fewer special rules and greater simplification of the treaty to bring all policy areas under the same rules."
"We must not end up with a huge treaty, but at a smaller treaty."
"We need in the long term to arrive at a constitution because this is the only way to really make progress."
"This treaty offers the chance to make basic social and civil rights the legally verifiable basis for evaluating our legislation."
"This is a major development!"
"In the next round we want to implement individual rights to litigation on the strength of basic citizens' rights, but this first step is a great and positive step, which we should make proper use of."
"The inclusion of the social chapter and the employment chapter in the overall treaty gives the social dimension to this European Union."
"We are called upon as the European Parliament to make use of these instruments too."
"The European Court, contrary to the opinion of Mrs Roth, has been strengthened by this treaty, and to make large parts of legal and domestic policy Community responsibility, that is all areas dealing with the setting of norms and standards, is a breakthrough for the Community Europe and acts as a counter to intergovernmental Europe, and we should continue with this work."
"With foreign and security policy we have new areas and new procedures."
"Practice will show whether these really bring progress."
"If I bear the planning unit in mind and see how it is talked about in certain Member States, that it is only a COREPER body in which the countries are represented by one person, then that is not progress."
"This planning unit should not be an intergovernmental organization at ambassador level or below, but rather a true Community solution fully involving the Commission, or else it will not bring success."
"We will have to see to it that a motion as sensible as this is tabled, and Parliament will approve nothing less."
"We have exhausted the present method of the intergovernmental conference."
"Europe needs to be involved in a political dialogue and should not be held back by the doubting Thomases found in the offices of the national ministries."
"Only then will we be in the position to bring about a new order for Europe, and this is something we should be working towards."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Council, Mr Commissioner, I would first like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Tsatsos, for their analytical work of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which is contained in the introduction to their document."
"My regret is all the greater, in that the resolution which is the outcome of their work, is not on a par with their thinking."
"To call on Member States, in the first paragraph to ratify the treaty is more of an injunction than a balanced reflection on a treaty which in truth merited such reflection."
"Who can dispute the correctness of such an assessment?"
"Does this House need reminding that this House itself passed several resolutions strictly defining the absolute priorities that had to be met prior to the challenge of any enlargement profoundly modifying the Union, and that account was also to be taken of economic and monetary union and the completion of Agenda 2000?"
"Eighteen months of negotiations have given birth to a mediocre and disappointing document, which contains advances where we did not expect any. Among these were the first steps towards a social policy, employment, human rights, equality between men and women, power for the European Parliament."
"But also, what dramatic inadequacies there are in essential fields! The absence of any preamble to the Treaty of Amsterdam - and this is the first time that this has occurred - is an expression of the very disturbing inability of the fifteen Member States to agree together on the objectives of the European Union of the Third Millennium, at the very time when ten states are knocking on our door for admission into a project whose name, aims, means and values escape us."
"As regards institutional reform - already a necessity for the fifteen Member States, and more than ever absolutely essential when there are twenty - for the second time I say that the Council has admitted that it is powerless, and simply said that it will do better."
"A common foreign and security policy, and this is a matter of the external visibility of the Union, has been put to the test and has failed in Yugoslavia and elsewhere in the world. But The Union is now endowed with better intergovernmental tools, whose efficiency will depend, as the resolution emphasizes with a cruel realism, on the goodwill on each of the Member States, each of them possessed of the anti-Community weapon par excellence, the right of veto."
"Neither in the field of internal affairs or of justice, nor in the area of reinforced cooperation, which is itself also subject to veto, is there any more cause for optimism."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the attitude adopted this afternoon by the majority of Parliament of acquiescing to this draft, which is virtually unanimously considered inadequate, will be no more honourable than a possible alternative strategy, consisting of postponing our vote until after the European Council of Luxembourg, and asking that Council to make a clear announcement of its intentions on the future of Europe."
"If we had done that, we would have applied point 19 of the Méndez de Vigo and Tsatsos resolution, and Parliament would have exercised its rights and that would have been true politics."
"Tomorrow will be the time for reflection, and for getting back to work on these issues, with, let us hope, with a Commission which is more up to its task, with a Council which is more united around a common objective, and a Parliament which assumes its role as a pioneer, an inspirer of European construction."
"Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to the good job done by the two excellent rapporteurs, Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Tsatsos."
"Nevertheless, I have to say that I am disappointed by this somewhat florid debate."
"When there are no results, metaphors abound - and Mr Méndez de Vigo used the especially elegant metaphor of the inn and the road, taken from Cervantes, because his report is based on the philosophy of the step forward."
"There are always steps forward."
"However, I would like another type of debate."
"Not a populist, opportunist debate, of course, but a clear, political and responsible debate."
"A debate which does not necessarily end in an obligatory yes vote by Parliament, which can decide to vote for, or against, or abstain, after a responsible appraisal from the position of responsibility conferred on it by the citizens."
"I should therefore briefly like to set out my group's position on the Amsterdam Treaty, then on the report."
"Objectively, we believe that the Amsterdam Treaty is a failure."
"Subjectively, it is disappointment for both Parliament and the other institutions."
"Why?"
"Because it makes inadequate provision for either social protection or the regulation of the market in the face of the predominance of, not so much the economic, as the monetary sphere - the monetarist logic; because it does not endow the Foreign Policy and Justice and Home Affairs pillars with the minimum Community characteristics that are necessary at this political moment; because it does not provide for the minimum institutional changes that are essential before enlargement, and were the principal goal of the Amsterdam Summit; and lastly, as has already been said in this Chamber, because it was drawn up using the traditional method employed for drafting treaties - a diplomatic, intergovernmental method far removed from the citizens and even their representative parliamentary institutions."
"The report, which is technically very good, plays up the positive aspects and plays down the negative aspects of the draft treaty, although I recognize that it contains significant criticisms."
"It proposes using the Community method, and we agree with that."
"But that is not the vision set out in the draft treaty."
"It is a proposal for the future."
"Lastly, it recommends that the Member States ratify the Amsterdam Treaty."
"In political terms, I find it unreasonable that Parliament, which does not have the right to give its assent to the draft treaty, because it is denied that right by the Member States' governments, should now feel obliged to recommend the ratification of such an inadequate treaty."
"Consequently, on the basis of the declaration by the Governments of Belgium, France and Italy, we are requesting that, first, the necessary steps be taken to prepare for enlargement and significant undertakings be made to the European Parliament, the national parliaments and the citizens of the European Union."
"Madam President, I believe that by voting on this resolution, the European Parliament is going to add a new chapter to its story of conformity with the governments and its refusal to carry out a role of political initiative in the process of constructing Europe."
"At the moment, we are observing a rite which, in its timing and in its principal content, has been imposed by the need of the governments signing this treaty which we can say has not been executed; governments which, to appease any MEPs and reluctant, disconcerted and misinformed public opinion, need to be able to use the favourable opinion given to the ratification of the European Parliament, which is absolutely irrelevant, however, as it is lacking in political consequences."
"In fact, we are voting to give our governments a headline: ""European Parliament says yes to Treaty of Amsterdam' , or ""Important new stage in construction of Europe' ."
"We all know that the truth lies elsewhere, all of us in this Chamber know that the Treaty of Amsterdam cannot achieve any of the objectives the governments had set themselves."
"We know that the European Union will not control the impact of the enlargement and monetary union will be at risk, without a change in the balance and operation of its institutions."
"Beyond the absence of any overall, forward-looking view of this least ambitious of all treaties that have gradually marked the stages of the construction of Europe, beyond the fair criticisms we have heard in almost all opinions from the committees involved, I believe that this treaty provides a good representation of modern times in Europe."
"An integration crisis, a prevailing trend towards renationalization, a discussion of several basic principles and several clear roles acquired by the Commission and the Court of Justice, despite what Mr Brok says, a dangerous game of Russian roulette on expansion which, if developed under current institutional conditions, would penalize the Union's inability to make decisions."
"On the Committee on Institutional Affairs, some of us have tried to suggest a more political, less conformist road for Parliament, more in keeping with a logic of Parliamentary independence."
"We have tried to suggest the road of deferring opinion, to ask and try to obtain, before giving an opinion, by the Council of Luxembourg, the undertaking to place on site and execute, before the new accessions, the institutional amendments not made in Amsterdam, as three Union governments are already asking."
"Not only has this request been dropped, but the inclusion of a somewhat diluted political content in the form of lukewarm calls to the governments has had to overcome unusual hostility and a surprising closing by the rapporteurs, not to mention the hard resistance to any change, particularly from the German delegations of the two largest groups that have guided the relevant groups in the noble undertaking to make a clean sweep of any political ambition held by the European Parliament."
"We have thus witnessed the incomprehensible failure of traditionally unshakable positions held by Parliament, in a realistic logic whereby any initiative the governments do not like should not even be attempted."
"This is what our rapporteurs have been telling us for months."
"In this framework of attacking the independence of the role of Parliament, the political fragility of the Tsatsos and Méndez de Vigo resolution is no surprise."
"It is an ambiguous text, with no political view of the future of Europe other than a request to the governments to implement the treaty properly, with no careful assessment of the Amsterdam appraisals."
"Mr President, to use an English expression, this evening the whips will guide the vote of their own disciplined troops and there will be no surprises."
"Unfortunately, we are only left with one vote against this resolution so far from the ideals on which the European challenge is based and the associational method that produced it, convinced that the way to honour our mandate is to do so as servants of Europe and its democratic growth, and not as government spokesmen."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, permit me, and here this in no mere ritual on my part, to pay my respects to the often difficult work of the two rapporteurs, Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Tsatsos, who have defended their vision of things with brio."
"I must admit that our respective points of view were initially quite far apart, and have now become somewhat closer. Unfortunately, not enough for us to be able to vote in favour of their report."
"I shall not speak about content."
"I shall never tire of repeating that the European Parliament, alas, does not have the power to ratify treaties."
"The task which is ours is a purely political one, and this should leave us far wider scope in our judgement."
"Most unfortunately, I have to observe that the work of the rapporteurs was from the very outset conditioned by the final message which they wished to get across, at no matter what cost, and even if getting that message across meant passing over the immense shortfalls in this treaty."
"I myself remain convinced that a more critical approach to the treaty was not incompatible with the call for ratification by national parliaments, which we support."
"As regards the link between institutional reform and enlargement, let us recognize that the report has been very substantially improved."
"After the institutional fiasco of Amsterdam, it is quite unacceptable for the European Parliament not to pitch with all its weight into such a reform, prior to any enlargement."
"Failure to do so would mean that we risk not only delaying enlargement, but also imperilling the operation and survival of the European Union itself."
"However, we do not find in the report this determination to ensure that the Parliament wields its full influence."
"The guarantees given in this respect by the institutional protocol annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam are also inadequate."
"Hence the questions we raised a few months ago in this very House, remain as burning now as then."
"Has the time not come to say clearly that enlargement cannot be undertaken on a satisfactory basis except accompanied by the wide-ranging institutional reform of the Union, and that monetary union needs to be completed by substantial progress towards a political union, and possibly also economic, social and tax union?"
"As regards matters of form, and the same criticisms apply as to matters of substance, the general tone of the report seems to us to be something of a step back from the positions that have been expressed by the Parliament over the last eighteen months, and we regret this."
"I appeal to the political intelligence of the two rapporteurs to improve this result somewhat, by accepting a number of amendments."
"But there is also a question of strategy."
"The European Parliament must one day stop being a mass of institutions trailing in the wake of events, and break the umbilical cord which ties too many of us to the purely nationalistic positions of our respective governments."
"Why should we, on the eve of the European Council of Luxembourg, give governments carte blanche, and take position here and now on the Treaty of Amsterdam, when we know that there is an unavoidable link between the Treaty of Amsterdam and the opening of official negotiations for enlargement?"
"Why do we have to take a position today, when the national parliaments have a timetable which will allow them to pursue their own strategy?"
"I remain convinced, like Mrs Spaak and Mrs Aglietta, that it would be preferable to come back with an opinion on the treaty at the beginning of 1998, which would enable us to exert some pressure on the Luxembourg summit, and give an opinion when the full facts were available to us."
"The rapporteurs have not agreed with this point of view."
"I ask them at least - and we raise a call in this direction - to accept one of the amendments, whose aim is to reinforce paragraph 4 of the resolution."
"Those are the few considerations that I wish to express before this House, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance."
"Madam President, the report from Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Tsatsos recommends that the Member States ratify the Treaty of Amsterdam, in spite of its shortfalls."
"But what are those shortfalls?"
"And are they without consequence?"
"The accusation is first raised that the treaty does not adapt Union institutions for future enlargement. But this is an error that we could perfectly well make good in the years to come."
"On the other hand, there is another failing in the treaty, which is not so easy to put right, which should cause us to reject the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"The treaty makes for less democracy in Europe, as it tends to strip national democracies of their powers, without there being at the Union level any equivalent controlling authority."
"The blame for this is not insufficient extension of powers of codecision with the European Parliament, as we occasionally hear, for codecision with the European Parliament could only be fully democratic if there were a single European people."
"However, not only is this not the case, there is even reason to doubt that there exists among the peoples of Europe the wish - alleged - to integrate in the strongest sense of the word, that is, the merger to which the European parliament attaches so much importance."
"Under such conditions, the approach of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which increases the number of cases where codecision or majority voting in the Council takes place, which reduces the role of national parliaments and affirms the superiority of Community law, even when derived, over national constitutions, appears totally artificial and quite out of touch with real society."
"Here is the root cause of insufficient democracy."
"The promoters of the Treaty of Amsterdam have put their money on the fact that it is possible to transfer powers to insufficiently democratic European institutions, hoping to be able to correct them at some future date."
"But has anyone given any thought as to whether this date might not be very far off, and that it might never even happen!"
"A risky bet if ever there was one!"
"Or again, we should look at the situation face-on, and construct European Union on the basis of national democracies. But at all events, we have to put an end to the dangerous manoeuvring which is proposed by the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"That is the reason why we are launching the 'SOS Democracy' appeal."
"That is why, for the good of the peoples of Europe, we are refusing to ratify this illegitimate treaty, and as regards France, we shall demand a referendum."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I must first congratulate you for the quality of the report on the Treaty of Amsterdam, drafted in the name of the Committee on Institutional Affairs by Mr Méndes de Vigo and Mr Tsatsos."
"This is a substantial document, which places the Treaty of Amsterdam in its historic context, and underscores the considerable progress made with respect to the three pillars."
"I also thank the Presidents of the committees and the speakers delegated by the political groups, the majority of whom have recommended adopting the present treaty."
"I would like above all to note the generally positive turn of the draft, which is in the spirit of the resolution approved by vote of the European Parliament the day after the meeting of the European Council on 16 and 17 June in Amsterdam."
"The Committee on Institutional Affairs indeed recognizes the major advances of the treaty signed on 2 October in Amsterdam, even if some things remain to be done, in particular, with a view to the forthcoming enlargement."
"This incidentally is not disputed by the signatories of the treaty."
"The Presidency has had occasion to express its opinion before you regarding the results of the Intergovernmental Conference, and it is not my intention to return to the details."
"I must, however, on this occasion, reaffirm that the over-hasty criticisms expressed in the aftermath of the Amsterdam meeting - and your discussion has just demonstrated this - could not withstand ever so slightly an attentive and objective a study of the results."
"It appears to me that as weeks go by, this assessment seems to be ever more correct, and I am delighted."
"The draft resolution accompanying the report opens with a recommendation to the Member States to ratify the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Allow me to emphasize the political importance of the recommendation made by the European Parliament, which is the institution representing the peoples of the Member States united in the Community, and two members of whom participated in the work of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"This shows that the Parliament sees in the Treaty of Amsterdam a continuing process which started with the earlier treaties, and that the Parliament rightly calls incomplete. But it is nevertheless part of the process of construction of European political union."
"Of course, as the European Parliament has emphasized, this new stage in the process of European integration will only produce tangible results if a clear political will arises in favour of a common approach within the Union."
"The need for such a common approach is clear, today more than ever before."
"Honourable Members have alluded to the method of treaty revision. In response, I say that an end to the procedure under article N can only be achieved by a unanimous vote."
"There is no other solution. Any alternative method - and there are some - will not obviate the need to confront the real problem of ratification by national parliaments."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam will help us, as it provides a response to the multiple challenges confronting the European Union."
"The future enlargement of the Union is only one of such challenges."
"Indeed we must also and above all work to reduce unemployment in Europe, reinforce instruments combatting organized crime and the plague of drugtaking, ward off the threats to public health."
"Generally speaking, we must bring the Union closer to its citizens, by making it our strong priority to deal determinedly with the citizens' day-to-day concerns."
"I entirely share the considerations of the draft resolution, according to which advances in European integration must be assessed in the light of the progress of the Union, not only as a common market, but also as a system of values, and in the light of the improvement in the quality of life that such advance makes possible."
"I note with pleasure that the Committee on Institutional Affairs acknowledges the progress made in this respect by the draft treaty, for the purpose of developing Union policies in the interests of the citizens."
"More than anything else, the question of unemployment directly affects the life of millions of European citizens."
"With 18 million people workless today in the Union, the new treaty had an obligation to make the promotion of a high level of employment one of the objectives of the Union and to define an European strategy in favour of employment, while allowing Member States to define their own national policies with regard to employment."
"Joint action at the Union level aims more at elaborating a strategy for the coordination of policies of employment, which include the adoption of guidelines for employment, along the lines of the mechanisms already in force for the economic policies of the Community and the Member States."
"This action also provides for an annual evaluation of measures adopted at the national level."
"I need not emphasize the importance that the Presidency of the Council attaches to the effective and rapid implementation at Union level of instruments combating unemployment and promoting employment in Europe."
"Witness the extraordinary summit of the Heads of State and of Government devoted to this question, which will be held tomorrow and the day after in Luxembourg."
"This Extraordinary European Council will specifically deal with clearly identified proposals in the field of guidelines for employment, as expressed in quantifiable and verifiable objectives."
"Furthermore, the insertion into the treaty instituting the European Community of the agreement on social policy will provide for the creation of a single market in social and labour affairs, contributing to the development of a consistent policy at the Community level and, I emphasize this, with respect to applicant countries."
"Inspired by the same considerations of concern for the citizens, the Treaty of Amsterdam substantially reinforces provisions relating to the protection of public health, enforcing high standards of quality, and the protection of citizens as consumers and inhabitants of an environment which must remain clean."
"The objective of the free circulation of persons was already a part of the treaty setting up the European Community, and it was therefore logical to take steps so that asylum seeking, visas, immigration and external border controls might now be part of Community rules and procedures."
"Similarly, it is significant that the manuals and procedures developed over the last few years by the Member States in the Schengen system, for whom the free circulation of persons was already a reality, should be incorporated into the Union."
"Freedom to circulate within a border-free area should not nevertheless reduce the security of persons living in the Union."
"Criminal activity, like terrorism, like crimes against children, drug trafficking and fraud, do not stop at national borders."
"Hence the Treaty of Amsterdam has established cooperation between police forces, customs departments and other law-enforcement organizations of the Member States, which will be developed to prevent and detect criminal activity."
"The operational capacities Europol will also be considerably improved."
"The concrete improvements provided by the Treaty of Amsterdam in the field of foreign policy and common security, which the Committee on Institutional Affairs recognizes, should of course be assessed in the light of experience."
"Unanimous voting will remain the rule for PESC, but in those cases where the Council can come up with common positions, or launch common actions, the scope for qualified majority voting has been enlarged in article J-13."
"The Council last week gave an update on the preparations for the introduction of the planning and rapid alert unit, and on the integration into the treaty of the Schengen manuals."
"Institutions were not the main theme of the Intergovernmental Conference, although the institutional results of that conference were what the judgement of many people targeted, to the exclusion of all else."
"These modifications include very significant advances, some of which have been alluded to by the Committee on Institutional Affairs."
"In the eyes of many, these modifications are a failure, simply for the reason that there was no agreement on the weighting of votes in the Council or on the composition of the Commission."
"Simply, by way of a parenthesis, I would like to remind you that the European Parliament has never formulated precise proposals with regard to the composition of the Commission, nor with regard to the weighting of votes within the Council."
"The reinforcement of the powers of the European Parliament, by codecision and the extension of the competencies of the Court of Justice and of the Court of Auditors, have not been sufficiently emphasized."
"The same applies to the new procedure for reinforced cooperation or flexibility, laid down in the treaty."
"I think it is time to put this into its proper perspective."
"The results of Amsterdam have clearly shown that public institutional reforms are necessary prior to the forthcoming enlargement."
"This is the very direction of the protocol on the institutions annexed to the treaty."
"However, it would be an error to measure the results of Amsterdam solely in the light of the foregoing, just as it would be an error to isolate the reforms from all the other measures that will need to be taken to ensure the proper preparation for enlargement."
"Here I am thinking in particular about the reform of our policies and of the way our institutions operate, setting aside the way they are made up."
"It is clear that both the Council and the European Council examine with interest any contribution that the Commission and the European Parliament would like to make to the debate, to ensure that such reforms can be carried out under the best possible conditions, without slowing up the process of Union enlargement."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would, as I draw to a close, like to warmly welcome the resolution of the European Parliament to intensify contact with the national parliaments."
"Such a decision is supportive of debate in the member countries, with a view to enabling rapid ratification of the treaty."
"This appears to me all the more important at a time when, as now, it is more than ever necessary to explain to public opinion the initiatives undertaken at the Union level."
"Let us together try, in the words of your own report, to optimize the results of Amsterdam in the interest of European citizens and, to paraphrase Mrs Pauline Green, if we want the treaty to be ratified by national parliaments, let us emphasize its beneficial effects."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly like to say how pleased I am to be able to participate in this debate to evaluate the Amsterdam Treaty, on the basis of the report presented on behalf of the Committee on Institutional Affairs by Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Tsatsos, whom I congratulate most warmly on their excellent work."
"The motion for a resolution, through its methodology, and through its overall evaluation, its reflections on the legal bases and, above all, its proposals for a future strategy, clearly identifies, in my view, what the outcome of the European Council's meeting in Amsterdam represents."
"I should also like to thank the representatives of the different committees and all other speakers - including those to come - for taking part in this debate. This demonstrates the importance of this debate."
"You are well aware, ladies and gentlemen, that throughout the Intergovernmental Conference I engaged in deliberations with, and shared the disappointments and hopes of, Parliament and the Committee on Institutional Affairs."
"No more than two months would go by without me attending a meeting of the Committee on Institutional Affairs to listen to the views of the different political groups and parliamentarians, as well as to set out the Commission's position on the various issues."
"And you are also well aware that on the very day that the European Council's meeting in Amsterdam ended - at twenty to four in the morning - I left immediately for Brussels and met with you at ten in the morning to convey to you my response to the draft treaty, with the tiredness that is natural after an 18-hour meeting, and perhaps with the haste that is inevitable at moments like that."
"At that time, I expressed to you - and, a moment ago, probably quite rightly, the President-in-Office, in a way, criticized this for being too hasty - my personal dissatisfaction."
"But I also spoke to you later - and I shall it repeat now and repeat it continually - of my commitment, and the Commission's commitment, to carrying on the fight. Indeed - as we all know - the European project did not end in Amsterdam, and the immediate future will be full of events which require our undivided attention."
"In the view of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Amsterdam Treaty must be judged by what it really means."
"We believe that it means significant progress in a number of fields - which have been underlined today - especially the field of citizenship, in the broadest sense."
"As an unfinished job with a lot of loose ends, it is undoubtedly unsatisfactory in a number of other respects, especially - as has also been underlined today - as regards the institutions and foreign policy."
"Faced with this situation, we clearly have a number of options. One is quite simply to say that we are completely satisfied with the draft treaty."
"Another is to reject it."
"A number of speakers have announced that they are going to reject the draft treaty, describing it in a variety of ways: Mrs Roth called it an inflatable monster;"
"That is undoubtedly one possible response to the draft treaty."
"However, alongside the options of quite simply accepting the draft treaty unreservedly or rejecting it, there is a clearly a third option, which is that presented in Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Tsatsos' report: we can undertake, as of now, to seek solutions to the outstanding problems."
"This will require us to do a number of things."
"Firstly, we shall have to create the institutional conditions necessary for enlargement."
"Almost everyone has said that."
"We will not be in a position to tackle enlargement unless the necessary institutional changes are made."
"The fact is that those institutional changes were already envisaged in the Maastricht Treaty, and were one of the principal reasons for negotiating the Amsterdam Treaty. But this issue was then sidetracked and left unresolved."
"Consequently, we must create the institutional conditions necessary for enlargement."
"Secondly, we shall have to adapt the political institutions to a Union that will have a single currency whose stability will be constitutionally guaranteed, so to speak, by the European Central Bank."
"And we shall have to acquire the means to carry out - as everyone agrees, and Mr Spencer said earlier - a common foreign and security policy that is commensurate with our ambitions and responsibilities."
"As the House will understand, the Commission does not wish to make a pronouncement at present on either the various amendments, judgements and criticisms put forward - many of which I support - or the objections expressed in relation to the draft treaty."
"In my view, ladies and gentlemen - and here I am following on from what the two rapporteurs said - the important thing is to attempt to exploit the possibilities offered by the draft treaty to the maximum, utilizing the protocol on the institutions itself to prepare the necessary reforms."
"The proposal to reopen the debate - which, in my view, is one of the most interesting and incisive elements of the report - has the political backing of the Commission, which undertakes to draw up the report requested in the motion for a resolution."
"In this regard, I wish to remind the House that the Commission proposes in its document, Agenda 2000, to take immediately the political decision on the weighting of votes in the Council which must accompany the reduction of the number of Members of the Commission before the first enlargement."
"It is also recommends convening a new Intergovernmental Conference as soon as possible after the year 2000 with a view to carrying out a comprehensive review of the provisions of the treaties on the composition and functioning of the institutions."
"What we must not do is what we did last time."
"We must not stick rigidly to an event, and then find that we do not have time to resolve the institutional problems. Let us leave aside the event."
"Let us resolve the institutional problems calmly, efficiently and resolutely; and, once we resolved them, we shall be in a position to move towards enlargement."
"I should also like to recall that the Commission has undertaken to submit a proposal amending the decision on commitology in June - and to do so in close cooperation with Parliament and the Council."
"Our goal must be to draw up a proposal which enables us to resolve a problem which has existed for years, and which was not resolved with the introduction of the codecision procedure."
"There can be doubt that the introduction of the codecision procedure was a step in the right direction, but it was clearly insufficient to resolve the commitology problem."
"This has been an outstanding issue for a long time."
"We have to tackle it with decisiveness."
"The 1994 ""modus vivendi' agreement cannot go on for ever. We must make the procedures more effective; and we must fully involve the national administrations, whilst fully respecting the rights of all the institutions."
"I also wish to tell the House that I am personally convinced that it is necessary to initiate a debate on the method of revising the treaties."
"A great many of speakers have referred to that today."
"Clearly, as the President-in-Office said a moment ago, we are restricted by article N: the amendment of any article of the treaties, not just article N, requires unanimity."
"Nevertheless, I believe that it is important for both Parliament and the Commission to be able to explore ways of changing the method of amending the treaties."
"I consider that we have reached the point at which the system that we have had for many years has outlived its usefulness."
"I believe that it is necessary to explore other ways."
"There is therefore highly important work for the Commission, Parliament and - of course - the Council to do to improve the current procedure."
"I consider that the procedure must be made more democratic, since - although not formally - it is partly constitutional in nature."
"Furthermore, there is a need to increase efficiency with a view to enlargement."
"Naturally, Parliament, the Commission, the Council and the Member States' governments will be the main players in this debate, along with the national parliaments and civil society."
"A great many speakers, including the rapporteurs, have referred to the role of civil society and relations with the national parliaments."
"In my view, this is very important."
"This is new language."
"I remember well when we were gathered together in November 1990 - I was a Member of the European Parliament at the time - at the celebrated assizes of Rome; although, as the House well knows, the least that can be said is that they were not a great success."
"I believe that we must revive that idea, with the European Parliament fulfilling its role completely - and it can do so much more successfully with the powers conferred on it by the Amsterdam Treaty - but also ensuring a dialogue with the national parliaments, like the one that the European Parliament is conducting."
"And ensuring a dialogue with civil society, because civil society - as Parliament, which has organized two sets of public hearings, well knows - cannot be ignored. It cannot remain on the sidelines, leaving it up to ministries alone - or Parliament or the Commission alone - to do everything."
"Civil society must also participate."
"And it is therefore worthwhile drawing attention to the quality of the proposals submitted to us by civil society."
"In short, ladies and gentlemen, we have a lot of work ahead of us."
"Firstly, we must perfect the implementation of the provisions of this draft treaty."
"Secondly, we must address important issues such as unemployment, which is a fundamental problem, and the most serious problem currently facing the European Union."
"We are on the eve of the Luxembourg meeting of the European Council on matters relating to the single currency and enlargement, and I confess that I am convinced of the urgent need to make progress."
"I would therefore echo Mr Méndez de Vigo's call to the House not to dwell on the details of the draft treaty, which, for all its defects, will enable us to continue making progress."
"Lastly, I should like to make an appeal to all those who believe that our countries and their citizens only have a future in a Europe of peace and solidarity, and that we must act together with determination and resolve, as well as with enthusiasm, courage and patience, for the fight ahead will be hard."
"Quoting Cervantes, Mr Méndez de Vigo said that we must choose between the inn and the road."
"I should also like to quote our immortal national author and say that the wizards may try to steal the adventure from us, but with courage and effort we will not let them."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with the Méndez de Vigo/Tsatsos report, the European Parliament has today sent an important political message to the Member States to ratify the Amsterdam Treaty."
"As Members of the European Parliament, we do so with increased self-confidence. For in the run-up to the treaty reform the European Parliament led the way for the discussions that followed as an engine for further integration."
"I am thinking here of my colleagues Mr Bourlanges, Mr Martin, Mrs Dury and Mrs Maij-Weggen."
"The European Parliament was able to play an important role in the discussions on treaty reform both with respect to the discussions themselves and in regard to public provision."
"Special thanks should go to our former President, Mr Klaus Hänsch, the incumbent President, Mr Gil-Robles Gil Delgado, and the Members Elisabeth Guigou and Elmar Brok."
"The European Parliament has come out the winner in the results of the treaty reform."
"75 % of the legislation will be codecided by us, and we will also elect the Commission President in future."
"In actual fact: Amsterdam, following the Single European Act and Maastricht, was an intergovernmental conference at which, once again, a difficult compromise between the various interests of nation states had to be reached."
"There is no doubt that it was only the change from Conservative to Labour government in Britain and France that made a social policy without opt-out and an employment chapter at all possible."
"If we consider the scale of what has been achieved, we can see already that it is quite considerable."
"First, with employment we have progressed via a chapter of our own to coordinating the policies of the Member States, to facilitating financially assisted incentive measures and to creating a committee on employment."
"Second, the agreement reached on social policy has been integrated into the treaty and improved."
"We now have a real chance to actively implement equality between the sexes."
"Third, where the environment is concerned, sustained development has been taken up as a treaty objective and the ecological goal for all Community policies implemented in the treaty."
"The same applies to improved provision in the area of health care."
"Fourth, home affairs and justice."
"We now have an express safeguard for the basic democratic and constitutional structures at Union level and a guarantee of basic rights, with assured legal protection through the European Court of Justice."
"We have begun to apply Community-wide procedures in the areas of asylum, immigration, control of external borders, status of non-EU citizens and customs collaboration."
"We are also seeing the procedures of intergovernmental cooperation moving towards those of the Community and thereby witnessing a more precise definition of duties and powers, particularly in the area of crime-fighting."
"I am thinking here of greater support for Europol."
"Fifth, foreign policy through the creation of an identifiable figure in the form of the Secretary-General of the Council, strengthening of the structures through the setting-up of an analysis and planning unit, and a new troika formula including the EU Commissioner."
"The funding must occur in accordance with general budget requirements in conjunction with our inter-institutional agreement."
"There are approaches to majority voting within the framework of the jointly approved strategies and, above all, the inclusion in the EU's responsibilities of the Petersburg agreement."
"That is one side of the coin."
"The other side is - let us be open about this - that a lot of the proposals were much too timid."
"In many areas, especially home affairs and justice, foreign and security policy, only slight progress has been made, and the three pillars have not been surmounted."
"The European Parliament has come out in favour of a tree as the symbol of a growing community and not for three rigid pillars."
"This also applies to the deficiencies where the coordination of economic policies is concerned, and to the fact that majority decisions involving equal representation on the part of the European Parliament have not been included in the legislative procedure in general."
"Above all, important institutional reforms are lacking in regard to the Council and Commission."
"We contend that this is not going to make today's European Union capable of enlargement."
"The European Parliament is generally critical of what has been achieved - and rightly so, for a whole series of our demands have not been realized!"
"Still, we should not get into the habit, neither internally nor publicly, particularly where questions of European integration are concerned, of only registering successes in silence while constantly carping on about the questions left open."
"That will not take us forward in Europe!"
"And I say to you that, in my judgement as a trade unionist too, the positive aspects outweigh the negative."
"That is why we can give our consent in Parliament."
"I also say this following the discussions with the national parliaments we have heard here."
"I also say this following the discussions we have held with the representatives of non-governmental organizations."
"For us there were only signs of approval."
"There were no signs that Parliament should reject this treaty outright."
"That means for me as spokesperson for the socialist group that we will be giving our political consent to it today in this House."
"I am very conscious of the heckling from colleagues among the Greens."
"I deeply regret that you want to vote against ratification."
"I recall that a number of you brought an action in the Federal Constitutional Court against the Maastricht Treaty, while others fought against your country joining the EU."
"It lacks credibility if you only welcome the European idea in its mature form and shirk responsibility on a central question and timidly vote no."
"The European Union today is on the threshold of making some of the most important decisions in its nigh-on fifty-year-old history of integration - treaty reform in 1997, entry negotiations in 1998, euro currency in 1999 and a new financial framework from the year 2000."
"To achieve this, we need the political vision for further institutional reforms to make the European Union work better following enlargement."
"That is why the reforms must take place before enlargement, but the reforms should not delay this process either."
"Not at all!"
"This is not an attempt to square the circle, but the situation should not be solved with the methods employed to date."
"Hence, it is important for the European Parliament to develop concepts now for the next steps towards integration."
"Thanks to my colleague Mrs van Putten, I had the opportunity to talk to journalists, officials and others at the Amsterdam Summit, in the Central Bank and on the fringe of the negotiations."
"I sometimes thought that if the citizens of Europe witnessed this type of negotiation, they would not understand Europe in future."
"We need to turn Europe into more of an open process, where controversy is debated, and help bring about greater involvement of those who have been elected for this purpose in their own countries, that is to both the national parliaments and the European Parliament, In this way the resolutions needed are not lost in a long night beset with internal problems or the institutional reforms do not fail on the pretext of those who wish to hold the new democracies in central and eastern Europe hostage for their national interests."
"Europe, that means its citizens."
"Their consent to the Community depends on the success of the Community's policies."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam has a host of advantages."
"The ruling of the European Court on women's equality is a great encouragement set against this background."
"The European Employment Summit needs practical success."
"It should not founder on the blockade of the German Federal Government."
"We all know that nationalism results from unresolved European problems."
"National problems can only be solved jointly, that is on a European scale."
"Hence we need to strengthen the European Union, and Amsterdam makes the European Union stronger!"
"Mr President, a French politician - now somewhat forgotten, although undeservedly so, because his healthy cynicism was so refreshing, President Henri Queuille - once said that politics is not about solving problems, but keeping those who raise problems quiet."
"I fear that the shade of Henri Queuille may have loomed unnecessarily large over the work of the Intergovernmental Conference and the European Council of Amsterdam. For you have enforced silence on those who raised problems - be they states, institutions or some sectors of opinion - by satisfying them on some points, by fobbing them off with words when they wanted concrete reality, by dangling long term goals before them when they needed instruments by which to act, anything so long as action was avoided, lulling minds in a general incantation."
"But solve problems you did not, and you know it."
"There were three problems that needed to be settled. first democratization, and on this point I grant you, progress has been made."
"Then deepening the Union, that is, the implementation of institutional measures giving strength and vigour to the policies proclaimed in Maastricht, but which had remained dead letters since."
"Here you merely shifted the same pieces about the board, you came out with more procedures, but changed nothing with regard to fundamentals."
"Finally, there was the 'massive' problem of enlargement, where I regret, Mr President of the Council, you are on record as saying that this was not the main purpose of the treaty."
"How can we get a European Union of more than 500 million inhabitants, how can we get a European Union of nearly 30 Member States, how can we get a European Union as heterogeneous in political, cultural, economic and administrative terms as the one we are on the way to constructing, how can we get this Union to operate?"
"Here you have nothing to say."
"You remain sterile."
"You have not settled the essential problem!"
"Some say that the work of Amsterdam was worthless."
"I do not think so."
"I find it is merely mediocre."
"Above all, I find that it is off the point. And as a teacher of literature, I say that any work which is off the point is unsatisfactory."
"This report proposes an approach which I broadly approve, at the stage where we now are. It can be summarized in three words."
"Protection of what we have achieved. As parliamentary soldiers, we have to build up our reserves, wherever we can lay our hands on them, in preparation for the campaigns that lie ahead, and that is the meaning behind the call for ratification."
"The second is criticism. Here we criticize the fact that we have fallen out of step in our joint march to enlargement and deepening of the Union through its institutions."
"The rapporteurs do not go far enough, although they are going in the right direction."
"Finally, proposal. This is where this report makes its major contribution, I believe."
"The diplomats have failed, it is now down to the citizens to take up the challenge, while respecting article N, I agree, but this provides for plenty of flexibility."
"This is the essential contribution of this report."
"Here, ladies and gentlemen, is why I approve the report, at this point in time today. But I do not for all that discharge the European Council of its responsibility."
"The Council has not kept its promises. Incidentally, we do not see how it can keep its promises any better tomorrow!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the coverage of the Amsterdam summit has been largely negative, and that impression has lingered."
"The new treaty is supposed to be a superfluous measure, or just a tiny step forward, and it would hardly matter if it was ratified or not."
"The negative impression, colleagues, has been caused in particular by the failure to reach an institutional agreement."
"Isn't it ironic that commentators and observers, who had up until then not attached any importance to the institutional issues, suddenly saw nothing else."
"It made the task of the rapporteurs difficult, but they have accomplished it in an exemplary way."
"A sober, yet correct analysis and evaluation of the treaty and a recommendation which, as Jean Racine put it, contains neither this excess of honour nor this indignity."
"Their detailed report, 269 points over 72 pages, contains an excellent analysis and evaluation of the treaty, and proves the need for ratification."
"I will support that call, as will the majority of my group."
"But it has been shown just as strongly that the entire institutionalization process has yet to start, and that it will have to happen quickly."
"Quickly, so as not to not slow down the enlargement."
"Because, Commissioner, colleagues, Mr President, this enlargement is the greatest challenge which this Union has faced during peace time."
"A weak Union would collapse under such a confrontation, it would not be able to cope with such a confrontation."
"It follows that enlargement and intensification of the Union are by no means mutually exclusive; on the contrary, they are complementary."
"I have noticed recently how a gap has been growing between those who think that those things are mutually exclusive."
"I can imagine that the gap is regarded with great satisfaction by all those who want neither intensification, nor enlargement."
"That is why, ladies and gentlemen, we must get to work immediately, to make clear that we want both enlargement and intensification."
"I am delighted that the rapporteurs suggest this is done together in conjunction with the national parliaments."
"I am somewhat proud that I have been able to make a small contribution to this during the previous parliamentary session."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, whether the ominous, much cited glass of water is half full or half empty can only be gauged by the thirst of the person looking at it."
"I can assure you, the thirst of the Heads of State and of Government for European democracy in Amsterdam was, God knows, very slight."
"The thirst for European democracy, for a basic social order in Europe, for ecological progress, must have been very slight to make the glass seem half full to many of them."
"I can at any rate assure one of the previous speakers, Mr Janssen van Raay, a glass of Mouton-Rothschild tastes different."
"What this House will resolve today about the Treaty of Amsterdam is legally of no consequence."
"Many people, quite rightly, are complaining about this."
"So, we can only offer the electorate one course which counts in politics as basic, namely the truth about the Amsterdam Treaty and the future state of the EU."
"That is the only opportunity, the only power and the only duty this House has."
"Yet what is the truth?"
"Is it the contention of the rapporteurs that the Amsterdam Treaty is a step towards the building up of Europe, or are we not closer to the truth if we open another report, a very discreetly treated one, a very secret one, conceived in this House too, the report from the Intergovernmental Conference working party to the President of the European Parliament?"
"This says that all in all, the new treaty only represents the measure of the national and even nationalistic electoral aspirations of its signatories without any forward-looking objectives. Do we not come closer to the truth when we follow this report further and it states that above all, the Amsterdam Treaty represents a strikingly clear failure compared with the original mandate of the Intergovernmental Conference and the three axes around which it was constructed, namely greater popular responsiveness on the part of the European Union, the reform of the institutions in a more democratic and efficient Union and the bolstering of the Union's capacity to act externally."
"It may be true that we have only the truth to offer the people of Europe today."
"That might not be much, but we should not make it anything less!"
"We should not owe that to the people as well!"
"For this truth will be the basis for whether we find a way out of the crisis in the Union."
"Either this House will find this way out or no-one will find it."
"That is the task facing this Parliament, and it should not withhold the truth to achieve this."
"It will not be able to cover up the failure of the national governments."
"As to the failure of Parliament, today's sitting will decide."
"Amsterdam has already decided on the failure of the national governments."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my fellow group member, Mr Saint-Pierre, has already outlined the reason why our group will not approve the report."
"Amsterdam was above all a vain attempt in the face of necessary institutional reforms."
"The Union continues only to have to dialogues with unitary Member States, even though they no longer have any legal powers in many areas."
"In Belgium, for example, only the federal states of Flanders and Walloon each for itself and separately have constitutional powers over culture, education, planning, the environment, scientific research, structural funds, transport, and so on."
"These federal states have become constitutionally independent with their own address, own house, own budget, own management."
"Yet the Union continues to send its invoices and minutes to the old address of their parents."
"A Union which cannot even keep up with a change of address is structurally hopelessly out of date."
"That is why Maastricht was a missed opportunity on this issue as well, and Europe is too dear to us to say yes to this report."
"Mr President, with the Amsterdam Treaty you and other Britons are getting a written constitution without democracy."
"Perhaps that is better than having a living democracy without a written constitution anyway."
"And the other 14 countries in the EU are getting a new constitution, a new basic law, this little bagatelle in fact, which will replace this little bagatelle, the Danish Constitution."
"To the extent that the Union constitution conflicts with the Danish Constitution, we know of course that it is Union law which takes priority."
"The Court of Justice made that up as a principle, and what is new about the Amsterdam Treaty is that it is written into the protocol on subsidiarity."
"There it is written that the relationship which the Court of Justice has developed between national legislation and Community legislation shall not be touched, and account must also be taken of the Treaty on European Union, which says that the Union shall provide itself with the means necessary to attain its objectives and carry through its policies."
"So this is not a principle of subsidiarity, but the opposite."
"It is the principle of the supremacy of Union law, even over national constitutions, which is now being written into the treaty itself for the first time. And that is why it is a new written constitution, which Great Britain is now getting for the first time in your lives and in the lives of other Britons."
"So, is the constitution we are getting a fine constitution?"
"No, it is not. It is not a fine constitution with fundamental rights inscribed in the first chapter and with provisions on institutions and democracy in the following chapters."
"It is a constitution which does include fundamental rights and social rights, but they are spread around the treaty."
"But the basic principle is that the fundamental rights of the Member States in the national constitutions are being exported, and with them the practice of the Commission on Human Rights and the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg and to the Union's authorities, which shall act in unison."
"As far as content is concerned this is a constitution, but as far as form is concerned it is a normal international agreement."
"I hope nevertheless that the Member States will treat it as a constitutional amendment and therefore give the voters the opportunity to have the final word."
"Mr President, the new treaty has not solved the difficult problem of the competence and duties of the Institutions."
"The small steps taken in the improvement in the structural requirements of the European democracy will never manage to make good the deficit we have reported for years which we have been fighting since the Treaty of Maastricht."
"The current institutional structure is no longer able to govern the unification process appropriately."
"The failure to execute the institutional reforms causes a fortiori a slowdown in the decisions on the expansion of the Union."
"I share the attitude held by France, Italy and Belgium, which emphasize the inadequacies of the treaty in the prospect of expansion and make new accessions conditional on institutional development."
"The opinion held by the Alleanza Nazionale for years is confirmed, in that, failing a reformed institutional framework, failing a political union, any new accession increases the state of operational and decision-making inadequacy of the European Union."
"The hierarchy of the rules is a problem the treaty leaves unresolved and is not bureaucratic but affects the nature of the Community acts closely."
"Who should decide in each individual case?"
"What competence can be transferred to the executive bodies?"
"Who supervises the delegated legislative business?"
"How can the legislative bodies exercise this essential function of control?"
"The protocol regulations include the social protocol that gives the Union's social policy a greater consistency and unity."
"The inclusion of the protocol is not yet a policy: the history of the Community is full of protocols, charters and declarations on social rights!"
"A real development in the social policy only took place during the period of economic development and the growth in production in our countries in the '60s and '70s, which means that, with no expansion of the economy and with no increase in the GDP, the social policy remains a protocol of good intentions."
"With regard to the foreign policy and policy on justice and domestic affairs, we are far from beginning a real political union, without which the Union will remain imbalanced in favour of the single currency, not resolving the problems of imbalance and disharmony of the unification process."
"Finally, the Treaty of Amsterdam has started down a road, taken a few short steps in the right direction, but the road is a long one, too long!"
"It does not come up to our expectations and does not convey any message of hope to the citizens, which we are sorry about."
"At the October sitting, during the debate on the state of the Union, we said that Amsterdam was a big disappointment; today we would like to add that it was a lost opportunity."
"We believe this Parliament should finally note that it should move in the direction of the strongest citizens, because otherwise the treaties will remain a dead letter and political union will remain a dream."
"Mr President, the new treaty has just been signed by the Union's Ministers of Foreign Affairs and is today undergoing its final examination by the European institutions."
"Up to now the treaty has lived in its creators' aseptic cocoon, its contents filtered through speeches by the specialists and diplomats who, for the last three years of often contradictory advances and retreats, have been trying to breathe new life into the old Maastricht Treaty."
"But on attaining its majority today the text of the Treaty of Amsterdam goes to each of the States of the Union to be subjected to the risks of debate and national public opinion and, subsequently and consequently, to acceptance or rejection by the citizens of Europe."
"The die is cast, therefore, as regards the fate of the treaty, from the moment of our vote today."
"We count ourselves among those who will wish it a prosperous future, and will, therefore, vote in favour of the opinion of the European Parliament; who hope it will be speedily ratified to make it possible to set up a stabilized institutional framework, with clear and enduring rules, to face other challenges confronting the Europe of the Fifteen."
"From our point of view there must always be a balance between stability and reform."
"We must constantly assess where the priority lies according to Europe's historical interests."
"In our view this is a time for stability."
"To rush into amending a treaty which has not yet reached adulthood might be tantamount to throwing out the baby with the bathwater."
"It is therefore more important to be calm than to agonize over it."
"It is more important to publicize and immediately ratify an amended treaty than to amend it again."
"Mr President, there is a saying in my country that cats in a hurry give birth blind kittens."
"Let us not be blind."
"So before revising the treaty, before revising what has already been revised, we must first win the argument."
"Mr President, the Treaty of Amsterdam has been received with little enthusiasm by the public."
"What should have been a thorough renovation of the European Union's house, has resulted in a little wall here, a shed there, and a nice dormer window."
"Achievable adjustments have been implemented, but the necessary conversion, necessary, too, for enlargement and to keep the Union workable, did not take place."
"What should the European Parliament advise national parliaments on their duty to either ratify or not ratify this treaty?"
"In itself it is very positive that the national parliaments, or at least some of them, have asked for our opinion, and do not want to proceed to approval before they know this opinion."
"That, incidentally, shows that the relationship between the national parliaments and the European Parliament is much better than many people think, and that is a good thing, because we have many common interests."
"The cooperation between the national parliaments and the European Parliament will increase, and become increasingly necessary to improve the democratic calibre of the Union."
"I am pleased to say that on that front we have reason to be somewhat satisfied. Because precisely as far as the participation of the European Parliament in deciding legislation important leaps forward have been made."
"We owe this partly to our colleague Mr Brok and our former colleague Mrs Guigou."
"In fact we can say now that 80 % of European legislation is now subject to participatory procedures, and that is a substantial improvement."
"At the same time it is regrettable that this democratization was not implemented for agricultural budgeting and agricultural legislation, but it is sensible to say yes to this treaty, merely for the sake of that step forward, because there is more democracy."
"That way at least the small amount that was achieved in Amsterdam is landed."
"Otherwise we cannot always be satisfied, unfortunately."
"An achievement has been made with regard to the rights of citizens."
"The anti-discrimination article has deservedly been mentioned several times."
"A small step forward has also been made regards the transparency of institutions, because the Council minutes will be made public in the future."
"And in the social sphere a step forward has been made, but we will have to see at the employment summit this weekend whether the content will prove to be positive or not."
"Sadly far too little has been achieved in the area of internal security and in foreign and international security policy."
"The large gap is institutional."
"Everyone recognizes that."
"That is the reason why the excellent report by Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Tsatsos recommends us to make a takeover in that area, too, that is to say, to organize another round to ensure that there will be solutions in that area, before new entries are discussed."
"That is a sound proposal."
"And it should not be attempted in the usual way, through the IGC, in the usual European way through proposals from the European Commission, through advice from Parliament, and on that basis there will be a result."
"Until then enlargement cannot really justified."
"The European Union will become a mess if we implement the enlargement before these institutional problems have been solved."
"In that respect we can say yes to the treaty, but we must hope that at a later stage the steps will be taken which should have already been taken in Amsterdam."
"Mr President, in the spring of next year there will be a referendum in Ireland to decide whether or not to ratify the Amsterdam Treaty."
"During the course of the debate leading up to the referendum vote together with my colleagues in the Fianna Fáil political party, I will be campaigning enthusiastically for a strong 'yes' vote."
"I hope that the Irish people will once again give a strong endorsement for my country's continued participation in the European Union as they have done on each of the three previous occasions when a European referendum has been held in Ireland."
"I had expected that the Members of the European Parliament would be given an opportunity to cast a vote on the changes to the treaty being introduced following the Amsterdam Summit."
"If this had been the case, I would have voted in favour of endorsing the new treaty."
"I very much regret that Parliament is not being asked to vote directly on the contents of the treaty but instead, is being asked to consider the merits of a lengthy opinion from the Committee on Institutional Affairs."
"The document tabled by the Committee on Institutional Affairs should have confined itself to a simple recommendation to vote for or against the Amsterdam Treaty."
"I hope that when a similar situation arises following the next intergovernmental conference, our procedures are changed to facilitate such a vote."
"The Committee on Institutional Affairs' report contains many elements with which I am in total agreement."
"However, it also contains comments with which I profoundly disagree."
"It is not necessary, for example, for this text to complain about the policies which are not in the new treaty."
"There is no need to reopen the argument concerning the membership of the Commission."
"This issue was discussed at length prior to the Amsterdam Summit and, in my view, the correct position was taken by the Heads of State and of Government to maintain the present practice whereby each country has the right to nominate a Commissioner."
"Secondly, the Heads of State and of Government took the view in Amsterdam that there was no compelling case to involve Parliament in the administration of the common agricultural policy."
"The present system whereby the Commission operates the CAP on a day-to-day basis subject to the overall supervision of the Council of Ministers has been satisfactory and should be maintained."
"The Heads of State and of Government also took the view that there was no compelling necessity to have a common defence policy at this time and did not include it in this version of the treaty, a decision which I fully endorse."
"I fail to see the need to reopen this debate in the context of this report."
"For this reason and for the reasons I have already referred to, I propose to abstain on the final vote on this report while at the same time, firmly recording my support for the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Votes"
"Mr President, as I pointed out to your services and while I understand the reasons that inspired the authors of the amendment, I nevertheless believe that the reference to a protocol which is now somewhat 'old' , if I may say so, is not necessary at this stage."
"I will therefore ask you to proceed to a separate vote, the first part of the amendment being word for word identical to the text of the Rules Committee."
"I will ask this House, and I will leave it free in its wisdom, to decide to also vote through the second part."
"(Parliament adopted the decision)"
"Mr President, Mr Pimenta was the author of this resolution in the Environment Committee."
"He has to be in Lisbon today because of ill health in his family and I ask your permission and that of Parliament to introduce a four word oral amendment to clarify the meaning of paragraph 2 in order that we can maximize Parliament's support for the Union's position in Kyoto."
"I want to insert the words 'after the Kyoto conference' following the opening phrase which says 'Calls on the European Union' to convert the Commission's recent communication into a binding commitment in order to give substance to our commitment."
"It was not Mr Pimenta's intention in drafting this, or that of the Environment Committee, to bind the Commission's negotiating hands in Kyoto."
"By adding that phrase 'after the Kyoto conference' we make that clear and I hope the House will then be able to support the revised text."
"(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, as you well know there is an unfortunate tendency on the continent to mix up England and Britain, something which you and I feel is an important distinction."
"Unfortunately the services have made a mistake in Amendment No 41: the word 'anglaise' in the original French text has been translated into 'British' ."
"This is highly regrettable."
"I should like this to be recorded."
"We will ensure that all the language versions are correct and these important distinctions are adhered to."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that Amendment No 45, which we introduced, should read in the second part of the German version: ' advocates maintaining a cohesion fund' and not, as was incorrectly translated, ' demands for its part the maintenance of a cohesion fund' ."
"It is a very important point that the words are reproduced exactly as I uttered them, or else there are likely to be problems."
"The discussion in the groups and in the Committee was very intense."
"It is important to have the same, correct version in all languages."
"Mr President, to avoid all doubt, I would call for the Spanish version, which is the version negotiated, to apply."
"I can read it out if you wish, since it is very short: ""Notes that the Commission proposes that the cohesion fund be maintained in its present form; is in favour of maintaining a cohesion fund' ."
"Mr President, I would like to point out that at this point the first part of the original text should be taken, and this reads: ' advocates maintaining a cohesion fund' ."
"This is the common text which was discussed by everyone."
"Now the translation of what my colleague Mr Izquierdo Collado said into German was still such that there could have been some ambiguity."
"I insist that this wording 'advocates maintaining a cohesion fund' is correct in the second part."
"I understand that this is important but we cannot hold a linguistic discussion at this point."
"I have checked and discovered that the original version was in English."
"We shall therefore as is the usual practice ensure that all languages correspond to the English version."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, I wanted to make a point of order because I wish to congratulate you on your patience on taking us through this vote."
"However, I have to say that in committee we had 275 amendments to this report and we managed to bring it through with virtually no amendments."
"I am disappointed with the I-EDN Group which chose to table amendments and ask for split votes, thus taking up valuable time in this House."
"It would suit them better if they attended committee and put their energy and effort into committee work instead of taking up your time."
"After long negotiations, the Conciliation Committee has finally reached an agreement relating to the internal market for postal services."
"We need to guarantee a universal postal service and, within the necessary framework of the liberalization of this market, determine which services should be reserved to universal service providers, and which should be the unreserved fields, open to competition."
"European quality standards will be fixed in the interests of the consumer."
"Public service must absolutely be guaranteed, even in an open market."
"Some domains are reserved to public service: letters and packages of a certain weight, as well as letters which are registered or have declared values."
"Furthermore, this protection forces public service providers to comply with certain quality standards, that is, ' access points' (letter boxes) in sufficient number, reasonable frequency in the collection and distribution of mail, continuity of service, and pricing to allow the use of postal services by all."
"Out of concern for transparency, the directive will force postal companies to operate their accounts in such a way that they separate accounts for reserved services from accounts in services open to competition."
"The decision for liberalization in direct mail services and cross-border mail has been deferred to 1 January 2000, when the Council and Parliament will have to decide on whether to pursue liberalization in this sector."
"Finally, the directive has struck a just balance between the all-out liberalization practised in certain parts of the world, and our perception of public service."
"The new provisions should guarantee consumers better quality services and more competitive tariffs, without calling into question the universal service and the public administrations which provide for it."
"Seen from this point of view, the compromise of the Conciliation Committee is an acceptable draft which will still need to be transposed into national regulations, without adversely affecting the structures that have proven their worth in Luxembourg."
"In my opinion a deregulation of postal services should not be a subject of debate at all."
"Postal services in society are based on public service."
"The Post Office should reach everyone everywhere."
"People living in cities should help to subsidize postal services in sparsely populated areas."
"If this is opened up to profit-driven companies in the area of postal services, it will only lead to the profitable activities being hived off."
"The profits will then go to the private companies instead of helping to subsidize the socially beneficial services."
"It is with regret that I am forced to make a decision on this report today."
"However, I know that the rapporteur has done everything in his power to soften the negative effects of this proposal as far as possible."
"My group objects strongly to the procedure being followed at present."
"It may be that Council and Parliament, as institutions, have reached a high level of agreement. It is, however, known to all those concerned that this agreement was not reached without a fight."
"First of all the Commission submitted a proposal that anticipated far more liberalization than was present in the text which is we are now waiting to vote upon."
"After ten long years of resistance from national monopolies in numerous Member States the Commission has given up the fight and thus forsaken its duty as implementer of Treaties, and as defender of a free internal market."
"This resistance on the part of Member States has arisen from considerations of two kinds:"
"as long as there is a monopoly, there is no need to take account of inefficiency and postal services can thus be used for all sorts of improper purposes such as giving away public jobs and bestowing political reward; -in a few Member States which have to wrestle with depopulation in rural areas, maintaining post offices is seen as a social service, which provides a number of essential services to an aging and decreasing population cheaply, which would otherwise have to be taken care of by an socio-administrative public service."
"However, these Member States overlook the fact that for example in Sweden and Finland maintaining both essential services and privatization of the postal services go hand in hand perfectly well."
"However, this should not happen at the expense of tariffs which might be seen as a subsidy given by densely populated areas to thinly populated areas.Both Council and Parliament also overlook the established fact that, whatever they protect in reserved sectors, competition will raise its head anyway."
"Not only will delivery services, which are able to operate more cheaply than the top heavy postal services, increasingly be able to find ways to by-pass the monopolies, and not only will business customers make increasing use of this, but it is also absolutely certain that the liberalized telecommunication services such as fax and Internet will replace the traditional post, also for the private user."
"Businesses who of necessity have to make use of physical delivery services, such as direct mail and mail order companies, will soon reach the point where they will take care of such services themselves, or make use of the services of others."
"For the liberal group the most unpalatable aspect continues to be the embargo on cross-border postal services other than those provided by official postal services, and this against prices which could be described as extortionate."
"This means that the principle of the free internal market is violated in such a way, that this point alone might be considered a reason for our voting against."
"That not one of the Member States has not regarded this as a reason for voting against may be regarded as a sign of the birth of the integration ideal of Europe."
"Everyone from the political groups and institutions knew that the liberal group had these objections."
"I myself have stated this explicitly and in front of the entire conciliation delegation under the Presidency of Mrs Fontaine."
"We should have at least been given the opportunity to announce this at a public meeting."
"All we can do now, is to do this in an explanation of the motive behind our vote, and to make clear that the Council and Parliament are not as united as the larger groups and the large Member States would like to make us believe."
"Fontaine report (A4-0337/97)"
"Once again, the European Parliament has demonstrated its inability to understand the problems of the smaller countries."
"At the first reading, Mr Fayot and myself took the liberty of proposing an amendment stating the concerns of the Luxembourg legal environment with regard to the formalities required for the registration with the competent authority of a foreign advocate."
"This amendment was rejected, and I continue to deplore this."
"I am nevertheless convinced that any regime for free circulation of advocates must be defined in a manner such as will guarantee that consumers have protection in all circumstances, meaning by this that the consumer can be sure of obtaining legal assistance from an advocate with qualifications in the law of the Member State concerned."
"However, this objective cannot be met if a Member State has no right to check the knowledge of advocates in the national law."
"I would like to yet again raise the fact that the vote on the Fontaine Report will not in any way change the rather more than special situation of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, which is at the crossing point of several legal systems."
"Hence, the constitutional and administrative law is essentially of Belgian inspiration, whereas civil and commercial law are influenced by France and Belgium."
"Tax law originates in German tax law, and the decisions both of the government administration and the courts are made with reference to German jurisprudence."
"Another difficulty resides in the fact that the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is a trilingual country."
"However, the language problem is an essential one for any advocate who works professionally in the Grand Duchy."
"It must also be noted that very many residents of Community countries who are qualified in foreign laws are currently registered with the Luxembourg legal authorities' training course, and successfully meet the requirements of the end-of-training examinations."
"Having said that, I believe that the current system enables advocates of European citizens to offer their services and to set up in Luxembourg without difficulty, while ensuring that they are sufficiently qualified to give advice on Luxembourg law."
"Luxembourg citizens do not understand why this situation should be changed by a directive, and this is the reason why I shall vote against the new report."
"I nevertheless acknowledge that Mrs Fontaine has gone to much trouble to understand the Luxembourg problem, and for this reason I would like to thank her at all events."
"I wish on the one hand to congratulate Nicole Fontaine for the excellent work that she has carried out on the subject of this proposed directive, examined under the codecision procedure."
"On the other hand, there is reason to congratulate ourselves on there being a common position, which was precisely the wish of our parliament in the first reading."
"Indeed, the amendments made by the Council of Ministers do not go back on the spirit that the European Parliament wished to give to the directive, and that is the reason why I voted in the favour of the decision approving the common position."
"The examination of this text by the European Commission, the Council, and the Parliament shows that the three institutions can, with calm deliberation, implement the principles of negotiation, which prevail in community legislative procedures, and end up with a highly satisfactory result."
"I am all the more pleased with this good result, as the draft is of major importance, insofar as it contributes to the effective introduction of the European Union, and more particularly, to a concretization of the principles of free circulation and freedom of establishment."
"Dell'Alba report (A4-0345/97)"
"I voted yes to the report."
"There are great opportunities to coordinate the European project through increased cooperation between the EU and the Council of Europe, especially the two bodies' parliamentary assemblies and their committees and delegations."
"This could lead to a more firmly based European cooperation and reduce unnecessary duplication."
"A wider study should be carried out jointly between the two European institutions on how this cooperation should be deepened."
"Jöns report (A4-0352/97)"
"With this explanation of vote we would like to emphasize the fact that in the final vote we supported the report."
"After the inability of the Member States to produce a directive for many years, the agreement which has been negotiated between the ETUC, CEEP and UNICE is of great importance for millions of workers in the European Union."
"It is therefore vital that the European Parliament supports the agreement in its opinion."
"We also believe there is cause to reiterate, as the report does, Parliament's request to the Commission that it should ensure that a directive is put forward for other atypical work."
"There are, however, a number of paragraphs in the report with which we cannot agree."
"Among other things we believe the report contains criticisms which cannot be regarded as entirely factually accurate. For example, the criticisms made in paragraphs D, H, 4 and 6."
"These mainly concern criticisms directed against the agreement on the question of failings in establishing minimum rules and failings in the scope of the agreement and on the question of what can be regarded as objective criteria."
"We also think that the criticism of articles 3 and 4 in the agreement on social policy, as it is presented in paragraphs 12 and 16, is unwarranted."
"We believe, on the contrary, that the role of European partners in drawing up rules for the labour market are of great significance for the development of a European social model."
"We are also sceptical in principle about the idea that the parties in the labour market should be liable to report to the Commission, as stated in paragraph 21, in an area which falls under EU law."
"Finally, we consider it inappropriate to do as paragraph 22 does and propose changes to the text of the framework agreement itself."
"It is particularly inappropriate because the report sets out with the ambition of trying to make its own interpretations of what could be described as objective criteria and to define who is a part-time worker."
"In spite of these objections, there was never any doubt that we would support the report in the final vote."
"The Danish Social Democrats are voting against the report by Mrs Jöns, in spite of the fact that it contains a lot of good elements."
"It is important that the European Parliament presses for corresponding agreements to be made for employees in other types of atypical employment."
"And it is good that attention is being drawn to the areas where the agreement could have been better."
"But social dialogue is a precondition for creating a more humane and just society and a European Union with a more human face."
"The agreement on part-time work is an important step forward for the establishment of a social dialogue at the European level."
"To try to restrict it at its tender birth could have catastrophic results."
"It is therefore regrettable that the Commission in its legislative proposal has set the stage for interference in the agreement."
"We should instead allow the agreement to remain in force without changing it, out of respect for the social partners' negotiations."
"We are also concerned about the wording of paragraphs 17 and 19 of the report."
"We do not believe there is cause for concern about the way in which the social protocol has been written into the Amsterdam Treaty."
"And there is, in our opinion, no immediate need to expand the circle of social partners beyond those who are already involved in the social dialogue."
"24 million people are employed part time in the European Union. Women, young people and the least qualified are those most affected."
"The rise in the number of those working part time is especially marked in certain countries, such as the Netherlands and Great Britain, where part time work accounts for 25 % of the whole."
"Too often, part time working is enforced by companies and not chosen by employees."
"The framework agreement between the European social partners has set out as its first objective the recognition of the principle of non-discrimination between part time and full time workers."
"This should contribute to improving the conditions of employment of part time workers and give them better conditions of service."
"But there are too many shortfalls and grey areas, particularly with the absence of provisions relating to equality of treatment in the field of social protection."
"This lack of clarity leaves the door open to differences in interpretation and, above all, the possibility of too many derogations for ill or undefined 'objective reasons' ."
"I am delighted that the report of the Committee on Social Affairs has also deplored these discriminatory derogations."
"The framework agreement appears unbalanced."
"While it provides some assured conditions of service, albeit limited and subject to derogation, to part time workers, it encourages flexibility in working hours in the context of the development of part time working."
"From this point of view, it is part of the approach of the Commission in the run-up to the European Council of Luxemburg on employment."
"Our group is opposed to this approach, which aims at greater labour market flexibility in a manner which exclusively favours the interests of companies."
"To develop employment and improve the conditions of life and work of the employees, our group proposes that the reduction of working hours be one of the central themes of the European Summit on employment, and so give European employees the strong signal that they expect."
"A decision on 21 November in Luxembourg to open up the prospects of reduction in working hours could also mark a new start in building Europe and a move towards a Europe of progress, peace and security, which would make social progress and employment the motors of a new form of development."
"The outline agreement signed by our social partners subscribes to some of the objectives to which our group attributes great importance."
"The struggle against the discrimination which afflicts part-time workers, who are victims twice over, furthermore, because they arrive in that situation by way of a process that penalizes them, the improvement of their working conditions, and the placing of emphasis on the voluntary sector as a basis for the development of this type of work - these are indeed objectives for which we are all genuinely fighting."
"We must however express our regret, as we did in the amendment we submitted, that the principle of nondiscrimination against part-time workers is subject to general exceptions in the agreement, and those exceptions leave the way open for the principle to be disregarded."
"Furthermore, we cannot accept the underlying philosophy represented by the enshrinement of the so-called flexible organization of time which, in reality, means that job security becomes precarious and there is a real tendency to treat the workforce as merchandise."
"Even those aspects of the agreement that can be considered positive do not extend to other forms of work which until recently were considered unorthodox."
"It will be said, as the Jöns report claims, that the outline agreement is a first step towards the creation of a range of legal measures which will gradually eliminate existing forms of discrimination."
"It would be nice to think this is true, but the agreement is so timid and hesitant that there is a risk that it will be accepted as such - as a first step - and that the illusion will be created that we are on the right road when we are actually going against the interests of workers."
"These are the reasons for all our reservations why we are voting as we are."
"I am backing adoption of this agreement as reached between employers and trade unions in June this year."
"Countering discrimination at work faced by part-timers, improving their working conditions as well as the promotion of part-time work and flexible hours as useful options for many people are all things which we can enthusiastically support."
"I accept that the rapporteur may feel that the agreement could cover other types of work and even social security systems."
"However, speaking as a British Labour Member, I feel that we should back agreements reached by the two sides of industry wherever possible."
"Agreements reached by those who will carry them out might well be better able to last and evolve than anything we as politicians could devise on their behalf."
"Of course we can have our say in these policy areas in future."
"But we should support the social partners in their gradual development of policies which can benefit our fellow citizens at their places of work."
"I for one do so with enthusiasm rather than reluctance."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last July, our Assembly adopted a resolution on the reinforcement of the Community strategy for improved air safety."
"The text on which we are today to give our opinion is part of this set of measures."
"By analogy, the Committee on Transport and Tourist is asking for the application to the air transport sector of what is being done in the maritime sector."
"We are requesting that third world countries respect the safety standards of the Chicago Convention and the rules of the International Civil Aviation Organization."
"The European Union must have a strict position in this."
"We know that many aircraft do not respect elementary safety rules."
"Proof of this is the 'airports of convenience' which are being developed in order to circumvent obligations."
"This we cannot accept, as nobody can play around with personal safety."
"Finally, we also know that some countries, particularly the least wealthy, will be adversely affected by this safety code."
"We will therefore have to devise means of cooperation with these countries, through technical assistance."
"Knowing the difficulty of a technical report of this kind, I would like to congratulate our colleague Mr Gonzalez Triviño on his serious work."
"I am a supporter of the conclusions and the features of this directive, which deals with the safety of non-Community aircraft."
"Like the rapporteur, I believe that henceforward, we must concentrate more on the airlines than on the airport authorities."
"I support the key undertakings of this directive, and I appreciate its determination to impose enforceable measures on operators, who on occasion use aircraft flying in hazardous safety conditions."
"I support the amendments of the initial draft, whose purpose is to make public information on grounded aircraft."
"This desire for transparency is praiseworthy and necessary. It must be imposed on all and in all fields."
"More transparency will contribute to giving citizens more confidence in those who take decisions."
"The report of 1 March 1996 by aviation experts from the Union shows that increasing numbers of countries are shirking their obligations to implement and uphold international safety standards. This objectionable omission, which has already cost large numbers of human lives, must be challenged actively."
"In order to protect the safety of their own citizens the European countries must be careful when entering into aviation agreements with third world countries."
"It would be advisable if they adopted the policy of USA, which only enters aviation agreements once the authorities in the countries concerned are able to guarantee the safety of the air fleet."
"Aviation competition in Europe tempts the Member States into adopting a flexible attitude towards unreliable airlines from third world countries."
"We therefore agreed with the SAFA procedure, as suggested by the Commission."
"When a breach of the safety regulations is suspected to have taken place, aeroplanes from third world countries should be checked within the Union, and if necessary, should be grounded."
"That way the Commission will be able to prevent policy competition at the expense of safety."
"It is desirable that a Member State proceeds to platform inspection when there are serious complaints or when there is legitimate suspicion on safety grounds."
"Considering the above we supported the amendments to the González Triviño."
"We regard in particular Amendment No 12, which would like to see the publication of the details of grounded aeroplanes, as a good addition to the proposal of the Commission."
"Citizens need to be able to know which airlines are not totally safe."
"Junker report (A4-0318/97)"
"I have voted yes to the report because it is important for decisions in an EU context to be based on a perspective of the role of the sexes and equal opportunity."
"The Committee's addition about an EU control group with national representatives at a high level to integrate questions of gender into development work are good."
"However, the setting up of a number of well-paid expert services at the Commission's DirectorateGeneral and other authorities must be rejected."
"The Commission's proposal should be received positively."
"It has the right objective - to integrate gender issues as an important factor in development cooperation."
"But implementation, turning it into reality, is another thing."
"And not a lot has happened on that point."
"Mrs Junker talks about equal rights."
"I would instead like to argue for a form of 'positive discrimination' for women."
"The western way of thinking about equality between men and women does not hold up when you are talking about developing countries, especially not where Africa is concerned."
"We must accept that, unlike in Europe, people are not people first and men or women after."
"In developing countries it is often the other way round, and we cannot change that."
"We must consciously make a distinction and tailor the help directly for women, because that it where it does the most good."
"For example, everyday life for most African women is a life on the land, often without a husband, who is perhaps dead or working somewhere else. And it is far from certain that a woman will see anything of her husband's money."
"It is her responsibility alone to get everyday life at home to work."
"She tills the soil, fetches water, cooks food and has need of money for the children's schooling, medicines, tea, sugar, bus fares and shoes for the older children."
"But, unfortunately, help from the EU often benefits the men, not the women, where it would do most good."
"We must instead support women directly through the allocation of land, loans, better equipment and technology."
"Women should be included in all aspects of development cooperation and in all EU policies which have to do with developing countries."
"It is not enough to have individual success projects. The involvement should be a constant feature in all stages."
"The Commission's general mainstreaming approach could be part of this strategy, if the principle is carried out in practice and does not remain empty words."
"Help for the Third World will simply be wrongly organized and not benefit the right people if we do not give weight to women in the development cooperation."
"In evaluating development assistance we should also use genderclassified statistics throughout."
"Without such statistics we cannot measure the effect on men and women respectively."
"You have to doubt how serious the EU is about gender politics."
"We saw that in the Green Paper on Lomé, but also in other agreements."
"Nor is any priority given to staff in the area."
"At the moment there is one person in DG IB and two people in DG VII, of which one is an expert on temporary loan."
"The staff should be permanent employees at a high level to have clout."
"The gender issue should be involved everywhere in development cooperation. Only in that way can the aid be effective."
"The gender issue must become part of development."
"In many countries it is women, after all, who not only keep the economy running, but who also support society."
"If our development policy is to be in the slightest bit effective, then it is important that women benefit fully from it."
"Unfortunately that is not all that these days."
"After all, men control the political and international, bilateral and multicultural agenda in the south, too."
"In itself the proposal of the Commission contains useful suggestions, which chiefly amount to capacity-building for women."
"Key words are thus advice, methodology, procedures, guidelines, training, etc."
"I would like to emphasize that these are all useful proposals. But they are by no means sufficient."
"In addition money absolutely must be allocated to support concrete women's projects."
"That at least will achieve something!"
"It will definitely help to engage women more in the decision-making process, because they will start feeling stronger once their socio-economic position improves."
"Fortunately Mrs Junker argued for the same thing."
"This is expressed in the amendments."
"My group will vote wholeheartedly in favour of this report and hopes that the Commission will implement these amendments."
"Gutiérrez Díaz report (A4-0317/97)"
"I hope that not only British, Northern Irish and Irish Members but our colleagues from across the EU will be happy to support this report."
"Although the EU is already the largest contributor to this fund, I share the rapporteur's desire to ensure that the money provided from it is additional to, and not a substitute for, other public or private funding."
"Of course it is also right to ask that this money be coordinated with that already committed to Ireland and Northern Ireland by the EU's structural policies."
"The EU was originally founded on the basis that by living and working in peace alongside each other, old enemies across this continent could secure a prosperous and safe future for future generations."
"At this time the cross-party talks process inside Northern Ireland is at a crucial early stage."
"This practical gesture from the EU to continue its funding support for economic and social development inside Northern Ireland and in its relations with the Republic is welcome news."
"My colleague John Hume has spoken eloquently in the past of the example this city of Strasbourg has set as a place of reconciliation between old enemies."
"The jobs and projects helped by this fund build bridges between the old enemies of Ireland."
"Let us remember the victims of all sides by building a 'bridge for the living' . To quote Philip Larkin, a British poet."
"Linkohr report (A4-0343/97) and Kyoto conference"
"Mr President, I did not vote for the Linkohr report."
"It is not certain to me that climate change in the form of global warming is taking place, and even less clear is the part played by human activity or specifically by carbon dioxide."
"Parliament should be wary of trying to solve something that may not exist."
"Precautions can only be taken successfully against a known problem."
"If, however, carbon dioxide is a threat to the world, then the Green position has logic on its side: an end to the use of all fossil fuels, oil, gas and coal."
"However, last year the world consumed more coal, more oil and more gas than in 1995, and by significant amounts, and not only in developing countries."
"My concerns are to reduce atmospheric pollutants which are life-threatening - CO2 is not - and to place maximum emphasis on energy efficiency."
"Finally, we should remember the two billion people, 40 % of the world's population, who have no access to any commercial energy supply whatsoever."
"For them climate change is not a priority."
"The report from our colleague Rolf Linkohr is at once determined, comprehensive, serious and of high quality."
"I would like to congratulate him."
"The Parliament has, on many occasions, had laid before it problems relating to the environment in general and to gaseous emissions contributing to the greenhouse effect in particular."
"This is a major problem both for today and over the next few years."
"Not long ago, we voted in a resolution whose aim was to reinforce mechanisms of surveillance over CO2 and other gases."
"Not all are pleased about this, and some may even be of the opinion that we do far too much in this field."
"For my part, I believe that we should ceaselessly work to preserve our environment and the quality of our air."
"In the strict sense of the term, this is a vital question."
"I support Rolf Linkohr in his determination at the Kyoto conference to forge an ambitious position for the European Union, particularly as he is doing so with a keen sense of his responsibilities with regard to the economy and to employment."
"As this date draws closer, I am astonished at the lack of enthusiasm by some countries for ratifying vital and minimum commitments."
"These same countries are much more prompt when it comes to imposing their own visions, whenever unbridled liberalization bears down on individuals with all the weight of the sacrosanct law of profitability."
"Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we do have to envisage measures of constraint, to enable the effective putting into practice of actions to achieve our proclaimed targets."
"We should not forget that in this field, most unfortunately, the question is not how to improve the current situation, but to avoid it becoming too very much worse."
"We are all beginning to suffer the consequences of climate change."
"Even the most reluctant can no longer deny the scientific and factual evidence of this alarming fact, which was announced years ago."
"Emissions of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, have increased by 3.4 % in the United States, but this does not deter the Clinton Administration's incomprehensible attitude towards the conference or the disappointing cuts announced by Japan."
"The EU delegation is going to the conference with a positive approach and the mandate of the Fifteen to seek the inclusion in the new protocol of the target of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases by 15 % by 2010 compared with 1990, with a reduction of 7.5 % by 2005."
"The Union must ensure that these objectives and this timetable, as well as the future strategies, are binding for everyone."
"We are agreed that a failure at Kyoto would have such dramatic consequences that the industrialized countries' sense of moral responsibility must prevail at the conference."
"The climate conference in Kyoto should be a starting point for being able to limit world emissions of greenhouse gases."
"Unfortunately, both the USA and Japan have a very intractable position when it comes to getting to grips with the problem."
"The EU's position is in the right direction, but in my opinion it does not go far enough."
"I do not share Commissioner Bjerregaard's and Council representative Lahure's view that, in order to really be able to do something about the problem, the EU should not take a lead and introduce binding commitments unless other industrialized countries also do so."
"Comprehensive measures are needed in the areas of energy, agricultural and transport policy."
"I think it would be better for us to take these measures now rather than wait until it is too late."
"We have to adapt to the limitations of nature to a much greater degree than today."
"Comprehensive measures will also give companies in EU countries a competitive advantage against those of other countries if in order to reduce emissions they develop new technology which can be sold to other countries."
"The EU's demands are in fact on the low side, but they are nonethe-less far more realistic than those of the USA and Japan."
"I voted yes in the final vote, but no to the amendment on support for nuclear power."
"Mr Linkohr deserves praise for his report on the energy dimension of climatic change."
"It is good to learn that anthropogenic climatic change is being taken seriously and that the horrific scenarios which are put forward by scientists about the climatological effect of greenhouse gases on the world are not being ignored."
"A sensible energy policy should aim to change behaviour at all stages in which greenhouse gases are produced."
"Many of the greenhouse gases which alter the climate come from large industrial plants which can easily be regulated and which can easily be inspected."
"Centrally-directed solutions are in order here."
"Mr Linkohr's report gives many excellent examples of that."
"However, we have to be aware that there are also very large emissions of greenhouse gases from domestic animals, traffic and other small producers which are difficult to control."
"You can of course counter this to a certain extent with increased controls and by making administrable demands on the local authorities and the supply businesses which are in direct contact with the citizens."
"But we must go even further."
"If we really want to solve the problem of emissions which are difficult to control, we must use financial incentives."
"It should be financially beneficial for individual households or farmers to save, and it should be financially beneficial to convert to using sustainable energy in households, trade and industry."
"However, I am very unhappy with the energy priority which the rapporteur is proposing as a solution to anthropogenic climatic change."
"It is proposed that you can let nuclear power replace existing CO2-contaminating power stations, because nuclear power is one of the cleanest sources of energy which does not emit greenhouse gases."
"I do not agree with that."
"Technical advances in recent years have greatly improved the efficiency of sustainable sources of energy, and instead of supporting and giving so much money to the European nuclear power industry, as the Community notoriously does, we should reinforce efforts to promote sustainable sources of energy."
"Nuclear power might be cheap, but the low price should not be a reason for us to forget to think on new lines."
"The many nuclear power installations also represent major safety problems for our environment, and it is true that the management of uranium mines in Canada, Mexico and Africa is far too poor."
"The uranium mines are often left in an unprotected condition and are a great danger to the surrounding environment."
"It is in the areas where there are uranium mines that the indigenous peoples live who are entirely dependent on nature."
"They no longer dare to eat game which has been deformed by pollution, and they are themselves exposed to radiation which is making the death rate from cancer, among other things, alarmingly high."
"In addition there are the problems connected with the disposal of spent reactor waste."
"There are still no sensible methods of storing the spent waste."
"Nor can I support the rapporteur's proposal to introduce an energy tax at the EU level."
"I am an opponent of allowing the countries which wish to go forward to be held back by the less progressive countries simply because there should be joint solutions."
"Tax policy should not be made an EU concern."
"It would be unfortunate, for example, if Danish energy taxes were harmonized 'down' to, for example, the Belgian level."
"What we need is a system in which the minimum rules are constantly raised and requirements are toughened for all Member States."
"BSE"
"Mr President, while welcoming the debate yesterday on BSE and the subsequent resolution, this House should not forget the human price of past negligence."
"Twenty-one people have died of the new variant of CJD, the human form of BSE, in Britain since 1995."
"Last Friday I met the parents and boyfriend of one of the victims in my constituency."
"Mr and Mrs Sinnott lost their 23-year-old daughter, Nina, to new variant CJD last May."
"They and the other parents of sons and daughters who have died deserved an explanation."
"The last government is guilty of a cover-up and they have been warned by the Royal Environment Commission back in 1979 and the Southwood report in 1989, but failed to act."
"The Sinnotts and the public have a right to know the facts."
"Parliament's work should be followed up by a public enquiry in Britain."
"As a member of the Committee of Inquiry into BSE, and the Temporary Committee to follow up the Recommendations of the European Parliament relating to BSE, I would like to draw your attention to a particular point in the dossier, at a time when fifteen months of work are now being completed with the vote on the Böge report."
"We have, over time, brought to light on a number of shortfalls and failures."
"Now, this long and painstaking work has enabled us to set up a new strategy at the European level to guarantee our citizens food safety at all stages of the food chain, from animal feed to the table."
"This was an absolute necessity. We could not have done otherwise."
"All the food production sectors, like the consumers themselves, have understood the full import of this drive to clarify matters."
"In the future, we will of course not be satisfied with this."
"The work that has already been done will need to be continued, so that each one of us, and in particular those who, like me, are members of the more sensitive committees, such as agriculture and health."
"The conference on food safety and consumer safety which will be held twelve months hence will be one more opportunity to continue with this very strict monitoring."
"However, we need not seek to go too far in all fields."
"Here, I essentially have in mind industrial uses, where procedures are so tried and trusted as not to present any dangers to end users' health."
"For example, industrial applications that use tallow by-products as raw materials."
"This occurs in sectors other than foods, in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, and in industrial activities and detergent production, paint manufacture, lubrication, or public works."
"Such sectors would inevitably be affected if excessive measures were implemented."
"In the light of their implications in the field of employment, we have to be particularly vigilant when applying directives, to avoid being overcautious, once we can be sure that consumer health is satisfactorily guaranteed."
"I therefore approve of the Böge report."
"This should be an opportunity for the European Parliament once again to meet the expectations of the European population in the fields of health and food fields."
"The threat of a censure motion demonstrated how effective our control over the Executive can be."
"I also share the opinion of the rapporteur, when he says that he is delighted at the effort undertaken by the European Commission, which has an obligation every six months to give us a regular and ongoing report."
"This is progress in the right direction, even though there is still a long way to go."
"Since the first report to the European Parliament on mad cow disease, which was adopted in February 1997, the discovery of a number of massive frauds has shown that the embargo on British beef can be got round with a disconcerting ease."
"At the end of September, it was estimated that more than 10, 000 tonnes of prohibited meat had been sold and consumed in the European market."
"This fraud is all the more dramatic as it has just been proven virtually definitively that the infectious agent causing bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or mad cow disease) has crossed the species barrier, and caused a new form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in man."
"Given this situation, what are the European Commission and the Member States doing?"
"Out in the field, inspection is still inadequate, particularly in the transportation sector."
"In particular, the dogma of the uncontrolled circulation of products (the so-called 'free circulation' in the biased language adopted by Brussels) is so strong that it paralyses all our defensive reactions."
"The European Parliament monitoring committee report states that ""measures and controls of the Member States and of the Commission, insofar as they are possible within the framework of the single market, have not been enough to prevent circumventing the embargo on British beef' , and that 'the Commission and the Member States have therefore been unable to protect the health of the population from the sale of potentially infected meat.'"
"To date (end November 1997), the Commission has still not presented to the Council or to the European Parliament any proposal aiming at improving border controls, and there has not even been introduced a system of compulsory notification of all meat and animal transportation from the United Kingdom."
"It is therefore clear that, once again, the Commission is giving the concern for free circulation of products a higher priority on the internal market than consumer health."
"However, I do not want to insinuate that the Commission has done nothing in this field."
"It has ensured that the works of its expert committees are more transparent, and has undertaken a certain degree of regulatory activity, for example, regulations on the manufacture and use of animal meal, on the prohibition of potentially hazardous products in animal feed and in the human food chain, and the voluntary labelling of beef (this should become compulsory in 1998, instead of the year 2000)."
"But the move to regulations is hampered by three contradictory factors."
"First contradiction: the Commission is unwilling to call into question the dogma of total abolition of internal border controls, as I have already said; such abolition was an error, and it will one day have to be recognized as such."
"Second contradiction: the Commission is too much wedded to the idea that, in order to combat the risk to health, the powers of the Commission should be increased, and the rights of the Member States to self-defence be reduced."
"A reflection of this is, for example, the stupefying amendment to article 100a, proposed to the Council of Amsterdam and accepted by it."
"In the future, when taking national measures of protection in the fields of health or environment, and when making derogations to Community rules (and therefore to the rule of free circulation in particular), Member States will need to make a request under very restrictive conditions, where the Commission enjoys full latitude in its assessment."
"Hence, the Member States will have no means of independent defence against the inertia, prejudices, and failures of the Commission, all of which have, as everyone knows, been the major difficulties we have been faced with in handling the mad cow affair."
"At a time when the whole business should have served as a lesson to the Council of Amsterdam, to set a new balance in the relationship between the Commission and the Member States, it has been used by the dominant ideology to reinforce the powers of the Commission, and to shift the burden of guilt a little bit more onto the Member States."
"Third contradiction: while trying to use Community regulation to ward off the danger of other epidemics in the future, the Commission is continuing to water the seed bed in which such epidemics can grow, by proposing a framework for an ultra-productivist agriculture, based on the lowest prices in the world market, in its Agenda 2000 programme."
"For our part, we want an agriculture which respects natural mechanisms, and so supplies the peoples of Europe with hazard-free food."
"However, such an agriculture will not be possible unless in future commercial international negotiations, there is recognition of the legitimate rights of regional zones of preference."
"This is the reason why we are calling on the European Council of 12 and 13 of December next, which will be examining the Agenda 2000 programme, to reject the agricultural proposals of the Commission. We are calling for a firm orientation in favour of community preference, with a view to what is already being called the 'Clinton Round.'"
"We are calling for a revision of the dogma of elimination of internal border controls. Finally, we are calling on all the peoples of Europe to refuse to ratify the revision of article 100a, and therefore for this very serious reason (although this is not the only one) to reject the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"I voted in favour of the Committee of Inquiry report on BSE because of the important balance that the report reflected between reminding us of the disastrous history of BSE in Britain, under the last Conservative Government, and the measures that are now being taken by the new Labour Government and by the Commission to ensure the health and safety of the public in food and agricultural policy from now on."
"Much has been written about the whole question of food safety following the BSE crisis and we in Ireland, with a substantial food industry, are interested in any improvements the EU may introduce in order to enhance consumer confidence."
"The Commission has recently put forward a proposal which would include primary agricultural products within the scope of the existing EU product liability directive (85/374/EEC)."
"Consumers will therefore be able to seek compensation for damages caused by defective primary agricultural products such as meat, cereals, fruit and vegetables."
"Farming groups in Ireland are concerned by the possible costs of this proposal to their members."
"Consumer groups have pointed out that it is notoriously difficult to trace a disease back to the primary agricultural product."
"The Commission is therefore contemplating introducing a measure which does not have the whole-hearted support of two major groups relevant to food safety - producers and consumers."
"Has the Commission learnt nothing from the BSE crisis?"
"You must get the support of all of these groups if you want to have an effective regulatory regime."
"In 1995 the Commission assessed the impact of introducing such a proposal to the agricultural sector and stated that 'it would not adversely affect the agricultural sector' ."
"I am calling on the Commission today to further investigate this situation, before this extension of the Product Liability Directive is enacted into law."
"The Commission has established a Food and Veterinary Office in Ireland."
"This study is the type of work this new EU office should be completing and I call on the EU to commission such a study/report immediately."
"One of the main tasks of the Food and Veterinary Office is to monitor the observance of food hygiene, and veterinary and plant health legislation within the EU and elsewhere."
"It will cooperate with the many existing national food agencies, including the Food Safety Authority of Ireland."
"I call on the present Irish Government to speed up the process to get this agency up and running by passing a bill in the Dáil establishing its powers."
"The Fianna Fáil party during the recent general election stated that it would scrap this body."
"They should not be playing with people's health while at the same time leaving the Irish food industry in the dark about what powers the agency will have."
"In the original FG/Labour/DL proposals the agency was to have the power to carry out audits on food companies and ultimately fine the companies if they were not adequately following hygiene legislation."
"Fianna Fáil instead believed that the ultimate decision over whether a company should be fined would be taken by the responsible Minister for Health."
"Consumers will not have confidence in such a scenario."
"We know that pressure can be put on Ministers not to fine a company."
"I call on the present government to maintain the independence of the Food Safety Authority as that will be good for consumer confidence in the short term an for the reputation of the Irish food industry in the long term."
"Since the setting-up of a Committee of enquiry on BSE, the European Parliament has been able to exercise a really effective control over the executive."
"To date, we note that the Commission has taken up most of the recommendations of the Parliament, either by directly applying them, or setting deadlines for their implementation."
"We have now set up a date with the Commission for six monthly assessments on work in progress."
"Considerable progress can now be observed, and although relations between the Parliament and the Commission have been tense, it now appears that they may end up by being mutually beneficial, and I hope that this will continue into the future."
"We of course know that there is major dissension with regard to certain specific points, on which we have taken positions - and rightly so - in our resolution, which I wish to support."
"Having said that, it is fundamental that we continue with our joint efforts, with the Commission, with the Council, and with the Member States who so wish, to correct the errors of the past, to change the order of priorities to a degree, and to place public health, and hence product safety and quality, at the very top of our list of concerns."
"Everyone, or nearly everyone, now agrees on this basic principle."
"However, to meet this objective, there has to be a real change in mentalities."
"This change must now and will need in the future to take place in the form of a number of choices that we will have to make at the European level, particularly with regard to new production and processing techniques, or in the decisions that we will need to take with regard to Agenda 2000."
"This change will also need to translate into the responses that we can give to the many questions raised by the BSE problem: can herbivores continue to be fed with animal meal?"
"If so, can this meal really be made from the recycling of sick animals, whether the sickness be BSE or rabies or anything else."
"If not, what do we do with the carcasses of the animals destroyed?"
"Are the funds allocated to research and health inspections sufficient?"
"How can we provide for efficient control of the food processing chains from the farmyard to the table?"
"How can we reconcile the legitimate demands of our consumers with some of our international commitments (hormones, labelling of genetically modified organisms, etc.)?"
"We will need to set up a real ongoing process of vigilant oversight on every occasion where we need to make choices which can have repercussions on public health. We need to be sure that all these fundamental questions are the subject of public debate in each of our Member States."
"The real cause of the BSE problems for the UK was a series of actions by the UK Thatcher Government."
"1.The agri-feed industry, generous donors to the Tory Party, were given the benefit of deregulation; thus the feed bags to farmers did not have to list ingredients (unlike even the modest tin of beans).2.Renderers were given the benefit of removal of stringent temperature rules."
"Commissioner Fischler, in a meeting with myself and Allan Macartney, agreed to the principle of regional lifting of the ban but the Unionist parties and the Farmers' Unions of England and Scotland both refused this saying the Scots had to sink or swim with England!Scotch beef is desired in EU markets but London has prevented this."
"We have not taken part in the BSE vote today, for a number of reasons."
"The first is that, under the procedure in force, the Group of the European Radical Alliance was involved neither with the work of the monitoring committee, nor with the drafting of the common proposal within that committee, so failing the most elementary rules of democracy."
"This has prevented our voice being heard and prevented us affirming our position as we did in the temporary committee of enquiry into BSE."
"The second and probably the most important reason is that the draft is a reflection of a soft and quite politically correct compromise, which is no honour to this House."
"We are not opposed to the majority of points raised, but we cannot by our vote in favour lend our support to what has been passed over in silence."
"Do you not think it is odd that in no place is there mention of the overwhelming responsibility of the United Kingdom in the management of the BSE crisis? Or of the reticence of the Council and of certain Member States with regard to the adoption or at the very least compliance with the regulatory measures which are essential to the protection of public health?"
"Or of the scandal of the fraudulent breaking of the embargo? Or of the uncertain wherabouts stocks of potentially contaminated animal meal?"
"Do you not think it is strange that the victims of the new form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and their families have not been indemnified, at a time when we clearly know who has prime responsibility for the crisis and its origin? Do you not think it is quite illogical that the resolution fails to mention that the European Commission has not explored all means available to it to institute legal action for damage and interest against the United Kingdom?"
"The third reason is that we profoundly regret that the Parliament has not pursued its ambitions to their full extent, and is unable today to go beyond the analysis contained in the Böge report and to draw the true political and institutional conclusions which must be drawn."
"This was the time, now or never, for the European Parliament, as an independent political organization, with the ability to overcome national constraints and divisions, to impose its authority."
"Even so, I would wish to remind the House that we are otherwise delighted at the actions and initiatives already undertaken by the European Commission in order to introduce a European Community food safety policy and we exhort it to continue that action."
"We hope that the Council will support its efforts and that the Parliament will be truly associated with this drive."
"In spite of a real charge sheet from the Committee of Inquiry on BSE some months ago against those with responsibility for the crisis - including the British government and the Commission - the majority of the European Parliament refused to censure the Commission, and gave it a few more months."
"At the time, our group, which was in favour of the censure motion, saw in this decision of the Parliament a failure on its part, evidence of a lack of necessary political will to send a clear and strong signal to governments and to the Commission which had 'given priority to market management, at the expense of health.'"
"I recognize that the Temporary Committee monitoring the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry has given positive results."
"The Commission has effectively taken a series of decisions in line with the recommendation of the Parliament."
"I am delighted in particular that financial resources have been released for the families affected by Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease."
"But these improvements remain technical and do not go to the heart of the problem that the mad cow crisis contributed to revealing."
"Here I am talking about the design itself of European construction, which sets greater store on profit and free competition, at the expense of public health and the interests of livestock breeders."
"This is the essential reason why I am abstaining from the final resolution. Even if the resolution notes the responses of the Commission and the Commission's shortfalls, it does not draw all the lessons of the mad cow crisis."
"It in no way calls into question the orientations of the Commission relating to CAP reform."
"As part of the same logic as that adopted in 1992, the resolution may well lead to further intensification of farming, which may adversely affect the environment and product quality."
"Measures of a totally different scope should be taken, both in terms of CAP reform and for the circulation of goods, which should take more into account both the environment and consumer health."
"The temporary monitoring committee, which took over from the committee of enquiry, has just completed its work, and its conclusions are damning as far as the Commission is concerned."
"The Commission for a long time had serious scientific information at its disposal which showed the high risks of transmissibility of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease to man."
"The most recent scientific work has but confirmed this analysis, and the draft final resolution, presented by Mr Böge, naturally takes account of this."
"The Commission needs to be kept under strict control, and this is the first lesson to be drawn from this sad business. In this field, our Parliament has a legitimate role to play."
"It must do so with far more firmness, clearly setting down the priorities which must be enforced on all."
"Should not concern for the public health of European citizens naturally prevail over the old ideological behind-the-scenes deals which have some of our colleagues to the most regrettable self-censorship?"
"Should we turn a blind eye to the scale of the Commission's responsibilities in the BSE dossier, on the excuse that we should not, in the name of a shared federalist ideology, diminish the credit of the 'objective ally' that the Commission is thought to be?"
"This surveillance of the Commission by the European Parliament appears all the more indispensable as the mad cow problem has revealed the very special malleability of European functionaries when faced with to pressures of a certain kind."
"In order to dispel the merest hint of a hindrance to the extension of the single market, to the ratification of the Maastricht treaty, to the setting up a single currency, they have relegated to a secondary consideration, the priority concern which should have been the health of consumers."
"To keep rigorous control over the Commission, we do not need, as is proposed in the compromise resolution - with which we do not agree with on this point - to extend codecision to agricultural expenditure."
"This proposal is quite foreign to our debate. Adequate instruments of control already exist."
"All we need is the courage to use them, at a time when the Commission's responsibilities, as is the case here, have been clearly established."
"We can but regret that 118 members only have supported this proposal, which was put forward in this Parliament last spring by Philippe de Villiers, in a call for a vote in favour of censuring the Commission, in the wake of the very serious failings which were brought to light by our Parliament's commission of enquiry."
"We must not therefore let up the pressure."
"This is the reason why, in the person of our colleague, Édouard des Places, we have stated that we would be paying the greatest attention to monitoring this dossier and that we would hold the Commission responsible at the plenary session of November 1998, by putting forward a new motion of censure, if it has not before then undertaken the indispensable reforms."
"We are happy to note that the Green group, which did not support the censure motion last spring, now supports this proposal."
"Vigilance in our control will be of benefit to all, and will once again enable our Parliament to act both legitimately and effectively in a field which is really part of its competency."
"I am supporting these reports from Parliament's special BSE enquiry committee as I think it has done excellent work on behalf of the people whose interests we are sent here to represent."
"Thanks to parliamentary pressure, confidential documents can now be seen by MEPs, monitoring of food policy has been separated from other parts of the Commission, new laws to ensure better food quality controls are set to be proposed and we have the Commission's support for a greater say by this elected House on agricultural legislation."
"This last point is one of the most important to emerge from the tragic story of the BSE crisis."
"Had there been more involvement and knowledge within this Parliament about agricultural policies in the past, we might by now have a less costly common agricultural policy as well as one which takes consumers' interests at least as seriously as those of producers."
"It is taxpayers' money which funds EU agriculture to such excessive amounts - it is high time that their interests were taken properly into account."
"For the amount of money they contribute, the least they can expect is safe food to eat."
"Menrad report (A4-0354/97)"
"The report proposed by our colleague at the very least, reveals much cultural diversity in Europe."
"The introduction of a minimum system for participation of workers is a difficult matter."
"It is certainly regrettable that this text is short on ambition."
"It is the result of two important cultural factors: language and relationships between managers and employees, both being the result of history."
"Differences in the field of relationships are substantial."
"This is not the place to draw up a list and to distribute good and bad marks to each of Member States, at least at this stage."
"One thing does appear to me to be important: the acknowledgement by the European Parliament and by the European Union of the importance of negotiation, and of the need to lay the basis for workers to express themselves."
"I do not have too many illusions: this discussion is heavily charged with ideology."
"I am a socialist member of Parliament, and I believe that the participation of workers should enable the regulation and influence of the great free market which is being imposed upon us."
"Once again, I shall repeat myself: the globalization of the economy should be done with and on behalf of citizens, who are also workers."
"Gentlemen crusaders of ultraliberalism, giving more power to employees and their part in the process of production goes hand in hand with economic growth. As far as I am concerned, this is one of the conditions of such growth."
"Ultraliberalism crushes democracy."
"It manufacturers poverty, just as surely as it increases the wealth of some. This is the reason why I shall continue to fight for the dignity of the employee, of the citizen, against the totalitarianism of money, which wishes to bear down on all, and particularly on the weakest!"
"The European Parliamentary Labour Party expressed its opposition to elements of the Menrad report on the Davignon Conclusions concerning European systems of worker involvement."
"We find the mechanism which calls for compulsory reference rules an unacceptable element of this otherwise voluntary approach to a European company statute."
"In this respect we have voted against paragraph 9 (original text) and Amendment No 4(a) (new) which introduces punitive measures."
"Hernandez Mollar (A4-0353/97)"
"We have objections to three paragraphs in the report."
"In paragraph 10 the Member States in general are called upon to reduce the total tax burden for individuals by transferring taxation from work in the direction of consumption in areas like the environment and energy."
"This is a far too general and ill-considered demand, which we cannot support."
"In addition, paragraph 23 makes general demands for increased flexibility in the market for goods and services and in the labour market."
"It claims that without this flexibility the current levels of social protection will not be able to be maintained."
"To support such an abstract demand willy-nilly is impossible."
"Paragraph 24 emphasizes the importance of monetary union for employment."
"However, the opposite is the case. EMU is going to mean a tough blow for regions affected by decline, and is going to force citizens to be more mobile to find work."
"Unemployment and social exclusion are two of the greatest problems confronting the Member States of the European Union They are problems which urgently need to be solved. If they are not, one of the main pillars of the construction of the New Europe, economic and social cohesion and solidarity between Member States will be placed in jeopardy."
"The recent inclusion of a section on employment in the Treaty of Amsterdam represents an important basis for the construction of a coordinated strategy between Member States to achieve a high level of employment."
"But in addition to writing it into the treaty, we must therefore define specific quantifiable objectives with practical applications at European, national and regional level, and governments must prove that they are committed to achieving those objectives, as they have been doing in relation to the convergence criteria."
"Among the various suggestions made by Mr Hernández Molar, I was pleased to note the proposal for territorial employment pacts, his call to the Commission to give priority to projects in the peripheral and ultra-peripheral regions designed to create lasting jobs, involving the various social partners in a partnership scheme."
"The Autonomous Regions of Madeira and the Azores are privileged regions for the promotion of local employment initiatives, particularly in the fields of tourism, the environment, crafts and atypical work."
"The feasibility of these projects will depend on the financial support of the structural funds."
"It is to be hoped that initiative and innovation will be in evidence."
"On the eve of the Luxembourg Summit on employment, the report from Mr Fernandez Mollar broadly satisfies me."
"I completely agree with him when he emphasizes that growth is a necessary, but no longer sufficient, condition for job creation in Europe."
"Growth must be accompanied by structural measures which will create more flexibility in the labour market."
"Success by our enterprises will also depend on the increased coordination of budget policies, but also on fiscal policy at the European level, whose purpose is so far as possible to prevent distortions in competition arising from discriminatory fiscal measures."
"I subscribe to the need to move from passive to active measures in the labour market, to promote the spirit of initiative and to fight against loss of worker motivation, which is also an explanation for our high rates of unemployment."
"On the other hand, I would like to temper the words of the rapporteur on two points:"
"I am favourable to a reduction on the tax burden on labour; but for this measure to be effective, it should not translate into a transfer of taxation to other taxes such as indirect taxes, and in this respect public and social expenditure in general should be reduced, in order not to increase the budget deficit; -As regards the targets for jobs, it seems to me to be difficult to make a parallel between the criteria for economic convergence and criteria for jobs."
"Job creation cannot be quantified in the same way as the reduction of budget deficits."
"On the other hand, these data can be considered as benchmark indicators, so making for easier statistical comparison in Europe.Apart from these two points, I shall approve the report of Mr Hernandez Mollar."
"For us the report is a disappointment."
"It is of course good that we are studying how to create new jobs in the EU countries, but unfortunately there is no mention of the fact that we must also try to prevent the disappearance of jobs, particularly in the public sector."
"Unfortunately, the EU's policy, through the goal of economic and monetary union, means that many jobs are being cut in the public sector where many women work."
"The report entirely lacks an analysis in this area."
"We cannot agree with paragraphs 3, 4 and 24, which concern the necessity to coordinate economic policy at the EU level."
"We do not believe this is a way to create more jobs, mainly because, among other things, the industrial structures in the EU countries look very different."
"Of course there are also parts of the report which are positive, including the request to study unemployment among the young and to put forward proposals which the Member States can use to do something about youth unemployment."
"It is also important to have a switch in taxes so that tax on work is reduced while tax on energy and raw materials is increased, which is a policy the Green Parties are pursuing in the Member States."
"A reduction in working hours is also a good way to reduce unemployment."
"I am abstaining on the report by Mr Hernandez Mollar, as it does not deal with macro-economic orientations, which are of determining importance for employment."
"The convergence criteria, which are absolute and sustainable constraints since the adoption of the stability pact, have deprived Europe of the economic recovery which is essential if mass unemployment is to be reduced."
"Employment is the inevitable result of choices which are above all financial and monetarist in nature."
"The dangerous and recent decision to increase interest rates, taken by the central banks, bears this out, alas!"
"The report does not go sufficiently onto the offensive with regard to the urgency of a European growth policy, growth through recovery of investment, by providing substantial European funding to launch a programme for major works, as proposed by the Commission in 1993, and still not implemented, growth by supporting recovery in consumption, the Achilles heel of our countries, by revising our tax system and by supporting wages policies."
"Nothing will be possible without redistributing the wealth of capital towards labour, without European taxation of capital movements, without reducing VAT on essential products, in certain job-creating sectors or in sectors with a future."
"Finally, the report does not sufficiently or vigorously affirm our determination to stop the current social deregulation."
"Europe requires real social convergence, such as the European principle of a guaranteed minimum wage, fixing the legal working hours at 35 for the year 2000, reduction in maximum working time, etc. The recent lorry drivers' conflict in France highlights the risk of social dumping, of an open market, without commonly accepted social and labour relations standards."
"If the Luxembourg Summit does not take decisions and put them immediately into force in favour of employment, for a minimum regulatory framework, and for a pact for economic recovery, Europe will not accept an automatic move to the euro."
"For monetary union without a reinforced political Europe, without social Europe becoming a reality, means that we labour under a major risk for the future: we shall have a diluted Europe, which is powerless when faced with unemployment, and far from the aspirations of the people."
"Izquierdo Collado (A4-0324/97)"
"Mr President, I voted against maintaining a cohesion fund in this report because I believe that - should we have monetary union by 1.1.1999 - you can no longer justify subsidizing countries that are not involved in monetary union."
"I think it is particularly important in regard to the vital EU enlargement eastwards that we save money here which we urgently need for enlargement in the East, and these ECU 3 billion annually can be very usefully employed for this."
"Moreover, I consider it a disadvantage for the future new Member States from central and eastern Europe if we continue to subsidize countries not involved in monetary union while at the same time the new Member States fail to enjoy this cohesion fund."
"That is why I have voted against this amendment to maintain a cohesion fund in contrast to the majority of my group."
"Mr President, the report presented by Mr Izquierdo Collado formulates proposals whose intent is to improve the way Community policy in favour of greater social and economic cohesion currently operates."
"Of course this report rightly emphasizes the need to preserve the principle of additionality, and to concentrate Community initiatives which have to date been too scattered, to pay attention to the increasing number of people who are in situations of economic precariousness and exclusion, and work for better respect of the environment, and reinforced support to small and medium-sized companies."
"The report finally touches on the theme of misappropriation of subsidies."
"However, our agreement on these points should not make us forget that we refuse the rampant federalism which is characteristic of this report."
"The group of independents for Europe of the nations cannot concur with the act of faith recited by Mr Izquierdo Collado at the foot of the altar of monetary union, affirming that monetary union will be beneficial for the whole of Europe, provided it is associated with close economic coordination between the Member States."
"Yes, we refuse any unacceptable slide towards a single European government, as is currently being prepared for under the economic approach."
"And we similarly reject any propaganda in that direction."
"Furthermore, the present report demonstrates as clearly as could be wished a concern to encourage cooperation with regional and local authorities in order to cut the ground from under the feet of the nations."
"The only real interlocutors of European institutions in our view must remain the Member States, whose wishes are the fountainhead of the legitimacy of those institutions."
"On the other hand, the financial proposals in the report leave the disagreeable impression that the intention is to give everyone a little bit of something to keep them happy, hence a glaring contradiction with the declared determination of fighting against piecemeal interventions."
"No more funding for the cities."
"No more funding for the information society, no more funding for research."
"No more funding for the cohesion funds, etc."
"Now we understand why the budgetary framework of Agenda 2000 was not bold enough in the eyes of the report."
"The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations believes that common policies and structural policies should be kept separate, and would appreciate the Community concentrating its financial effort on common policies for cohesion, such as the CAP, and the PCP."
"The Community should for example avoid scattered efforts in the labyrinth of urban deprivation, where it will inevitably be no more than window dressing."
"In the immediate, you will understand why, for all these reasons, our group cannot vote otherwise than against this report."
"Mr President, I would like to explain why I voted as I did on paragraph 51, Amendment No 16, referring to the policy to be adopted for the islands of the Aegean."
"I voted against the amendment that was submitted by Mr Ephremidis since the subject of the policy on behalf of the islands, about which we naturally agree and which is included in the Amsterdam Treaty, is mentioned at another point in Mr Collado's report."
"In no way does my vote mean that I do not agree with the implementation of an integrated policy on the part of the European Union, with the aim of giving equal opportunities for development to all the islands of the European Union including, of course, the islands of the Aegean, which are sorely in need of special support to enable them to participate on equal terms in the European Union."
"The report is very full."
"It makes a number of very good demands, but unfortunately it also contains a number of statements whose points of view we do not share."
"Above all we do not believe at all that the common currency is going to have beneficial effects on all regions in the EU."
"What paragraph E of the draft report points out is important, i.e. that even though the differences between the Member States have been reduced, the differences in income between the regions has remained practically unchanged, while at the same time the differences in levels of unemployment have increased."
"With this result there is reason to wonder what the point of all the work on cohesion policy is."
"Nor do we believe, as paragraph 14 of the report states, that a liberalization of the transport and telecommunications sectors will automatically bring advantages for consumers and companies."
"Deregulation has often proven to lead to the weakest members of society being hit the hardest."
"Nor do we agree with paragraph 30 of the report on repudiating all attempts at renationalization of structural policy."
"On the contrary, we believe that a lot of regional policy could be simplified if this part was returned to the Member States."
"However, the most important question for us concerns the future of the objective 6 area."
"It is regrettable that the report did not touch on this topic."
"We shall never renounce the demand that the current support for the objective 6 area for arctic and subarctic regions should be maintained at the current level and that the criteria for these regions should remain unchanged."
"We also ask to be allowed to point out that big promises were made to the Norrland region of Sweden in connection with the referendum."
"These promises must be kept."
"We would like to thank the rapporteur for a good job on the report."
"With this explanation of vote we would like to stress the importance of maintaining aid in the area currently covered by objective 6 aid even after a change in the structural funds."
"We would also like to stress the need for a thorough overhaul of the aid currently given to the agriculture and fisheries sectors."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, economic and social cohesion by definition translates into a desire for solidarity going out from the richer countries to the poorer countries."
"However, the excellent report of our colleague discloses shortfalls in this field, serious shortfalls in the perspective of Agenda 2000."
"While, in ten years, revenue disparities between the Member States have certainly been reduced, regional disparities have remained virtually unchanged."
"Worse still, unemployment has risen from 17 % to 22 % in the poorest regions!"
"What can be deduced from this?"
"All the evidence shows poor coordination in many Community policies."
"Such coordination is essential if we want successfully to take up the gauntlet of enlargement."
"The Agenda 2000 shows some ways ahead, which must be the subject of reflection with the relevant actors."
"Do not let anybody say that we have to reduce the number of structural objectives, that would only result in excluding the eligible regions who need them."
"Disparities would become still greater."
"At attentive and meticulous examination of what is being undertaken in these regions, with economic actors and politicians - I emphasize that - is essential, so that we can find solutions together."
"In recent years, the objective of economic and social cohesion has been pursued with good planning and a certain political will, favouring a continuous development of the European regions."
"Despite that, the regional disparities within the EU and the individual States have deepened."
"The distance between the richest and smallest regions has grown by around 7 %."
"An examination of the official documents shows an inconsistency and a lack of coordination of many Community policies with regard to the objective to strengthen cohesion."
"We need to ensure greater consistency between the regional policies and the other EU policies because, even if considerable financial incentives are handed out in the scope of the structural funds, we have come to a dead end: that is not to say that quantity leads to quality."
"The success of the economic and social cohesion policy should be examined not only in the light of the infrastructures constructed, but also in the light of the economic convergences, the development of human resources and productivity, and the employment statistics."
"And in recent times there has been a constant loss of ground in the battle against unemployment."
"It should be recalled that the policy of cohesion, aimed at favouring the adaptation of the structurally weak regions, will supplement the single market by offsetting the negative effects produced by the rules of an open market and seeking to reduce the differences in income between the states."
"Moreover, when the new countries become full members of the EU, there will be an even greater difference in development within it than at present, which is already considerable, jeopardizing economic and social cohesion."
"For that reason, there should be closer cooperation between MEPs, governments, European Commissioners and representatives of local authorities, with greater involvement of the regions and local partners, so as to considerably increase the efficacy of the policy of economic and social cohesion."
"Without a concerted action, the EU's ambitions for the twenty-first century will be frustrated and it will inexorably head for fragmentation."
"Beating the challenge of cohesion means enabling a new concept of solidarity and intra-Community unity to triumph, thanks to which the EU will not sink to the ranks of a vast free trade area."
"I share the fundamental preoccupations of our colleague."
"The report is frank and well-constructed in its content."
"In a word, this is good work."
"I fully agree with the concern to harmonize levels of technology in the various regions."
"I hope that this aspect will be supported by the European Parliament and by the Commission."
"The general philosophy of the report is good: it is necessary to reaffirm the vocation of the European Union for structural adjustment of the regions and the Member States."
"Union enlargement, if it is to be beneficial, must take into account these priorities."
"For this reason, we must maintain and reinforce the cohesion funds."
"If we concentrate over-much on the internal market as part of the global market, we shall lose the political dimension of European construction, which was so dear to the heart of the founding fathers."
"This report requests that more allowance be made for local authorities when meeting defined objectives."
"I approve of that orientation, as this partnership would promote a better matching of proposed actions to the reality of the lives of local actors."
"This would guarantee better visibility with regard to the commitment from the European Union to the regions who have vital requirements."
"The image of the Union would be reinforced and enhanced."
"The European Union, if it is to be strong when facing the new challenges, must be united and coherent."
"If some regions are left to fall behind, there is a risk of fragmentation, which would be detrimental to the future."
"We should not lose sight of this idea, and of the necessity of this point of view, when we come to the study of the reform of the structural funds."
"I wish to explain my vote on the report by Mr Izquierdo Collado, as it relates to a subject which in my view is essential for the future of the Union, and that is economic and social cohesion."
"The first three-yearly report on economic and social cohesion threw light on the persistence of considerable disparities between the fifteen countries of the European Union, this being so in spite of the acknowledged efficiency of the structural policies undertaken for a number of years."
"The report also emphasized the lack of coordination which may exist between the various Community policies with regard to the objective of cohesion."
"Mr Izquierdo Collado is not content with analyzing these conclusions, but goes further, by placing the future reform of the structural funds within the perspective of the two major challenges of years to come, the enlargement of the Union and the single currency, and on this basis developing a number of recommendations for the future of cohesion."
"I supported the Izquierdo Collado report, as I am, like him, convinced that economic and social cohesion must remain one of the priorities of the European Union, and that substantial resources must be employed to that end."
"Account must be taken of this when establishing the financial prospects of the Union, and defining other Community policies."
"Indeed, while specific policies are carried out in the name of social and economic cohesion, it is also necessary to develop synergies with the other Community policies - whether these are policies in the field of research and development, transportation, communications or competition, or contribute to meeting the objective of cohesion fixed by the text of the Union treaty."
"Furthermore, while structural policies remain, of course, a privileged instrument of cohesion, their forthcoming reform naturally raises a number of expectations among all actors in the Union."
"Mr Izquierdo Collado is in his report setting out a number of priorities, which I subscribe to overall."
"But I would simply add that I believe it is necessary for the European Commission to inform us as soon as possible of its detailed and precise proposals in this field, both as regards the definition of new objectives, and the phasing out, or the development of partnership, so that we can give all the care and attention that they deserve to the examination of these questions, and not act over-precipitately."
"In the vote on Amendment No 16 of the Confederal Group of the European United Left I abstained, though not because I believe that the islands of the Aegean should not get support. Quite the contrary."
"However, I believe that this particular paragraph concerns clause 227, paragraph 2 of the Amsterdam Treaty, which does not mention the islands of the Aegean."
"Therefore whatever position Parliament were to take on this point would be meaningless."
"Furthermore, there is a special reference to the islands of the Aegean in paragraph 52, where the Commission calls for immediate measures to be taken on behalf of their inhabitants."
"Neither the declarations of good intentions which were shown in this report, nor calls for social cohesion, can hide the terrible social reality."
"While it clearly appears that there are continuing disparities between regions, there is something which is more serious still, which is the general state of social, economic and demographic disintegration of most of the countries of the Union, and to begin with in France."
"The economic policy of savage competition and of the opening of our markets enforced upon us by the Commission, the unceasing flow of immigration from outside Europe and the exorbitant social security charges which weigh down on labour are plunging our country into a crisis of employment and into an enormous social crisis."
"Unemployment, insecurity, immigration, tax, drugs, loss of identity, ageing of the population: this reality is not social cohesion, but generalized social disintegration."
"You propose continuing down the same track, bolstering up the same policy, ever more generously financing the same actions."
"But the Commission has gone down the wrong road."
"We need another policy and another Europe, in order to set up Community preference, in order to protect our markets from social dumping and from immigrationcolonization, and to re-establish security in our cities, free tax payers from tax slavery, and guarantee a true family policy."
"Your Europe is one of failure and crisis. We want nothing to do with it."
"In spite of investment in economic and social cohesion through the structural funds, the cohesion fund, the social fund etc., the injustices largely remain in Europe between the poor and the rich, between those who do and those who do not have work, and between the strong and the weak regions."
"The Commission's suggestion that the problems are going to be solved through the introduction of EMU and through further efforts on the route already taken does not inspire confidence."
"Nor does the report, which largely recommends the same solutions."
"A reduction in the number of objective areas in the structural funds is justified, but under no circumstances should it be at the cost of the aid itself as such."
"The proposal to incorporate the objective 6 area into the objective 1 area must not be allowed to lead to reduced regional aid for Sweden."
"It is good that the structural funds are being used more extensively to increase employment."
"To merge objective 3 and objective 4 in order to concentrate solely on re-education and training appears panicky."
"That concludes voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.35 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"On a point of order."
"Mr President, I would like to bring to the House's attention an incident that happened at lunchtime today."
"During the voting at lunchtime, one of the Members of this House claimed that during the translation of certain amendments one of the amendments had been incorrectly translated into English from the original version in French."
"He claimed that the text should have read 'English meat' instead of 'British meat' ."
"Can I point out to this House that I have a copy of the original amendment, signed by that Member, which quite clearly states 'la viande britannique' , which quite clearly points to British meat."
"That Member was misleading this House and I wish the record to be corrected."
"Treaty of Amsterdam (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate of the report (A4-0347/98) by Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Tsatsos, on behalf of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, on the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Mr President, I really would like to admit to our two rapporteurs that the Treaty of Amsterdam has brought benefits and developments in its wake."
"However, historically, we must concede that the governments and leaders of the Member States have failed in the historic dimension insofar as they have not managed to give the European Union of the Fifteen greater decision-making powers, nor have they succeeded in making it capable of enlargement."
"That is the historic failure of the governments, not Europe, but the governments."
"What we are now faced with, and what I really fear, is a very difficult dilemma, that on the one hand the political situation could develop in such a way that the institutions will not get to be reformed and that, on the other, enlargement will be postponed, or even declared to be impossible, in view of the lack of institutional reform."
"This dilemma is the legacy of Amsterdam."
"We should admit this quite openly."
"The following course seems advisable to me. The most important point is that we do not let the political discussion about institutional reform peter out."
"The European Parliament needs to ensure, together with the national parliaments, that political pressure is maintained in the direction of institutional reform."
"If we cannot manage that, then the thing I really fear will be upon us, with the result that neither enlargement nor a consolidation of the European Union will happen."
"The reason for us getting into these difficulties still lies in the fact that in reality there is no consensus about the aim of European integration."
"That is the original cause of our difficulties."
"We need to show commitment to bolster support for the political union publicly, in our own countries, because this is not just a central responsibility, but also the crucial point, if we want to move forward with European integration."
"Mr President, like the majority of my group, I am going to vote no to the report in question and advise the Member States against ratifying the Amsterdam Treaty."
"The treaty means that even more powers will be transferred from the elected representatives in the national parliaments to the EU's institutions; institutions which are under much weaker democratic control."
"There is no area where decision-making is being transferred closer to the citizens of the Member States."
"Major changes are taking place in the Union of today compared with the Union which Sweden joined almost three years ago."
"The border controls which it was then said would remain are now going to be banned, the right of veto which we were to have in the area of foreign policy is now to be severely limited, new steps are being taken towards a common defence which it was said would not become a reality, supranationality is increasing and the influence of small states is being reduced, while the European Parliament is being given increased power."
"This negative development is not outweighed by the limited advances also being made in the treaty in areas such as employment and openness."
"I would like in particular to point out two paragraphs in the report which I cannot accept."
"There is a demand that the European Parliament should have a right of assent in future treaty changes."
"That would be a crucial change which would change the nature of the Union in the direction of a state."
"If the Member States are no longer able to decide the development of the treaty themselves, they will also have lost control over the direction in which the Union is going."
"The second area is that the report demands new large institutional changes as an absolute condition for a future enlargement of the EU."
"In this way enlargement is being taken 'hostage' , but there is nothing to say that an enlargement would be more successful if the dominance of the large states in the EU were increased further by giving them more votes on the Council of Ministers."
"Nor is there any connection between supranationality and efficiency within the EU."
"Perhaps the clearest example of this is the fact that the EU's agricultural policy, which has been supranational for almost the longest time of all policy areas, is one of the most inefficient by far."
"Mr President, Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Tsatsos have done a lot of work on this report, which we are grateful for."
"I am, however, surprised by the turn which the reading of the Amsterdam Treaty has taken."
"From seeing the treaty as a great disappointment and directing massive criticism against it, it now appears that a majority are prepared to vote for the treaty, even though it has not been changed."
"We were agreed and the criticism was massive precisely because of the lack of openness and public insight as well as the 'concerns' about supranationality, intergovernmentalism and protocols etc. in the third pillar which make it completely incomprehensible, and mean that it could in fact lead to legal uncertainty."
"At the beginning of the debate Mr Méndez de Vigo addressed the 'good Europeans' and not those who were thinking of voting no, i.e. not to those of us who do not want any federalism."
"I would recommend him to go round the various Member States among the people of Europe."
"Of course they want to have cooperation, but they do not want to be subjected to the centralized and bureaucratic acquis communautaire ."
"The citizens have very little sympathy for these superpower dreams and there is very little desire for EU federalism."
"The really good Europeans represent a popularly-based and democratically legitimate Europe."
"We want cooperation to apply to the whole of Europe, without reservations, so that we can create a stable peace and democracy."
"We are going to vote no and want referendums in the Member States."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their work, although I normally refrain from doing so in principle because of the time."
"Although we will not be approving the report, the work involved really does need to be highlighted."
"In presenting its arguments, the report objectively shows up the merits and deficiencies in the text of the treaty in a way that could have just as easily borne the famous 'no, although' as the 'yes, but' opted for by the rapporteur for political reasons after controversial debate."
"For us independents, alongside the For and Against, the lack of progress in the institutional sphere heard today, reflecting in our view the situation in the Union, there is also the casting vote of 'no, although' ."
"That is largely because we see this as signalling that the intergovernmental conference has reached its limits, because the citizens of Europe are not prepared under the given circumstances to surrender sovereignty further and because we believe that this phenomenon should be taken seriously."
"Mr President, this assessment is more general."
"The Amsterdam Treaty could be regarded as the agreement of the many little steps, most of which must be described as positive."
"However, the radical reforms that our times demand were absent."
"The European Union has not been institutionally strengthened even on the eve of a new cycle of enlargements, which must not be put off till doomsday."
"A joint foreign policy remained one of the demands and defence policy remained in the hands of a NATO which is not exclusively European and in which Europe does not play the leading role."
"Great aspirations met with rejection and with the scepticism of those who still aim at seeing Europe gradually being transformed into a broader free trade area."
"The shadow cast by the transition into the third phase of economic and monetary union and the euro did not permit new leaps forward."
"Most European governments did not feel strong enough to move forward, even in the institutional sector, in a Europe that continues to be plagued by unemployment and that has not yet stabilized its economic recovery."
"On this view, the Amsterdam Treaty may be regarded as an interim agreement."
"The weaknesses that have been pointed out must not lead us, however, to feel disappointed and to condemn the treaty, nor to underestimate its advantages."
"The steps that have been taken may well have been limited, but they were many and in the right direction. They also contributed to transparency, to a more social and a more community-oriented Europe, which is making a greater effort to move closer to its citizens and to simplify its decision-making procedures, to a more democratic Europe with a stronger role for the European Parliament and with the balance between large and small States essentially unchanged."
"The analysis of the details of the treaty, which Mr Méndez de Vigo and Professor Tsatsos achieved with such great success and after a great deal of intense effort, leaves the final conclusion in no doubt."
"In spite of its weaknesses, Mr President, the treaty is worthy of ratification, and the representatives of the governments of the fifteen Member States, during their meeting with our committee, although driven by different motivations, came to the same findings."
"The crucial question now is what the next step is going to be."
"The intergovernmental system for the revision of Treaties has reached its limits and the rapporteurs suggest a different approach, with a Commission proposal and political dialogue with national parliaments."
"Mr President, it has already become urgent for us to move forward to political dialogue without delay, because it would be dangerous to complete further enlargements without in-depth examination of the issues. And it would be a mistake to risk this in-depth examination without respect for equality between large and small countries."
"Balances need to be maintained, because they are established by the general interest and by the very philosophy of the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, every time we have discussed Europe here in the European Parliament or elsewhere, we have been concerned to know where we are going and, above all, where we want to go."
"We will make no exception to that rule today."
"At a time when the future of the European Union is being redefined, we sincerely believe that it is by reverting to major political causes that its leadership will be affirmed."
"The fundamental principles of humanism, with its inherent prosperity and quality of life, the unyielding defence of democracy and transparency in our institutions and participation by all the citizens of the various Member States in the building of Europe are the great values which will enable us to strengthen and, furthermore, to keep fresh in our memory the original foundations of the European Union."
"We should be reminding ourselves that strengthening political cooperation is, therefore, an imperative which we cannot allow to be overlooked, and affirming that its grounds of justification are based on unyielding respect for the diversity of the different nations of which the Union is composed. This, then, is an aim with which we must identify ourselves."
"Political cooperation between Member States must be strengthened through the effective participation of all citizens."
"Everyone says so, and they are right."
"What is not said by so many people is that Europe must not be imposed, but rather consented to, loved and desired."
"This fits in with the Méndez de Vigo-Tsatsos report on the Treaty of Amsterdam - and I take this opportunity of warmly congratulating its authors on its technical quality and its creativity - a report which, while more reasonable than so many others, does not give answers to the fundamental questions with which we are concerned."
"It contains positive aspects, such as for example the acknowledgment that the European Union is a union of states which, therefore, are equal with one another, although the necessary institutional consequences are not drawn here."
"The fact is that while institutional reform is recommended before the time-limit for the formal adhesion of the 16th country to join the European Union, it omits, or perhaps it does not omit, to make a statement on a matter which really is essential for us."
"What institutional reform, at the end of the day?"
"Furthermore, the report defends the ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"While it is debatable whether the report can recommend this to Member States from the institutional point of view, it is politically entitled to do so."
"In my opinion this report fails to raise the question of representative power in Europe."
"And that is a question worth raising, and I shall always be willing to raise it."
"Mr President, like my Liberal colleagues I am in favour of the outcome of negotiations in Amsterdam because it contains a number of small improvements with regard to the principle of subsidiarity, the environment and simplified, democratic decision-making procedures."
"But the most important thing that history will remember us for is not the treaty, but what it paves the way for."
"The enlargement with the new democracies in the East is our generation's historic opportunity to secure peace, democracy and prosperity for future generations in Europe."
"That is what the whole purpose of the European cooperation was."
"It is far more important than the question of to what extent the treaty could have been better on certain points."
"I agree that with 20 or 25 Member States we should change to majority decision-making in several areas so that the Union can carry out its core tasks effectively."
"But I do not agree with the rapporteurs and the Committee on Institutional Affairs when they threaten to say no to any enlargement if we do not have more majority decision-making."
"Imagine that we have 5 countries ready for membership in the year 2002."
"Would this Parliament say no to them and take them hostage because we are unhappy with the Council?"
"Do we really want to take the new, young democracies hostage over this dispute with the Council?"
"I would like to ask the representative of the Council what you think of paragraphs 15 and 16 of the report by Mr Tsatsos and Mr Méndez de Vigo. And I would like to ask the representative of the Council to repeat what your Prime Minister, Mr Juncker, said."
"He has clearly distanced himself from the statement by France, Belgium and Italy."
"These three countries of course have the right to have their opinion and to promote it, but, and this is the crux of the matter, if Parliament goes in and stops the enlargement, and if the twelve countries do not fall in line with the three countries, history will condemn this Parliament."
"It is a simple lack of historical perspective, a lack of a sense of proportion."
"Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, vote against the last part of paragraph 15 and against a some words in the introduction to paragraph 16."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteur for this excellent report."
"I would ask support for the motion for the amendment which was approved in the report."
"In it a parallel is drawn between the vitally important issue of alliance for new Member States and non-alliance, actually for the first time, in this type of document."
"The committee voted against the amendment but, through my initiative, we got it in the part-session as revision 18 of the whole Socialist Group."
"Parliament's position as a legislator has strengthened the base for the joint decision process."
"The Union is becoming more democratic, I am glad to say."
"So-called globalization has, however, meant a change in direction."
"The state withdraws, and keeps an eye out."
"Supranational market forces means we must keep a sense of balance."
"Why are decisions on these issues not forthcoming?"
"National opportunities for influence and information-gathering must be extended, since the broader foothold the Union has, the more open it must be too."
"The working party reforms gained at Amsterdam will not, however, provide nourishment for expansion."
"That is why we need a new study, or else we will choke to death."
"A ship that gets wider, but not deeper, can hardly keep up straight."
"What is important is the expansion of a region of peace and stability."
"The change of emphasis in the Council's votes, as planned in the Amsterdam Treaty must be made very cautiously and always respecting the say of smaller Member States."
"In changing the number of members in Parliament we must also remember that the small states, too, need parliamentary representation, as the most important principle of the Union is solidarity."
"Uniform status for Parliament members was not achieved at Amsterdam."
"I have recommended to the part-session of Parliament that all representatives receive the same pay and that only bona fide travel expenses be paid."
"Mr President, I too appreciate the work of Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Tsatsos."
"You cannot fail to approve their report and the treaty: every small step forward, however small, is always progress and deserves appreciation."
"Moreover, as the European Parliament, we have to direct the examination of the national parliaments, because it would be very serious if the national parliaments failed to approve the treaty at the confirmation stage."
"We still have to favour the process of accepting the prospect of greater integration of those countries that are already members of the European Union that have not yet joined the monetary union, and we also have to offer those countries applying to join the European Union the image of a truly effective unity of intentions of the entire Union."
"I approve the treaty for those reasons, but we cannot hide our disappointment at the inadequate changes at institutional level."
"It is not a romantic disappointment, caused by an abstract and idealist European culture; it is a political and therefore a concrete and realistic disappointment, not so much because the European Parliament had hoped that the intergovernmental Conference would approve the institutional changes relating to operation, prerogatives, composition of the Council and the Commission, and the Parliament itself, which were largely unanswered, but also because we know that, without these institutional reforms, the European Union risks a real process of regression and even collapse."
"What was not done in Amsterdam should be done as soon as possible."
"What was not done in Amsterdam for political reasons, which we can readily guess, should be done first, before any concrete expansion; what was not done can be justified by being impossible technically, time-wise and politically in Amsterdam, but can never become a mental reservation for not achieving expansion or, on the contrary, for using expansion to make the powers of the political union less effective and empty."
"But it is not only a question of expansion: monetary union itself invokes a rapid institutional reform, the institutionalization of a political government for the Union that is just that."
"Monetary union implies the absorption into the Community of decidedly consistent shares of national sovereignty that cannot be handled with efficiency, fairness, transparency and participation: and this we cannot pretend to ignore."
"As the European Parliament, we should state clearly that expansion and the birth of monetary union and the objective of a greater integration of the European Union seek the completion of the institutional reform that only began in Amsterdam."
"Mr President, enlargement is now the EU's most important task and no obstacles must be put in its way by making absolute demands for reforms before an enlargement."
"Doing that would create uncertainty about Europe's development with a high risk of civil war."
"Therefore there are parts of paragraphs 15 and 16 for which I cannot vote."
"On the other hand, I am pleased about paragraph 20 about a continued and strengthened cooperation with the national parliaments, and I would like to urge the Committee on Institutional Affairs to go further with this with regard to creating a vision of the future cooperation in Europe."
"The Amsterdam Treaty is not perfect, because we human beings are not perfect."
"Nor do we agree on all the answers to the questions of life and of everyday living."
"We have different traditions, cultures, living conditions and problems, so the Amsterdam Treaty is a compromise."
"It is incomplete, but it is a good basis for peace in Europe."
"I am therefore voting yes to the Committee's report, which is a signal that a yes to ratification is the most important thing."
"Mr President, the Amsterdam Treaty clearly falls short of the aspirations of this Parliament, as has been pointed out by many speakers in this debate."
"But the choice facing us today is not between the Amsterdam Treaty and an ideal treaty that we would have wanted."
"It is the choice between the Amsterdam Treaty and the existing treaties as they are now."
"If you make that comparison, the Amsterdam Treaty includes a dozen or more significant steps forward, even if it falls short on one major point which is preparing for a wider Union."
"I will not go through all the improvements."
"They have been alluded to already."
"I will just mention some key ones: the social protocol, the new possibilities opened by the employment chapter; the improved provisions on public health, consumer protection and environmental policy; the integration of part of the third pillar into the first pillar; the better protection of human rights and the procedure that is introduced, for the first time, to deal with any Member State that ceases to be democratic, should that ever happen; the better provisions on transparency; and above all, the extension of the powers of this Parliament, both in scope of the codecision procedure and in the procedural changes, which are precisely the ones we wanted."
"It is interesting to note that none of these changes would have taken place - not a single one of them - without the change of government in the United Kingdom on 1 May."
"It is also interesting to note that many of them, especially those concerning Parliament, were certainly facilitated by the work of Mrs Guigou and Mr Brok, representing us in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"That being said, the new treaty fails to provide for the functioning of an enlarged Union."
"The European Council itself acknowledged that in the protocol that it attached to the treaty."
"This provides and needs further institutional reform."
"I believe that this reform must include, above all, the question of extending qualified majority decision-taking instead of unanimity."
"Unlike Mr Haarder, I do not think this need for reform means that enlargement will be held up - far from it."
"There is time to agree those reforms and to ratify them together with the enlargement as a single package, perhaps even in the same treaty in due course, which would make ratification easier in certain countries and would of course also require the assent of the European Parliament, because we give assent to accessions."
"There is time to do it."
"It must be done."
"We must put the two processes together and make sure that enlargement takes place with the necessary institutional changes."
"Mr President, in light of the speeches that have been made in this debate, I think that it is legitimate to ask whether we are talking about the same treaty."
"Indeed, for some Members, the Amsterdam Treaty is a resounding failure, but for others it represents the triumph of pragmatism over idealism."
"And, in my view, that is the most significant thing about this draft treaty: its ambivalence."
"Those who have accorded maximum priority to the institutional pillar have condemned its inadequacies - and I agree with them."
"Those who have emphasized the economic aspects have welcomed the fact that the draft treaty gives a boost to economic and monetary union and introduces a large number of innovative elements - and I agree with them too."
"I believe that the rapporteurs have managed to overcome this difficulty, with intellectual rigour, and without extolling the draft treaty's virtues or concealing its defects."
"Whilst this considered approach is important, the most significant thing is that this report is set within three complementary perspectives:"
"Firstly, the perspective of the past, since the Amsterdam Treaty already belongs in the past."
"However, the report does not restrict itself simply to stating the facts, since what the draft treaty represents can only be understood as a function of the historical process whose roots lie in the origins of the European project."
"Secondly, the perspective of the present, since history is not made only by counting past successes. On the contrary, we must also recognize our new point of departure."
"And thirdly, and most importantly, the perspective of the future, since if we do not know where we are going, we will recognize neither our new point of departure nor the road itself - to which Mr Méndez de Vigo referred this morning."
"The rapporteurs firmly understood - and, in my view, have clearly expressed in the explanatory statement - what the European Union has been, what it is, what it can be in the light of the possibilities offered by the draft treaty, and, above all, what it should be."
"To this end, there is an unavoidable need to change the method."
"And, in my view, this is the essential contribution that this report makes: it looks to the future."
"This report is therefore set in the perspective that we are still in time. But in time for what?"
"In time for ensuring that the wrongs which we condemn do not occur?"
"No."
"We are in time to ensure that they cease being wrongs."
"And, in this regard, there are two possible approaches: continuing to argue about how many angels will fit on the head of a pin - whether the Amsterdam Treaty is good or bad, that is - which will change absolutely nothing; or ratifying and implementing this treaty, and working to change and improve a situation with which we are not satisfied."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, congratulations to the rapporteurs, Méndez de Vigo and Tsatsos."
"The quality of their work strengthens the credibility of the European Parliament in its exercise of its share of Community powers."
"It is true that we expected a Maastricht II from Amsterdam and only got a Maastricht I and a half. Yet Amsterdam should be compared with Maastricht, and not with some ideal model, as my colleague, Mr Corbett, was saying here just now."
"The construction of Europe consists of a series of efforts, not a gift from heaven."
"In any event, it would be an illusion to think that history is made by laws."
"In the best scenario law is an accessory to history, in the worst, a reflection of it."
"Now, if we are not mistaken, Agenda 2000 is no longer than Amsterdam."
"And the extension of the first enlargement to include five countries is measured by the same standard."
"Amsterdam, therefore, is moving at the speed of history itself."
"Obviously, institutional reform held no great attraction."
"But what we have done here is a step in the right direction; a strengthening of the codecision procedure of the European Parliament and the democratic legitimacy of the President of the Commission."
"The path to real Europeanization lies along the Commission/Parliament axis and it can make contact with its citizens again through the democratization of the Union."
"The questions of the number of commissioners and the weighting of votes on the Council are simultaneously insufficient to resolve the problems of transition to a new enlarged Europe and too much to alter the whole European construction model, without sufficient debate or the express consent of the electors, as though it were being brought in surreptitiously by the back door."
"Until the single currency comes in we have time to think about real institutional reform."
"This is also the case because you do not find two revolutions taking place at the same time and the one that is now in process is the change to the single currency."
"I suspect, furthermore, that the first issue on the agenda today, the institutional question, has been and still is the apportionment of powers between Union and States, due to the Intergovernmental Conference model."
"Institutional reform could only take that principal place in a framework in which the codecision procedure of the European Parliament also played a part in the revision of the treaties."
"That is why I agree with the rapporteurs and their suggestion of a new method of revising the treaties, with greater participation by the European Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we already said last June, the results of Amsterdam are not satisfactory."
"An observation made here, of course, and elsewhere too."
"Have we given this treaty enough of a chance?"
"Perhaps not."
"Although the worst may never happen, it is never wrong to be lucid and critical."
"Our ambitions for the European Union are not limited to the pure summation of national interests, averaged down to the smallest common and acceptable denominator."
"It would be better even so to ratify the treaty."
"We prefer a little bit of not very much, to rather a lot of nothing at all."
"I know many of my colleagues and friends will vote against today, but would in fact vote for if they were member of national parliaments."
"Intellectually, the teacher that I am, or that I remain, understands this subtle distinction."
"But politically, now that I have become a European Member of Parliament, I disapprove of that approach."
"After long and painful labour, Mr Tsatsos and Mr Méndez de Vigo heard new demands rising on all sides."
"A consensus has come into being around four basic points."
"Whatever our assessment of the Treaty of Amsterdam, institutional reform is still ahead of us."
"Institutional reform is a prerequisite to any enlargement, and must be undertaken now, and in another way than at present."
"Now let us move on to the future. Let us ask others also to think about the future."
"Our parliament has said and proclaims this louder now."
"The Commission has heard this voice. It needs to act, and said that it was ready to do so this morning."
"Governments have responded."
"It is down to the Council to listen, and take this message forward, to give a signal, both to ourselves and to the citizens at the Luxembourg summit, to say that they have understood and that they are going to get on with the job."
"We could have adopted a more radical position, especially as our expectations were so high, and our hopes so dashed. We were almost cut to the quick to see that in Amsterdam, the European idea appeared to have been set to one side."
"Our expectation from the Luxembourg summit is that Heads of State and of Government should take a grip on themselves, give a meaning to Europe, and say to the citizens that they know where they are going, and above all, that they all want to go there together."
"Let us listen to René Char's words, as if he were speaking to us here in this Parliament, both today and for the future, and as if he were saying to us what he wrote for others: ' Work for your happiness, go out towards where your risk lies."
"The more they watch you doing this, the quicker will they get used to it.'"
"Mr President, my congratulations to the rapporteurs for their report."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam is very modest and for that we can be glad."
"Nevertheless, it contains many good things."
"For this Parliament it contains increased powers that will improve the democracy and efficiency of the EU."
"For my country it provides a secure legal base for the retention of our frontier controls while not frustrating the desires of the other members of the EU."
"And although I have to admit that it has not been the constant point of discussion on every street corner, it contains much that is of relevance to the citizens of the EU."
"The employment chapter, the anti-discrimination clauses, the new protocol on animal welfare, the UK's opt-in to the social chapter are all of relevance to citizens."
"Of course it does not contain everything that people would want."
"In fact, it is not as anybody would have written it."
"It is clearly a compromise, as any treaty of this sort must be."
"Mr Corbett has mentioned its deficiencies in respect of enlargement."
"I would like to have seen some reform of articles 38 to 43 on agricultural policy which clearly are extremely outdated."
"But, on the whole, the treaty is a good one and this is partly because it recognizes, as some contributors to this debate have not, the fairly modest aspirations of most EU citizens in respect of the growth of European powers."
"Members of this House may be frustrated with the slowness and lack of vision of the member governments of the EU but it is those governments who have got to get whatever treaty they agree passed by their national parliaments and passed in referendums if that is required in their countries."
"Mr Bourlanges - who is now here - said: ' The diplomats have failed."
"The citizens are going to have to take over' ."
"Personally I rather doubt that if we had a Europe shaped by the citizens, it would quite meet the aspirations of Mr Bourlanges or a majority of this House."
"That is why I have doubts about the end of intergovernmentalism as a means of designing treaties, which several people in this House have mentioned."
"Mr President, I thank my colleagues for this report, which seems to me a very good one, as it is, in my view, the political expression of what the Parliament as a whole believes."
"It is not necessarily completely consistent with my own approach, however, and my colleagues know this well."
"Firstly, much has been said here about citizens."
"It is true that whenever we hold one of these meetings, at least in my political framework, the citizens reject the Treaty of Amsterdam, and reject the Treaty of Maastricht."
"But that is not the problem that faced our rapporteurs."
"That is a collective problem, which involves the question of how are we to rekindle the European flame."
"And here, I see only one solution. This is in fact to do more Europe, to make the Europe we are constructing better, and to ensure our actions relate to their problems."
"I hope that the Luxembourg summit on employment will contribute to this."
"Secondly, should we say yes or no to Amsterdam?"
"I think the question was already settled in July."
"We said then it was not the best treaty that we could have had, but we have already said yes to it, in a certain manner."
"Thirdly, the real problem is of course that of enlargement."
"If this Treaty of Amsterdam was intended only for the fifteen, I would say that, in the final analysis, although this does not add up to a major revolution in the Community, the treaty does contain some things which are not too bad, in the field of the environment, in social affairs."
"However, when seen from the point of view of enlargement - and here, I am only repeating what our colleagues are also saying - this treaty is absolutely inadequate."
"This is the real problem."
"The European political project is one of enlargement."
"If we do not manage our own reforms first, and achieve democracy and efficiency, we will be faced with enormous difficulties, which will mean that our citizens become even more reticent than they already are with regard to Europe."
"And finally, the fourth question. This is how we are to organize the forthcoming intergovernmental conferences."
"We have already seen quite clearly that the current procedures for discussion among governments did not give good results."
"The governments are prisoners to their own constraints."
"Let us allow the citizens to speak out more clearly, and let us give more power to the European Parliament."
"This is the message already contained in the report. This is the message we wish to lend even more support to."
"Mr President, Commissioner Oreja, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Amsterdam is the European Union's visiting card to introduce it to its citizens."
"And through the treaty, what it says, what it does not say and above all what its citizens can succeed in learning by reading it, they can create the will to be Europeans."
"To achieve this the Treaty on European Union must fulfil three objectives: it must be an effective basis to enable the European Community to meet the challenges of the information society, the knowledge society, which is what the society of the Third Millennium will be; it must give high priority to people; and it must be clear and legible."
"None of these principles is satisfactorily enshrined in the text which came out of Amsterdam."
"The Méndez de Vigo/Tsatsos report has been the occasion of great debate between those who advocated the pure and simple rejection of the text and those who recommended that Parliament should support its ratification."
"That debate has transcended all party politics, which I think is a healthy sign."
"The Parliament will show a responsible attitude by adopting a clearly critical but constructive position as regards the results of Amsterdam - as suggested by the rapporteur, who has shown great flexibility in including countless suggestions, and even criticisms, some from within his own group, in the final text."
"It is obvious that there can be no enlargement without genuine institutional reform."
"There can be no institutional reform without a radical change in the method of revising the treaty and, above all, of the intergovernmental rationale which has held sway up to now, and thus without the total involvement of the Parliament and parliaments; that also is obvious."
"A further point which is self-evident is that only profound institutional reform will make it possible to create speedy and efficient decision-making mechanisms."
"But, Mr President, the fact that statutory equality of members is the very basis of the Community and that its wealth lies in the cultural, geographical diversity and varying sizes of the States of which it is composed is another important truth which I wish to emphasize and which must be taken into account when we consider institutional reform."
"The fact that the cultural dimension will be the driving force behind the European project in the future knowledge society is perhaps the least known, but also the most fundamental of truths and must be represented in the text of the treaty."
"And, finally, I live in hope of seeing the Council moving closer to the Parliament's position as regards the urgency of establishing a new method for the next revision, and also of seeing a reference to culture in the preamble to the treaty and the addition of a specific article on language policy, in view of the importance of that question to every citizen."
"Mr President, I think the most important achievement of the Treaty of Amsterdam is that as a result, economic and monetary union will start on time, and secondly, that the process of enlargement has not been obstructed."
"The treaty itself is thin."
"That cannot be denied."
"It offers, in particular for the European Parliament, some attractive perspectives on the issue of further democratization."
"But, Mr President, the problem remains for this Parliament too, that no parliament exists without a relationship with the people: democracy."
"If you look at what is in the treaty, further intergovernmentalization, opt-ins, opt-outs, flexibility, then you will end up with a situation in which the people of Europe will never be able to understand how democracy in Europe functions."
"Mr President, the shortcoming of the Treaty of Amsterdam is that enlargement will not be easily achievable, and that we will have to hope that, by reaching agreement on institutional reform, enlargement will become possible; without it the quality of the existing Community will decline."
"To me that this is the crux of the issue."
"Mr President, I do not feel all that confident about this, as the existing Community already finds it difficult to function well."
"I will illustrate this."
"We are always discussing the reforms of the Commission, the number of members in this Parliament, but we never discuss the Council."
"But I saw in the paper today that my Minister of Transport did not manage to get the European Council of Ministers to discuss something as topical as the transport strikes in France, because the councils are no longer able discuss topical issues, if these have not been extensively prepared by officials."
"That means a lot of time is lost."
"Mr President, I think the problem is starting to seem as if there is no remedy; that, as price for enlargement, further bureaucratization will occur, and this further bureaucratization can be an important obstacle in the democratization of Europe, and I think we made very little progress on that issue in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"You should always measure yourself against your opponent."
"Who is fighting this Treaty of Amsterdam with the greatest vehemence?"
"On the one hand, there are the Euro-fundamentalists. For them the Treaty of Amsterdam does not go far enough."
"They want a quicker and more complete move to a European federal state, and this Treaty of Amsterdam is a long way off that."
"On the other hand, the Treaty of Amsterdam is being fought by the main opponents of the European Union, who either do not want a common Europe at all or only want a very loose confederation of states, a superior free trade zone of nation states, who can say no to everything."
"For such opponents and their arguments the Treaty of Amsterdam cannot be bad at all."
"But it could be better."
"It could, and should, embrace much broader and deeper institutional reforms if it is to bring about each bit of consolidation needed for the next enlargement of the Union."
"We still have a few years yet until enlargement."
"We must use this time for further treaty review, which follows other rules than the previous Intergovernmental Conferences."
"The previous method of treaty review is out of date."
"It leads to veto positions in areas where we need movement."
"It leads to the lowest common denominator in areas where we need great - if not the greatest - commonalities."
"Which procedure will help us out of this dilemma?"
"Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Tsatsos bring the correct approach to the discussion."
"The next treaty review needs to follow European rules of lawmaking. It must proceed in the way we traditionally make European laws: on the basis of a notice of motion from the Commission and with the legitimate involvement of Parliament and Council."
"If we conduct the next review according to these rules, then it will be successful, and then the next treaty will not only fail to prevent enlargement, but actually promote it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission and Council, if the work of the treaty were to be appraised in one idea, then it might be said of it, drawing on the words of the German poet Bertolt Brecht, that it involves 'moderate progress' ."
"Bertolt Brecht meant this very cynically and critically."
"Certainly, you can convey this element; you can also be very positive and say that it is progress."
"We should not deceive ourselves, however, into thinking that the progress is too slight when measured against the demands that this House makes."
"How does the citizen of Europe regard the European Union after the Treaty of Amsterdam?"
"The citizen of Europe sees that we will be arguing and debating hotly in the near future because in many cases we have not succeeded in moving from the principle of unanimous voting to majority voting."
"That is a crucial task which we need to put right with the next reform, so that Parliament can slowly arrive at the position it really deserves."
"Secondly, there is an aspect I am constantly experiencing in the area of foreign policy: the citizen of Europe sees that here there is a large continent that produces a lot, pays a lot, but has very little say in the matter, because it does not speak with one voice, but with many voices compared with the single voice that comes from America."
"My final point: Mr President, how are things to proceed from here?"
"Mr Rack and many others have already stated - and you will find this too in the report from Mr Tsatsos and Mr Méndez de Vigo - that things need to be different."
"There is a need for this House, that is for the voice of the people, to express a greater willingness to reform!"
"For this was the way things were after Amsterdam: each head of government went home and said, ' Amsterdam was a great success."
"I gave away nothing."
"We did nothing for Europe, and I saved my home country.'"
"That is why Parliament, which represents the higher interests, must play a greater role in future."
"In this respect I would like to thank the rapporteurs Mr Tsatsos and Mr Méndez de Vigo for their excellent report as a starting point for new reform, which must express more strength and more desire for a common ground."
"Mr President, I am very conscious today that we are taking part in a continuing historic evolution of our European continent."
"I wish to say that this latest stage of European integration sees the third significant treaty change in over a decade."
"The ordinary citizen wants to know what this treaty is all about."
"We have to spell out very clearly what it is and, to put it at its simplest, it is there to strengthen the Union's policies and the effectiveness of its institutions."
"In this regard, I very much welcome the fact that the Union is being given enhanced powers in the fight against crime."
"In future the aim will be to ensure that citizens can benefit from free movement while criminals do not."
"I also welcome the new treaty provisions which reinforce the powers and the competence of the European Parliament in areas such as employment, the environment and all the other areas, such as social exclusion and poverty, that have been mentioned here this afternoon."
"These are areas, naturally, where the public expect us to be active."
"A further major advance in this treaty is in the area of a more effective and coherent foreign policy."
"This involves streamlining decision-making procedures with a limited provision for qualified majority voting while preserving a national veto whenever vital interests are at stake."
"For Irish nationals this is very important, and it is important to realize under this heading that there is no threat here to Irish neutrality."
"In fact the treaty will have to be ratified by way of a referendum in Ireland and in a number of countries."
"In this regard, I would ask the Irish Government to ensure that it provides simple information, not complicated texts in legal jargon."
"One regrettable point about the treaty is that the seat of the European Parliament has now been reinforced here."
"The ordinary Members of Parliament, the elected Members, do not have a say on this and this is very regrettable."
"I welcome the debate today and I look forward to the debate in the national parliaments in the months ahead."
"Mr President, I should firstly like to congratulate Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Tsatsos on a clear and comprehensive report which makes a critical but realistic analysis of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"This week, three important events with a European dimension are taking place: this debate in the European Parliament; the special Employment Summit in Luxembourg; and - a situation which affects Europe, although Europe is not playing a major role in it - the conflict between Iraq and the United States, or Iraq and the United Nations."
"I am going to depart somewhat from the question of the Amsterdam Treaty, depart from the confines of Parliament and depart from Strasbourg."
"I am going to put myself in the position of the European public."
"Whatever form is given to the treaties - by means of a system of revision which clearly cannot be the present system of an Intergovernmental Conference alone - as long as Europe does not have a socioeconomic model or an international political vision, the Community, the Union, will continue to function, for better or for worse, with highly competent institutions, but it will not be integrated into the world."
"And, in this regard, it should be recalled that the Community was founded on the basis of a typically European socio-economic doctrine."
"Within the capitalist system, Europe was endowed with an economic model based on an indicative plan for private enterprise, a binding plan for the public sector, and provision for social security."
"This model lasted from 1957 to 1986, or perhaps 1989, when Europe was subjected to a different socioeconomic interpretation and lost its distinctive identity."
"Europe was built by means of a Christian Democrat-Socialist consensus."
"I am now calling for a consensus to establish a European model."
"When this model exists, and when Europe defines its position in a world which is no longer bipolar, or under the hegemony of single power, but multipolar, the entire European project will be easier, and the revision of the treaties will be easier."
"As far as the technical revision of the treaties is concerned, it is logical for us to focus on our tasks, but we must also call on Europe to maintain its international and socio-economic models, since, otherwise, we shall be engaging in mere formalities."
"European reform, European action, the European position must be viewed in relation to the need to enhance Europe's image on the world stage as a socioeconomic and international political model."
"The rest will then be easier, and we shall not find ourselves with a suit made for an adolescent which is growing, or which we do not wish to grow."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, as the institutional debate on the Europe of the euro gradually deepens, we find that Amsterdam could not have been anything other than what it was."
"Only when the institutional consequences of monetary unification have been specified will it be possible to outline the overall institutional framework of the European Union, not on account of virtuous automatism of monetary unification, creating political institutions, but the need to finally take into account, with all the information available, what has been the real and disturbing Maastricht revolution, that is the design of a Union that is always a union, but no longer a union of equals but rather a union of different people."
"The government of differences is therefore the great challenge faced by the Union for it to remain a Union."
"The extraordinary effort of convergence that has already been made in the field of public finance shows how this vision of a Union with differentiated status is both realistic and worrying owing to its intrinsic novelty for the Member States."
"This should therefore be the focal point of the political and institutional attention of this Parliament in the near future, because the question of expansion will also jeopardize not only the guarantees of our unity but above all the ability to manage our differences; with this tension between unity and diversity, which already exists in our system, a decisive factor of cohesion will be the transverse institution consisting of the European people and their rights and duties, that is, the institution we call citizenship."
"The deepening of the substantial dimension of Union citizenship is basically the most important institutional contribution this treaty could give and has given, as all other aspects have been brought to a compulsory standstill."
"It is in this climate of transition that, concluding this long debate, I believe it is good advice to follow the opinion of Mr Tsatsos and Mr Méndez de Vigo."
"The debate is closed."
"The President congratulates the rapporteurs, Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Tsatsos on their excellent work."
"The vote will take place this evening at 5.30 p.m."
"EU/USA summit and trade relations"
"The next item is the debate on the statements by the Council and Commission on trade relations, including sanctions, and the implementation of the new transatlantic agenda (2nd and 3rd Pillars of the Treaty on European Union) with a view to the European Union/United States of America Summit to be held on 5 December 1997"
"Mr President, ladies and Gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to be able, in the name of the Council, to take part in this debate on the forthcoming United States of America - European Union Summit."
"As you know, the new transatlantic agenda signed after the summit between the European Union and the United States of America, which was held in Madrid on 3 December 1995, along with the joint European Union - United States action plan, which was associated with it, have given a new focal point and orientation to all aspects of partnership between the European Union and the United States."
"The new transatlantic agenda, as our American friends call it, has encouraged both parties to enlarge and intensify their cooperation in many fields of common interest."
"I believe I can say that the six-monthly summits are an essential element of the NTA."
"Not only do they emphasize the global reinforcement of relations between the European Union and the United States, but they contribute to advancing the implementation of the NTA, and are an opportunity for overall re-examination of the European Union - United States relationship, and for debating specific matters of common interest."
"The president of the European Council and myself are awaiting with interest this forthcoming summit, which will take place, as you know, in Washington on 5 December, following the summit between the European Union and Canada, held the day before."
"Preparations for this summit are well advanced, and the President of the Commission and the American representatives will meet tomorrow in the top level group established between the European Union and the United States to make an assessment of the current state of implementation of the new transatlantic agenda, and to examine some of the main questions that we face today."
"We are now establishing a detailed agenda for the summit with our American partners, but I can already tell you that we are expecting to raise points as important as our commercial relations with the United States, in particular in the framework of the relationship between the European Union and the United States in the WTO, and with regard to the Helms-Burton legislation."
"Also, there are other topical subjects, such as the peace process in the Middle East, the question of Cypress, the question of climate change, fighting against crime and organized crime, the fight against terrorism, narcotics, drugs, immigration and asylum."
"These are the essential matters, I believe, for debate at the summit."
"As in previous summits, the United States and ourselves will focus on concrete successes which have been achieved in the last six months."
"We hope we will be in a position first to sign the scientific and technological agreement, and then to put our initials to the agreement on the implementation of the principles of active courtesy in the application of our competition rules."
"Thirdly, we can also, at least I hope so, officially announce initiatives such as the Transatlantic Information Exchange System, the digital library and transatlantic dialogue on civil society."
"As regards the European Union and United States programme in favour of democracy and civil society, announced at the Hague summit, we hope that we can confirm the names of those who will have seats on the judges' college."
"This summit, Mr President, ladies and Gentlemen, will be the fourth since the NTA has been set up."
"In the last two years, we have reached a number of substantial, concrete results."
"Hence, in the field of foreign policy, the two parties have reinforced their cooperation on key questions, including the promotion of peace, stability, and reconciliation in the Balkans, in the Middle East and in Central Africa."
"The membership of Euratom, on 17 September, in the organization for energy development of the Korean peninsula, alongside the United States, Japan, and South Korea, illustrates our joint willingness to reinforce efforts undertaken in the field of nonproliferation."
"As regards the field of humanitarian aid to development, we have improved our coordination in response to the needs of societies torn by war."
"We are also collaborating in the promotion of democracy and the reinforcement of civil society."
"The European Union and the United States are working together to meet the challenges raised at the global level."
"As part of our cooperation in the field of the fight against narcotics, at the Hague summit we signed an agreement on chemical precursors, in order to combat the misappropriation of chemicals for production of illicit drugs."
"We are working together in the Caribbean region, and hope to extend our cooperation to the Andes region."
"We are currently making great efforts to exchange information as part of our effort fighting international organized crime, and we have launched a coordinated information campaign initially directed at Poland and the Ukraine, in order to combat international trafficking in women."
"In spite of divergences between the European Union and the United States on the timetable for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, we are reflecting on the ways and means to cooperate at the Kyoto conference on climate change, which is due to be held in December."
"Some important results have been achieved, as regards the multilateral agenda on trade and on efforts to create a new transatlantic market."
"As part of the WTO, the European Union and the United States have made a common effort to finalize the agreement on information technologies and the agreement on basic telecommunications services, which together will make it possible to liberalize some thousand billion dollars' worth of international trade in goods and services."
"Within the framework of the OECD, joint efforts have contributed to the adoption of major decisions in the field of fighting corruption in international commercial transactions."
"Mr President, within the framework of the new transatlantic market, the European Union and the United States have worked together to reduce barriers to trade and investment, in many cases responding to the recommendations for transatlantic dialogue between companies."
"Following the conference which was held in Chicago in November last, and the European Union - United States Summit, which was held at the Hague on 28 May of this year, the two parties signed a cooperation and mutual assistance agreement in the customs field, which will contribute to facilitating trade, reinforced implementation of decisions, and fighting fraud."
"Negotiations on an agreement for the mutual recognition and the evaluation of conformance have been completed."
"A fundamental aspect of the NTA is the development of links between peoples."
"Transatlantic dialogue between companies is contributing to closer ties between the European and American business environments, promoting good practice, and further liberalizing transatlantic trade."
"Following the success of the Chicago conference, the TABD met again on 6 and 7 November in Rome."
"On the other hand, a transatlantic conference entitled 'Building a bridge across the Atlantic' was held in May in Washington, and brought together experts in civil society, education, youth and culture, in electronic trade and parliamentary links, from both sides of the Atlantic."
"We are particularly pleased that relationships between the European Parliament and the American Congress are becoming every closer, a development to which Mr Alan Donnelly, member of the European Parliament, is making a substantial contribution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the NTA is a dynamic process which the two parties are constantly stimulating into new movement, by continually updating priorities and reviewing new targets."
"However, it must be admitted that it is not the solution to all our problems."
"Very major differences, such as those relating to the Helms-Burton and D'Amato legislations, to hormones, and even, the to the banana protocol clearly testify to this."
"But the NTA on the other hand has generated mutual confidence and has allowed the two parties to develop their overall relations within a spirit of cooperation which has taken its inspiration from fundamental, jointly shared principles and objectives."
"Mr President, on the eve of the EU-US Summit on 5 December in Washington, I wish to start by explaining why I believe that the relationship between the United States and the European Union is so critically important, why it is essentially healthy and why it is in both our interests to work together to overcome the problems which arise between us."
"The relationship is the most important bilateral economic relationship in the world."
"The annual value of trade in goods and services in 1996 exceeded ECU 360 billion."
"We are the largest investors in each other's markets."
"European companies are the largest investors in 41 United States' states and the second largest in the rest."
"One in twelve American factory workers is employed by European firms, and American companies employ three million workers in Europe."
"We are deeply interlocked, and that benefits both sides."
"But the heart of our relationship lies much deeper: we share many basic values, attitudes and interests; we cooperate to promote those common interests and values around the world in working for political stability, democracy, open trade and human rights, and that is why we are working together in Bosnia and Eastern Europe, and in promoting peace in the Middle East."
"These common interests have not been removed or reduced by the end of the Cold War but they may have to be refocused."
"Many of the issues we are now facing, such as globalization, climate change, the emergence of China, and drugs, are not the old issues of East-West confrontation but they are issues on which we stand together and on which we often take joint initiatives in multilateral fora."
"Against this background, the first theme in what I want to say today is that we have our differences - sometimes very serious - on a range of issues but we have to see them in context and keep them in proportion."
"Across the board the EU-US relationship is strong and deep."
"Perhaps it is because our ties are so fundamentally sound that we allow ourselves to voice our differences so openly and so frankly."
"When we agreed two years ago to launch the new transatlantic agenda, both sides saw the importance of having a comprehensive framework in which we could promote our cooperation in the very wide range of fields it covers."
"That has paved the way for a leap forward in the EU-US relationship."
"In the new transatlantic agenda we set four main priority areas for cooperation: promoting peace, stability, democracy and development; responding to global challenges; expanding world trade and closer economic relations; and building people-to-people bridges."
"We have made progress on all these fronts over the past two years, less than we might have dreamt of but creditable nonetheless."
"We are developing our foreign policy cooperation."
"We are making progress in working on global problems such as drugs, organized crime and trafficking in women."
"We have been able to deliver tangible benefits to our business and peoples through our collaboration in international organizations, such as the WTO, and also in our bilateral agreements, most recently the mutual recognition agreement covering six sectors and approximately $50 billion of trade."
"I was most glad to see that both Mrs Erika Mann's report on the new transatlantic agenda for the Committee on External Economic Relations and Mr Souchet's report on EU-US relations for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy acknowledge both the early fruits and the future potential of the new transatlantic agenda process."
"Let us not forget that the NTA is still young."
"We can and will do more."
"I am particularly concerned that we move forward to build what is described as the new transatlantic marketplace, drawing from the recommendations of the very successful transatlantic business dialogue by focusing on those barriers which really matter, while taking into account consumer and other interests on both sides of the Atlantic."
"Secondly, it is important to recognize that this is increasingly a relationship of equals."
"That is not always going to be very palatable in the United States but it is in both our long-term interests."
"The European Union can at times seem a frustrating partner for the US because of our institutional complexities and the mixture of national and Community competence."
"However, for all that, we are becoming more coherent in our external relations and increasingly acting as a single player on the international stage."
"As such, we will become an ever more capable partner of the US while having to cope with the US Congress, which often seems to us to be becoming inwardoriented and unilateral-minded."
"The European Union is already a fully equal partner of the US in international trade and we put that partnership to excellent use in leading the international agenda in trade and liberalization, whether you talk about the information technology agreement, telecoms or financial services which is due to be concluded on 12 December this year."
"If you look at the benefits of that very close cooperation with the US - what we do with each other in such areas as mutual recognition and what we do with each other vis-à-vis the rest of the world in providing joint leadership to bring about the very important international agreements which we have already achieved even this year - then that puts into perspective the negative effects of rulings by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body, such as in the bananas case."
"I am fully aware that many people see such rulings as the Americans using the WTO against the European Union."
"But let us also reflect that they represent a welcome move by the United States away from purely unilateral trade legislation and action and towards binding multilateral dispute settlement."
"We should not put into question the value of that just because we may not be comfortable with some of the decisions."
"I, for my part, shall not hesitate to propose to Member States that we should make full use of those rights, which we negotiated in the Uruguay Round and which we have used in many cases and will be using in the future - the Japan spirits case is a very good example - against the United States when it, in our view, has acted in breach of its WTO obligations."
"We, indeed, started the process of doing so in a case only this week where we thought that export subsidies in the United States were contrary to the rules."
"We shall use that quite as vigorously as anyone else."
"The trend to see the European Union as an equal partner to the United States is obviously going to be reinforced by the launching of economic and monetary union in January 1999."
"It is no coincidence that there is a welter of articles from the other side of the Atlantic - some alarmed, others alarming - but all focusing on the apparently new reality to the United States of economic and monetary union."
"The European Union, when that happens, will have a single currency which is appropriate, matching its status as the world's leading trading economy. And the euro will become a competitor with the dollar as a global currency."
"For a country which is so keen on competition, that should be something that is acceptable, if not always welcome."
"I am convinced that in monetary matters as in others, competition is healthy both for us and for the world as a whole."
"But it is extremely important, now that the reality is becoming more clear to the United States itself, that Europe and the United States begin more intensive discussion on the international implications of the introduction of the euro in order to avoid surprises and reap benefits."
"In this context I very much welcome the growing appreciation of EMU by the US administration."
"In a recent hearing in Congress the Under-Secretary of the Treasury, Mr Summers, testified that the US Government is now convinced that EMU will happen."
"US policy-makers are now starting to consider its effects on their economy and the international monetary system."
"The Treasury has advised American companies to speed up preparations for the euro."
"Let me now turn to the problem of extra-territorial legislation reflected in the Helms-Burton Act and the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, ILSA."
"These issues are of great concern to me, to the European Union's Member States and, of course, to Parliament."
"I am very much aware of the two resolutions adopted by the plenary concerning the Understanding reached with the United States on how to attempt to bridge our differences."
"I want to explain our policy on this important matter of principle - and this is my third point - taking into account the questions put forward by the honourable Members, Mrs González Alvarez, Mr Cabezón Alonso and Ms Oddy."
"I would like to thank the Members of the European Parliament US Interparliamentary Delegation and in particular, its chairman, Mr Alan Donnelly, for the great efforts that they have made to convey the depth and the width of European concern about these issues to members of the United States Congress."
"They have in fact gone beyond expressing concern."
"I welcome, in particular, Mr Donnelly's proposal to convene a transatlantic conference on Cuba next year."
"The root problem lies with the legislators."
"Given the prevailing mood on international issues in the American Congress, European parliamentarians have a central, and not a peripheral, role to play in presenting our views to them."
"In respect of Cuba, as also in the case of Libya and Iran, the tragedy is that we and the Americans share similar, if not identical, policy objectives: in Cuba, promotion of democracy, economic growth and human rights; in Iran and Libya, human rights, opposition to the promotion of international terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"The fundamental truth is that we are each other's strongest allies in seeking these objectives."
"We have taken many concrete steps in that direction in both cases, through our common position in Cuba and the measures we have taken against Iran and Libya."
"The presidency and President Santer informed President Clinton in detail about our counter-terrorism and non-proliferation measures against Iran and Libya at the May summit in The Hague."
"The European Union and the United States, jointly with Canada, have also subsequently greatly intensified their foreign policy dialogue on Iran."
"But the threat of secondary embargoes on European companies introduced under the Helms-Burton Act and ILSA has been a set-back to EU/US cooperation in tackling these problems. It has not helped the common objective."
"It has hindered it."
"We are of the opinion that such secondary embargoes are illegal in international law."
"But beyond that, they are counterproductive in policy terms."
"This has led to a huge diversion of energy and attention away from the real priorities of dealing with Cuba, Iran and Libya."
"I welcome the fact that there has emerged from this House a suggestion which will enable us to explain to the American public and Congress what we really are doing and the interests that we are advancing in those areas."
"But we had as our primary duty the obligation to protect European interests."
"To do so we turned to the WTO."
"It was the action taken in the WTO, and only that action, which led to the Understanding which I negotiated in April of this year, under which, in exchange for our suspending but not abandoning our WTO action, the American side agreed to work towards the granting of waivers, both of Title IV of Helms-Burton and under ILSA."
"The Helms-Burton waiver is linked to bilateral negotiations on disciplines for investments in illegally expropriated property on the one hand, but on principles relating to extra-territorial legislation, on the other hand."
"We had not reached agreement by the target date of 15 October but we are continuing to work and to consider how best we can reach an agreement."
"In order to reach such an agreement there has to be a readiness on the part of Congress to authorize waivers of both pieces of legislation in respect of the EU when the terms of the understanding have been fulfilled."
"It will require longer term agreement between us on the wider aspects of sanctions policy which may involve enhanced consultations regarding countries of concern."
"But it is clear that since the understanding was reached no action has been taken against any European company under either act."
"It is clear also that if action is taken against any European company that would render it, in my view, impossible to continue the suspension of the WTO panel and we would be right back there."
"I would also emphasize again that to be acceptable, any overall settlement must cover not only the negotiations on Helms-Burton but also protection for European companies against the effects of the ILSA Act."
"We consider that the European Union fully qualifies for a waiver under ILSA and that obviously includes Total, which signed an agreement fully compatible with Community and international law."
"Let me conclude my remarks now by briefly looking at some of the other subjects which are likely to be covered at the summit."
"Complementing the Presidency's remarks, I imagine our foreign policy discussions will be focused on how to increase EU-US complementary efforts in support of the stalled Middle East peace process."
"We will ask the US to press all parties to implement the full terms of the Oslo agreements."
"The other major topic will be the possibility of strengthening the economic reform process in Ukraine."
"Climate change, as has been mentioned, will obviously play a major role at this summit, which takes place just prior to the ministerial part of the Kyoto climate conference and, difficult as it seems, it must be our common aim to bring Kyoto to a successful conclusion."
"On bilateral trade we reserve the right to point to the discriminatory draft American implementation rules of the GATS Basic Telecoms Agreement as well as to the raising tide of unilateral sanctions legislation at state level in the United States."
"And no doubt the Americans will raise their concerns about the risks to trade of any ban on specified risk materials used in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics."
"I also have no doubt that the question of genetically modified crops will also be raised."
"There may also, I hope, be two forward-looking presidential statements."
"I say 'I hope' because the preparations for the summit have not yet been completed and we are still working on these issues."
"First, a statement on increased regulatory cooperation between the European Union and the United States' authorities with a view to improving effective market access for our exports to each other while maintaining the necessary high standard of protection for health, safety, consumers and the environment."
"When negotiating the mutual recognition agreement, which was the top priority of the business communities, it became very clear that there was ample need for much greater cooperation between the regulatory authorities."
"A second declaration will, I hope, give electronic commerce a major boost by establishing common principles which will help guide its development across the Atlantic and around the world."
"The growing importance of new people-topeople links across the Atlantic will be reflected by the envisaged signature of the Science and Technology Agreement with the United States, providing new opportunities for our scientists and scientific institutions to collaborate on cutting-edge issues."
"I have no doubt that this House, and the Presidency and the Commission, will look at the relationship in the round, its beneficial features, the problems - warts and all - as well as the opportunities."
"I am quite confident that a robust defence of European interests is not inconsistent with the advance of common interests, quite the reverse: it facilitates the resolution of problems, which enables us to go on to work closely together."
"It is in that spirit and with these aspirations that we approach the forthcoming summit."
"Thank you Sir Leon."
"I think that was one of the longest Commission speeches ever made in this place."
"I assume you were carried along by the interest you have on this subject and by how important you think it is."
"And I agree with you which is why I did not ask you to wind up before the 20 minutes - double the time of the Council."
"However, it has been a most interesting speech and I hope this is also the opinion of colleagues."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Mr Commissioner, I think it is proper that the speech from Commissioner Leon Brittan was somewhat longer than usual because it was a very full and important speech."
"The Commissioner has shown that the USA and Europe are both partners and competitors at the same time."
"He was very optimistic that we are increasingly becoming equal partners."
"I do not know if everyone sees it like that, especially in the United States of America, or else Helms-Burton or D'Amato might perhaps be viewed differently, and then things might perhaps be viewed differently at McDonnell-Douglas and Boeing, and British Airways and American Airlines, too."
"It still seems to me that the view is that Europe has to adhere to bilateral and multilateral agreements, but that America is fully entitled, every so often, when it suits its own interests, to make unilateral arrangements or even unilateral resolutions."
"This is no doubt to do with the fact, Mr Commissioner, that in many areas we hold very varying opinions in Europe itself."
"You mentioned Bosnia and the Middle East."
"We are still not so far down the road that we support the same code, and it is precisely where the Middle East is concerned that I agree with you."
"It is not acceptable that Europe should be putting a lot of money in this area, to no avail, because America is exerting too little pressure here to really bring about a peace process through the appropriate attitude of Israel."
"I would like to give you my whole-hearted support where Helms-Burton, D'Amato and other acts are concerned."
"Europe can be ready for compromise on the detail, but not on the substance; it should be clear that - if, for instance, action is taken against a company - the waiver must cease, for then we must be prepared for argument and debate at the WTO."
"I also agree with you: it is good that we now have breathing space, but it is only breathing space and not an overall settlement, and I would like to support you in your efforts to bring about an overall settlement."
"One last point in view of the time: fast-track negotiations, talks in the USA, failure and the consequences."
"I believe the USA is in a similar situation to us, without overestimating the question we need to ask together - and I stress together - namely: How can we carry out and implement free trade in the world if at the same time there are many economic and, particularly, social problems connected with this form of trade?"
"We are supporters of free trade because we gain from it."
"Yet we need to make it clear to our own people, just as it is necessary for President Clinton to do so in the USA, that free and fair trade are compatible, that, with all free trade, the trade must be fair in the eyes of our citizens."
"In this sense it is an important assignment to conduct these talks with the United States of America, at this summit and beyond."
"In this respect, may I wish you, Mr Commissioner, a pleasant and successful trip to America, which you will be embarking on tomorrow, I believe?"
"Mr President, I warmly welcome the two statements which we have had this afternoon."
"There is no criticism of anyone for speaking too long."
"It was extremely clear and very beneficial that we should be able to have such a statement before what will be an important summit meeting early in December."
"Therefore I welcome the statements made."
"We can recognize the significant progress made when we look at all the issues which are now under discussion concerning something which is barely two years old, the new transatlantic agenda."
"However, it is important to stress why this summit in particular has its importance."
"The danger is that we have at present a number of differences, as the Commissioner has pointed out, but we also have an overwhelming bundle of common interests."
"Will we be falling into a trap, not through lack of interest but a lack of priority, when we come to deal with the introduction of the single currency, as the Commissioner mentioned, and as we come to the question of enlargement eastwards?"
"It will not be simply through lack of interest but through lack of priority in dealing with the transatlantic relationship that all these issues that we have heard enumerated today could go further down our list of priorities and not get the attention they need in six or twelve months' time."
"Attached to this, it is rather evident to us in the political field that all the issues under discussion between the administrations also have their political context."
"Increasingly economic issues, whether sanctions or the building up of a new transatlantic market-place, will require this House and the US Congress to be involved in some way, whether in the shaping of regulations or the stimulus of finance or whatever else is necessary to ensure that this new transatlantic agenda is successful."
"I would like to ask three questions of the Council and the Commission in terms of this summit meeting."
"Firstly, will the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission, when they both go to the summit, ensure there is a long-term perspective built into the summit conclusions so that we know we are working together on both sides of the Atlantic to shape a longer term transatlantic partnership?"
"Secondly, could we ensure that such a perspective looks forward to the 21st century, where we could think of having a comprehensive institutional framework, perhaps a treaty."
"Then you could bring in the political communities alongside the business communities, to work with the administrations to create this new transatlantic relationship."
"Lastly, would the Commissioner like to say a little bit more on the new transatlantic market-place which I know he stressed is an important concept?"
"We will have to define that concept."
"Perhaps it is at this summit in Washington that the green light can be given to that examination."
"Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, the new transatlantic agenda, agreed in December 1995 in Madrid, underlines and confirms the joint efforts of the European Union and the United States to extend and deepen their relationship."
"The liberal group is therefore pleased with the success of the Transatlantic Business Dialogue."
"In this framework, many trade barriers have been demolished since November 1995."
"The most important examples of this are the Multilateral Recognition Agreements."
"The MRAs will stimulate international trade and lower the cost for business and the consumer."
"I therefore very much regret the protectionist attitude of the American Congress at present, which seriously hinders the implementation of existing agreements and the reaching of new ones."
"Trade encourages business growth and is thus crucial to employment."
"I therefore hope and expect that Congress will abandon this wrong track, and return to its traditional liberal attitude regarding free trade."
"On behalf of my group I also call on the Commissioner to implement this Parliament's resolutions on the trade disagreements with the United States."
"The EU-USA summit in the Hague was very successful and for the first time emphasized the importance of the relationship between citizens on both sides of the ocean."
"This is invaluable to our long term relationship."
"During the summit in Washington this will be furthered by means of a Thai project which encourages electronic exchange between citizens."
"In addition, the signing of the agreement on scientific and technological cooperation signifies a milestone within the new transatlantic agenda."
"I would finally like to ask Commissioner Brittan whether he can advise Parliament on the summit with Canada which will take place on the fourth of December."
"Canada is another transatlantic partner, and moreover, the Union has a joint action plan with it."
"I would like to have your answer on this, Mr Brittan."
"Mr President, we have heard today quite a lot about achievements, intense discussions and indeed some problems with our partners on the other side of the Atlantic."
"There is no doubt that negotiations at the Washington summit or wherever else have to proceed whenever dissent emerges as a substantial obstacle to the transatlantic agenda and dialogue."
"It is also true that in some cases negotiations per se, in particular with protracted deadlines, serve only the purpose of the other side."
"The troublesome case of Helms-Burton should have taught us a bitter lesson by now."
"Since 11 April there have been seven or eight rounds of negotiation between the European Union and the United States; on the European side naturally some satisfaction has been expressed in that Title IV and the suspension of the United States sanctions have spared some but not all European companies, while, by the way, hitting hard firms outside Europe."
"At the same time an atmosphere of intimidation and fear has been created and continuously fuelled as a result of threatening statements by some congressmen."
"The results are in front of us."
"Trade between the countries of the Union and Cuba has been drastically reduced."
"Investments are being cut or halted to the levels of 1996."
"In other words, Helms-Burton is operative."
"It works wonders for the USA while endless negotiations go on with only some barking and very little bite in this House and in Brussels."
"May we suggest that the time has come to fix a deadline - let us say 31 December - and then go for the only option available, recourse to the WTO panel."
"We would like very much to have a clear-cut opinion from the Commission on the matter of a deadline concerning negotiation, on Helms-Burton or, for that matter, the D'Amato Act."
"Mr President, patting each other on the back is the last thing we want in these days before the EU/USA summit."
"Because there are a whole lot of issues missing from the new transatlantic agenda that belong in any dialogue committed to the environment and the welfare of the people."
"This dialogue, which we undoubtedly need, must be both a critical one and one capable of withstanding criticism among friends."
"False friends are no use to anybody."
"And right at the top of the list of priorities of the two largest economic blocs in the world should not be the kowtowing to company interests, but rather political guidance in the direction of world peace, socially and ecologically sustainable regulation of the global economy, and equal participation of all countries, especially the weaker ones."
"It is also absurd to push for a multilateral trading system under the aegis of the WTO, on the one hand, while pursuing special bilateral paths, on the other, that exclude and disadvantage the rest of the world for the protection of your own economy."
"The opposite course would be more appropriate: common concern for greater consumer protection, raising the standard of the existing social environment, and providing better public information."
"Preparations for the next WTO Conference of Ministers should also be on the agenda."
"Because substantial proposals in the areas of social and environmental standards need to be made early."
"Genetically modified soya, hormone-treated beef also need to be banned from our menus according to the WTO text."
"The EU should also remind its friends of its homework in Kyoto and Ottawa, where in December the international agreement banning land mines is to be adopted."
"Because we have a global responsibility."
"We do not need a fortress Europe nor a hegemonic US superpower."
"Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, please persuade your group to allow more than a minute and a half. It is only natural that you cannot express your thoughts in such a short time."
"Mr President, transatlantic dialogue will only be truly fruitful and the meeting of 5 December will only be a truly useful stage in this dialogue, if both make moves towards the settlement of a series of major legal and commercial disputes, which today oppose the European Union and the United States of America."
"I am therefore delighted with the announcement that we have just had, stating that the Helms-Burton law was on the agenda."
"More broadly, we believe that the very serious question of the extra-territorial application of national American legislation should be raised to its full extent."
"We have the strongest regrets that the bilateral concertation in October did not end up with substantial progress in this area."
"However, it is essential for the European Union to stifle perverse practises such as these at birth, for if not, we risk proliferation in the future."
"The path chosen by the Commission at the time of the Uruguay-Round was to make European countries pay a high price, in counterpart to the United States renunciation of unilateral practices."
"If the United States continues with unilateralism, we shall have been sold a pup."
"We therefore have to show the greatest firmness on this question of principle, and if necessary, brandish the threat of credible sanctions, and for this purpose, ensure we have the indispensable instruments for a foreign trade policy."
"Has the strategy of the Commission been the right one?"
"Was renouncing the WTO panel, albeit on a non-definitive basis in consideration of a very fragile assurance of short-term non-application of the Helms-Burton legislation to European companies, the best possible choice?"
"There is reason to believe not, as instead of seeking a definitive elimination of legislation whose illegality is beyond all doubt, we have contributed to maintaining a climate of legal unsafeness, which is detrimental to our companies, and which may have dissuasive and paralyzing effects."
"The laws remain on the books, and may be used at any time a chance event may cause the American administration to put an end to the moderate way in which the matter is now handled."
"Furthermore, leaving such legislation on the books unchanged may only encourage other lobbies to mobilize and - at the federal, state, and local authority levels - impose new legislations with extra-territorial effect, as we have seen with Massachusetts."
"Our interest therefore, Mr President, is to put a complete end to this very pernicious trend."
"Hence, it is essential at the meeting of 5 December that we raise the awareness of our interlocutors as to the serious and very harmful effects that these provisions may have on the climate of transatlantic relationships."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was not surprised when I heard the Council and the Commission."
"But even so, I was astonished not to hear a single word about the asymmetry in the relationships between Europe and the United States at present."
"When I use the word 'asymmetry' to avoid using the word, ' colonization.'"
"Political and military colonization - and just see what happened in the discussion between France and the United States over the NATO southern command."
"Commercial and economic dissymmetry - did the Commissioner speak about the three million workers in Europe whose livelihood depend on American decisions? That is unilateral, and what about the other side?"
"Cultural colonization - just look at the tidal wave from the American sub-culture which is swamping our television screens and the cultural universe of the European youth."
"Building a bridge over the Atlantic under such conditions would be to set up a one-way traffic lane, reduce barriers, and allow the strongest to become even stronger at our expense."
"Not a word either about Iraq, this virtual genocide under which nearly a million Iraqi children have suffered to date. All that in the name of human rights, which is really an extraordinary position."
"Not a word about the scandalous cartel between Boeing and McDonell-Douglas. Not a word about the scandalous policy of American domination in the Balkans."
"Not a word about the discussion which might affect the steel market, the electrical construction markets, the agricultural markets, where America is wholly dominant."
"Of course, the Helms-Burton law has been mentioned."
"The truth is that the American empire has won three world wars."
"With the First World War, it got rid of the German and the Austrian-Hungarian empires."
"With the Second World War, it got rid of the British and French Empires, and with the Third World War - the Cold War, in fact - it got rid of the Soviet Empire."
"Fine."
"But the result of all that, is that we now have an American superpower, which is colonizing the whole world."
"We expected just a little resistance from Europe, in the face of this unilateral process."
"Mr President, may I say I welcome Sir Leon's remarks on the WTO."
"I would wish, on behalf of my group, to underline his point that we cannot think the WTO is a good body when it finds in our favour and a bad body when it finds against us."
"However, I do think that if the European Commission actually withdraws its case on HelmsBurton, having satisfied European interests, then it would be undermining the WTO itself."
"This debate does raise a very important question of what we feel is a very dangerous emerging democratic deficit in the new global world order which, to some extent, this transatlantic dialogue can offset."
"I was moved to make these remarks by Sir Leon's use of the expression 'diversion of attention' when talking of Congress's attitude to Helms-Burton."
"Politicians can play an important role as intermediaries, but it is important that non-elected politicians, as you choose to be nowadays Sir Leon, are aware that it is a two-way process."
"All too often politicians - and they sometimes volunteer themselves - have to be intermediaries in explaining to the electorate decisions taken by other people about which they sometimes feel uneasy."
"Politicians also have another role and that is representing the views of the electorate to decision-makers."
"Although politically I have no sympathy whatsoever with Jesse Helms, as an elected politician I do have some sympathy with the rights of people who are elected to put forward legislation which they feel reflects the views of their own voters."
"Unless we are careful we will see a very dangerous discrepancy develop between what is decided amongst the great and the good and what needs to be encouraged and explained to the electorate."
"In that respect I would hope that the transatlantic dialogue will develop a democratic arm and include more and more elected politicians as a small step to getting beyond what is, I repeat, a rather dangerous emerging democratic deficit in this new world trading order."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and Sir Leon Brittan for their report and the insight they have given us."
"I believe that over the last few years a lot has been achieved by the work of the Commission in particular."
"Good relations between Europe and the United States have provided for freedom, peace, more human rights, stability and prosperity over the last decades."
"We need to see to it that this is kept alive in the future, while appreciating too that, because of the new world order, the end to power bloc confrontation, the diminished significance of alliances forged through military threat, the strengthening of the European Union to the point of monetary union, things have changed to such an extent that we need to find new responses to the mechanisms and that NATO alone cannot be relied upon to maintain transatlantic relations."
"I think we should see beyond the transatlantic declaration, beyond the transatlantic agenda, to how we might use the momentum from the successful work of recent years to strengthen these relations."
"It is precisely the decision in regard to Helms-Burton, the inability of the American President to push fast-track through in Congress, which shows that things will only work if we can bring this together at a political level that also includes the American Congress."
"Anything else, I believe, is impossible if we wish to improve relations long term."
"I think that is why a transatlantic market-place with clear objectives and a timetable is very important, to maintain the momentum while providing a framework for a treaty which takes in the democratic institutions of the European Union and the United States."
"In this way it can be made clear that the common interest is greater than the individual interests which are asserted at times."
"Mr Commissioner, I should first like to thank you for answering a number of questions which could not be answered yesterday for lack of time."
"Secondly, as I have only one minute, I shall refer solely to the question of the extra-territorial application of legislation, which, as you can see, is of concern to everyone taking part in this debate."
"And this is for two reasons, I believe: firstly, because the United States seems to be trying to impose a model of political and trade relations whereby it decides how and when everyone else should trade; and secondly, because a number of us have the feeling that by withdrawing its complaint before the WTO and continuing to negotiate on illegal laws, the European Union is contributing to the illegal embargo on Cuba that has existed for years."
"The European Union must not contribute to this, because, as you are well aware, in the last vote in the United Nations, the General Assembly condemned the embargo as illegal by an overwhelming majority, and therefore condemned the Helms-Burton Act."
"I believe that the European Union must adopt a vigorous stance vis-à-vis the United States, and must not enter into negotiations on the Helms-Burton Act, but affirm that act is illegal."
"I believe that a superpower like the United States will be far more impressed by sincerity and the vigorous defence of principles - principles, which, as you can see, all the Members of this Parliament are calling on you to uphold."
"In any event, I am aware that the agenda is very broad, and I wish you luck."
"Mrs González Alvarez, I will make the same comment to you: that your group should take more than a minute."
"I feel very bad when I have to interrupt a colleague after just one minute but, goodness me, the groups should allow two or three minutes."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the President-in-Office and Sir Leon Brittan not only for their excellent presentations this afternoon but for the real commitment that has been shown by the Commission and the Council to deepening the relationship with the United States of America."
"There are the Cassandras in this House and in the American Congress who will use any issue to say that the transatlantic relationship is not working, that it is disastrous and should not be continued."
"The fact is that the relationship between Europe and the United States is the most important relationship that exists on this planet."
"This is particularly so now that the Congress has refused fast-track for trade negotiations for the US President."
"We have to step up our activity in trying to deepen the relationship."
"You cannot simply allow this dynamic to fail."
"We have to look at new ways: people-to-people links, education establishments, diplomats, politicians and trade negotiators working more closely to try to make the Congress understand that this relationship between Europe and the United States is so important for our mutual future."
"That is why I hope when the transatlantic summit meeting takes place in a few weeks' time, that rather than being just a thin audit of what has gone on in the past it pushes the agenda further forward, in particular on electronic commerce, fighting crime and fighting organized crime and drug trafficking in the third pillar areas."
"We should look for new ways of cooperation."
"This House has a responsibility - and I say this to all the political groups represented here this afternoon."
"You cannot expect the civil servants - this is the point Michael Hindley was making - to deal with the US Congress."
"It is up to us as politicians to deal with the US Congress."
"We have to speak to them, we have to meet them regularly, we have to solve this problem."
"That is why I hope that in the context of the work of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, the Committee on External Economic Relations, the delegation for relations with the United States, we will look very carefully over the next month or two months at ways of talking to the Congress, of deepening that relationship, in particular with the new Congressmen and Congresswomen who simply do not have a grasp of the international relations that exist between Europe and the United States."
"It is our responsibility, not the responsibility of the Commission or the Council."
"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming summit between the European Union and the United States is perhaps a decisive and definitive opportunity to test whether or not the European Union has its own voice, and whether or not it has institutions whose actions are governed by the will to defend Community political and economic interests."
"It is therefore important that in December the Council and the Commission should be capable of preventing the United States from continuing to maintain and impose arrangements which run contrary to the guidelines that have been agreed multilaterally."
"It is obvious that the existing rules on competition in the agricultural sector, or in the aeronautical, naval or audio-visual industries, should be just as valid on the east or the west coast of the Atlantic."
"It is fundamental to ensure that the WTO genuinely operates independently of American interests, as regards the protection of public health, the predicted death of Community banana producers, or the pure and simple rejection of those legislative attacks on human rights, the so-called Helms-Burton or d'Amato-Kennedy Acts."
"Mr President, Sir Leon Brittan, Minister, I have heard of the success you have had in recent times, and it is impressive."
"Indeed, we cannot claim that there was too little on the new transatlantic agenda, rather we can assume there was too much."
"Perhaps that is one of the problems."
"The sweep of political and economic issues really does extend from trade disputes, via the question of how we are to deal with extra-territorial legislation, to a whole range of political questions: What are we doing in the Ukraine?"
"What are we doing in the Baltic?"
"What are we doing in the Middle East?"
"How can we bring our citizens together in future, and how can they reasonably participate in this new transatlantic agenda which politicians and economists have got off the ground?"
"All this is very sensible."
"However, I believe we have to shoulder a special political responsibility, and by this I am referring now to the three institutions that are active on the side of the European Union."
"I believe we need to add two things to the overall range of issues just mentioned on the political and economic agenda, and we should do this in the next half year. Firstly, we should bring people more into the dialogue we are conducting."
"We have conceived four dialogues: one for the citizens, one for the small and medium-size companies, one for the flagship generally, namely the Transatlantic Business Dialogue, and one dialogue for the workers and trade unions."
"We know we have considerable problems apart from in the area of the Transatlantic Business Dialogue."
"We need to do something here; this is part of the responsibility we need to assume, and we need to do it together."
"The second thing we must do, and this will not be any less dramatic: we need to include ourselves as parliamentarians in this form of the work."
"It will not do that we have a political and economic agenda, but not a parliamentary one."
"We need to ensure that we are included in future in all the arrangements you come to and in all forms of agreement you make, including the issue of the transatlantic market-place - and that we are included by means of the codecision procedure."
"I think we can come to a sensible form of cooperation in this area too!"
"Mr President, I just wish to support most of what has been said in this debate this afternoon."
"This is not a particularly controversial issue between the various sides of this House."
"There is a general assumption that we want to maintain and improve relationships at all levels in the United States - the administration and the Congress."
"I welcome the very full introduction to the debate from Sir Leon Brittan."
"Without being - and certainly not wishing to be - churlish, I would, however, like to suggest that he adds one thing to his list, which appeared to be omitted, and that is the suggestion that there should be much closer cooperation between the competition authorities on this side of the Atlantic and those on the other side, notably the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission."
"There have been some highly controversial competition issues in recent months in our relationship with the United States - Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas being one, Guinness and Grand Met being another, and KPMG and Ernst & Young being potentially another."
"Those of us who belong to the delegation were reassured by the promise we had from Commissioner Van Miert to try to work towards closer relationships between competition authorities on both sides."
"Sir Leon mentioned the need for closer cooperation between regulatory authorities but I would respectfully suggest that competition is a rather different matter."
"One other thing I should like to add to the shopping list is the suggestion that every time there is a transatlantic summit we have a debate like this, with the representative of the Commission and the representative of the Council coming to talk to Parliament, just as they did this afternoon."
"Mr President, relations between the European Union and the United States must be set in the political sphere, but in today's world of globalization, politics are inseparable from economics, and I should therefore like to refer to a number of trade issues."
"I believe that the European Union must vigorously defend its interests, and must affirm its identity as a unified and coherent whole, both in the field of the aeronautical industry - to which other speakers have just referred - and in the field of the World Trade Organization, where the European Union has lost its cases before the panels on hormone-treated beef and the EU banana regime. And I hope that the negotiations that Sir Leon Brittan is carrying out on behalf of the Commission will enable us to ensure that the European Union's interests are adequately defended and that the chosen method of consensus will not prejudice Community action."
"I should quickly like to ask the Commissioner a few questions specifically concerning the difficulties that President Clinton has encountered in securing the celebrated fast-track powers from the US Congress."
"What implications does this have for the new transatlantic agenda?"
"Does the Commissioner consider that the fact that President Clinton has not, for the moment, secured those powers from the US Congress will somehow mean that he will not secure the necessary powers to modify Title III of the Helms Burton Act?"
"And, lastly, in view of the fact that he has not, for the moment, secured those powers, will the European Union take advantage of this window of opportunity to increase its commercial presence in, and develop commercial ties with, the countries of Latin America?"
"Mr President, straight away I would like to express my gratitude to all those who actively participated in this debate."
"I think we all agree in recognizing that transatlantic dialogue is extremely important, not only out of technical and commercial considerations, but also because the foreign trade and direct foreign investment figures testify to very major economic ties between the European Union and the United States of America."
"As regards the results obtained to date, I think it can be said, although there are some areas requiring improvement, that the overall assessment is broadly positive, particularly as transatlantic dialogue got underway some two years ago only."
"There exist, as you emphasized in a number of your speeches, clear differences, and I would say that these are on occasion striking differences, between the approaches adopted by the United States and the European Union."
"Witness the notorious Helms-Burton and d'Amato laws, and the European position with regard to them."
"I therefore wholeheartedly agree with what Sir Leon Brittan said to you."
"I think it is perfectly unacceptable, and Europe should say as much loud and clear at the summit."
"And since we are talking about critical dialogue, I think that the placing on the agenda of a debate on these two laws provides clear proof that the European Union intends to defend its commercial interests vigorously."
"Partnership has been mentioned."
"Some have said that we were under American dominance or hegemony."
"Others have already mentioned partnership between equals."
"For my part, I would say that we are perhaps midway between a partnership between equals, and that European monetary union will be a key element in achieving that equality of partnership."
"Let me explain myself, Mr President. In July 1995, I was privileged to attend an official visit of our Prime Minister, Mr Juncker, to the United States."
"At the time, we spoke a great deal about the project of economic and monetary union in the European Union with President Clinton's administration and the relevant officers of state."
"At the time, nobody in the United States believed in it, and all were ready to lay money on the fact that we would be unable to rise to the challenge and achieve economic and monetary union."
"I think that the fears that are now being expressed in certain quarters of the United States - the American Congress and the corporate sector - show that the completion of economic and monetary union is essential for the commercial and economic policies of the European Union at world level."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to say a word about our policy as part of the WTO."
"I would quote something Mrs Lalumière said, if I am not mistaken: united we can do a great deal."
"I hope that we will be united and remain united, as in these last few weeks, and particularly during the Florence euro-workshop, where we saw that there was a broad consensus on the future agenda for the WTO."
"I think I can say that we will have great solidarity between ourselves on this dossier, which is a particularly important one for the European Union and the Member States, and here I mean financial services."
"If we are able to show the same cohesiveness as for other dossiers, for example, telecommunications services, the meeting at the ministerial level of the WTO on 11 December in Geneva will be a great success for the European Union. That is my hope."
"On the other hand, much is being said on the settlement of disputes relating to the WTO, where we have, I would say, lost a battle or two."
"This should prompt us to reflect on how to reinforce or even change procedures in the settlement of disputes."
"We are open to discussions on this subject."
"But I would say that the system currently in force, even if it is not always satisfactory at the multilateral level, is far better suited to the defence of commercial interests than the unilateralism practised earlier by the Americans."
"That already is an important point."
"On the other hand, the question has been raised as to President Clinton's chances of getting the fast track adopted."
"Firstly, there is the major summit meeting, where I do not doubt for an instant that the presidency of the Council and the Commission will once again place their arguments on the table."
"Having said that, this extremely important political dialogue, at the Presidency and Commission level, which takes place every two years, deserves to be pushed on to completion."
"On this point, I believe that all those in this House who have pleaded in favour of a more active role in this Parliament in the political dialogue with members of the American Congress are right."
"Indeed, I believe that there is a role not only for the Commission, and for the Council, but also for the Parliament."
"The agenda was also raised, and it was said that subjects such as Iraq were not on it."
"Mr President, in my speech I specified that the agenda for this summit with the United States made room for discussions on negotiations on peace in the Middle East."
"It is quite clear, after the events of the last few weeks, that the question of Iraq will be raised. I have no doubt whatsoever about this."
"Mr President, we have also been asked whether we took into account the long term, whether we had made plans to discuss themes relating to the future."
"The agenda that we are now finalizing expresses the desire on the European side to deal with subjects which will play a useful role in the real development of our relations with the United States in years to come."
"Mr President, I have no time to say more."
"I will add just one thing."
"I find the Presidency's appearance in this House prior to every summit an interesting idea."
"But there is another idea which I find interesting, which is to come and keep you informed, at your December session, of the results of this summit."
"I very much agree with Mr Swoboda in his statement that it is necessary for us to enlist the public in an understanding of why trade liberalization with the United States and working with the United States and the rest of the world is desirable."
"I certainly can assure Mr Elles that there will be a long-term perspective for what we are trying to do with the United States and the question of the appropriate framework for the new transatlantic marketplace to be developed further is one which is very much to the fore of my own thoughts, even if I am not able to give a conclusion to it today."
"As far as the Canada summit is concerned, I would say to Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel that we will be focusing mainly upon the devolution with Canada of progress following our agreement with Canada, which has been considerable."
"To Mr Manisco on the Helms-Burton issue, I would say that we are actively negotiating."
"I do not think it is useful to announce a deadline at the moment."
"If you are negotiating, it is only worth negotiating if there is any sign of progress."
"We are not interested in negotiating to eternity without any prospect of a result."
"That I very much agree with."
"I do not think it is right to say, as Mr Souchet has said, that we are operating on the basis of no definitive solution to the problem."
"We are seeking a definitive solution."
"It is not right to say that we have withdrawn from the WTO."
"We have suspended it and reserve the right to return at any time, I would point out to Mrs Gonzalez Alvarez."
"As far as Mr Hindley and others who have advocated Parliamentary participation in the new transatlantic agenda are concerned, I welcome that."
"I would add that the new transatlantic agenda specifically refers to that possibility and it is up to Parliamentarians to make the most of it."
"Similarly, those such as Mrs Erika Mann, who spoke of bringing people in to a greater extent. Again, I would welcome that."
"As to the fast-track, I agree with Mr Donnelly that the problems over the fast-track mean that we should step up the dialogue."
"I believe that the European/US dialogue is a way both of increasing the chances that fast-track may nonetheless be passed and also of making progress in the absence of fast-track."
"It is certainly true, as Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra has said, that there is a window of opportunity for us in South America."
"I would like us to take up that opportunity, not just because the United States has injured itself by not passing the fast-track, but also for its own sake."
"To Mr Cassidy I would say, yes, a cooperation of competition authorities is very much part of the game."
"We are actively negotiating a second and supplementary agreement with the United States which would build on the one that we already have, which would enable the principles of positive comity to be applied more systematically."
"That is an important part of the agenda."
"Sir Leon, your contribution to this debate has been extremely interesting."
"We have accepted 8 motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37, paragraph 2 of the Rules of Procedure."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"The debate is closed."
"Votes"
"Mr President, there were four problems to be solved if the reform of the European Union envisaged by the Maastricht Treaty was to become a reality: the elimination of the constitutional democratic deficit of a Union from above and of a Europe of the intergovernmental conference; the elimination of the institutional deficit of a Union without legal personality, of dualism, the pillar-and-space structure lacking any single competence to act in the matter of peace and legal policy; the elimination of the legal framework deficit in the confusion of Union, Community and international law; and finally the elimination of the paralyzing lack of clarity as to how future integration and enlargement measures should be carried out to finally overcome the East-West divide in Europe."
"It is not a case of denying the partial improvements made to the Maastricht Treaty by Amsterdam when pointing out the lack of a solution still to these fundamental problems."
"No-one is going to devalue the efforts of the two rapporteurs on Amsterdam. But their report remains ambiguous in regard to these fundamental problems and is therefore unacceptable to my group."
"In view of the failure of the Intergovernmental Conference it is not so vital whether this House recommends accepting the Amsterdam Treaty or not."
"Rather, what is central is whether the European Parliament limits itself to being a proud co-mover of partial institutional reforms or whether it finally rouses itself to become the leading voice in a constitutional process, the heart and nerves of the next crucial steps towards integration!"
"(Applause from the Green Group)"
"Mr President, I voted against the report because I did not wish to be party to a utilization of the European Parliament by national parties and national governments, which not only serves to undermine the sovereignty of the European Parliament, but equally the sovereignty of the national parliaments themselves, because these are the bodies that have the decisive word at the moment in the ratification process."
"This dilemma that we have with this decision suggests that now is the time to get serious with a central claim, which states: old-type Intergovernmental Conferences like this are no longer in the position to drive European integration forward!"
"Precisely because this is the case it only works if we say that, in the ratification process for Amsterdam, we need to ensure that the next intergovernmental conference takes place with the European Parliament enjoying codecision."
"Otherwise we can leave everything the way it is!"
"Mr president, I too voted against this resolution."
"The reason was that I do not believe that the intergovernmental conference is any longer the right way to further the development of the European union."
"It is in many respects a failure."
"I believe it will, for example, lead to the European parliament's inability to effectively influence amendments to the treaty."
"Europol is a good example of how the protection by law of citizens is in danger when governments are disinclined to give either the European Parliament or national assemblies sufficient powers of democratic supervision."
"The other example of an inter-governmental conference's ineptitude in solving these fundamental problems is EMU."
"The issue is whether in formulating economic and monetary union we will have created an essentially federalist part of the EU, while there will be a move to administer it as if it were an inter-governmental project."
"With that, the democracy deficit and the future lack of central bank control is clear."
"I think we ought to switch to the kind of constitutional legal process whereby the rights of citizens would be an important ingredient in the debate."
"Mr President, the European Parliamentary Labour Party, on whose behalf I speak, broadly welcomes the Amsterdam Treaty, not as something that is perfect but as something that contains many good things."
"In particular, we know that our constituents would welcome the UK opt-in to the Social Chapter, the provision for Europe-wide legislation against discrimination and the new protocol on animal welfare."
"There are also many other things we welcome."
"However, we have some reservations about the final report and while we have kept our separate votes to a minimum, nevertheless we have voted against five parts: the first indent of paragraph 8 on border controls; the first indent to paragraph 9 on a common defence policy; the second indent of paragraph 12 extending codecision to fiscal policy; the fourth indent to paragraph 12 giving the Union and the Community a single legal personality; and, the third indent of paragraph 16, restricting unanimity to constitutional areas."
"With those provisos we can broadly welcome both the report - and we congratulate the rapporteurs on their work - and the Amsterdam Treaty."
"We support the Amsterdam Treaty and agree with Parliament's appeal to the national parliaments to ratify the treaty."
"It is a success for political cooperation in the area of the environment, equal opportunity and, above all, employment."
"We also welcome the principle of increased openness and the citizens' access to documents."
"We do not support the demand for a common defence, and in a special supplementary proposal we have pointed out that the position of the non-aligned states must be respected."
"We share the view that a number of institutional questions must be solved in connection with enlargement."
"Regarding the decision on increased use of majority voting, we are not prepared to support the report's far-reaching demands for common majority voting."
"We do not therefore support the second and third points of paragraph 16."
"Nor do we support majority decision-making in the area of cultural policy (paragraph 12, eleventh point). We consider that to be mainly a question for the individual Member States."
"After having indicated the paragraphs on which we have a dissenting view, partly through voting and partly through this explanation of vote, we voted for the report in the final vote."
"We think that it is an important signal to the citizens of Europe that the Intergovernmental Conference was successful on several issues which are important to citizens."
"We are saying no to the Treaty of Amsterdam, which is a further step towards pushing down nations."
"This is not what the peoples want."
"A survey recently undertaken by the Commission itself across Europe, showed that 8 % of those questioned only were favourable to a European superstate, 40 % were in favour of cooperation without loss of national sovereignty, and 38 % were in favour of cooperation accompanied by jointly pooled competencies in limited fields, and finally 14 % were for strict national independence without cooperation."
