"With regard to our talks with the ECB, it was hugely disappointing to learn from the press that the ECB had long been aware of the system for which we are now creating a legal basis and which has been publicised in the media and that the ECB knew what SWIFT was doing with the United States."
"I am not trying to link two issues here, but it is surely obvious that what we are doing here is rubber-stamping a by creating a system after the event and putting it on a legal basis."
"It would have been very helpful – and this is not addressed to the Commission, because the fault does not lie with it – if an institution like the ECB had said ‘We know that such things are happening, and we want to cooperate with you to develop a sound legal basis on which to create provisions that protect the fundamental rights of our population, particularly in relation to the United States’."
"The United States is, of course, a transatlantic partner of ours."
"I would never question that, particularly as a German."
"Yet we are starting to think things over. It is not only the recent disclosure of events in connection with SWIFT."
"There was also the issue of storing aircraft passengers’ personal data, we suspected the existence of secret prisons, there were secret flights, and we had the discussion on data retention."
"These things are steadily escalating."
"For precisely this reason, I personally would have inserted a sunset clause – irrespective of the fact that this is an international instrument – so that we could check after five years whether the whole system had achieved anything, whether it had proved useful or whether we had created unnecessary legislation, for that cannot be our function as a parliament."
"If I call in a painter, I want him to paint the wall properly when he comes. I do not want him to come back twice more to paint some of the bits he has missed."
"The public have exactly the same expectation of our legislative activity."
"In this respect, I would like to see the sunset clause stay in place – and I am aware that there has been an agreement on committee procedure – so that we in Parliament have an obligation to review what we are actually doing."
"Nevertheless, I shall hold discussions with my colleagues from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to determine our general approach to the subject of SWIFT in the context of transfers of funds."
"At the end of the day, however, my thanks go to the Commission for cooperating in a spirit of mutual trust, and I would ask whether it might also exert some influence on the European Central Bank to encourage it to cooperate in the same spirit as the Commission itself."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reservations expressed by the rapporteur, Mr Alvaro, were explained and discussed in detail by both of the committees to which this matter was referred."
"What we have here is a small piece of legislation, namely the implementation of Special Recommendation VII, defining the information that should accompany money transfers."
"Precisely because it is a small piece of legislation, though highly political and with the potential to intrude extensively into people’s private and business affairs, this Parliament has wisely and rightly decided to ask in earnest what needs regulation, what is worth regulating and what constitutes an appropriate response."
"We did not simply bow to the fact that there was already a prior understanding between the Commission and the Council."
"Both committees did their best to find proper answers."
"This applies to the question of the threshold for incoming funds, which will remain traceable, while the threshold will prevent legal over-reaction against the participating banks on the issue of possible international threshold values."
"It also applies to anonymous donations, which are made in several countries, such as Austria, the country of the outgoing Council presidency."
"They are not to be prohibited if a Member State wants to keep that option open."
"A threshold of EUR 500 has, however, been set, and larger anonymous donations are only permissible if they are made to absolutely organisations."
"The same applies, moreover, to the technical matter of an intermediary bank involved in the transfer of funds."
"Here too, we have come up with sound solutions."
"In Member States where complete information cannot be transmitted for technical reasons, it will still be possible, acting jointly and with the consent of the bank of final destination, to hold intermediary banks accountable too."
"Last but not least, it also applies to the question of outgoing payments from the European Union."
"We did not make the mistake of creating too much red tape or imposing too many requirements; on the contrary, we made a conscious distinction between payments with the risk of a terrorist link and payments that might simply be made by migrant workers who have not the slightest connection with terrorism."
"This distinction was important, because we support the Commission in its desire to extend the licensing system to the more informal providers of payment services that operate in grey areas and thus to bring them to the surface in order to obtain as much knowledge as possible, thereby avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy and ensuring that no undue restriction of civil rights occurs."
"On behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs of the political groups for their excellent cooperation."
"I believe the remaining problems can be resolved by the time of Thursday’s vote, because the committee procedure, on which we were still at odds with the Council, actually relates to only a small section of the draft, namely the matter of an committee to which associated territories have to be admitted."
"It does not concern the sensitive issue of thresholds or politically sensitive provisions."
"Allow me to make one more point."
"We are creating transparent legislation that is clearly understood by the people of Europe, reliable legal provisions, not unilateral declarations by individual states in this world that seek to induce private companies – even international organisations with cooperative property rights – to do things that may or may not be compatible with national law."
"We are asking the same questions as the Belgian Government, and we will assist them in their search for answers to these questions, because those answers must be found."
"For this very reason we should continue to legislate and build the foundations for international agreements on the basis of the rule of law and not give way to the law of the jungle."
"Together with the rapporteur, we shall find suitable ways to pursue that approach."
"."
"Mr President, this regulation is one of a number of efforts by the European institutions to improve our effectiveness in combating terrorism and money laundering."
"Analysis of terrorist attacks in Europe has shown that terrorist groups use various methods to collect funds for their activities."
"One such method is the use of payment orders for varying amounts of money made both outside the European Union and within its borders."
"This regulation will mean that money transfers will henceforth be subject to greater supervision, and banks will have to ensure that for each transfer of a prescribed amount of funds, all information relating to the payer is available."
"Even if this results in a slight increase in the workload of the banks, this regulation should not be allowed to reduce the efficiency of payment transactions."
"Although initially it appeared that this was one of many regulations – and may I mention in passing that there are around 60 regulations of this type aimed at combating terrorism – although this is one of a number of regulations that we initially thought would be rapidly completed, this has not yet happened."
"A series of proposed amendments have emerged, and more often than not the subject of our discussions has been what level of funds should be subject to transfer supervision."
"After a lengthy process of coordination with the rapporteur, the Commission and the Council, we finally have an agreed 15 proposed amendments supported by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"We also support the proposed amendments that relate to the so-called ‘review clause’, and the fixing of a threshold for payment orders."
"Towards the end of the discussions another question arose, namely the gathering of information by the US intelligence agency, the CIA, which would obtain data on bank transfers using the SWIFT code and the kind of consequences this might have for data protection."
"We in the Group of the European People’s Party believe that this issue is not a subject of the regulation, and we do not therefore support a debate in the context of this report."
"Moreover, although a large number of regulations, directives and so forth relating to the fight against terrorism have been produced since 2001, within our political group we believe that this regulation will make its own contribution towards the easier identification of financial ..."
"."
"Mr President, the Member States of the European Union have committed themselves to implementing the Special Recommendation VII of the FATF concerning money transfers at a European level, with the aim of successfully preventing the funding of terrorist activities."
"Therefore in order to ensure an exchange of information concerning the person making the transfer at each stage of the transfer process, we have to introduce a system which obliges the financial services suppliers to include specific and accurate information about the person making the transfer in the financial transfer documents."
"We must fight terrorism and adopt measures to make the funding of terrorism impossible."
"However, it is also important to make sure that the bodies responsible for combating money laundering or the funding of terrorism act in accordance with national criminal law and respect fundamental rights."
"The five-year period proposed by the Commission for storing information deserves our support."
"However, as far as the implementation of the regulation is concerned, some exceptions, such as those proposed by the rapporteur, have to be included."
"Certain definitions must also be made more specific and more complete."
"We must limit the use of stored and transmitted information to the defined scope of application in order to prevent general storage of information on citizens and to minimise the infringement of fundamental rights on the basis of this regulation."
"We also have to prevent executive powers being used to introduce changes and the comitology procedure."
"Changes in legislation which were subject to the codecision procedure should also take place within the framework of the codecision procedure."
"The Member States should ensure the creation of lists of organisations in their countries to which the regulation applies and make sure that these lists are updated and always made accessible to an interested Member State."
"Moreover, three years after the regulation enters into force, we should introduce a revision clause relating to money transfers and mobile payments as well as a sunset clause of five years after the regulation comes into force."
"Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report on a very complex and important issue for the European Union."
"."
"Mr President, as a member of both the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home, I have to say, wearing both hats, that I am starting to get really concerned."
"From the perspective of civil liberties, I wonder where we are heading if we are going in for some sort of permanent and comprehensive monitoring of all citizens."
"In that way, the whole principle of presumption of innocence goes straight out the window!"
"As a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I am worried about the burden on industry."
"I find it actually extraordinary that the Commissioner for the Internal Market should give an introduction that only covers the fight against terrorism, because we should actually also be discussing industry."
"After all, commercial enterprises that simply go about their commercial activities, are increasingly burdened with the collection of data for police and judicial purposes."
"I would, by way of example, also draw your attention to the Directive on data storage and passenger name records."
"The effectiveness of all those measures is questionable."
"We appear to have some kind of blind faith in technology and that, as long as we collate as much data as possible on members of the public, we are bound to pick out a terrorist sooner or later."
"A recent report in the United States, however, makes an equally strong case for the fact that in reality, terrorists do not use standing orders to collect their criminal funds, but use all kinds of different channels for this."
"If we adopt measures of this kind, then I wonder in all honesty whether we may well force those money flows underground."
"I hope in any case that we have made the proposal somewhat more workable for the enterprises that have to use it."
"I am, for example, pleased that the clauses about the EUR 1 000 and USD 1 000 thresholds are included."
"I would question whether the EUR 150 threshold for donations to charity organisations is not rather low after all."
"In this context, I would once again like to stress the importance of what we call purpose limitation, namely that those data are only used for the purpose for which they are collected."
"Finally, I should like to add my voice to those who have already expressed their concern in no uncertain terms about the ‘Swift’ scandal that has recently come to light, and I think it is really high time for a much more fundamental debate on how we here in Europe want to fight terrorism effectively without affecting fundamental rights."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you are all aware, the European Union has already taken a host of measures in connection with the war on terrorism."
"One of the most effective measures needs further improvement, and that is why we are now looking at this means of checking the flow of funds."
"In the war on terrorism we must not only assist the competent authorities in combating money laundering but must also go further by enacting measures to improve the surveillance of electronic payment transactions where these are being used to finance terrorism."
"For this reason, the authorities must be able to trace electronic payment transactions from start to finish."
"We do, however, need a practical solution, in other words a solution that helps the authorities without making unreasonable demands on providers of payment services."
"In the tabled proposals we have struck a decent balance between these requirements."
"One of the problems is posed by donations. My own country of Austria is one of those in the spotlight here."
"We know that the donation system is being abused to finance terrorism."
"On the other hand, we cannot stop donations being made to charitable organisations or for academic or research purposes."
"This is why I am in favour of these practicable proposals being implemented for non-profit organisations, including those engaged in educational and scientific activities."
"I also welcome the practicable solution of the reduced thresholds."
"This is another advance that came out of the negotiations."
"In general terms, I am convinced that this will give us a small but important additional instrument to cut off terrorist funding and to raise security standards in the European Union still higher."
"Mr President, the proposed regulation is yet another piece of legislation which harms, that is to say limits, fundamental rights."
"The previous regulations dealt with population records, the introduction of microchips and so on. This measure aims to limit financial freedom."
"It continues the measures started in 1978 by OLAF (then called UKLAF) to combat large-scale tax fraud that damaged Community finances, a practice closely linked to organised crime."
"How is the proposed regulation supposed to prevent money laundering and the funding of terrorism?"
"By monitoring the billions of transactions our citizens make and storing them for a five-year period?"
"I am sure it cannot do that!"
"It is good that both the rapporteur and those bodies providing their opinions, namely the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the European Economic and Social Committee and the European Central Bank, have pointed out the serious flaws in the proposed regulation."
"To conclude, let us read it over once again and avoid creating a regulation that benefits the financial and secret services."
"Let us hope that we can avoid becoming their collaborators or victims in the future, something that is happening in Poland today."
"."
"Mr President, for the record I wish to confirm that the Commission accepts all amendments that reflect the agreement allowing the adoption of this proposal in a single reading."
"I have arranged for a list of the Commission’s position on all amendments to be handed to the secretariat for inclusion in the record(1)."
"Some Members raised subjects this evening that are reflected in amendments that the Commission is not in a position to accept and these relate to the following."
"A threshold of 1000 euros or dollars for incoming transfers would deprive authorities in charge of fighting money laundering and terrorist financing of an effective means to do their job."
"Below the threshold, information on the payers would not have to be collected or recorded."
"The risk is that these funds could be used for financing new terrorist attacks."
"Terrorist acts can be organised with little money."
"It has been estimated that the cost of the Madrid attacks only amounted to about EUR 8000 and any threshold for incoming transfers can easily be abused by dividing the amount to be transferred into several payments below the threshold."
"The general sunset clause that would limit the applicability of this regulation in time: this was not accepted by the Council either."
"Such a clause could be useful in certain cases in the context of better regulation, but the Commission does not see added value in including this general clause in this regulation."
"Inserting this clause would mean that users and providers of payment services would be deprived of the necessary legal certainty."
"A comprehensive review clause is no doubt better suited for this regulation."
"If it turns out in the light of the review that changes are needed, the Commission will set them in motion and I therefore appeal to the House to accept this sensible solution."
"The comitology procedure under the provisions of this regulation covers a special procedure of authorisation by the Commission for Member States to conclude bilateral agreements with territories or countries outside the Community."
"Member States authorised to include such agreements will benefit from derogations from the obligations under the regulation."
"Such waivers will allow Member States to treat transfers of funds between that country or territory and the Member State concerned as transfers of funds within the Member State."
"Amendment 103 limits in time, until 1 April 2008, the possibility for the Commission to grant such authorisations."
"Imposing such a sunset clause is clearly not in line with the recent agreement on the revised comitology procedure."
"As part of this deal both the Council and Parliament agreed not to limit in time the powers granted to the Commission."
"For the same reasons, Amendments 20, 22 and 24 are not acceptable either."
"Some of you have raised the SWIFT crisis widely reported in the media during the last few weeks."
"You are aware that the issue is on Parliament’s agenda later this week and my colleague Mr Frattini will make a declaration on behalf of the Commission."
"We will make sure that we have all the facts of this case before taking any decision on further action."
"As far as this regulation is concerned, the Commission considers that it contains the appropriate standards on data protection and access by the competent authorities to such data."
"Your rapporteur had the foresight to submit the proposal to the European Data Protection Supervisor, who gave a positive assessment."
"No problems were detected on data protection issues."
"Let me stress once more that non-compliance by 1 January 2007 with the agreed international standards to ensure an effective fight against the financing of terrorism will not only send a negative message to the financial community on Europe’s commitment to fight terrorism."
"Non-compliance would also have significant economic consequences due to disruption of money flows from and to the European Union."
"The Commission has been ready to take the concerns on board."
"The compromise found is a good one."
"It will make Europe a safer place and show that Europe lives up to its responsibilities in the world."
"I count on your support in bringing this dossier to a successful conclusion now at first reading, thus avoiding lengthy discussions and probably less satisfactory results at second reading."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Annex – Position of the Commission"
"The Commission can accept the following amendments in full: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 25, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 48, 50, 53, 55, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 80, 86, 90, 91, 94, 96, 98, 99, 101, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 115, 117, 119, 121, as well as amendments 126 to 140, both inclusive."
"The Commission is not in a position to accept any of the other amendments."
"The next item is the report by Mr Szejna on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs on recent developments and prospects in relation to company law [2006/2051(INI)] (A6-0229/2006)."
"."
"Mr President, this own-initiative report on recent activities and prospects concerning company law aims to react to steps taken by the Commission, as well as to work out a strategic plan for Parliament concerning further actions in the field of company law."
"Significant progress has been made in implementing the 2003 Action Plan."
"However, further action is needed aimed at achieving the targets set out in the amended Lisbon Strategy, at committing ourselves to increasing growth and employment, at strengthening and increasing competitiveness in industry and improving conditions for entrepreneurship, and at supporting the ‘Social Europe’ project."
"The European Parliament calls on the Commission to guarantee that the steps taken to modernise company law and corporate governance are, and will be, in line with legislation in related sectors."
"It also emphasises the importance of taking into account the ruling of the European Court of Justice on the principle of entrepreneurial freedom."
"Parliament calls on the Commission to make a decision concerning further measures aimed at developing company law, and in doing so to consider the European social model, especially the involvement of employees."
"Better regulation and simplification of legislation are very important in order to increase cohesion and clarity of Community legislation, especially in the field of company law."
"However, this should not be the only aim."
"First of all, we should define the areas where further initiatives are necessary at a European Union level in order to achieve the previously mentioned goals."
"We should investigate whether there is a need to consolidate the whole of company law in a single legal document or whether the first stage of the consolidation process should only cover certain areas."
"The Commission’s decision to withdraw some draft legislation, in fields where it should already have noted the interest expressed by the companies concerned, cannot be justified by the need for better legislation."
"The European Parliament should be constantly involved in drawing up, defining and adopting measures aimed at simplifying legislation."
"The European framework for corporate governance should create the appropriate institutional conditions to support long-term viability for companies and employment prospects, define mechanisms preventing bad management and guarantee transparency and responsibility in terms of investments and revenue."
"We should also not forget that workers represent human capital for a company."
"Employees are not only important in terms of contracts, but are also investors and European Union citizens."
"Employees should be viewed in the same way as shareholders, as people involved in the company in the sense that they also bear a risk related to decisions made concerning the company."
"The European Parliament also calls on the Commission to take greater account of the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises in future draft legislation and revisions of existing legislation and to remember that they create jobs and are a motor for economic growth."
"In the field of company law, the European Parliament welcomes the proposal by the Commission concerning the Parliament and Council Directive on the exercise of voting rights by shareholders of companies having their registered office in a Member State and whose shares are admitted to trading on a regulated market."
"The European Parliament also welcomes agreements relating to matters including the proposal on the Parliament and Council Directive amending the Directive as regards the formation of public limited liability companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital and the proposal relating to the Parliament and Council Directive amending the Directive on the annual accounts of certain types of companies and on consolidated financial reports."
"The European Parliament should always take part in the debate on setting further priorities in the field of company law and corporate governance."
"This means, amongst other things, that Parliament should be regularly informed about expert group discussions."
"In the field of company law, Parliament expects the Commission firstly to guarantee companies a choice of different management systems, including the chance to choose between a monoist and dualist system without the need to adopt legislation defining the rights and obligations of the company’s management."
"Secondly, Parliament expects the Commission to analyse the opportunities for amending the principles of the European Company Statute concerning the creation of such companies, with the aim of simplifying them and adapting them to the requirements of the market."
"Thirdly, it expects the Commission to put forward a proposal on the European Private Company to fulfil the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The European Parliament deplores the fact that the Commission has already taken a decision to withdraw two proposals: the proposal for a regulation on the European Association Statute and the proposal for a regulation on the European Mutual Company Statute, as well as two proposals for directives complementing these statutes with respect to the participation of workers."
"We note, however, that in the Commission’s 2003 Action Plan, the Commission announced its intention to provide active support for the legislative process in relation to these statutes."
"We call on the Commission to draw up new legislation on the European Mutual Company Statute and on the European Association Statute."
"The European Parliament also calls on the Commission to present, in the near future, a proposal concerning the Fourteenth Directive on the cross-border transfer of the registered offices of limited liability companies."
"The European Parliament expects the Commission, if appropriate, only to put forward draft legislation concerning the principle of ‘one share, one vote’ following the revision of the Parliament and Council Directive on takeover bids."
"Finally, I would like to thank the draftsman of an opinion, Mr Lehne, whose excellent comments increased the value of this report."
"."
"Mr President, I warmly welcome Mr Szejna’s report and today’s discussion on the recent developments in and prospects for company law."
"This report is timely, as we have just finalised our consultation on future priorities for the Action Plan on Company Law and Corporate Governance."
"Our detailed report on that consultation will be available on the Internet shortly."
"Let me thank Mr Szejna and his colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Mr Lehne and colleagues in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the efforts they have put into this piece of work."
"Our consultation has been successful."
"We received more than 250 replies and around 300 people actively participated in our public hearing on 3 May."
"The views expressed in the replies to the public consultation were confirmed at the hearing."
"What are the main lessons of the consultation?"
"Firstly, there was overwhelming support among stakeholders for the application of the ‘Better Regulation’ principles."
"Respondents praised the consultation exercise."
"They supported the commitment to the strict application of the subsidiarity and proportionality principles."
"They also welcomed the Commission’s commitment to undertake systematic regulatory impact assessments before any potential legislative initiative."
"A majority of respondents supported the objective of simplification."
"However, most stakeholders considered a recasting exercise inappropriate."
"Stakeholders do not want us to take the risk of opening a Pandora’s box."
"A codification or consolidation exercise would seem to be the most appropriate."
"Secondly, as regards the continued relevance of the Action Plan, and in particular the measures proposed, respondents generally supported the work done since 2003."
"However, opinions were split on the details of the measures proposed for the medium and long term."
"A number of respondents expressed ‘regulatory fatigue’."
"However the general opinion was that work should continue on enabling legislation that would enhance the mobility of companies in the European Union or facilitate company restructuring."
"The vast majority of respondents called for the adoption of a Fourteenth Company Law Directive on the transfer of registered offices."
"A large number of respondents also called on the Commission to table a proposal for a European Private Company Statute."
"In addition, a large number of stakeholders wanted to see more focus on small firms."
"Thirdly, when it came to the detail of the measures proposed in the Action Plan in the field of corporate governance, views were split."
"There was general support for exploring certain issues at EU level, for example the issue of ‘one share, one vote’, at least by carrying out a fact-finding study, or the rights of shareholders."
"Views were more qualified on the disclosure of institutional investors’ voting policies."
"There was clear opposition to the adoption of an EU wrongful trading rule, as well as to potential harmonisation of the legislation on directors’ disqualification."
"Parliament’s report provides the Commission with very useful input for the development of a strategic perspective for further action."
"You underscore the trends observed during the consultation exercise on the need to have more regard to the needs of small firms, the call for a Fourteenth Company Law Directive on the transfer of registered offices and the opposition to the adoption of a European initiative in the field of wrongful trading rules."
"It is too early at this stage for us to respond in detail to all the issues raised in this exercise."
"I have heard the views expressed."
"On the basis of the outcome of the consultation and of the report discussed today, we intend soon to publish a statement in which we will indicate our priorities for the near future."
"Our views are mostly convergent."
"I welcome that."
"The Commission and Parliament must work hand in hand if we want to develop a regulatory framework that makes a difference in strengthening the competitiveness of the European economy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by expressing my special thanks to Mr Szenja, the rapporteur in the lead committee, for our close and fruitful cooperation."
"This is an extremely significant report, because it makes clear from the parliamentary perspective the priorities we still wish to pursue in implementing the rump of the old action plan on company law in this legislative term and shows how far we intend to push the Commission to present concrete proposals in the course of the present term."
"In the policy debate, I was not surprised to see that there was broad agreement, not only between the large political groups but among the smaller groups too, on the substance of the reports, which were adopted by large majorities in both the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and, subsequently, in the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"In the view of my group, this is also a compelling reason for us to reject all the amendments that have been tabled in the intervening period for the reading in plenary."
"The report is good as it stands and should not be watered down by amendments that may also scupper previous compromises."
"This is why we in the PPE-DE Group cannot support the amendments that are now on the table."
"Allow me to add a comment on the subject of ‘one share, one vote’."
"There were differences on this point, not only in the debate within the Committee on Economic Affairs but also in the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"At the time when we negotiated the Takeover Directive, we became aware of these differences."
"Even then, we managed to find a reasonable consensus."
"The consensus view is quite simply that we should wait first of all for any studies that have been commissioned and then wait for the evaluation of the Takeover Directive in 2012/2013."
"At the end of the next legislative term, a decision can be taken as to whether further proposals need to be made."
"This is a good example of a sound compromise."
"In conclusion let me reiterate my thanks to everyone involved."
"This is a good report that merits a large parliamentary majority."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to echo Mr Lehne’s words of thanks to the rapporteur."
"The report, which does not really fit into the series of diverse reports on company law that have previously been adopted in this House, especially as it enjoys a sort of special status through having been drafted on the initiative of a parliamentary committee, helps to fill a genuine gap, and the Commission should now fill that gap completely in the coming years with initiatives of its own."
"We eagerly await the Commissioner’s statement on the next steps in the realm of company law, because, as we all know, European company law is an important element of the single European market and an important instrument for the continuing integration of companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises."
"This means that the policy we are pursuing here is one which directly creates jobs."
"Jobs can only be created in really large numbers if SMEs receive special support."
"And SMEs can derive particular benefit from this form of company law because it lowers their consultancy costs and because a harmonised legal form would make it easier to start up a business, which we also want to encourage on a cross-border basis – as you said, Commissioner – by improving mobility."
"For this reason, I believe it is right that the Commission should take initiatives to simplify the creation of European private companies in future."
"There is already Mr Lehne’s project, of course, to have Parliament foster the Commission’s activities by means of a motion for a legislative resolution."
"I also welcome the fact that the proposal to introduce a European private company, which was contained in the action plan back in 2003, is now to be resurrected."
"The amendments contained in this report, which focus especially on accounting standards, are extremely important in my opinion, and I therefore ask you, Commissioner, to give these amendments due consideration."
"Mr President, I should like first of all to thank and congratulate Parliament’s rapporteur."
"In this field, Commissioner, you are really in quite a paradoxical situation."
"Since May 2003 you have had an action plan that would enable you to influence this debate, which is taking place in all the Member States."
"The reality is, however, that the speed at which the Commission works is such that, during that time, each Member State has been preparing for European negotiations."
"So rather than initiate a European process on subjects that are new, you allow the Member States time to adopt their own proposals, which then makes the development of European governance more complicated."
"Especially since it is a subject where the transatlantic dimension must not be underestimated and Europe would be better prepared if it were more advanced in the development of that European governance."
"I am a little surprised at my colleague Mr Lehne’s reaction to the amendments that have been proposed – but he is not listening to me, so I shall have to go and tell him afterwards – when he says that adopting such and such an amendment tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament would dilute this report a little more."
"I believe adding one or two useful references for corporate governance to the draft resolution’s 47 paragraphs deserves to be reconsidered."
"So far as the double voting right is concerned, I for my part believe that the balance we found in the takeover bids directive was satisfactory."
"Unlike the Commissioner, I do not propose reopening that debate, especially since the question is not whether one national model or another is reprehensible but rather how a body of citizen shareholders can be put in place that will get us away from the volatile and stateless nature of today’s shareholder in the largest quoted undertakings."
"We should be encouraging long-term shareholding, employee shareholding and transparency of directors’ pay."
"That is where your energies should be directed, Commissioner."
"Mr President, I was very pleased to learn that work on updating company law and on the strengthening of corporate governance in the European Union was to continue."
"In my work as a lawyer, I have frequently encountered problems resulting from the failure to adapt company law and corporate governance to reality."
"I think that the Lisbon Strategy guidelines have contributed significantly to the progress made in work on this subject."
"We cannot underplay the role of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the best motor for economies."
"It is therefore comforting to see that the Commission has also noticed the need to create the best possible environment for precisely this kind of activity."
"We need to pay particular attention to an appropriate analysis of these environments."
"All barriers, including administrative ones, should be removed as soon as possible."
"I agree that the report we are debating should set out a plan for further action by the European Parliament concerning activities in the field of company law."
"There were no particular difficulties involved in implementing the 2003 Action Plan."
"Its main aims, such as increasing the effectiveness or competitiveness of companies and strengthening the rights of shareholders, are still relevant today."
"However, we must take further action aimed at achieving the goals of the Lisbon Strategy, namely by showing our commitment to increasing employment, increasing competitiveness in industry and improving the conditions for entrepreneurship as well as, and this is particularly important, our commitment to supporting what is known as ‘Social Europe’."
"The Commission should not delay in presenting a Fourteenth Company Law Directive on the transfer abroad of registered offices of limited liability companies."
"Mr President, Commissioner, most people support better and simpler legislation and measures to prevent abuse."
"Transparency and public scrutiny are often good tools for achieving these things."
"Politicians often have a tendency to believe that companies are public institutions owned by themselves, but that is not the case."
"Companies are property, and they belong to their owners, not to politicians."
"Ownership is the very basis of the market economy."
"Do not allow market forces to be eliminated."
"If the ground rules are changed, businesses suffer, as does everyone."
"Businesses need fixed, long-term ground rules."
"My concern regarding the matter on today’s agenda relates to the rules governing voting rights."
"The Member States have different models for taking care of companies’ interest in developing their business, which is to say entrepreneurs’ interests."
"Sweden has a model guaranteed in the compromise we reached in April 2004."
"I should appreciate it if Mr Lehne too listened to what is being said."
"I am therefore less delighted about the external study that is to review the rules governing voting rights because experience shows that such studies have a tendency to be rather one-sided."
"The fact that objectivity has been included among the demands made of the working party does in fact indicate a lack of confidence right from the start."
"There can be no guarantee of objectivity."
"It would therefore be appropriate to have representatives of the Nordic system in this working party so that any kind of result that is finally produced might inspire confidence in the people of the Nordic countries."
"This is a matter to which I should like Mr Lehne to pay a bit of attention."
"It is true that this is an own-initiative report, but it should not be used in such a way as to block development after 2012."
"If large countries retain their cross-ownership and their rules on voting rights, small countries should be able to do so too."
"We have a deal, and it must be honoured."
"There is nothing to say that it must be abandoned in 2012."
"Instead, it can be renewed."
"Pacta sunt servanda."
"Mr President, I, too, should like to congratulate Mr Szejna on his report."
"In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, our group could have quite happily added a whole load of things, but we whittled them down to a few points only, namely those also indicated by Mr Lehne, whom I should like to thank for his willingness to compromise."
"Like Mrs Berès, though, I think that what we have added to the amendments for the plenary is not in conflict with that compromise."
"I shall return to this point in isolation later."
"In his report, Mr Szejna has opted for a wide approach, which appeals to me."
"Unlike Mrs Cederschiöld, I think it important – and that was also subject of the debate that was held earlier this evening – that enterprises should not simply be the property of shareholders."
"Shareholders have shares, but enterprises are more than simply a piece of paper or an investment object."
"Enterprises function in the real economy where interests other than those of shareholders are at play."
"That is why I should particularly like to stress recital F and general point 3, the section concerning employee participation in corporate decision-making and the thesis that is expressed in this report that this should also form an integral part of corporate governance and of company law."
"I hope that Mr McCreevy can agree with Parliament on this and can ensure that this will also play an important part in future dossiers."
"In the light of the fact that it is of major importance that this cannot be circumvented by, for example, the European company and a change of office, we have tabled a number of amendments to that effect."
"I hope that Mr Lehne will revisit this issue – even though he does not seem to be listening at the moment – to see if he can support those."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to acknowledge a number of salient points in the report."
"Among them, the explicit recognition of a European social model, notwithstanding the various national approaches to company law; and the connection between company law and corporate governance, on the one hand, and social policy, including by means of corporate social responsibility, on the other."
"The European Parliament is making the relationship with stakeholders a priority, thus rooting companies’ social responsibility in processes of corporate governance and is therefore taking advantage of the most genuine opportunity in this regard."
"I would also mention the explicit recognition of the need for directors to have a relationship of dependency and for transparency with regard to remuneration as well, together with the guaranteed rights of workers and their representatives to participate in company decision-making."
"I would reaffirm the need to provide for the possibility of coordinating with the financial markets, so as to take due account of developments in the real economy, and I hope that these suggestions will be adequately and correctly implemented in national law as soon as possible."
"."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Members for their comments and observations."
"We had the opportunity to cover some of the ground two weeks ago when I met the Committee on Legal Affairs to discuss the annual policy strategy."
"Let me repeat that I welcome the report as Parliament’s contribution to setting priorities and developing a strategic perspective for further action."
"As I said, we shall shortly be publicising how we will carry forward the priorities identified."
"Some issues were raised and I note in particular the difference of opinion on a number of areas, for example as regards ‘one share, one vote’."
"I am very conscious of the debate that took place on this matter before I became a Commissioner, and Mr Lehne’s advice that we should await the publication of the study is probably best."
"Looking back over what has been said here and the great debate that has taken place previously on this issue, I think this has emphasised that throughout Europe there are different cultures and a different ethos regarding both company law and corporate governance."
"That is a fact that we should all bear in mind, as I will certainly do in whatever I recommend in this particular area."
"I think that was also brought home by what other speakers said, such as Mrs Berès, who spoke of moving towards a certain degree of European harmonisation in some of these areas."
"It would be very difficult to harmonise company law measures in the European Union because of the different cultures and traditions and the different ways that have developed in many of the Member States."
"The situation is not the same in every Member State, and I shall certainly be taking that into account in whatever proposals I bring forward and in whatever I decide is the best and most effective way to do things on a Europe-wide basis."
"It is important to remember the different areas of conflict that we have had in the past and I certainly will take them into account too in whatever recommendations I bring forward."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A6-0201/2006) by Caroline Lucas on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on reducing the climate change impact of aviation [2005/2249(INI)]."
"."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that I warmly welcome the Commission’s communication on reducing the climate impact of aviation and that my report strongly supports the Commission’s position that a comprehensive package of measures is needed to address the full impact of aviation on the climate."
"I should also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups for their good work and collaboration."
"The starting point for my report is that while aviation has brought a great many benefits to society, its current growth rate is completely unsustainable."
"Between 1990 and 2003, the EU’s international aviation emissions increased by 73%, corresponding to an annual growth of over 4%."
"At this rate the increased emissions from aviation will neutralise more than a quarter of the reductions required by the EU’s Kyoto target by 2012."
"Moreover, crucially, aviation’s total impact on the climate is estimated to be two to four times the CO2 impact, even without considering the potential effects of cirrus cloud enhancement."
"Of course, the industry’s efforts to reduce its emissions are welcome."
"However, as Eurocontrol predicts, EU air traffic movements are set to more than double by 2020 compared to 2003."
"It is clear that rates of technological improvements – which historically run at about 1-2% per year – will be insufficient to offset this enormous growth."
"It is clear then that action is urgently needed."
"International aviation is not subject to Kyoto or other commitments."
"Article 2(2) of the Kyoto Protocol urges states to pursue reduction of greenhouse gases from this source through the International Civil Aviation Organization, but there are currently no plans for a global solution here."
"That makes it vital that the EU shows leadership and exploits the advantages of laying down an example with early regional action."
"Council Conclusions of December 2005 reaffirm this, calling for ‘specific action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation if no such action is agreed within the ICAO by 2002’."
"I therefore welcome the communication’s recognition that we need this comprehensive package of measures, including regulatory, economic, technological and operational instruments."
"In particular, its plan to pursue the introduction of kerosene taxes is very important, given the existing imbalance between the treatment of aviation and other modes of transport."
"This should begin right away with a tax on all domestic and intra-EU flights – with the possibility of exemption for all carriers on routes where non-EU carriers operate."
"The ongoing renegotiations of air service agreements must continue so that third-country carriers can gradually be taxed on an equal basis with EU carriers."
"Ending the VAT exemption would further level the playing field, and bring fiscal as well as environmental benefits."
"Colleagues will see that I have brought back an amendment to seek to achieve this."
"Improvements in air traffic management could reduce average fuel burn by between 8% and 18%, with resultant decreases in all engine emissions."
"All of these measures are necessary, but the main focus of the Commission’s proposals and therefore of my report is on emissions trading."
"I agree that it has the potential to play a role, but only provided any scheme is properly designed."
"First, it is clear that other policy instruments must be introduced alongside an emissions trading system to address the full climatic impact."
"Instruments directly linked to the impact in question, such as a NOx charge, would be most likely to induce the most efficient behaviour, although multipliers on CO2 emissions are an interim alternative."
"This is crucial, because if there is not a parallel emissions charge or multiplier formula to cover aviation’s non-CO2 impacts, the effect of buying the right to emit a tonne of CO2 from another sector with much lower non-CO2 impacts would actually be a net disbenefit to the environment."
"Second, and crucially, a separate closed system for aviation is crucial at the very least as a pilot scheme because, apart from the administrative difficulties of including aviation in the EU’s general ETS, many sectors already in that scheme are concerned about the possible effect of aviation’s inclusion on carbon prices, noting that as a sheltered sector, aviation will be able tolerate higher prices than many others. There is a very real risk that excessive pressure on vulnerable, energy-intensive industries could lead to a loosening of the overall cap."
"It would also be impractical for aviation to join the general ETS before 2012."
"I do not think we can afford to wait another six years before we act, so good use could be made of the period 2008-2012 by running at least a pilot scheme."
"Any arrangement by which aviation was ultimately incorporated into a wider ETS would also need a cap on the number of emission rights the aviation sector could buy from the market to ensure that aviation itself begins to make some of these cuts."
"Finally, if colleagues are in any doubt about the importance of a separate scheme, they should consider the words of a chief economist of British Airways, who admitted last week that if airlines joined the existing emissions trading system their emissions would simply continue to grow at an alarming rate: they would simply buy up the right to emit as ever, their own emissions would not go down, and we would still see aviation having a massive accountability for the climate crisis."
"Therefore, I urge colleagues to vote for this report, which will send a very clear signal to the Commission and to the Council that Parliament is looking for ambitious but realistic proposals in this field."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Lucas and thank her for her report."
"I should also like to thank the European Parliament Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for unanimously adopting the relevant report and the European Parliament Committee on Transport and Tourism and its opinion draftsman, Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, for agreeing to include aviation in the European Union greenhouse gas trading system."
"The aviation sector contributes approximately 3% to the production of carbon dioxide in the European Union, but this rate is increasing rapidly."
"As Mrs Lucas said earlier, in a few years' time, by 2012, it will have increased by 150% in comparison with 1990, which is approximately just under 5% per annum."
"This rate of increase in carbon dioxide is, of course, helping to exacerbate the greenhouse effect and it should be noted that it is not only carbon dioxide which aircraft emit; there are other side effects, such as emissions which help to create other greenhouse gases and, as such, the contribution of aviation to the greenhouse effect is much greater than the 3% reported for carbon dioxide."
"As Mrs Lucas also said, the Kyoto Protocol does not extend to limiting emissions of carbon dioxide by aircraft, although there is, of course, a reference in Article 2, paragraph 2."
"This is precisely why the European Commission will continue its present efforts and step up its efforts in future in order to include aviation and maritime transport in any system agreed for post- 2012."
"However, this period is still several years away and, that being so, the gas trading system now needs, following the European Parliament and Council codecision procedure, to include gases so that we can limit and aviation can help to limit the greenhouse effect and so that this sector does not end up at an advantage compared with the other sectors which help to limit the greenhouse effect."
"In other words, we do not want the other sectors to fare worse than aviation."
"That is why it is particularly encouraging both that the relevant reports have been submitted by the parliamentary committees and also that the Council of Ministers for the Environment of the European Union and the Heads of State or Government of the European Union also agreed at the European Council last December to include aviation in the trading system and called on the European Commission to table the relevant legislation under the codecision procedure."
"I should like to make three comments on the points made by the Committee on the Environment and the points raised earlier by Mrs Lucas:"
"First of all, would it be better to have a closed or open system for aviation?"
"The European Parliament committee report wants a closed system, a separate system for aviation, either as a permanent system or in a pilot stage up to 2012."
"The Commission has taken a different approach: it considers that the broader the scope of the trading system, the less it will cost to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and, as a result, aviation will have lower costs without reducing the benefit to the environment."
"Similarly, I should like to follow on from Mrs Lucas's thoughts on a tax on kerosene, the fuel used for aircraft."
"It is a fact, as you said earlier, that there are bilateral agreements which basically exempt aviation from payment of tax."
"Of course, the European Commission has been passing Community legislation since 2003 allowing the Member States to tax fuel on their domestic flights and, following agreement with another country, to allow tax on flights between the two countries."
"The Commission is continuing and will continue its efforts towards third countries, in accordance with what you too said earlier, in order to abolish this tax exemption for kerosene, which clearly does not have positive environmental results."
"Furthermore, I should like to make a comment about the geographical scope of the trading system: the Commission has proposed including all flights from airports in the European Union and the parliamentary committee has proposed including all flights to or from airports in the European Union and flights which cross the airspace of the European Union."
"We consider that the Commission's approach is simpler and more effective and could make it easier to extend the system to other countries."
"Without doubt, however, as Parliament and as the airlines themselves and non-governmental organisations have proposed including all flights to and from airports in the European Union, the Commission will examine this approach during the course of the detailed study of the impact this will have before submitting its proposal during the codecision procedure which we hope to have before the end of the current year."
"Finally, I should like to say that, without doubt, in addition to including aviation in the trading system, there are other measures, such as those you mention: improvement of air traffic, investment in research, so that more environmentally-friendly technologies can be developed, improved and used, the possible use of biofuels in airlines – although this last option is still at the research stage – and a series of other measures which can be applied in parallel in order to mitigate the impact of aviation on climate change."
"."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank Commissioner Dimas for the realistic contribution he made a moment ago."
"I very much endorse the remarks he addressed to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"Indeed, in a communication by the Commission, different options are being examined and a more consistent application of energy levies is also briefly looked at."
"At the same time, the Commission recognises that this latter cannot be seen as a cornerstone of a strategy for fighting climate change effectively."
"In the end, the Commission concluded in its communication that market-based instruments are by far the most effective."
"It settled on the trade in emission rights, and that is a conclusion I fully endorse."
"It is environmentally effective and economically efficient."
"In recent months, as is still the case today, a great deal of hard work has gone into further fleshing out this initiative, including its scope, and I have tried, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, to draft a realistic opinion."
"The goal is, after all, to develop at the earliest opportunity a model that is as workable as possible and that can be extended worldwide."
"Despite all the appreciation I have for Mrs Lucas herself, my amazement was nevertheless considerable when I read the final version of her report which is totally devoid of any realism or workable solutions."
"The resolution has been decorated with the proverbial Christmas baubles."
"One such Christmas bauble is, for example, the C02 multiplier, while the CE study shows that including non-C02 effects is very difficult to measure."
"Also, it harps on endlessly about kerosene tax as being the panacea for all environmental problems and much more."
"With all due respect, while a tax of this kind is good for the coffers, its environmental effectiveness has not been proven in any way."
"Do not get me wrong, I too would prefer to see all transport modalities treated the same way, but I would urge you to take all aspects into consideration, including, for example, the way in which the infrastructure is financed."
"Moreover, this discussion takes the attention away from what this is really about, namely a swift integration of aviation in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS), and as Commissioner Dimas was right to point out a moment ago, a directive that allows Member States to apply fuel tax to domestic flights is already in force, something which only the Netherlands has taken up so far."
"I would therefore ask you to shift your attention to this."
"I have taken the liberty of applying for a list of separate votes and votes in sections, in the hope of removing all Christmas baubles from the resolution."
"Should this prove impossible during the vote, then I will ask for my name to be removed from this resolution."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the two rapporteurs for their work."
"The adverse effects of air transport on the climate are considerable, and are rapidly becoming more acute."
"For this reason, the Commission must lose no time in presenting us with legislative proposals on how to remedy this problem."
"We cannot use the argument that air transport makes up only a small percentage of total global emissions."
"We keep hearing this in debates on climate: that the individual emitter is only ever responsible for a proportion of the emissions."
"If each individual emitter talks his way out of it by arguing that he is only responsible for a small proportion, however, we shall never see an active fight against climate change."
"In addition, the EU already imposes very heavy taxes, charges and environmental requirements on other modes of transport such as buses, railways and even cars."
"Operators of bus or railway enterprises, for example, cannot see why we are imposing heavy charges on them – relatively environmentally friendly modes of transport – yet have thus far imposed such small charges on the relatively environmentally unfriendly aeroplane."
"This distorts competition not only between the various modes of transport, but also – and this is a point I should like to make in view of the holiday period in Europe – between holiday regions."
"There are European holiday regions to which Europeans normally travel by bus, train or car, and there are others that are primarily reached by aeroplane."
"In the region from which I come, representatives of hotels, other establishments providing food and drink, and other tourism enterprises openly complain that, to give an example, the taxes that a Dutchman would have to pay if he flew from Amsterdam to Turkey are very much lower than those he would pay if he took the bus to a mountainous area in Germany or France."
"That is a distortion of competition that we need to remedy."
"We should, however, be careful in our choice of instruments for this purpose, so that we do not create new distortions of competition."
"For example, it is important that we take care that the instruments chosen give rise to the minimum possible distortion of competition between the European airlines and their non-European competitors."
"In our view, the original draft prepared by Mrs Lucas had a number of weaknesses in this regard."
"For this reason, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has drafted some amendments and has also endorsed a number of amendments along the same lines from the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"Focusing our discussion exclusively or primarily on the kerosene tax is unlikely to solve the problem."
"We should concentrate on other instruments: namely a fundamentally redesigned emissions trading scheme that remedies the weaknesses of the present scheme, plus a mixture of other instruments."
"What is important is that emissions trading should cover not only flights within Europe, but also intercontinental traffic, or at least that which takes off and lands in Europe."
"It goes without saying that we want to see a worldwide system as soon as possible."
"The weaknesses in the present Emissions Trading Scheme need to be overcome: that means less bureaucracy, a uniform allocation method throughout Europe and greater recognition of past performance."
"This is one of the reasons for my plea, on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, for a separate scheme – as this will mean that the shortcomings can be remedied more quickly than if the deficient scheme were adopted."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wants to see an impact assessment, and I assume that the Commission will soon be presenting one."
"In addition, in the context of all the emphasis on emissions trading, we should like to see equal priority being given to further pursuing other measures, such as air-traffic management."
"We should also reflect on the fact that one way of remedying distortions of competition is to reduce taxes on environmentally friendly modes of transport."
". – Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Lucas, on her well-balanced report."
"Indeed, we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament support her on many points – with the exception of the one about creating a separate emissions trading scheme for air transport."
"From 1990 to 2002, the CO2 emissions from international air traffic that were generated by the 25 EU Member States rose by 60%."
"In addition, the altitude at which air traffic produces emissions means that their impact on the climate is far greater than their quantity would suggest."
"Heavy fuel taxation is common practice in Europe, yet almost nowhere in it is aviation fuel taxed."
"This has a considerable impact on the competitiveness of the other modes of transport."
"Long-distance rail transport is stagnating."
"Parliament should give its resounding support to the Commission’s intention of further pursuing the introduction of kerosene taxes, and implementing these as quickly as possible."
"The EU must take the lead on this and set a good example by taking timely action at regional level."
"This report does not discuss only the kerosene tax, however, but also the massive distortion of competition caused by tax exemptions on air transport."
"Rail transport is subject to taxes and to the Emissions Trading Scheme, which entails considerable cost increases for this environmentally friendly mode of transport."
"Emissions trading is not a replacement for the measures needed to reduce climate change impact, but it has the potential to be, provided it is properly organised."
"As I have already emphasised, we support the Commission’s proposal to integrate air transport into the existing Emissions Trading Scheme, but we also support paragraph 24, which calls for a pilot phase of a separate scheme covering the period 2008–2012."
"."
"Mr President, we like to proclaim the growth of cheap air travel as a European success story."
"It is thanks to the breaking of national monopolies that there are now such unparalleled opportunities, mainly for the middle class, to enjoy holidays abroad."
"My own assistant just popped over to Stockholm this weekend for an engagement party – not even a wedding, just an engagement party."
"We all enjoy this, but I think we have to remember that the poorest in society, let alone the poorest across the world, are denied these opportunities."
"Whatever the price of the air fare, they cannot afford the holidays at the other end; but for those of us in a privileged position it is fantastic."
"The trouble is the predicted growth is so great as to wipe out the gains being made in reducing carbon dioxide in other sectors."
"A big airline operator in the UK told me they expect a 60% increase in the use of their planes over the next six years alone."
"That is a fantastic and terrible rate of growth."
"What the lobbying letters from the aviation industry are really saying, putting forward every excuse in the world, is this: ‘just don’t touch us, we are somehow special."
"Our growth and our profits must be protected."
"Do not take measures against us."
"The future of the world can go to hell, frankly, just so long as we are protected’."
"They want to be included in the Commission’s emission trading scheme, and you may ask why."
"It is because they know it is not going to be consequential on their profits."
"The socialists are now saying yes, we are backing the capitalists in this."
"I think they should look at this again."
"The point is that the aviation industry says a closed scheme would be a tax."
"Yes, in effect it would be a tax, but it would be a flexible tax rewarding those who take measures to try to introduce the best technology and to make maximum use of their planes."
"Technological development is what we really need to promote."
"Our message to the airline industry should be this: expand as you like, but find ways of doing it without increasing CO2 emissions."
"We do not want to stop air travel, we simply want to ensure that its growth is not at the expense of our children and our future."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would like to express warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Lucas, for her excellent report, whose proposals for action are very well justified."
"Emissions from air traffic are growing faster than any other source of carbon dioxide emissions, and the other emissions and impact of aviation more than double its effect on global warming."
"Since 1990, greenhouse emissions from air traffic within the European Union have increased by 85%, which is 4% a year."
"This threatens to wipe out a quarter of the reductions in emissions achieved in other sectors for the prohibition period."
"This cannot be allowed to continue."
"Emissions from air traffic are by far the greatest per kilometre travelled."
"For example, the impact is fifteen times greater than that of trains."
"Every aspect of air travel, however, is subsidised, including fuel, which is not subject to taxation."
"On the other hand, rail traffic is taxed in a number of ways, and it is also affected by the trade in carbon dioxide emissions."
"The ‘polluter pays’ principle must be extended to flight, in such a way, obviously, that it does not lead to distortion of competition, although current tax breaks for aviation and other preferential treatment are a distortion of competition in themselves."
"The next global climate agreement should cover air traffic, but there are good reasons now for extending emissions trading to all flights arriving in and departing from the European Union, preferably based on a separate emissions trading system, to make the incentive for reducing emissions effective."
"Ladies and gentlemen, every one of us flies, and we do so quite a lot."
"Every one of us can do something too."
"We can compensate for the emissions from our own air travel voluntarily."
"There are organisations which calculate flight emissions per passenger and through them you can finance an equivalent amount of investment to reduce emissions in the developing countries."
"I myself started compensating for the emissions from my own flights last year, and now I have paid compensation for all the flights I have taken since I was elected to the European Parliament."
"I call on all my fellow Members to do likewise – we can afford to."
"."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank Mrs Lucas for her very lucid report."
"I support the gist of the Commission’s proposal in which it wishes to put a check on the fast growing share of aviation in climate change."
"Mrs Lucas’s report complements the proposal well, and we share her view that including the aviation sector in emissions trading should not be the only instrument, but should form part of a package of measures, such as introducing kerosene tax, VAT on plane tickets and congestion tax for airports."
"Like the rapporteur, I take the view that the emission rights to be issued should be auctioned in order to avoid large enterprises feathering their own nests with free rights, without the environment benefiting in any way."
"Although my group sees the Commission proposal as a step in the right direction, we should not overestimate the importance of emissions trading, whose environmental benefits have not been proven beyond any doubt."
"Moreover, CO2 is not the only problem aviation faces."
"The emission of nitrogen oxide (NOx) is also enormously important, not only in terms of the climate, but also air quality."
"That is why we are in favour of including NOx in emissions trading, which is what is already happening in the Netherlands, certainly if a separate system is being set up for aviation anyway."
"A system that addresses CO2 alone will not yield the maximum effect."
"It would be preferable to tackle NOx at the same time."
"We agree with the rapporteur that research into cleaner engines is needed, but this should not yet again mean that specific measures against said emissions will be shelved."
"If NOx is not included in emissions trading – and it now looks unlikely that it will be – airports must be encouraged to impose local emission levies as part of the package of measures set out by the rapporteur."
"My party supports the Commission’s intention to end the tax benefits which the aviation sector enjoys internationally."
"This has led to unfair competition between different modes of transport for longer than anyone can remember."
"We therefore support the rapporteur’s proposal which indicates that the EU should take the initiative to introduce a kerosene tax on all domestic flights."
"This could prove an effective brake on the tremendous growth in the number of cheap flights against which rail is hardly equipped to compete."
"Budget airlines already account for a quarter of European air traffic, which has, above all, resulted in the growth of regional airports."
"It is important for the Member States to give us an insight into subsidies that are channelled to those airports with the intention of attracting airline companies."
"We must move away from the idea that the increase in air traffic within the EU is a driving force of regional growth."
"For many of these medium-long distances, rail connections are a much more environmentally-friendly alternative, provided that there is a level playing field."
"Since the introduction of emissions trading, rail has been paying a much higher price for electricity, but airline companies still do not pay a cent of excise despite their constant moaning and groaning about high fuel prices."
"."
"Mr President, every year, we become increasingly aware of the effects of climate change."
"It takes longer for winter to set in, and when it does, it is increasingly milder, and summer starts earlier and is increasingly warmer."
"Is this an inevitable process?"
"I hope not."
"We should, though, pull out all the stops to ensure that this trend is bucked."
"That is why I agree with the Commission’s communication."
"If we want to fight climate change effectively, all sectors must do their bit, certainly the aviation sector, which is responsible for high-altitude emissions and which has, as such, an extraordinary impact."
"I can go along with the plan to set up an emissions trading system for aviation too, provided this meets a number of conditions."
"First of all, since it must encompass as many companies and routes as possible in order to fight unfair competition, it should apply to all flights out of, and into, all the EU's airports."
"Secondly, efforts which companies have already made to limit their emissions should be taken into consideration."
"I would also prefer for allowances to be handed out on the basis of an auction."
"Thirdly, it should become possible to include substances other than C02 if this can be backed by scientific proof."
"Also, the VAT exemption for kerosene and plane tickets should be abandoned, provided this is done in an all-inclusive plan in which the VAT exemptions for other modes of transport are also reviewed."
"In the framework of the discussion on Eurovignette, the Commission has promised to carry out a study into the internalisation of external costs for all modes of transport."
"I should like to call for this study to be completed promptly, so that the results can be made available as soon as possible and we can adopt legislation that takes these results into account."
"As a result of technology developments and the globalisation of tourism and the economy in the past decades, the number of passengers travelling by air has shown a radical increase."
"Unfortunately, the number and extent of environmental problems caused by air travel have also shown a proportional increase."
"At the moment, aeroplanes account for only 3% of the European Union's total greenhouse emissions, but the rapid annual increase of almost 5% means that it is now time to act."
"Europe has assumed a pioneering role by deciding to take action in this area, in conformance with the Kyoto principles."
"However, pioneering actions always involve risks."
"Therefore, we must make sure that the measures taken do not place European airlines at a competitive disadvantage."
"At the same time, we must find a solution that effectively encourages the sector to reduce atmospheric pollution."
"I personally believe in market instruments, which is why I support the introduction of an adequately developed emission trading system in this area too."
"It is important that we make maximum use of the reserves still left in the current imperfect system."
"I am thinking, primarily, of improvements in air transport organisation."
"This is important both in respect of atmospheric pollution and noise pollution caused by aeroplanes."
"We need to reconsider the logic of making detours to avoid military facilities, and we must make every effort to avoid flights over inhabited areas, because the increase in air traffic is affecting the lives of more and more European citizens, and is leading to increasingly frequent protests from the population."
"The principle and the objective are clear."
"Our mobility should not have harmful effects on our health or on the condition of our environment."
"I hope that we will be able to achieve this, and I congratulate the rapporteur for a report showing plenty of initiative."
"Mr President, first of all, my compliments to Mrs Lucas."
"She has drafted an excellent report that encapsulates the problems in aviation and the dilemmas associated with them."
"What do those problems in aviation amount to?"
"First of all, aviation contributes hugely to climate change: per passenger and per kilometre, the C02 emission in aviation is considerably higher than in transport by train or even by car."
"Certainly for short distances, the burden on the environment is high and it is precisely when short distances are involved that there are alternatives, of which, at present, too little use is being made."
"The second problem is that too few people are aware of the major environmental burden that aviation presents."
"That is why it would be good if tickets and cars were to display the CO2 emission per km."
"I would welcome initiatives to that effect, Commissioner."
"To us in this House, it would be useful to know exactly what the CO2 emission is when we travel to Brussels or Strasbourg by car, train or plane."
"The third problem is that the environmental tax is in no way reflected in the costs."
"Flying is unnaturally cheap."
"It is mystifying why the aviation sector should still be exempt from VAT."
"This puts the more environmentally-friendly transport methods, such as trains or buses, at a disadvantage."
"This phenomenon can, and indeed should, be stopped without delay."
"It is, in any case, of the utmost importance that aviation be brought, at the earliest opportunity, within a system of tradable emissions rights."
"This would give C02 a price tag and promote innovation, particularly more efficient engines and more economical and better use of fuel."
"In my view, it is obvious to use the existing emissions trading system as a basis, as long as we avoid the mistakes that were made in that system."
"Instead of free allocation, I would prefer to see auctioning."
"It also goes without saying that kerosene should be taxed."
"The fourth problem is that it is not easy to tackle the aviation sector."
"Aviation is a source of both employment and enjoyment for consumers and tourists alike."
"That is why it is important to operate at European level and at the same time to invest in comfortable high-speed connections between the European cities."
"This would be an ambitious policy, and one to which the public would be sure to give its backing."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as an important transport sector, aviation is of vital significance to economic development in Europe."
"Worldwide and also in the EU, aviation is a growth sector, providing employment for more than four million Europeans."
"Although aviation accounts for only approximately 3% of global CO2 emissions, this proportion is growing constantly."
"The objective of our policy must be to reduce the climate-change impact without also reducing growth in this key sector."
"The growth and competitiveness of our airlines must not conflict with the reduction of greenhouse gases."
"The choice of instruments is vital to achieving this objective."
"The introduction of a kerosene tax and the levying of departure or airline-ticket taxes would only result in dampening demand."
"Making flying more expensive would reduce greenhouse gases, but only at the expense of growth, which is not absolutely necessary."
"The incorporation of aviation into the Emissions Trading Scheme, as proposed by the Commission, is a better alternative from an environmental and economic point of view."
"Emissions trading that is limited to the EU must offer guarantees that European airlines are not put at a disadvantage in comparison to other airlines."
"In addition, emissions trading must not become an end in itself, but must primarily create incentives for investment in improved technologies."
"The promotion of technology holds the key to harmonising the objectives of growth and reduction of CO2 emissions."
"The European aviation and space-travel industry, in particular, has made a decisive contribution to the development of engines with greater fuel efficiency, and thus of cleaner aircraft."
"In addition to the promotion of technology, two further aspects need to be taken into account that have been neglected in the debate on reducing emissions."
"Firstly, the creation of a single European airspace and air traffic control area – the ‘Single European Sky’ project – and secondly the extension of airports."
"Even without regulatory enthusiasm, we can achieve a considerable reduction in greenhouse gases by reducing flying distances and avoiding stacking."
"Mr President, thank you, Mrs Lucas, for a constructive and clear report."
"Action in terms of quotas is preferable to free and complicated allocation."
"It is important for us to make a clear decision about separate trading systems for aviation."
"That is only logical because the climate change impact of aviation is two to four times greater than the impact of carbon dioxide alone."
"Aviation would therefore be placed at an undue advantage if it were to form part of the general system, and the fight against climate change would become less cost-effective."
"Aviation is expanding rapidly."
"It is a kind of tax haven of the skies, with exemption from VAT and fuel tax being the most serious aspect of this."
"All this is of most benefit to the richest people in society, who are the most frequent fliers."
"Paradoxically enough, it would, then, be those on low incomes who would benefit most from increased emissions charges, for these would reduce the amount of state income needed from other areas, such as rail travel, in which those on low incomes account for a larger share of the market."
"I am very pleased about the support for separate systems shown by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and I expect the Socialist Group in the European Parliament also to stand up for the less well off."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, it is no simple matter to establish equal conditions for the various forms of transport."
"Qualification requirements for crews, the infrastructure of the individual forms of transport, the fuel or energy required to keep things running, unified operating rules for a given form of transport, environmental impact and how to assess it – there are indeed many aspects to consider, all the way from research and development to the investigation of accidents."
"This is why the report under discussion is attracting so much interest from the experts in the field."
"A basic requirement when introducing any measure is to ensure fair competition."
"It is therefore necessary to require that the introduction of carbon dioxide emission permits for aviation fulfils paragraph 32 of the motion for a resolution in the sense of the Kyoto Protocol, in other words with no growth in emissions compared to the base year, and that this applies to all organisations."
"In the modern age, aviation is always in the forefront when it comes to introducing new technical solutions."
"It is therefore sure to provide an example in cutting other emissions, although establishing limits is a matter for further negotiation."
"Despite this, it is necessary to establish standards for volatile hydrocarbons – especially aromatic ones – and solid particulates, oxides of nitrogen and other factors such as noise on an equal basis for all users of the European Union’s air space, in such a way that EU transport firms do not suffer discrimination through the selective application of limits."
"It is similarly desirable to support the use of biofuels."
"We must not allow unfair competition from foreign transport firms through the introduction of VAT, and it is essential to coordinate such a step across the entire aviation sector and not just within the EU."
"The operation as a whole will certainly be complex but it is feasible, as long as the conditions set out in the report are adhered to."
"On behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I therefore strongly urge all Members to endorse the report on reducing the climate change impact of aviation, including our amendment."
"I would like to conclude with the comment that flights by military aircraft and helicopters used for espionage and guard duties constitute a significant source of emissions."
"Let us try to reduce them, Commissioner."
"Mr President, whether one accepts Mrs Lucas’s figure of 4.1 million jobs or the Association of European Airlines’ figure of 7.5 million jobs directly dependent on air transport, we must agree that the aviation industry contributes very significantly to European employment and growth."
"Air transport is vital to the EU’s economy, accounting for up to 8% of GDP, boosting productivity, attracting investment and encouraging tourism."
"Air transport has become an integral part of society, allowing us to travel long distances quickly, but also strengthening Europe’s integration, prosperity and political importance."
"Aviation facilitates social cohesion and cultural exchange."
"Strategically, air transport is of critical importance, particularly for peripheral regions and islands such as Ireland."
"It is easy to exaggerate the contribution from aviation to the present problem of climate change, and emissions from all transport sectors are of concern to the air quality issue and the climate change debate, which is the number one item on every environment agenda."
"We should not be singling out aviation and ignoring shipping and the considerably greater impact from increasing road transport and car usage."
"In 2003, total emissions from flights into and out of the EU 25 Member States contributed 3.4% of CO2 emissions, which was equivalent to 0.5% of worldwide emissions in this area."
"Air transport is treated differently under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in terms of how its greenhouse gas emissions are accounted for."
"It is not directly included in the Kyoto Protocol."
"While we should acknowledge the advances made by the European aviation industry’s voluntary initiative, the Emissions Containment Policy, with EU air traffic movements set to double by 2020 over the 2003 level, the real question is whether, on the basis of the polluter pays principle, this voluntary initiative will be adequate to counteract rising emissions from air transport."
"Do we need legislation?"
"Interestingly, a recent House of Lords report on aviation’s contribution to climate change stated that it was insignificant and likely to remain so for 30 years."
"The industry itself claims that fuel efficiency, direct routing and new technology have already achieved a 70% reduction in aircraft emissions over the last 30 years and that air traffic management, improved holding patterns over airports, and replacement of older planes with state-of-the-art technology in fleet renewal could reduce climate-change impact even further as the number of flights increases each year."
"An emissions trading scheme and auctioning rights are worth investigating, but, I ask the Commissioner, would a stand-alone or closed ETS for aviation not fall at the first hurdle, since all the trading entities would be net buyers and there would be no market?"
"A possible solution, following a comprehensive impact assessment, would appear to be incorporation of aviation into a reviewed existing ETS, with the proviso that all flights landing and taking off in Europe must be included."
"This should ideally be part of a global solution, with industry and governments sitting down with the International Civil Aviation Organization, as Article 2(2) of the Kyoto Protocol suggests."
"Do not hold your breath."
"Any economic instruments must have clear environmental objectives, rather than fiscal ones, and must be part of an overall package that addresses technological, operational and infrastructural improvements."
"An open skies agreement, reducing stacking and taxiing time through better air traffic control management and improved scheduling and coordination within a single European sky policy must all be part of a comprehensive policy mix."
"I would like to remind the author of the report that the European Parliament is often called the flying parliament."
"Flying as we do every week to one of the EU's capitals, we should be particularly concerned about making aviation a more environmentally friendly mode of transport."
"In policies concerning the effect of aviation on climate change, the ‘polluter pays’ principle must be upheld."
"It is regrettable that air transport does not cover the external expenditure which arises as a result of its effect on the climate."
"The logical thing would be to include aviation in the EU's trading system for greenhouse gas emission allowances."
"The funds raised by the collection of such taxes could be invested in new technology dedicated to the production of ‘cleaner’ aircraft."
"The expansion of rail and bus transport could reduce both the pressure on overloaded airports and the pollution emitted by aviation."
"Unfortunately, the rail and road networks in Lithuania and the other Baltic countries are not integrated into the EU's infrastructure."
"They are outmoded and overloaded."
"If the ‘Via Baltica’ and more importantly the ‘Rail Baltica’ projects fail to receive special EU attention, it will be a long time before rail and road transport in this region are able to help aviation."
"Mr President, I wish to join other colleagues in congratulating Mrs Lucas on her excellent work."
"Mrs Lucas’s report meets with my agreement to a great extent and hence I will confine myself to making some general comments on the subject matter under discussion."
"I think we all agree that the dangerous trend of increasing aviation emissions has to be checked."
"In my view, the simple, common sense options for a solution offering a reduction in aviation emissions are the following."
"First, a general reduction in air travel through encouragement of the use of other, less polluting means of transport, such as rail transport."
"For this to be achieved, there has to be genuinely fair competition, which historically there has not been."
"It almost escapes logical explanation why today aviation is still not subject to fuel tax or VAT, and this anachronism surely needs to be corrected."
"The corresponding air-fare price increases that will result will not only make people use, when possible, alternative, more environmentally-friendly means of transport, but may cause them to limit their travelling altogether, which is not a bad thing."
"The second option is the improvement of the fuel efficiency of aviation engines."
"For this to be achieved, novel engine technology research and development needs to be promoted even more intensively."
"State assistance to that end should be encouraged most strongly."
"The third option is the introduction and promotion of aviation fuels which have less impact on the environment."
"In this respect, more research should be encouraged into novel fuels such as biofuels."
"The fourth option would be the phasing-out of old inefficient aircraft, some of which cause two or three times as much damage to the environment as more modern aircraft."
"To this end, the airline industry must be given clear incentives for regularly upgrading their aircraft."
"Fifthly, there is the option of operating a more efficient service."
"There has already been mention of aircraft holding circles and running half-empty aircraft."
"Surely there is scope for improvement in efficiency in that area."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here, at last, is a report that takes a sufficiently critical line on the impact of aviation on climate change."
"I am much obliged to the rapporteur."
"All the previous speakers have mentioned the enormous growth rates recorded in aviation."
"The rates are so high that their further growth could destroy all the savings that the other economic sectors have worked very hard to achieve."
"For this reason, aviation, too, must of course be taken into account in the Kyoto objectives if it is not to continue to be privileged in such an abominable way."
"Since we have waited so long, a whole package of measures is now needed to bring the negative impact under control – emissions trading alone will by no means suffice."
"As my fellow Member has already said, tourism within Europe will also benefit as a result."
"This is not possible at the moment at global level, but we must take action at long last, before the emissions from aviation eat up all the savings we have made in other economic sectors. We cannot wait any longer."
"Mr President, information provided by the International Civil Aviation Organisation shows that the airline industry in Europe transports over 320 million passengers each year."
"This means that around 110 000 aircraft produce emissions that irreversibly pollute the air every day."
"It is estimated that by 2050 the amount of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere by the airline industry will reach 5% (in 2000 this figure stood at 2%)."
"In accordance with Eurocontrol forecasts, by 2020 the number of flights in the European Union will more than double compared to 2003."
"This data shows that the negative effects of the growth of the aviation industry outweigh its benefits for society in terms of technological progress."
"We have to try to limit these harmful effects on the environment while maintaining the principle of competitiveness within the growing cheap airlines market, as these airlines have become incredibly popular in Europe."
"We should also remember that the air transport sector generates around four million jobs, and that is why it is vital to carry out a detailed investigation into the influence of the airline industry on air pollution and the increase in noise levels."
"However, the main pressure should be placed on trade in emission permits and the creation of an appropriate system for enforcing this method."
"The system for trade in permits for aviation should cover all flights to and from all airports on European Union territory, regardless of the country of origin of the airline."
"If possible, it should also cover intercontinental transit flights passing through European Union airspace."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first thing we need is a standardised European procedure for stemming the environmental impact of air transport."
"Unilateral measures at national level such as airline-ticket taxes and kerosene taxes will not work."
"Emissions trading in air transport is the right course of action but, from a transport-policy point of view – or from my point of view – the main instruments contained in the Lucas report are wrong."
"Firstly, we need aviation to be included in the existing EU Emissions Trading Scheme."
"A separate scheme would be counterproductive and would stall the growth in air transport. That conflicts with our Lisbon Strategy."
"Why is that the case?"
"There is no market without suppliers and, in the early days, air transport will buy only on the basis of its growth rates and of technical innovations for the long term."
"In addition, a separate scheme would require a new administrative structure and contradict our intention to strive for better lawmaking."
"What would we then do with other modes of transport?"
"Would we need further schemes?"
"This does not make any sense."
"Secondly, I reject the inclusion of non-CO2 climate-change impacts through multipliers."
"Let us look at Switzerland, Sweden and the United Kingdom, where the NOx problem is regulated by means of landing charges."
"It makes sense to do it that way."
"Mr President, when some time ago we drafted the emissions trading directive, it was hard to imagine any other report that would have so much influence on the situation in Europe and about which the decision-makers knew so little."
"At the time, Europe was stepping into unknown territory, because there was only very little theoretical research into the effects of emissions trading."
"Now, however, those effects are very well known, especially those which hamper European competitiveness, as well as the effects which, paradoxically, damage the global environment."
"As we are now extending the front where the fight against climate change is taking place, we can no longer afford to make the same mistakes again."
"It is in this context now that the call in this report for the EU to show leadership in the fight against climate change by taking regional and early action reminds me too much of an attitude for which at present we are paying rather a high price."
"It cannot be considered leadership when we act alone, while others show their support from the sidelines."
"It is obvious that we have to address the problem of emissions from aviation, but the success of the project itself will be decided by the remedies chosen to achieve the goal."
"Now that we are wise when it comes to the current emissions trading scheme, we know that we need a common global way forward, so that the environment might benefit from it best."
"If the proposed actions, therefore, are to be realised, they will need to be examined much more widely and approached with caution, because we now need workable practices rather than ideology."
"On the basis of my initiative and in the name of our group, we have tabled an amendment in which we insist on a clear evaluation of the effects being made, caps on emissions being defined, and an explanation regarding what agency will in practice be responsible for the action to bring about reductions as called for, and, in particular, how we are to ensure that airlines outside the EU are also involved in emissions trading."
"If we do not have this knowledge base, once again we will be building a house of cards."
"Other options for emissions trading itself should also be studied."
"The priority remedies are, for example, the development of technology and the smooth flow of air traffic itself, because a good number of emissions are the result of using obsolete fleets and airport congestion."
"It was therefore regrettable that with the emissions directive we made such unsatisfactory progress in such a crucial area."
"With the Commission now drafting its own proposal on emissions trading in aviation, it is surely time for it to make a comeback."
"Mr President, when it comes to the environment, aviation always seems to me to be the easiest target to blame for emissions."
"However, there is sufficient evidence in the public domain that appears to contradict what is called for as a solution in this report."
"As Mrs Doyle mentioned, the UK House of Lords recently finalised a report on the effects of aviation on climate change."
"As she said, it states that the effect would be insignificant and likely to remain so for 30 years."
"Commissioner, Mrs Lucas, I have a copy of that report with me tonight."
"I would very much welcome your views on its contents."
"Similarly, as Mrs Doyle mentioned, figures published by IATA show that over the last 40 years, through technological development, aircraft are 70% more fuel efficient."
"I have no doubt that such technological advances will continue to improve the situation."
"We can already see that in the new generation of aircraft: the Airbus 380 and the Boeing 787."
"Given those two factors I suspect that the report’s author is more guilty of wishful thinking than scientific fact."
"One of my main concerns when addressing the topic is that Europe tries to act alone, making decisions which could potentially place EU airlines at a competitive disadvantage."
"There are international organisations – one of which is the International Civil Aviation Organization – that regulate the industry at a global level."
"I believe any action that is necessary should be taken at that level."
"In my view what is needed is incontrovertible scientific evidence, not speculation."
"That is why I support a full impact assessment being carried out before any proposals are brought forward."
"We must be careful in the messages that we send out, not only to the aviation industry, which contributes greatly to all our countries’ economies, but also to our citizens, who I believe have the right to continue to enjoy affordable air travel, whether on business or for pleasure."
"Mr President, I thank the Members of Parliament for their very important speeches and for their contribution to this evening's debate."
"In closing this debate, I should like to say that the Community initiative in the sector in question is extremely important."
"As Mr Bradbourn said, aviation is a global sector and, as such, responsibility for the matters in question must lie with the International Civil Aviation Organization, and account must be taken of scientific results and scientific proof and of the very important study carried out by the House of Lords committee, which I too have seen. Without doubt, we shall have a full impact study to support our legislative proposal."
"I should also like to say that there is excellent cooperation between the European Union and the International Civil Aviation Organization."
"On the question of climate change, in particular, we must take action at European Union level, including for the simple reason that the European Union agreed in the Sixth Community Action Programme that it must determine, propose and take measures if the International Civil Aviation Organization failed to propose the relevant measures by 2002."
"This deadline expired a long time ago."
"Consequently, we must take action and, as I said earlier, the European Council called on the Commission last December to submit the relevant legislative proposal under the codecision procedure."
"In all events, the action we are examining will not contradict the European Union's commitments towards the International Civil Aviation Organization, given that the Civil Aviation Organization itself is in favour of an open system of emissions trading; in other words, it has accepted that emissions from international aviation will come under the current national systems of emissions trading rights."
"Our proposal moves in precisely this direction."
"Last year, as you know, the Community trading rights system was put into practice."
"This is the first and the largest international trading system and now, of course, is the best time for us to extend it by including aviation in a way that is compatible with the International Civil Aviation Organization."
"The European Union accounts for approximately 50% of total carbon dioxide emissions by international aviation, compared with Annex I countries, in other words countries which have restrictions in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol."
"Consequently, the measure recommended by the Commission will doubtless have important repercussions."
"We hope that this example will be followed by other countries."
"Finally, I should also like to refer to the concerns expressed to the effect that our proposal will put European companies at a disadvantage, compared with companies in third countries."
"This is not the case; there is no such risk because, under the Commission proposal, the trading system will cover all airlines operating flights in the geographical area, within the geographical scope of the system, irrespective of nationality."
"This means, therefore, that airlines in the European Union will be treated in exactly the same way as their foreign competitors."
"I hope that plenary will approve the motion and support the Commission's proposals."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Mr President, I am pleased with this Parliament's opinion report aimed at seeking alternatives and measures to alleviate the negative effects of aviation on the environment and its impact in terms of climate change."
"I would like to point to the danger of proposing measures aimed at increasing kerosene prices, take-off and landing fees or flight ticket prices, since these measures would have a direct impact on users, who would have to shoulder any increase in prices by airlines."
"This increase would harm tourist areas, such as the islands, and would increase the costs of imported products, which would have a negative impact for consumers living in island regions."
"It would also mean a loss of competitiveness for the islands and it would slow down accessibility to continental markets and the full integration of the island regions into the so-called ‘motorways of the sea’."
"I would call upon the Commission and the European Parliament, before taking the measures proposed, to carry out a study of their economic impact on all regions and to pay particular attention to regions with structural disadvantages due to natural, geographical and permanent conditions, as in the case of the islands."
"The next item is the report (A6-0230/2006) by Mrs Eija-Riita Korhola, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the application of the provisions of the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters to Community institutions and bodies [PE-CONS 3614/2006 – C6-0156/2006 – 2003/0242COD)]."
"."
"Mr President, the regulation on applying the provisions of the Aarhus Convention to Community institutions, which will finally be voted on regarding its adoption in tomorrow’s plenary session, will complete a process whose principal beneficiary will be the EU citizen."
"The issue concerns important environmental legislation which applies to access to environmental information and public participation in decision-making."
"Together with the Conciliation Committee we achieved a result in which we endorsed both of these, at Union level too."
"The end result itself is, I believe, a balanced one."
"I am particularly satisfied that our Conciliation Committee adopted it unanimously."
"At the same time I want to thank my fellow Members."
"After some initial problems of interpretation, we found a common policy, which we successfully upheld."
"I have been rapporteur for the Aarhus Convention throughout the entire process, ever stressing the importance of citizens’ rights in environmental matters."
"Openness and transparency are the lifeblood of democracy and a fundamental element in our own safety."
"That is why I am especially happy that we were able to improve the transparency of the institutions while retaining the powers, but also the accountability, of the institutions to which they are relevant."
"This concerns democratically elected institutions, such as the European Parliament, not forgetting the Council of course."
"In a democracy, the people are the highest authority and the decision-makers that they elect implement their will."
"That is why I did not consider it right to go down a path where politicians would be delegating power away from themselves to less open and less transparent agencies."
"The Aarhus Convention, ratified by the EU and the Member States in the European Community, will be implemented by means of three directives, the two first so-called pillars of which have already passed through the codecision procedure, with conciliation."
"These pillars concerned the transparency of environmental information and the public’s right to participate."
"The fate of the third pillar, the directive on access to justice, is, unfortunately, still unknown."
"As these three Aarhus pillars were now being extended to the EU’s own institutions, that brought with it some legal challenges which set this regulation apart from earlier ones, those which were targeted at Member States."
"One area which became problematic during conciliation was the proposals regarding access to environmental information."
"Parliament’s amendments contained technical and legal errors, which was one factor in the reason why our Conciliation Committee was closer to the view of the Commission and the Council than was still evident after the second reading."
"The exceptions to releasing environmental information were one example of this."
"Parliament, after the second reading, would have liked to rely on Directive 2003/4/EC, intended for the Member States, as far as exceptions to access to EC environmental information were concerned."
"Legally, however, it would have been impossible, as the directive is only intended for the Member States."
"The final solution was to apply Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001/EC, which deals with the public scrutiny of documents held by the EC institutions and which is tailor-made for this very purpose."
"This way the approach is consistent for all types of information."
"The other difficult area where we abandoned the view reached during the second reading was the right for the public to participate in the drafting of action plans and programmes funded by the EU institutions."
"Right at the start there had been some confusion over concepts relating to this amendment."
"Some understood that the amendments related to access to information, although the question was about the right to participate."
"We nevertheless negotiated a good compromise."
"With these few compromises we succeeded in preserving the spirit of the changes during Parliament’s second reading, although we did also abandon some of them in the end."
"Other important achievements in line with Parliament’s policy were lengthening the period of time citizens have to make their voice heard, and broadening the scope of the obligation which the EC institutions are under to open their archives."
"Furthermore, with regard to access to justice, Parliament succeeded in extending from four weeks to six the period during which NGOs may avail themselves of access to justice."
"In the regulation itself, NGOs have been given a special role: that of requesting an internal review with regard to decisions by the institutions."
"This role, now created for them by the regulation, is important for the Union."
"I wish to thank the environmental organisations for their involvement and their input during the Aarhus legislation process."
"Although perhaps we did not always agree, for example, on the scope of the rights accorded them, I appreciate and respect their desire to genuinely be involved in drafting better environmental legislation in the EU."
"The future will show how well we have succeeded in our task."
"If the regulation is to work in practice as well as the two earlier directives, it will raise transparency in the EU to a level which will serve both our common inclinations and the public in the best way possible."
"Finally, I wish to say a special thank you to Austria for the excellent work it did as the country holding the presidency of the Council."
"This was the third form of conciliation which I led in my capacity as rapporteur."
"My experience of the Austrian representatives’ expertise, familiarity with the subject and negotiating skills was incredible, and I therefore have every reason to give Austria top marks for its presidency."
"Similarly, I would like to thank the Commission’s representatives for their excellent levels of cooperation, which I have enjoyed throughout the entire Aarhus process since it began in 2000."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Korhola, rapporteur for the Aarhus Convention, and Vice-President Vidal-Quadras, who chaired the conciliation committee with the Council, for the excellent results achieved during conciliation."
"The discussions held were constructive and achieved positive results and feasible solutions."
"The few outstanding matters have been settled satisfactorily, which is why the Commission supports the conciliation text."
"European citizens will therefore have a legislative framework which will guarantee them access to environmental information and participation in decision making on environmental matters."
"This being so, the Commission recommends that Parliament ratify the excellent results achieved by its negotiating team."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this outcome of the conciliation aims to achieve greater transparency in environmental matters and greater public participation in decision-making with regard to these."
"Mrs Korhola’s report makes it very clear that there had been a wide variety of developments in the legislative procedure and also some documents that certainly would not have met with our approval."
"Seen from this point of view, the compromise reached is undoubtedly acceptable."
"Evaluating this text on the basis of the objectives given is another matter, however. These state quite clearly that, through public participation, every citizen should be able to live in the environment he or she finds pleasant, yet this objective cannot actually be achieved, as everyone has a different way of looking at his or her environment."
"The fact is that this is a noble objective and, if I take it as a basis, our achievements do not live up to it."
"I should also like to make the basic comment that this compromise, in particular, fails to meet the general demand for less bureaucracy, more transparency and more democracy; on the contrary, it is completely wide of the mark."
"The additional bureaucracy that this proposal entails is hardly acceptable."
"In addition, from my perspective, it is unacceptable to grant special rights to non-governmental organisations in the environmental field."
"After all, many proposals and amendments would make it possible for NGOs to block or amend legislative texts from this House and Council just like that."
"I value the work done by NGOs in the environmental field, in particular, but I also see them as just lobbyists and representatives of a certain movement, like representatives of enterprises or associations."
"In this regard, we must follow closely what progress is being made with the legislative text, what the impact is on legislation in general, and also which objectives are being achieved – quite apart from the fact that I can also see this leading to harmful competition between enterprises and, potentially, to distortions of competition."
"We must monitor this situation."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentleman, Commissioner, I would like firstly to express my satisfaction with the agreement reached."
"The most important thing at the moment is for this legislation to be applied as soon as possible."
"In that way we will increase our objective of transparency in the environmental measures adopted at Community level."
"I would like to highlight certain positive aspects, such as the work carried out by the trialogue, with the participation of the Commission, the Austrian Presidency and the group of MEPs who took part in it."
"I believe that through all of this work we are improving access to information relating to issues affecting the environment, making the exceptions, and their interpretation, more restrictive."
"I would also like to stress, in relation to public participation in the adoption of decisions, that it is very important that that participation has been increased in the preparation, modification and revision of the environmental plans and programmes funded by the European Investment Bank."
"It is also an achievement for the citizens that, when adopting decisions on environmental plans or programmes, the relevant Community institution or body must inform, and not just make reasonable efforts – as the text previously said – to inform, the public in relation to all decisions, since in that way we will increase the transparency of this kind of process."
"With regard to access to information, perhaps the most important thing is the agreement reached on the basis of Regulation 1049."
"Since this Regulation is in force and relates to public access to documents held by the institutions of the European Community, there will be a system for access to all kinds of information held by the institutions and bodies of the European Union."
"Finally, as well as repeating that I hope this agreement will be approved tomorrow and be implemented as soon as possible, I hope that the Community institutions and bodies will recognise that its effective application will benefit everybody and that they will act on that basis."
"This is a legal tool that will in many cases help us to preserve the environment."
". – Mr President, I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur and indeed everybody involved in reaching an agreement which has produced a joint text on this important regulation concerning the Aarhus Convention."
"In Parliament and elsewhere we often speak about bringing Europe closer to its citizens."
"Well, Aarhus translates our words into action."
"I believe this regulation certainly helps to put flesh on the bones of Aarhus."
"Too often governments and other public bodies pay lip-service to public consultation and participation."
"It is seen as a necessary evil to be dispensed with as soon as possible; an inconvenience that the real decision makers have to endure."
"Too often public participation is filed away in some deep, dark drawer and very conveniently ignored."
"That was and, in many cases still is, the system."
"That system has decided in its wisdom that the public – the ordinary citizens – whose lives will be immediately and permanently affected by certain environmental decisions cannot be trusted to participate in and influence such important decisions."
"The system is due for a shake-up and this regulation will significantly help that process."
"Commissioner Wallström speaks of Plan D – for dialogue, debate and democracy."
"Well, Plan A, which is Aarhus, is surely a framework for ensuring that we can have dialogue, debate and democracy in environmental matters."
"Unfortunately we have not yet ratified the Aarhus Convention in my own country, the Republic of Ireland, unlike most of our neighbours in the EU."
"That continues to place Irish citizens at a disadvantage, as Aarhus is the world’s most far-reaching treaty on environmental rights and guarantees public rights to access to information and public participation in environmental decision making."
"This regulation, I am sure, will be welcomed by those who have an interest in the proposed incinerator in Ringsend in Dublin and will have certainly greatly facilitated those with concerns about Corrib Gas in the west of Ireland."
"However, I am pleased that, in this House at least, we are going in the right direction even if some countries, like my own, are dragging their heels."
"Mr President, the EU has problems with its image."
"There is all too little transparency, and it is too hard for committed citizens to participate in the decision-making process, as the previous speaker so eloquently described."
"The Aarhus Convention, governing the conditions for participation by NGOs in the environmental legislation process, has addressed this issue."
"This splendid Convention has been ratified by all the Member States, but clearly has not been implemented as it properly should have been."
"Now it is the EU that is to ensure that this legislation is implemented."
"There have been many problems achieving this state of affairs on a basis that is merely more or less consistent, but so numerous have been the improvements introduced as a result of the second reading that we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will support the proposal, even though it is far indeed from being as good as it could have been if the EU had lived up to its own fine words about being there for the people."
"It is, however, a pity that the Commission’s clear text on access for NGOs to the European Court of Justice has been watered down by the Council and by Parliament."
"It is now not at all clear whether this access actually exists."
"We hope, however, that future cases will work out in favour of the NGOs, and thus of the EU."
"."
"Mr President, in my constituency in Ireland there is a battle being fought."
"Men, women and children are standing guard everyday in Pallaskenry, County Limerick, blocking their county council from cutting off the pipes which supply them with the clean, spring-fed lake water that they and their ancestors have been using for thousands of years and from forcing them instead to take a supply of water from the River Deal, one of Ireland’s most polluted rivers."
"In another stand-off in Bantry, County Cork, people are camping out at strategic positions, blocking workers sent to run unnecessary over-the-ground high-voltage power lines across their farms."
"These groups are not only in the blockades but they are in the High Court, at great personal expense, and are being threatened by our justice system with prison."
"With Aarhus these situations should not be happening in Ireland."
"Is there anything you can do to help us?"
"Our government has signed the Aarhus Convention, which makes our government look good among its nation peers, but our government is one of the few signatories that refuse to ratify it and to give it effect."
"The Aarhus Convention demands that we the people contribute information and have access to it, that the people are part of every decision taken about the environment and that we have affordable and ready access to justice when it is necessary to protect the environment and the families in it."
"By not ratifying Aarhus, the Irish Government thinks it can continue its practice of riding roughshod over its people, whilst kowtowing to any and every wealthy investor, regardless of the damage it will do to people’s lives, health and environment."
"This report seeks to urge a better application of Aarhus, but we in Ireland have no application."
"Please put pressure on the Irish Government to finally ratify Aarhus, even at this late date, and see the people as an ally rather than an enemy in the effort to protect the environment."
"Over the past years we have heard at various European forums about how important it is for the European Union to be close to its citizens and to make the operation of its institutions more transparent."
"The adoption of the Aarhus Convention by the European Union is a significant step in this direction."
"Environmental protection is the area in which the general public probably shows the highest level of interest in the performance of our institutions, and apart from having access to information, it also wants to participate in decision-making."
"Finding the balance between the ever-increasing publicity and maintaining the institutions' ability to operate is not an easy task."
"It would not be right to create a situation that would lead to the proliferation of court cases."
"I believe that we can expect civil organisations wishing to exercise their rights to operate in a law-abiding manner themselves, and in exchange, we should not infringe their rights with unjustified exceptions."
"This is why I am disappointed that the final version of the proposal does not include access rights to projects financed by European institutions."
"We can hardly expect citizens to identify with a Europe that accepts certain fundamental principles, but at the same time is ready to provide financial assistance to objectives that they oppose."
"Moreover, Europe should also provide an example to Member States in this respect, as we have heard earlier."
"Overall, I am convinced of the advantages of social control."
"I am aware that the affected bodies may often view social control as an inconvenience, and it may seem unnecessarily complicated to them."
"Still, at an overall social level, it does lead to decisions that are better than those made without the participation of citizens and their organisations."
"After all, this is the basis of democracy, is it not?"
"Thank you very much, and congratulations to my colleague Mrs Korhola for her excellent work."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A6-0231/2006) by Johannes Blokland, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators and repealing Directive 91/157/EEC [PE-CONS 3615/2006 – C6–0154/2006 – 2003/0282(COD)]."
"."
"Mr President, finally, the moment had arrived."
"On 3 May 2006, more than two and a half years after the Commission had presented a proposal for the review of the Batteries Directive, the Council and Parliament, through conciliation, reached agreement on the final text."
"First of all, I should like to thank the Austrian Presidency for the constructive way in which this dossier was brought to a favourable conclusion."
"In the 23 amendments that were adopted at second reading, the presidency, and by extension also the Council, did more than meet this House halfway."
"I should also like to thank all Members of this House, especially those who were in the delegation and the conciliation secretariat, for their commitment and support. It is partly thanks to them that we have a good result."
"In addition, I am indebted to the Commission for its input in the compromises and the drafting of new text proposals."
"This has proved invaluable in terms of the process whereby agreement was reached."
"What have we now achieved?"
"I should like to single out a few key points."
"First of all, the directive enables consumers to choose a cost-effective battery more easily."
"After all, the cheapest battery is not always the most cost-effective."
"Since the directive makes it compulsory for producers to specify the capacity on batteries, consumers can assess the price/quality ratio themselves and select the most cost-effective battery for each purpose."
"Secondly, the agreement also stipulates that it must be straight-forward to remove batteries from appliances."
"By replacing the battery, we can prevent consumers from having to dispose of perfectly good appliances because the battery is flat."
"Thirdly, the producer must take back batteries after use and handle the recycling of them."
"This also applies to those supplied in the past."
"Fourthly, the directive requires all Member States to set up an effective collection system."
"This is a considerable improvement for at the moment, only six Member States have a national collection system for batteries."
"Moreover, the differences in collection percentages are still very high, ranging from 59% in Belgium to 16% in France."
"Fifthly, all producers of batteries in the European Union will be registered, so that all producers will be responsible for funding the collection and processing of spent batteries."
"Finally, I should like to mention the keystone of the directive on which we had already reached agreement at first reading, namely the ban on cadmium in portable batteries, which enters into effect in 2008."
"As a result, this harmful metal will, in time, disappear from household waste, with a consequent benefit to the environment and to public health."
"Moreover, the alternatives to nickel cadmium batteries appear to be far superior."
"Given the positive negotiation result, I warmly recommend this House to vote, tomorrow, in favour of the new Batteries Directive, and should like to ask the Council to do likewise as soon as possible, so that the new legislation can be published."
"In addition, the importance of what the Member States have to do in implementing and enforcing the Batteries Directive should not be underestimated."
"I would express the wish and expectation that a start be made straight away, so that we do not need to do the impossible in the closing stages."
"In my view, a review will be needed in future with regard to the applications to which an exemption from the cadmium ban applies."
"I take it as read that the Commission will be attentive in this respect and will present a proposal to Parliament in due course."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the representatives of the European Parliament on the discussions held in the conciliation committee last May."
"In particular, I wish to thank Vice-President Roth-Behrendt, who chaired the conciliation committee, and Parliament's rapporteur, Mr Johannes Blokland, who truly made a very important contribution to the positive results achieved."
"The discussions in the conciliation committee were constructive and moved in the right direction, thanks also to the efforts of the Austrian Presidency, and agreement was reached on numerous important matters, as Mr Blokland mentioned: the possibility of removing accumulators from appliances, the exemption for very small battery producers, capacity labelling on batteries and other important matters to which positive solutions were found."
"The European Commission supports the outcome of the procedure and we recommend that Parliament vote in favour of the excellent results achieved by its negotiating team."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am much obliged to the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, for his committed work."
"Of course, his original proposals were rather more ambitious than the outcome of the Conciliation Committee we have ended up with, and so it could be said that this is not an unqualified success for the environment."
"What was decided does, however, represent a clear improvement in the protection of human beings and the environment against the hazardous chemicals that can escape from batteries."
"That is why a vast majority in the House should support this outcome tomorrow."
"I agreed with Mr Blokland on most points but, even from the start of the procedure, I disagreed with the extension of the cadmium ban to industrial batteries."
"I am pleased that we have managed to find a solution in committee at second reading."
"A cadmium ban relating to industrial batteries – unlike such a ban relating to portable batteries – would have put too great a strain on industry whilst having little effect on the environment, as we have an effective recycling system for industrial batteries."
"The German Federal Environment Agency has informed me that even operators of certain plants in the Libyan desert are looking into how to dispose of their industrial batteries, as these batteries are so large that they cannot just be put into the household waste."
"Even in the Libyan desert, therefore, recycling is a real consideration, and that is why I advocated a derogation for these from the outset – which has in fact been laid down in the final resolution."
"I agree with all the other proposals Mr Blokland has presented, however, and am glad that agreement has been reached between all three institutions."
"Mr President, I too would like to begin by thanking Mr Blokland."
"It has been a long process, and you have worked hard."
"You have seen eye to eye with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament for a large part of the way."
"It is also for this reason that we are able to support the compromise even if, like the preceding speaker, we are not entirely satisfied."
"There are certain areas where this piece of legislation could have been better."
"We do not agree that cordless power tools, specifically, should be excepted."
"They account for a large proportion of the cadmium batteries in use today."
"There are alternatives, which may be reusable."
"It may also be possible not to let some of these batteries slip through the system, and for the environmental damage therefore not to be as large – if, that is, the system works."
"We must simply point out, however, that there are alternatives, and since there are alternatives, why should we not use them?"
"Why should we not, then, ban these hazardous batteries?"
"It is, of course, the progress, indeed great progress, made that ensures that we are supporting this legislation despite everything."
"The capacity labelling is a good thing, particularly for consumers."
"We are, of course, aware of all the advertisements for batteries – I shall not specify any product names, but there is definitely something to do with a rabbit – and the manufacturers clearly wish to give the impression that these batteries last much longer than those of their competitors."
"It is also possible that they do just that, but now we will have proof of the matter, because it will now state on the packaging how much energy such a battery contains."
"This is clearly a good thing."
"A further positive is that we are obliging the manufacturers to ensure that if there is a battery in an appliance it must be easy to remove."
"Another positive is the fact that we in Europe will now have a high overall percentage of recycling."
"Again, we could well have wished for an even higher figure, but we are happy to have Community rules in this area."
"All in all we have to say that it is an important area that we are now legislating for at Community level."
"Our ambitions were higher than what has been achieved, but we nonetheless support the legislation, overall, on the basis of the improvements that have been achieved."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I support the aims of this directive, which forms part of European environmental policy."
"As a member of Parliament’s delegation to the Conciliation Committee, I advocated a degree of flexibility, especially for accumulators that allow safety requirements to be met."
"The wording proposed by the Conciliation Committee not only allows ambitious rules and targets to be retained – especially in terms of collection and recycling – but also allows account to be taken of reality and of the efforts being made by the manufacturers of accumulators, especially for industrial use."
"Distributor take-back is in fact adopted as the default method of collection, but schemes that are already working can be retained, provided an assessment, which must be made public, shows that they are at least as effective as distributor take-back."
"This guarantee of equivalent effectiveness in terms of collection seems to me to be crucial for a flexible but non-permissive system."
"Moreover, appliances must be designed in such a way that used batteries and accumulators are easy to remove and they must be accompanied by instructions containing information for consumers."
"However, these provisions will not apply where, for safety, performance, medical or data integrity reasons, continuity of power supply is necessary and a permanent connection between the appliance and the battery is required."
"Once again, flexibility is closely circumscribed."
"I nevertheless remain sceptical about capacity labelling of portable and automotive batteries and accumulators; and while I understand this concern for consumer information, I think that too many variables, such as conditions of use and usage, affect the life of such batteries and accumulators."
"Finally, the joint text that is being put to the vote seems to me to bring balanced responses to the different institutions’ demands."
"I therefore invite you to vote in favour of this text, and I thank our rapporteur for the quality of his work."
"Mr President, thank you, Mr Blokland, for a long fight that eventually led to an acceptable result."
"The Council was pulled this way and that by the industry’s lobbyists and fought against the best interests of consumers and the environment."
"I wonder what EU citizens would say if they knew that a majority of their governments were fighting against the consumers’ right to know the capacity of the batteries they buy."
"The Council wants us to buy a pig in a poke."
"What would voters say if they knew that the Council did not want batteries to be easily removable so that they might be recycled easily or have their lifetime extended?"
"What would voters say if they knew that their governments were fighting tooth and nail to obtain the lowest possible level of liability in respect of extremely poisonous heavy metals?"
"As luck would have it, Parliament succeeded in putting most things right, but, scandalously enough, cadmium batteries in hand tools are still permitted."
"On this issue, the industry lobby unfortunately won, both in the Council and in Parliament."
"Thank you, Mr Blokland. You have done a good job, and I shall vote in favour of the report."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The first item on the agenda will be a statement by myself; 70 years after General Franco's coup d'état in Spain, on 18 July 1936."
"As you know, a group of 200 Members signed a request for an oral question to the Commission and the Council explicitly calling for a debate on condemning the Franco regime on the 70th anniversary of General Franco’s coup d’état."
"The Conference of Presidents did not accept that request and thought it more appropriate for the President to make a statement and for the various political groups then to express their opinions about the significance of this date."
"That is what we are doing now."
"We are talking about a date that is now way back in history: 70 years have passed since 18 July 1936."
"That is almost the life expectancy of the generation of Spaniards who took part in the transition to democracy, a transition that is seen as a model, but whose success required selective forgetfulness and suspension of memory, which is now emerging in a process of recovery which is filling the book shops and even being enshrined in laws."
"As I told you two years ago, I belong to that generation – like many of the Spanish Members here – and my personal relationship with the past inevitably determines my memory."
"This is an institutional statement, however, that I am making as President of the House, and what I say today must be a political act that goes beyond the personal."
"To bring our past to bear upon the present is an act of will which relates, above all, to the future that we want to build, and we want to build it not just upon the fragile and perishable memory of each of us, but upon History, which is not remembered, but rather learnt, and for that very reason can be shared."
"History tells us that on that day part of the Spanish army – just a part of it – rose up against the Government of the Second Republic, democratically elected by the Spanish people in 1931."
"That put an end to a great hope, because that republic had come with the intention of promoting democracy and carrying out necessary wide-ranging reforms: agricultural reforms, military reforms, the separation of Church and State, the establishment of social security, Statutes of Autonomy for the regions, rights such as votes for women and divorce, within a profoundly patriarchal society."
"Those reforms became a reference point for many European countries."
"They were a reference for democracy in Europe, the new frontier of democracy in Europe, a democracy that was facing difficult times at that point, having fallen in Italy, in Greece, in Poland, in Hungary and in Germany."
"That coup d’état did not just lead to a long and cruel civil war in Spain, therefore, but it also put an end to that hope for Europe that André Malraux had spoken of."
"The war in Spain was not just a war and it was not just Spanish."
"It was a confrontation between two great views of the world."
"Yes, the two Spains of Larra and Machado were returning, and one of the two Spains froze the heart of each Spaniard."
"A war between Spaniards would not have lasted so long, however, simply because our own forces would not have allowed it."
"The war was a decisive moment in the history of the world."
"It was of immense significance internationally."
"From 1936, Europe’s future participants in the Second World War came into direct or indirect conflict with each other during the Spanish civil war."
"Spain was the first great battle of the Second World War, the test bench for a war to come that would devastate Europe."
"For the first time in history civil populations were bombed."
"We all remember Guernica, but there were many Guernicas in Spain."
"Europeans lost their lives on both sides and their names populate the cemeteries of Madrid, of Jarama, of Belchite, of Teruel, of Guadalajara, of the Ebro …, mythical names, where so many Europeans lie."
"Their fellow Europeans then went on to fight across the whole of Europe in order to liberate it For some people that war was the last great cause, for others it was a crusade."
"I remember the crusade, the bishops saluting in the fascist style, surrounding generals at the entrances to the churches."
"I also remember the cemeteries full of people shot by one side or the other."
"It was the most passionate war, in which the ideologies of the 20th century confronted each other for the first time: democracy, fascism and communism."
"It was a religious war, but at the same time a class war, a revolution faced with a reaction."
"It was a conflict that would continue in Europe and which also continued in Spain after the war had finished, because it was not just a war. There was also a long and hard post-war period, during which it was no longer a question of beating the enemy, since the war had been won, but rather of eradicating it, in order to maintain a system that lasted for a long time and kept Spain out of the process of democratisation and also the process of reconstruction experienced by Europe as a result of the Marshall Plan."
"Many of our colleagues from the countries of the East remember the isolation they suffered as a result of Yalta and the iron curtain that separated them from the free, democratic and prosperous Europe, and that is what it was like."
"What people remember less, however, is that there were countries in the South of Europe – Spain and Portugal – that were also isolated from this movement and which remained under military dictatorships for a long time."
"I remember that a US congressman once complained to me that the Europeans were not grateful for the efforts the United States had made to liberate Europe."
"I had to remind him that, as far as Spain was concerned, that effort was conspicuous by its absence, since they forgot to liberate us, because the military regime was useful to them during the Cold War."
"Today I would like to use the words of Salvador de Madariaga, whose name appears on one of our buildings."
"‘Before 1936’, he said, ‘all of the Spaniards lived in Spain and in freedom."
"‘Today’, he said in 1954, ‘hundreds of thousands live in freedom exiled from Spain and the rest live in Spain exiled from freedom’."
"Freedom returned in 1975."
"We began to build the foundations of a community based on democracy, freedom and the prospect of joining Europe."
"New generations have brought new political demands regarding the future and regarding the past."
"They have been faced with a war and a dictatorship that have been placed at one remove from them and, when we talk in Spain today about moral reparation for the victims, what we want to do is to discuss the active memory of our country, of our society, in order to accept our past fully, in order to honour all of the dead and in order to face the obvious truths, not to forget those events that are uncomfortable for us and not to allow ourselves to be consoled by untruths."
"These are painful wounds that have begun to heal in Europe, but which remain in many people’s memories, because at the time it was not possible to exorcise them."
"That is the purpose of the event we are holding today here in the European Parliament: to face a past that lives on in part of our continent’s memory in order not to repeat yesterday’s mistakes, in order clear-sightedly to condemn those responsible for them, in order to pay tribute to those people’s victims and in order to acknowledge all those who fought for democracy, suffered persecution and promoted Spain’s return to Europe, as our common heritage."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats following this statement on the recent history of Spain."
"I would like to stress that our position is essentially based on full support for the values of reconciliation and of overcoming a past tragedy, which were the values that inspired the transition to democracy and which led to the 1978 Constitution."
"On a day like tomorrow, a 5th of July 30 years ago, the President of the Spanish Government, Adolfo Suárez, took on his job of taking our democratic transition forward."
"For those of us who had the honour and opportunity to assist in that project and to belong to the Union of the Democratic Centre - that party which, in government, was responsible for the material execution of the transition, aided by other political formations and supported unequivocally by Spanish society and His Majesty the King - our values of freedom and reconciliation enshrined in the Spanish Constitution of 1978 and our call for an end to the two irreconcilable Spains arose from our very deepest convictions."
"The mistake, the stupidity, the tragedy of the last century of Spanish history, was the ease with which the two opposing Spains have been able to re-emerge – an excessive phenomenon that has always existed in our country – the ease with which those two Spains were able to convince themselves that they could not live together democratically."
"We are all aware of the origin and the raison d’être of the European Union, which is founded upon the same moral strength as that Spanish Constitution, the moral strength of people joining together, the moral strength of unity, so that our recent past will not repeat itself, so that no more world wars will emerge on European soil, no more wars, no more dictatorships, no more communist regimes and no more civil wars like the one we suffered in Spain."
"The new nations of Europe may make mistakes when dealing with our present and future problems, but there is one mistake that we cannot make, that we do not have the right to make: to repeat historical mistakes, not to learn from the mistakes of our history."
"For all of these reasons, we must not become tired of reconciliation and harmony."
"We must not change our attitude, and many Spaniards believe it to be an historical mistake to try to promote a second transition today, as if the first one had grown old and obsolete; it is an historical mistake to unilaterally destroy the essence of our Constitution of harmony; it is historically foolish to introduce the debate on the right to self-determination in Spain, the creation within Spain of new nations that have never existed; it is an historical mistake because it moves us away from the harmony we have created."
"On this thirtieth anniversary of the Spanish democratic transition, therefore, Mr President, which began on 5 July 1976, and on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, please allow me to end with a 'viva' for reconciliation, a ‘viva’. for freedom and a ‘viva’ for the Spanish Constitution of 1978."
"Mr President, having listened to your speech, I would like to ask what was the spirit behind Franco and his regime?"
"We all know that spirit."
"It is the spirit of intolerance, of contempt for mankind, it is the spirit that smashes democratic institutions, the spirit that hates everything that is not how it would like it to be."
"Behind Franco and his regime was contempt for mankind and deadly propensity for violence."
"Unconditional subjection to its own ideology or death — that was the message of the Franco regime."
"It was not a Spanish message, however, because when Franco seized power 70 years ago my country had already been suffering under the Hitler dictatorship for three years and Mussolini had already been ruling for 14 years in Italy."
"At that time, the fascist movement of which Franco was a — primarily militaristic – part already existed all over Europe."
"The civil war was not just a Spanish civil war."
"Spain was its main territory and the Spanish people its main victims, but the Spanish people were also its hostages in a trial run for a greater war."
"Guernica and the Condor Legion are and remain a blot on my country’s history."
"The youth of the 1930s were a glorious page in European and world history, travelling to Spain to defend democracy of their own accord."
"Ernest Hemingway created an unforgettable literary monument to that generation."
"The famous American writer Arthur Miller once said that in the 30s the word Spain was an explosion."
"It was about overcoming clerical feudalism and setting the spirit of freedom and tolerance against the demon of intolerance."
"If we think of Spain today, we on Europe’s left think of the countless victims that civil war claimed from among our ranks — but not only from ours."
"There were also Christian Democrats, Liberals and Republicans who stood against that intolerance."
"Franco was opposed worldwide by the whole community of thinkers and nations, who opposed that totalitarian desire for subjugation that was associated with Franco."
"Franco lost."
"If we can take stock of the situation here in this House 70 years later, then I would draw your attention to the fact that since direct elections were introduced three Presidents of the European Parliament have been Spaniards: one conservative Christian Democrat and two Social Democrats."
"If today, 70 years later, a Spanish President of Catalan origin is able to say, on behalf of the elected representatives of 25 nations of Europe, that European integration is a victory over intolerance and bondage, then, 70 years on, we can say that freedom has won and Franco has lost."
"Nothing better could happen to Europe!"
"."
"Mr President, Europe is rich in history and, even if the European Parliament must not seek to play the role of the sole keeper of the truth about the past, it is nevertheless important for the future of European integration that Parliament should feel responsible for Europe’s collective memory, which is the principal factor constituting European unity."
"We are now in 2006. This is the anniversary of the workers’ uprising in Poznan in June 1956 and of the Hungarian revolution in October 1956: dramatic events in the struggle for bread and freedom."
"This is 2006: seventy years ago, General Franco imposed a dictatorial regime opposed to freedom, democracy and the rule of law."
"Spain, which should have been one of the founder nations of the European Union, found itself against the will of its people separated from the rest of Europe for half a century."
"In contemplating these events, it would not be proper to tot up all the instances of injustice, hatred, conflict and human suffering from the periods of the Civil War and the dictatorship."
"So that such events might never happen again, we shall need, rather, to recall that Spain’s experience is also Europe’s, and one that led to the foundation and construction of the European Union."
"Europe should make a point of remembering that, if Spain has been able to close this dramatic chapter in its history by consensus, then it is through reconciliation and peaceful dialogue."
"Let us pay homage to the courage and wisdom of the Spanish people."
"In this anniversary year this Parliament and Europe as a whole should rejoice in knowing the freedom upon which they are based."
"Beyond all political divisions, Europe should feel united and wake up to the fact that now we know why Europe exists."
"In doing so, we also honour the dramatic experience that we commemorate with sadness today."
"Thank you very much."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Spain in 1936 is above all a lesson for us Europeans or, rather, four lessons."
"The first lesson has to do with the courage, self-sacrifice and extraordinary imagination of a people, the Spanish people, in striving towards freedom and democracy."
"Who could forget the extraordinary social inventions of free Catalonia?"
"Who could forget everything that the Spanish people attempted during this amazing period?"
"The second lesson concerns the barbarity of fascism, and, as we have just heard, one of its symbols is Guernica: the symbol of murder, assassination, incarceration; the symbol too of an international Fascist project, since it is clear that Spanish Fascism would never have been able to triumph without the help of National Socialism."
"In 1936, the Fascist project of European domination was already evident."
"The third lesson is harder to take on board because it is the lesson of cowardice: the cowardice of Europeans, the cowardice of the French – even if it was difficult for Léon Blum – the cowardice of the British, the cowardice of all those who thought that if the Spanish people paid the price, then they would not have to."
"As in Munich in 1938, this attitude turned out to be one of the great errors of that period, affording one of the great lessons that we need to learn from it."
"As history has shown, anyone who thinks that they can keep a low profile while the storm passes by on the other side is often mistaken."
"This is an important lesson which, for a very long time, has been very difficult for many Europeans to accept."
"Sometimes, pacifism paves the way for horror."
"Sometimes, it is a sign of courage."
"It is always very difficult to know whether pacifism or its alternative is the right course of action."
"If, however, it is necessary to speak of cowardice, then the courage shown should also be emphasised: that, for example, of Pierre Cot, a minister under Léon Blum who, as a minister, had arms sent to Spain."
"Let us recall that Pierre Cot, whose actions in this difficult period were heroic, is the father of one of our fellow Members, Jean-Pierre Cot, whom I thank for having reminded me of his father’s actions."
"The fourth lesson, finally, concerns the horrible intolerance of Communist totalitarianism, because we must not forget that there are two great images from the Spanish Civil War."
"The first is that of the international brigades who wanted to save the Spanish people, but at the same time there is that of the intolerant Communist brigades which murdered Trotskyist members of POUM, as well as anarchists, because they did not have the same political orientation."
"That, too, is a lesson of the Spanish Civil War."
"It shows us that liberation does not mean dismissing everybody else’s opinion; rather, it means accepting diversity and democracy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union must profit fully from all of these four lessons."
"We must recall them when there is barbarity in Bosnia or when there is a duty to show solidarity with oppressed peoples."
"If these lessons are learned well, then I believe that the future could be a little brighter."
"."
"Mr President, Parliament is acting as it should by organising this political act to commemorate the seventieth anniversary of Franco’s unleashing of the Spanish Civil War."
"Indeed, the destruction of that young Republic is, in more than one respect, relevant to the whole of Europe."
"First of all, the forces of the 1936 Putsch only managed to overcome the Popular Front with the decisive assistance of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany."
"It was, too, in Spain that the latter experimented with a view to its future against France, and Guernica was the first example in world history of the massacre of a civilian population by massive aerial bombardments which was to become a terrifying model for what took place throughout the Second World War."
"Those dark years, 1936 - 1939, demand the attention of Europe for yet another reason: the way in which the republicans were betrayed by neighbouring democracies."
"The non-intervention of 1936 paved the way for Munich in 1938, which led to continent-wide disaster from 1939."
"What, moreover, is to be said about the smug indifference of Western and European leaders in general to the Francoist regime after the war, as soon as its leader had joined the forces for good against the evil empire."
"In conclusion, there is one final reason why the Spanish tragedy has a European dimension: this is the unparalleled surge of international solidarity to which it gave rise among the workers and the common people, as well as among the most eminent European intellectuals; a solidarity strikingly illustrated by the International Brigades, composed of 40 000 volunteers from around fifty countries."
"Conversely, a number of Spanish republicans went on to be members of the French Resistance."
"Some of them would take part in the Paris insurrection of August 1944 under the leadership of my late lamented comrade Henri Rol-Tanguy."
"Others took part in the liberation of Strasbourg in November of the same year in the army of General Leclerc."
"Without doubt, the European consciousness would not be the same without the unspeakable suffering of the victims of Francoism, without the intrepid courage of those Spaniards who offered resistance and without the tide of solidarity on which the young Republic was borne."
"May today’s commemorative act on our part pay to all the women and men concerned the tribute that they deserve."
"."
"Mr President, in many ways I find it very difficult to know what to say today, because I, unlike many of my colleagues, am from a generation that does not have a living memory of the tragedy that was the very foundation of the European Union."
"However, I read history and I have some knowledge and understanding of it."
"We are speaking today about the 70th anniversary of Franco’s coup."
"An atrocity or a tragedy on the European continent is commemorated in the history books for every single day going back over 227 years."
"I suppose, then, what we really should be focusing on is that fascism, communism, imperialism and the totalitarian regimes we have experienced on our continent have a common thread: a lack of respect for human difference and different ideas and an intolerance towards those who want to chart a different path."
"Whether we are talking about Potsdam, Hungary, Gdańsk, Siberia, Spain, Portugal or Ireland, those who have tried to impose their will on others have always failed, because the very essence of our humanity is the desire to be free to ensure that we can live and interact with others."
"That is why it is most important that we not only learn from the mistakes of the past but also ensure that we never repeat them."
"Rather than criticising or pointing the finger and saying that this tragedy was more dramatic, more damaging or more influential in European politics than others, let us agree that it happened and use it as an example."
"In Europe today, we have been able to overcome those differences; we have found a forum and a way forward in which people from different countries, with different ideologies, different histories and different interpretations of the same history can come together and find common ground and a common cause."
"The best thing that we can do today in the European Parliament is to encourage Prime Minister Zapatero in his efforts to bring together what were previously irreconcilable peoples to find a common way forward in the Basque region."
"That is not to forgive the atrocities that were committed or to say that the wrongs did not take place; it is to say that you cannot go on living in the past, you cannot remain bitter."
"When the opportunity for peace arises, we must seize it as it passes."
"Mr President, the fact that today, throughout Central and Western Europe, we have democracy, civil liberties, private ownership and tolerance is due to the fact that Communism did not take hold on our continent, although it could have."
"In Eastern Europe, a dam against Communism was created by the victorious battle of the Poles against the Bolsheviks in 1920 and the decisive resistance of Catholic Poland against enforced Soviet dominance."
"The fact that Communism did not take root in the West is largely thanks to the victorious civil war fought by traditional Spain against Communist governments."
"Although it came to power democratically, the Spanish left behaved in a similar manner to the left in Bolshevik Russia, where the main target of attacks was the Church."
"Almost 7 000 priests were murdered."
"Churches were desecrated, roadside crosses and holy statues were shot at."
"Traditional forces immediately responded to this attack on Catholic Spain."
"The International Brigades, organised by Bolshevik Russia, came to the aid of Communist Spain."
"In accordance with Communist custom, these brigades were entirely controlled by Communist party cells and their secret services, as was the whole republican regime."
"Thanks to the Spanish right, the Spanish army, its leaders and thanks to General Francisco Franco in particular, the Communist attack on Catholic Spain was thwarted."
"By the same token, attempts to spread the Communist plague to other countries were also halted."
"The presence of figures such as Franco, Salazar or De Valera in European politics ensured that Europe maintained its traditional values."
"We lack such statesmen today."
"It is with some regret that we observe today the phenomenon of historical revisionism, which portrays all that is traditional and Catholic in an unfavourable light and everything that is secular and socialist in a favourable light."
"Let us remember that Nazism in Germany and fascism in Italy also had socialist and atheist roots."
"The power wielded by the socialist and anti-Catholic bloc in this House is cause for great concern."
"We saw clear examples of this power during the voting last month on the texts on tolerance and the Seventh Framework Programme."
"Christian Europe is losing the battle against a socialist and atheist Europe."
"This has to change!"
"Mr President, I would like to avail myself of the option of making personal statements at the end of debates."
"I cannot now remember which precise Rule of the Rules of Procedure it is, but I would ask you to allow me this personal statement."
"I have listened carefully to everything the previous speaker said."
"I will not go into it in detail, but I want to say one thing on behalf of myself and my group: what we have just heard is the spirit of Mr Franco."
"It was a fascist speech and it has no place in the European Parliament!"
"Mr President, I would like to take advantage, as Mr Schulz has done, of my right as a Member of Parliament and to take the floor briefly."
"I regret that you and the Conference of Presidents decided to dedicate so much time to the debate on Francisco Franco but did not permit even a minute to be spent discussing another terrible massacre which took place in Katyń."
"It was something I asked for on behalf of Poles and all those who died there."
"I very much regret the decision not to grant my request."
"Mr President, as a Catholic I would like to say that we stand for human dignity, human rights, the rule of law, democracy and freedom."
"We do not consider dictators and supporters of totalitarian regimes – be it fascism, national socialism or communism – the right people to defend our ideals."
"We defend our ideals with our own convictions."
"I would like to thank everybody who has taken part in this debate and I would like to thank the Members who have attended it, in particular those who are not Spanish, for the interest they have shown in this historic event, which was undoubtedly a tragedy."
"I would also like to point out that we have been accompanied in the public gallery by people whose historical memory has brought them here."
"– Mr President, as a Greek I am, I think, entitled to say that today we are at the end of a marathon run of debates and negotiations which started not in 2004, when the Commission submitted its proposal for the draft general regulation, but much earlier, in 2001, when we started the first debates on the future of the Structural Funds for the period 2007-2013."
"Parliament was present throughout this procedure and set its seal on the debates and negotiations: on the initially unofficial consultations we had with the European Commission, on the third cohesion report which followed and on the interim report on the regulation voted through last summer."
"Parliament sent out a double message in all these debates: firstly, that the European Union needed a credible cohesion budget;"
"I think we were one of the powers that overturned efforts by certain parties to limit the budget for the new programming period."
"The second message was that we needed an effective regulation without unnecessary red tape and, on the other hand, a regulation which would help to put the money of European citizens to good use."
"In January, we started negotiations in order to influence the final outcome, following decisions by the European Council, and to incorporate some of our basic positions."
"I would like to highlight the constructive attitude both of the European Commission and of Commissioner Hübner and of the Austrian Presidency in these negotiations and to thank both sides for cooperating with the European Parliament."
"Today we are being called upon to say yes or no to the text negotiated."
"As rapporteur for the general regulation, I call on my honourable friends here today to accept this text and to say yes for the following basic reasons:"
"Parliament, during the course of negotiations on the financial perspective, secured an additional EUR 300 million for transnational and interregional cooperation."
"In addition, Parliament managed to link financing for projects to access for people with disabilities."
"For the first time, it is stipulated that projects will not be financed unless accessibility to them for people with disabilities is secured first."
"We were also successful in getting civil society involved."
"Despite the Council's initial resistance, monitoring committees will also be attended by environmental partners, non-governmental organisations and other bodies which represent civil society."
"In addition, thanks to lobbying by Parliament, infrastructure in regions which are no longer Objective 1 convergence regions may also be financed with the Commission's approval. This is something that all these regions have asked for."
"We also managed to ensure there is a special article on sustainable development and the environment."
"In other words, we achieved what we have for years referred to as the 'greening' of the Structural Funds."
"There is a strong legal basis for not causing any further environmental damage via the Structural Funds."
"At the same time, we strengthened urban policy."
"The Member States are obliged to have more specific forecasts for towns. This obligation includes submitting a special list of the towns selected in order to address the relevant problems."
"We also signed a joint declaration with the Commission on an interim examination of the consequences of decommitting funds on the grounds of the Ν+2 or Ν+3 rule, because problems may arise as a result of this rule."
"Does this mean that we are absolutely satisfied?"
"To be honest, it does not."
"I would refer by way of example to the British Presidency's bonuses, which have somewhat altered the cohesive logic of the regulation."
"I would also refer to the fact that we did not manage to get our views across on the so-called performance reserve, with the recycling of appropriations decommitted on the basis of the Ν+2 or Ν+3 rule."
"However, further delay would also mean a delay in starting programmes, which would be a bad thing for the regions and the poorer Member States."
"This too is therefore a compelling reason for us to say yes today to this regulation."
"Today we are moving from theory to practice."
"Even the best regulation, let us be frank, may have problems if it is not applied correctly."
"Consequently, the major challenge which we all face, especially the Commission, the Member States and the regions, is to ensure the regulation is now applied correctly."
"There are challenges both for the old Member States, which must not repeat past mistakes, and for the new Member States, which must not repeat the mistakes of certain old Member States in connection with the take-up and use of funds."
"Parliament will be present throughout this procedure in order to monitor and to call for structural movements for the benefit always of the poorer Member States and regions of the European Union."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after more than a year, we are coming to the end of an intense piece of work carried out in close cooperation with many of my fellow Members and with representatives from the Council and the Commission, whom I should to thank."
"I should also like to thank the Austrian Presidency and I extend my special, heartfelt thanks to Commissioner Hübner, who has always shown herself to be sensitive to Parliament’s requests and willing to debate and to enter into constructive dialogue, which is the real driving force behind exchanges of opinions between the two institutions."
"The European Parliament spoke with one voice at the negotiating table with the Council and the Commission, going beyond political affiliations and countries of origin, and thus succeeded in having a greater impact on the results of the negotiation, helping to significantly improve the initial structure of the provisions."
"Although the Council rejected some important suggestions put forward by Parliament, I personally believe that the texts adequately meet the needs of an enlarged Union."
"Thanks to the combined efforts of the three institutions, this morning’s vote will mean that Europe has access to new legal instruments that are vital for strengthening solidarity and economic and social cohesion."
"With regard to the regulation establishing a Cohesion Fund, for which I am the lead rapporteur, I should like to highlight the importance of the increase in the budget, for which Parliament fought, from EUR 18 billion for the 2000-2006 period to slightly more than EUR 61.5 billion for the next programming period."
"This is in response to the recipient Member States’ great financial needs in the environmental and transport sectors, with special attention paid to sustainable development, through a form of balanced yet flexible distribution, that is to say, one that is capable of adapting the way in which the Fund is used to meet the needs of each Member State."
"Aside from the trans-European networks, it will be possible to use the Cohesion Fund for projects in the transport field, including urban, rail, inland waterway and maritime transport, multimodal programmes and measures that promote sustainable development and that enhance the environmental dimension, with a special focus on the key sectors of energy efficiency and renewable sources."
"Parliament’s incisive work has produced positive results on several points."
"I should like to mention just a few of them that concern both the regulation establishing a Cohesion Fund and the general regulation, for which Mr Hatzidakis is the rapporteur and I am the shadow rapporteur on behalf of my group."
"Article 14 of the general regulation includes a specific reference to access for the disabled, which from now on must characterise all of the work financed with Community funds."
"We have succeeded in gaining more recognition for environmental protection and sustainable development, as Mr Hatzidakis just highlighted."
"I am satisfied regarding these two points, although I would have liked a precise reference to have been made in the main body of the regulation on the Cohesion Fund too."
"In any case, the reference has been included in the general regulation, and that is already a significant and important result."
"Next, with regard to the so-called partnership, there will be greater involvement of bodies representing civil society, non-governmental organisations and associations that campaign for equal rights between women and men, including in terms of cohesion policy."
"Finally, as regards the regulation on the European Regional Development Fund, for which Mr Fava is the rapporteur and I am a shadow rapporteur, I look very positively on the inclusion of the reference to the issue of public security in the context of the convergence objective, as a guarantee against Structural Fund-related expenditure processes being infiltrated by organised crime."
"Furthermore, Parliament’s intervention has meant greater attention being paid to the urban dimension – a topic that Mr Beaupuy, myself and so many others among us hold dear – and has emphasised the way in which a sound programme of investment and management of the funds intended for cities can drive the economic and socio-cultural revival of the suburbs and surrounding rural areas, which are the real agents of sustainable and lasting development in the regions."
"To conclude, I should like to add to what Mr Hatzidakis has said and call on Parliament to support the entire package of regulations under discussion today by voting in favour of it."
". – Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the process leading to the adoption of the new regulation on the European Social Fund is worthy of Parliament’s support."
"At first reading, we tabled 84 amendments to the Commission’s original proposal."
"Of these amendments I should like to highlight one point: the Commission’s original version established a range of measures that were the target of funding but whose actions varied as to whether the region benefiting from the funding was a convergence objective region or one that came under the competitiveness and employment objective."
"I oppose this regional difference in principle, on the grounds that, when it is put into practice, it will lead to the creation of a two-speed European Social Fund, and will enshrine a form of indirect discrimination of workers benefiting from the Fund depending on the region in which they work."
"Both the Commission and the Council have accepted my argument."
"Other significant amendments on which the Council and the Commission ultimately accepted our proposals concerned the use of money from the European Social Fund to fund the activities of the social partners."
"I have always opposed the Commission’s original proposal and suggested a more flexible yet tighter alternative solution that would earmark a suitable amount of resources from the European Social Fund for measures to strengthen the capacities of the social partners, albeit specifying that these activities must relate to training, network integration measures and stepping up social dialogue."
"On this point too, both the Commission and the Council have accepted our point of view."
"Following the normal procedure for a second reading of this new regulation, we ran the serious risk of the essential legal bases that would enable the Member States to use the European Social Fund appropriation from 1 January 2007 not being in place in time."
"Realising the importance of this, the Austrian Presidency contacted me to start talks aimed at reducing the time normally taken by the legislative process."
"With the invaluable help of the shadow rapporteurs, I was able to analyse the amendments that had not been addressed by the Council, and to table five points that the Council had not accepted at first reading but that we feel are of major importance."
"These points were as follows: strengthening the role of social integration, commitment on the part of the Member States to support priority actions, commitment on the part of the Member States to promote measures in the area of innovation, commitment on the part of the Member States to support transnational and inter-regional actions, and making an appropriate amount of money available for the training and networking of the social partners."
"I was very gratified to see that the Council agreed with our proposals."
"Accordingly, Mr President, and given that the commitment to the Austrian Presidency has been honoured, I wish to recommend the adoption of the common position without any amendment."
"Mr President, globalisation and technological and demographic evolution have led to far reaching changes to a number of areas of life in our societies."
"The most important political issue going forward is how to decide the direction of these changes and, in this regard, I admit that much of what is contained in this report is the result not only of hard work but also of detailed reflection on values that largely sum up my view of politics as a public service."
"When it comes to values, I am among those who believe that the free functioning of the market alone will never be able to promote the essence of the European project, of which I am a staunch advocate, which is based on the values of peace, social justice, freedom, democracy and respect for human rights."
"I should therefore like you to know that this was a further source of inspiration for the new European Social Fund regulation."
"Lastly, I should like to express my gratitude for the excellent spirit of cooperation shown throughout the process and to Mr Špidla, who is in the Chamber today."
"I must also express my thanks to the Commission’s services for their willingness to find solutions that were included in the final version but were not laid down originally."
"Finally, I wish to thank the shadow rapporteurs, Mrs Jöns, Mrs Schroedter and Mrs Figueiredo, and to express publicly my appreciation for the help of the Vice-President, Mr Cocilovo, on this matter."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the end of a journey that began in July 2004 with the presentation of the Commission proposals on the new Structural Funds, which, I should like to point out, Parliament has always supported, has sought to improve and has, at any rate, defended by emphasising certain aspects that we regard as important, relating to quality, spending, sustainable development, environmental protection, equal opportunities, access for the disabled, public security and cross-border cooperation."
"We have worked alongside the Commission and the Council to ensure that this journey is swiftly concluded, but also, I repeat, to improve some sensitive points that we regard as important in the way in which our regions and our local authorities will use the Structural Funds."
"I should like to quickly point out our contribution on some specific points."
"Firstly, the consultation procedure: we fought to have the procedure extended and supported and to have it include, alongside institutional and administrative topics, new topics that are of importance on the ground: I am referring to non-governmental organisations and to civil society."
"We believe that the consultation procedure is a great school for democracy and, above all, a great resource in terms of responsibility: extending the scope of responsibility in the management of the Structural Funds is one of the major political challenges facing the European Union."
"We have focused on equity, that is to say, on the need to prevent a two-speed Europe, which would pave the way for geographically discriminatory measures."
"We know that the European cohesion challenge is a difficult one."
"Enlargement has widened the gap that exists between various geographical areas of Europe, and we felt it important to bridge that gap and to strike an economic and social balance among all of the countries of the European Union, preventing the risk of a two-speed Europe."
"We have concentrated on a number of priorities, adopting the Commission’s proposal to avoid turning the Structural Funds and the Regional Development Fund, for which I am responsible, into a kind of 'shopping list' that anyone can access on the basis of the most varied of needs. Instead, we have concentrated on the quality of a few objectives and made sure that quality comes before quantity, and we have done so, too, on the basis of the experience that each of us has committed to memory."
"We have held on to the principle of additionality: the Structural Funds are a form of added value, they must not substitute for the current, normal expenditure of the Member States, of the State."
"In that sense, we must focus more on quality issues regarding this expenditure, as a form of added value."
"Finally, Lisbon: Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Lisbon does not only represent a competitive Europe, which is capable of getting its own economy off the ground and of pursuing the objective of full and good-quality employment, but it also represents a Europe that is capable at last of investing in knowledge, in intangible infrastructure, in know-how, in processes and technological innovation, and in everything that is today at the heart of the Structural Funds."
"The European Parliament’s contribution has been a practical one, including on a number of specific points, insofar as it has paid particular attention to environmental issues, to sustainable development, to urban policy, to small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the backbone of the European economy, and to security, too."
"We are pleased that a statement has been proposed that includes our request for special attention to be paid to security, aimed at making our European expenditure impenetrable to organised crime."
"We are only partly satisfied, Mr President, because, as you and all of my fellow Members will know, we do not believe that the budgetary resources are sufficient for the challenge we are facing, in spite of the enlargement and in spite of the proposal by the previous Commission, a proposal that is perhaps more generous and more in keeping with the needs of this enlarged Europe of 25."
"I feel it is worth stressing the European Parliament's sense of responsibility yet again, as other Members have done."
"It has always tried to cooperate fully and effectively with the other European institutions, has avoided the conciliation procedure and has avoided jeopardising the next programming period."
"I should like to thank the European Commission, Commissioner Hübner and the Austrian Presidency."
"They have acted in the same spirit of cooperation as we have."
"It is now down to our countries to act; we have the appropriate instruments, we ought to be able to make good use of them."
"."
"Mr President, the legislative work on the package of regulations on cohesion policy for the years 2007-2013 comes to an end today."
"We all remember the heated debate on the role and significance of cohesion policy in the European Union for achieving the aims of the Lisbon Strategy, as well as the attempts to limit cohesion policy gradually, and even to renationalise it."
"Today we are discussing these matters as if they were in the past, but it is useful for us at the European Parliament to remember that implementing the principle of solidarity through cohesion policy, amongst others, is an integral part of the functioning of the European Union."
"Its form may change, it may be adapted to new objectives, but to undermine it is to negate the basis on which the Community operates."
"Implementing cohesion policy, therefore, does not simply imply defining the structure of certain funds and the ways in which they are to be used."
"Most of all, it requires a definition of its current goals."
"This then needs to be followed by steps to adapt the policy methodology and implementation strategies, as well as by practical measures."
"In line with the terms of the Treaties, social and economic cohesion policy can be implemented with the aid of common financial resources."
"However, it can also be implemented without them, by means of joint activities in various Member States aimed at achieving similar goals."
"During the current programming period, joint cross-border activities form part of the Community initiative Interreg."
"This initiative encourages border-region, transnational and interregional cooperation."
"Experience of Interreg activities shows that cross-border initiatives undertaken jointly by local and regional authorities in several Member States are of great importance to them, as they create cooperation networks and build mutual trust."
"We can conclude that these activities, which use up few financial resources, deliver considerable added value."
"The new programming period should take advantage of this positive experience."
"Initiatives typically associated with Interreg have therefore been included in the main stream of cohesion policy, within the framework of Objective III."
"There is also a need to create new legal and organisational opportunities for cooperation partners."
"That is also the source of the innovative idea of creating a new legal instrument that would support all border-region, transnational and interregional activities."
"The core of this initiative lies in giving cooperation partners, who do not always use EU funds, an instrument which will make it easier for them to organise different activities, including cross-border public services."
"In line with the proposed regulation, and once the objectives and principles of cooperation have been established, public authorities and the public bodies created with their assistance within the European Union, in other words regional, local and national authorities, will be able to sign a suitable agreement which is referred to in the regulation as a convention."
"They will then be able to register the new institution as European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation."
"It will have a legal personality which will be recognised throughout the whole European Union, once all the Member States have been informed."
"The new regulation will introduce a new legal precedent."
"It deals with system-related issues and has therefore been met with many expressions of alarm, reservations and even protests."
"Work on the regulation has been an example of consistent progress towards compromise solutions requiring many concessions and difficult decisions."
"It is worth emphasising that the proposed solution guarantees Member States full control over the creation and operation of the EGTC."
"The compromise that has been achieved has not changed the essence of the new solution nor its innovative form."
"Today’s vote concludes the legislative work and creates new opportunities."
"Most of all, it is a way of expressing our appreciation to all those who have, for many years, been building a truly European, decentralised form of international cooperation."
"As a rapporteur from a Member State that joined the European Union during the recent enlargement, I had the opportunity to get to grips with the complexity of the legislative process."
"That is why I would particularly like to thank, for their extremely constructive and positive cooperation, Commissioner Danuta Hübner, the representatives of DG REGIO, the representatives of the successive presidencies, especially the Austrian Presidency, the secretariat of the Committee on Regional Development, the political advisors and also my collaborators and experts from Poland."
"It gives me great pleasure to be able to welcome for the first time to this House the Finnish Presidency—in-Office, represented by Mr Manninen, the Finnish Government's Minister for Regional and Municipal Affairs."
"."
"Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, it is a great honour to be able to speak here in your Parliament as a representative of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union."
"The importance of the occasion is highlighted by the opportunity to participate in the final draft of the package of regulations, which is crucial to the Union’s coherence and regional development."
"The objectives of the Finnish Presidency will be set out by Prime Minster Vanhanen tomorrow."
"First, I wish to thank the European Parliament for the very high levels of cooperation it has shown with the Council."
"Talks on the cohesion policy regulations have taken two years of hard work on the part of the various institutions."
"If Parliament’s plenary today votes on the package of regulations in accordance with the recommendations of the committees, the reform of the cohesion policy and the implementation of the new programming period can go ahead as planned at the start of 2007."
"The European Parliament has had a key part to play in deciding the content of the Union’s new cohesion policy."
"In the various ways in which it has approached the issue, Parliament has particularly stressed the importance of matters which are crucial for the public and civil society, such as partnership, paying attention to environmental values and the participation of disabled people in the implementation of programmes."
"It was a precondition for Parliament that the Member States should adhere to consistent practices with regard to the criteria for calculating cofinancing in the Community and management of VAT."
"Parliament was also active in establishing the regulations pertaining to European grouping of territorial cooperation."
"I have mentioned here only a few examples of matters that Parliament has worked to promote."
"Most of the amendments that Parliament has proposed have been taken into consideration in today’s debate on the regulation proposals."
"Besides the adoption of the regulations, we also need Community strategic guidelines on cohesion policy before the legal basis for implementing the programmes is finalised."
"The Member States will establish their national strategic frame of reference on the basis of such guidelines, and this will guide the drafting of regional development programmes."
"We have proposed an ambitious timetable for the adoption of the guidelines on cohesion policy."
"I trust in the willingness of the various parties to cooperate, and I hope that the fruitful patterns of cooperation with the European Parliament will continue."
"Parliament’s Committee on Regional Development completed its report on the strategic guidelines back in May."
"Our objective is to establish the Council’s position some time in July, so that the European Parliament is able to discuss the document right at the start of the autumn parliamentary session."
"If all parties commit to a speedy schedule, there is every possibility that the strategic guidelines for cohesion policy will be ready by October."
"In such a case, the Commission can adopt the Single Programming Documents so that they can start to be implemented in early 2007."
"Having the Community strategic guidelines on the regulations and cohesion come into force will be the most important regional development goal during the Finnish presidency."
"The European Parliament has worked with great determination and flexibility in the reform of cohesion policy."
"At the same time it has been possible to hold negotiations on the interinstitutional agreement, the regulations and the strategic guidelines."
"I would like to thank you for your constructive cooperation."
"I wish to say a special thank you to the Committee on Regional Development for its expert approach."
"I also wish to thank the preceding presidencies and the Commission and Commissioners for their valuable work in carrying out the cohesion policy reforms."
"The Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee are also to be praised in the way they have advanced the cause by raising issues that were close to the regions and the people."
"I am certain that the proposed legal basis will provide an excellent starting point for implementing a European cohesion policy which is effective and takes account of the special features of the regions."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking you for your continuous support and encouragement and for the role the European Parliament has played in preparing a reform of cohesion policy."
"First of all, let me say how much we appreciate your role in securing a significant financial envelope."
"Secondly, we appreciate your contribution to setting up a new architecture and also new instruments for this policy."
"You have insisted on establishing a more ambitious territorial cooperation objective."
"That objective has a considerable and clear European added value, in particular in the context of the enlargement of the European Union."
"I am sure that the increase of 4% in the financial resources available for this objective of reinforcing transnational and interregional cooperation, which had suffered the most substantial reductions in the European Council decision of December 2005, will help us to be more efficient and more effective in bringing European regions across the continent together."
"In addition, I would like to thank you for your support for developing a unique instrument designed to overcome the problems encountered by Member States, regions and local authorities in undertaking cross-border, transnational or interregional cooperation actions, whether funded by structural funds or not."
"For the first time ever, the EU will provide an adequate legal framework for enhanced cross-border, interregional and transnational cooperation."
"Thirdly, I appreciate your role in ensuring that cohesion policy will apply to all regions and Member States and that it will contribute to more and better jobs and faster economic growth."
"In this context, I am also very happy that you welcomed our efforts to create new supporting instruments such as ‘Jeremy’ and ‘Jessica’, which will bring in new partners and expertise from European financial institutions."
"That will address genuine market values and make the structural Funds work much harder."
"Let me use this opportunity to express my personal thanks to the rapporteurs, Mr Hatzidakis, Mr Andria, Mr Silva Peneda, Mr Fava and Mr Olbrycht, and to say how much we appreciated the role Mrs Krehl played as rapporteur for the Financial Perspective and her work on the Community Strategic Guidelines."
"Let me also thank Mr Beaupuy, without whose commitment the urban dimension would probably not be so prominent in our new policy."
"It was a pleasure to work with Mr Galeote, Chairman of the Committee on Regional Development, whom I thank very much for his commitment."
"He always maintained a very constructive and cooperative spirit and we shared the same principles and priorities throughout the negotiations."
"Jointly we have managed to avoid a policy based on a system of double standards in the application of the rules on the eligibility of non-recoverable VAT and in the application of the principle of total eligible cost as the basis of co-financing."
"We will not have two distinct cohesion policies for Europe, one for the old and one for the new Member States."
"That would have been, I believe, at odds with our efforts to produce an efficient and coherent policy, with transparency, with sound financial management and with simplified regulations."
"You have shared our insistence on the need to strengthen the partnership principle."
"We have jointly reinforced the role of NGOs, local and civil society and the environmental partners in our policy."
"With your support we have also strengthened the provisions on non-discrimination and sustainable development."
"However, there are a number of items where we failed fully to convince our Member States of their added value."
"I am thinking here of the concept of a Community reserve, of our intention to render the urban dimension of our policy mandatory and of Parliament’s idea of recycling the potentially unspent resources allocated to cohesion policy."
"As requested by Parliament, the Commission has prepared a joint declaration in which the Commission commits itself to presenting an assessment of the budgetary execution of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the 2007-2013 programming period, including the consequences of the implementation of the decommitment rule."
"Our major concern in the months to come is to ensure that the new, good-quality cohesion programmes will start on time."
"Much remains to be done."
"We are working with the Finnish Presidency to ensure that the Community strategy guidelines on cohesion can be adopted by the Council after the European Parliament has delivered its opinion."
"I understand that we can achieve that at the end of September or early October."
"The Member States will then formally present their national strategies concerning how they propose to use cohesion policy, after which we will discuss in detail the operational programmes, with final adoption by the Commission."
"In order to save time the Commission has already entered into informal discussions."
"We have already received the draft national programmes from 21 Member States."
"We are gradually completing the preparation of the new 2007-2013 generation, but we have to think long-term to ensure that cohesion policy will continue to support convergence and the economic and social modernisation of Europe."
"The Fourth Cohesion Report – due for publication in spring next year – and the Cohesion Forum to be held at that time will be important steps and will flesh out the ideas for the future."
"I look forward to your debate, convinced that your decision today will allow us successfully to finalise preparations for the new generation of our common cohesion policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, just like my fellow Commission Member Mrs Hübner, I should like to thank you for your support in recent years."
"Today, almost two years after the Commission’s proposal, you are set to vote on the package of regulations on cohesion."
"Thanks to your efforts and support, this is a well-balanced package that represents genuine reform."
"The European Social Fund (ESF), which celebrates its 50th anniversary in 2007, will retain its role."
"It will continue to be an instrument providing direct support to individual citizens and as such a key element in bringing the Union closer to the citizens."
"The funds, and in particular the ESF, must also, however, promote the Community's priorities much more clearly than before."
"The Commission’s efforts will be channelled into ensuring that the priorities of financing from the funds and of relaunching the Lisbon Strategy run in tandem."
"At a time when there is fresh work to be done in relation to enlargement, demographic change and globalisation, this is of key importance."
"In this regard, I should like to highlight the three main elements of the new ESF regulation."
"Firstly, we naturally need a strategic approach."
"During the programming process, the Commission will come to an agreement with the Member States and the regions on the main priorities and goals, which will be fully compliant with the relaunched Lisbon Strategy."
"The second is that the new version clearly calls for resources to be focused on the Community's goals under the European employment strategy, including important goals relating to employment in the areas of social inclusion, education and vocational training."
"The concentration of resources is an essential prerequisite for success."
"Thirdly, support for human capital will enable the ESF to contribute significantly towards creating a knowledge-based society."
"Support for an educated, qualified and adaptable work force, and for innovation, is key if we are to increase employment, productivity at work, growth, social cohesion and social security."
"Furthermore, also thanks to Parliament's staunch support, this regulation prioritises improving institutional capacity in the convergence regions and countries eligible for cohesion fund support."
"I strongly believe that this priority will play a central role in improving the effective functioning of public administration, thereby raising competitiveness and in turn strengthening the development of sustainable jobs and support for social inclusion."
"I should also like to point out that the ESF is also tasked with reducing disparities in terms of employment at national, regional and local levels."
"The creation of appropriate qualifications at all of these levels is an integral part of, and contribution towards, the growth and development strategy."
"These elements are, of course, mere parts of the whole."
"Thanks to Parliament, the wording has been tightened in a number of areas."
"The fund will from now on play a key role in equality between men and women and equal opportunities, by means of special projects and the implementation of these principles in all areas of life."
"The fund will also support projects aimed specifically at combating discrimination in the work place, which can be linked to the priority of enhancing the social inclusion of disadvantaged citizens, in particular with a view to providing them with sustainable employment."
"These practical steps help people to develop socially beneficial measures and show how the Fund leads to the sharing of the values on which the European social model was founded."
"The ESF will also provide special support for the social partners in the convergence regions."
"Thanks to Parliament, the current wording is totally unambiguous, which is something I welcome."
"The active involvement of the social partners is therefore a vital prerequisite for well-balanced, harmonious socio-economic development."
"Furthermore, I should like to thank Parliament for its active support in ensuring that special provisions on partnership are contained in the new general regulation."
"This is a key principle that applies to all the funds that we are talking about."
"This principle enables civil society actors to be involved at every stage, namely social partners, civil society, non-governmental organisations and equal opportunities organisations."
"One can therefore conclude that extraordinary results have been achieved."
"Accordingly, I should like to take this opportunity to thank the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs under the chair of Jan Andersson, which has provided the Commission with a great deal of support."
"At first reading, it drew up almost 100 amendments to the regulation, most of which were accepted by the Commission."
"In this regard, I should like to congratulate the main rapporteur, Mr Silva Peneda."
"We worked together on achieving a particular outcome, and now I should like to focus on the future."
"In the coming months, the Member States will submit their national strategic reference frameworks and operational programmes to the Commission."
"The Member States will thus take important strategic decisions on future investments from public resources."
"Most Member States have already made good progress in drawing up these documents."
"However, there is a certain aspect that emerges from contact with the Member States that in my view may be cause for concern."
"It appears that in a considerable number of Member States, ESF investment in our biggest asset, namely our citizens and their qualifications, could be somewhat lower than it should be."
"This is highly important, because the right balance needs to be struck between investment in physical capital and investment in people."
"The way in which we now invest in our workers in the form of vocational training so that they can adapt to new challenges, in education for young and old, and in support for the unemployed with the aim of helping them to help themselves, will help shape our future."
"This will ultimately have the biggest influence on the wealth and prosperity of our citizens."
"The Commission will do all that is necessary to ensure that discussions with the Member States achieve a balanced result in line with the priorities of the Community policies and with the shared interests of Europe's citizens."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should once again like to express my gratitude and appreciation for your support and your successful contribution."
"I firmly believe that today we are taking a fresh step forward that will lead to an effective EU cohesion policy."
"."
"Mr President, when we prepared the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund, we tabled 32 recommendations."
"In our opinion, we focused mainly on how to take the needs of disabled people into account in terms of implementing projects funded in part by money from the structural funds."
"We also called for the broadening of qualification criteria for funding within the framework of ‘regional competitiveness and employment’ in terms of the level of education available in a given Member State."
"We also called for administrative procedures concerning the use of structural funds to be simplified."
"Larger amounts should be paid in advance to the beneficiaries at the start of the implementation process for operational programmes."
"The so-called multifunding process should be maintained, which provides opportunities to obtain funding for programmes from more than one fund."
"We also proposed small changes to the reporting procedures, as we are convinced that excessive red tape will not aid the efficient use of European funds which are, after all, the basis for development in many regions."
"Not all our recommendations have been accepted, of course, but that is the way of parliamentary business and compromise, which are the basis for decisions in a Community as diverse as the European Union."
"However, we regard the result of our joint work as positive."
"We especially welcome the solutions concerning disabled people, social organisations and NGOs, as well as the extremely sensible proposals on the issue of VAT eligibility for certain activities."
"Taking this into account, I support Mr Hatzidakis’ motion to vote in favour of the proposed regulation."
"."
"Mr President, I would like in particular to congratulate the four rapporteurs for the regional Funds, and not merely out of courtesy, but because they have done an excellent job, with tenacity and skill, the result of which has been the incorporation of many amendments into the final text, of which the Council has already expressed its approval."
"It has been an honour for me to lead these debates and hence to be a direct witness to that success."
"It is a pity that the governments of certain Member States have been intransigent and that the Council has not been able to accept the institutional declaration, which is exclusively intended to open up a debate on the excesses of the cohesion policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the discussions in the Council last December on the financial perspective and now on the Regulations on the funds, we have begun to fear that certain governments wish to call into question the most visible and successful of the European policies: the cohesion policy."
"I am convinced that the huge majority of Europeans are in favour of solidarity and that our Parliament, always hand in hand with the European Commission – and I would like in particular to acknowledge the work of Commissioner Hübner – will be the guarantor of this essential pillar of European integration and structuring."
"Mr President, Mrs Hübner, Mr Špidla, Mr Manninen, ladies and gentlemen, today, after months of negotiations and talks, the European Parliament will be adopting the regulations on cohesion policy."
"I believe cohesion policy to be one of the most important, one of the most positive and, above all, one of the most visible of the European Union’s policies."
"That means it presents us with an enormous challenge."
"The disparities in individual countries have grown larger, and we European politicians have a great responsibility to the people as a result."
"People are afraid of losing jobs, and they are afraid of globalisation."
"If we are to make the most of the opportunities that globalisation offers Europe, however, we must help the weakest in the new and the old Member States."
"At this point, I would also like to underline the social aspects of cohesion policy clearly once again."
"We are not making cohesion policy for human capital, as the European jargon has it, but we are making policy for people."
"That means we must put people at the centre and hence in fact greatly strengthen the social aspect."
"We need well-qualified people."
"People must have access to the ‘Lifelong Learning’ Programme."
"They must be integrated, they must feel that we are there for them."
"I think the European Parliament has been very successful in the negotiations."
"As a result, there will be more participation in future."
"As a result, Member States will not be treated differently."
"Sustainability will be written large for us and not seen as a necessary evil."
"The urban dimension has been strengthened, just as Parliament has significantly strengthened territorial cohesion, equality of opportunity and non-discrimination."
"That means we can say with a clear conscience that the Lisbon Strategy is at the heart of our cohesion policy and the people of our Union really do have opportunities for the future."
"In one thing, sadly, we have not succeeded: we failed to get the necessary resources we proposed; and we have not managed to get recycling, the reuse of unspent resources within cohesion policy."
"We do still want to have something to do in the years ahead, however, and that is why we will continue to fight to get it."
"Mr Manninen, as rapporteur for the strategic guidelines, I and my colleagues will do all that we can to see that we are able to keep to this ambitious timetable and adopt these policies in October."
"Mr President, Mrs Hübner, Mr Špidla, Mr Manninen, ladies and gentlemen, I can testify to the vigour and richness of the exchanges of the last few months and the last two years, which have resulted today in texts that my colleagues and I think and hope will in a moment be adopted by the European Parliament by a very large majority."
"I would like to stress that, throughout this debate, my group has given the greatest possible attention to the need for these texts to be effective."
"The different speeches that have just been made have made clear the various areas where they need to be just that."
"As Mrs Krehl has just indicated, the Structural Funds are a testimony of solidarity with the most disadvantaged regions, so that they can attain an average level of prosperity."
"As the examples of Ireland, Spain, Portugal and other countries have shown, the development of regions benefiting from the Structural Funds contributes to the development of the European Union as a whole, because of the investments that those regions are able to make."
"Today, Mrs Hübner, Mr Manninen, we are going to move on to the second phase."
"After the theoretical phase of drawing up the Structural Funds, we are entering the preparation phase."
"Allow me to list three conditions – at an educational level and in terms of providing spurs to action and, if I may say so, tempting incentives - that are necessary if this preparation phase is to succeed."
"At an educational level, Mrs Hübner, I know that, with your co-workers, you have already organised a number of conferences to raise awareness."
"We really must develop this communication strategy, and the document that you have just published takes this approach."
"We also have to make good practices very widely known."
"The Member States, the regions and the different actors which are in the process of preparing projects must really have a good knowledge of different practices in order to be able to prepare their projects properly."
"Secondly, let us learn how to handle the various incentives available to us."
"You know - and with good reason - that within the Structural Funds it is possible to have recourse to technical assistance funds."
"We have noted in the past that a portion of these funds was not used, or was used badly."
"From now until the end of 2006, and throughout 2007, the technical assistance funds must be used in order to prepare worthy projects."
"Thirdly, as we say in France, ‘fear of the policeman is the beginning of wisdom’."
"The various Member States, project organisers and regions, etc. need to be reminded that if they do not comply with the rules laid down in the regulations, then they will not be able to benefit from the Structural Funds."
"I regret of course that, as my fellow Members have pointed out, certain Member States have recently refused to recycle funds that cannot be used within the specified periods."
"Finally, and to conclude, I cannot but point out, as president of the intergroup, that the European Union has finally recognised the need to bring the Structural Funds into play at the level of towns and regions."
"Therein, and within the framework of the Lisbon agreement, lies the assurance of improved success in the years to come."
"Mrs Hübner, Mr Špidla, Mr Manninen, please be assured that, together with our fellow Members of the European Parliament, we shall help to make a success of the Structural Funds, without however relaxing our vigilance."
". – Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, I, too, would like to begin by thanking, on behalf of my group, our fellow Members and in particular the rapporteurs for their close cooperation."
"I believe it was crucial that in the negotiations Parliament was united in defending the interests of the regions and the people who live there."
"It was above all Parliament that ensured that cohesion is and remains the real objective of the Structural Funds, because anyone who puts economic and social cohesion at risk strikes at the very heart of the European Union’s ability to integrate."
"Enough people have tried."
"The Group of Six from the Member States should be mentioned first in this connection."
"They ensured that there was a massive cut in the Structural Funds and were therefore the first to call economic and social cohesion into question."
"Then the Commission also joined in in a big way."
"Commission President Barroso was looking for money to pay for the Lisbon Strategy, so he helped himself from the Structural Funds."
"Suddenly, at the end of the negotiations, a list appeared in the documents which tied the Member States down to using the Structural Funds to implement the Lisbon Strategy."
"The actual purpose of the Structural Funds, to bring about cohesion between the regions and pursue their sustainable development, suddenly became merely incidental."
"I think it is scandalous not only that Parliament was bypassed when the earmarking list was put in the documents without consultation, but also that the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, should itself sacrifice economic and social cohesion in violation of those Treaties."
"It is therefore a quite particular success on Parliament’s part that at least the horizontal objective of sustainable development is enshrined in the regulation."
"I would also like to draw attention once again to the partnership principle, because it is extremely important that civil society is involved alongside the social partners and that the Member States are required to consult environmental organisations and equal opportunities representatives."
"I expect the Commission to monitor that."
"Finally, I would like to welcome Commissioner Kallas’ transparency initiative."
"He can count on our support."
"In future, every Member State will have to disclose who is receiving structural funds and how those decisions are taken."
". – Since the outset of negotiations on the Structural Funds for 2007-2013, we have stressed that a properly funded, proactive EU regional policy is a prerequisite for effectively reducing regional imbalances at EU level and for genuine convergence between the Member States."
"As regards the Community budget, regional policy should be an instrument of much-needed, fair redistribution, which will at the very least reduce the detrimental impact of the internal market on the economically least-developed countries and regions."
"Consequently, we must adopt a critical stance as regards this General Regulation on the Structural Funds, which translates into legislative terms the Interinstitutional Agreement on the amounts, the objectives and the implementation rules of the Structural Funds for 2007-2013."
"This Agreement represents a reduction in the Structural Funds from 0.41% of Community GNI in 2000-2006 to 0.37% for 2007-2013, despite the fact that the need for cohesion is all the greater following the enlargement and that, in view of the economic and social disparities, the trend ought to be upward rather than downward."
"Therein also lies the reason why, for example, the so-called statistical effect regions, such as the Algarve region of Portugal have not been completely compensated, something that we consider unacceptable."
"We also object to aspects such as the subordination of Cohesion Policy to the objectives of the so-called Lisbon Strategy, with the inclusion of the objective of allocating at least 60% of funds in the convergence regions and 75% in the other regions towards funding projects laid down in the Lisbon Strategy."
"In other words, cohesion is playing second fiddle to competition."
"I should lastly like to lend my backing to Mr Henin's remarks about certain cross-border regions, such as Hainaut in France and Belgium, which has differentiated access to the Structural Funds."
"This situation must be rectified so that the region can grow harmoniously."
"."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I would like to express my admiration for all the rapporteurs."
"This marathon, Mr Hatzidakis, has required a lot of effort but has resulted in a reasonable compromise."
"The fact that we have managed to achieve a political agreement, which takes into account the majority of reservations expressed by the European Parliament, is a success in itself."
"We have to be aware that time passes rapidly and that individual Member States need time to prepare their legislative systems in order to be able to make use of these funds before the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective comes into force."
"Member States need to coordinate these activities with their national strategic reference frameworks."
"Union resources are used in conjunction with the financial resources of individual Member States themselves, as well as the financial resources of regional and local authorities."
"If we take this approach to these funds, we will see that there are many fresh opportunities open to us."
"Some compare these opportunities for positive action to the benefits once brought by the Marshall Plan."
"This is no exaggeration."
"All the Member States are counting on these new opportunities, including those countries which, through no fault of their own, spent many years stagnating behind the Iron Curtain."
"These countries include Poland, and its eastern voivodships in particular."
"The European Union now needs real internal solidarity."
"It needs political, economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"We are living in regions that have significantly different levels of development and wealth."
"It is worth remembering that around 27% of the population of the European Union, namely 123 million people, live in areas where the GDP per capita is less than three quarters of the European Union average."
"Of course we also need to face the challenges of globalisation, competition, science and technology as well as dealing with the demographic crisis, an ageing population, a growing number of disabled people and immigration."
"We have to be sure that appropriate use of these funds will contribute to solving some of these problems."
"Finally, I would like to draw your attention to the need to monitor the legislation adopted and, if necessary, to respond rapidly."
"Not one euro should be wasted."
"Not a single opportunity should be missed."
"This is the best way of bringing Europe closer to its citizens."
". – Mr President, today’s debate sees the end of a 14—month-plus process of negotiation on general rules on drawing resources from the funds."
"What we have before us is a sensible compromise."
"What this means for the new Member States is a reduced need for cofinancing, which has rendered effective drawing of resources from the funds impossible."
"For example, this will mean a reduction of 15% for the Czech Republic."
"Private resources could become part of cofinancing."
"Non-recoverable value added tax will be an eligible cost and the absurd N+2 rule will at least for some time become N+3."
"Social housing projects that have a direct bearing on the environment will become an eligible cost for the funds."
"This sounds like the standard conditions that the original Members of the European Community made use of for decades."
"The ten new Member States, however, were denied them, perhaps in the hope that it would be possible to complicate even further the already difficult process of drawing EU resources, even though these resources formed part of the promise made in the accession conditions negotiations."
"Fortunately for the new Member States, it is not only Parliament that is unfairly divided into new and old Member States; this also applies to the Council, which has incorporated this compromise into the new rules."
"If, however, we leave the Council solely responsible for drawing up reasonable compromises, we will become a superfluous institution, which will simply take advantage of the voting rights of individual delegations to push through rules that will disintegrate the EU still further."
"The long and, here in Parliament, fruitless 14-month negotiation process has only served to demonstrate how matters in the EU would turn out if we adopted the European Constitution with a majority decision, indeed a decision that is valid here."
"The majority here in Parliament from the original Member States would impose rules on the weak, the small, the poor and the new."
"A decision-making process favouring consensus and veto, leading to reasonable compromises in the Council, would be removed from the equation."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the amendments to the structural funds that the Council adopted in the recent negotiations."
"Unlike Parliament, the Council displayed a far higher degree of realism and awareness of the genuine needs of the Member States."
"I warmly welcome the fact that the Council intends to pay non-recoverable VAT out of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)."
"Similarly, the fact that the ERDF will fund housing expenditure, albeit on a limited basis, is something that I welcome as good news for the citizens."
"Thirdly and lastly, and thanks again to the Council unfortunately, there has been a change with regard to automatic decommitment, in other words from the old familiar N+2 rule, to N+3."
"The Member States are now in a much better position to realise projects and receive money."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the only conclusion to be drawn from this is that the Council has shown far greater solidarity than Parliament as regards the negotiations on the structural funds."
"I strongly believe that we should support the Council position instead of thinking of clever ways of changing the rules and the budget during the funding process."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur I would like to look mainly at the European Regional Development Fund."
"At first reading, the European Parliament adopted a large number of amendments, appreciably changing the Commission proposal, especially in the areas of strengthening the urban dimension, greater protection for the environment and cultural heritage, non-discrimination and the treatment of persons with disabilities, most of which is also brought out in the Hatzidakis report."
"The possibility of using ERDF aid to assist with the construction of social housing was also accepted."
"The Common Position, which was unanimously adopted by the Council, is therefore a satisfactory compromise."
"The majority of the amendments adopted by the European Parliament were either taken over in full or in part, or the principle of them was accepted."
"One of the most important changes, which also reflect the outcome of the December 2005 summit on the Financial Perspective, must surely be the eligibility of non-recoverable VAT where there is private cofinancing."
"To avoid double standards – and that is one of Parliament’s successes – in the coming period this support will apply for all Member States."
"My group therefore believes that, in view of the urgency, not only the ERDF Regulation but the whole package of Structural Funds regulations should be adopted as punctually as possible so that there can be no further delay in preparing the operational programmes that are so important for us in the regions and the projects in the regions can begin promptly."
"In view of the fact that Parliament has emerged from the negotiations with great success, we recommend acceptance of the Common Position without further amendment."
"() Mr President, Mrs Hübner, Mr Špidla, Mr Manninen, fellow Members, let me first of all make a general remark: I would like to draw attention to the splendid spirit that presided over the work of the Committee on Regional Development as it examined the three proposals - which are today being submitted to plenary for the amendment of regulations."
"It seems to me that the less than generous nature of the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 has not prevented us from improving the legislative instruments of this reform – reform that is essential for us, as European Socialists, because it is the expression of solidarity between regions."
"Our work has made it possible to emphasise the necessity – as indicated by Mr Beaupuy a little while ago of supporting sustainable urban development in our regions."
"In this respect it is worth highlighting the increasing concentration of Europeans in cities."
"We have also been able better to take into account the particular situation of regions that have experienced the painful reality of this statistic and that will benefit from a transitional support mechanism."
"Besides the weakness of the budgetary foundation for this reform, allow me to tell you two disappointing facts."
"The first one is only half a disappointment because it concerns the partial eligibility for housing expenses - eligibility that I fought very hard to bring about."
"This is cause for celebration, but it is regrettable that eligibility only exists in countries that joined the Union after 1 May 2004."
"This national distinction is, in my view, dangerous."
"It is also unjustifiable because the housing crisis is very urgent in certain big cities in the other Member States as well."
"The second disappointment: I do not understand why there has been a reduction of the period during which a business cannot relocate its activity if it has benefited from Structural Funds."
"This period was fixed at seven years by the Commission in its initial proposal and confirmed by the vote of this House, and, in view of recent events, particularly the job losses in Europe caused by relocations, I would ask the Commission to reread the report on relocations, adopted by this House in March."
"The Regulation on the European Grouping for Territorial Cooperation has undergone many amendments in the debates on the package of cohesion legislation."
"Understandably, this is a new-generation legal instrument that can support the initiatives for regional cross–border partnerships that are restricted by the diverse nature of national legislations."
"However, the final answer to the question as to whether this is an appropriate way to stimulate geographical cohesion can only be delivered by practical experience."
"The answer will depend on the circumstances in the individual countries."
"Do they have a central or federal system of government?"
"Are they large or small?"
"Have they been involved in partnership over many years or are they only just beginning cross–border cooperation?"
"The new groupings introduced by the Regulation will in all probability be built around areas of specific common concern."
"Their advantage, in comparison with previous cross–border partnership arrangements, is that they raise the stakes where the implementation of mandatory legislation is concerned, thereby increasing the degree of responsibility of partnership bodies, and at the same time tightening up the area of financial responsibility for the management of common resources."
"We have reason to believe that supplementary budgetary resources will make an important contribution to the territorial cohesion of the European Union."
"Mr President, the Cohesion Fund is an ideal way of putting across one of the European Union’s most important basic principles, solidarity between Member States, to people where they are."
"I very much welcome the fact that this support is more geared to sustainable development and that sustainable urban transport, energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies are considered key sectors."
"The crucial thing for me, however, remains how these principles are put into practice."
"I am looking very much to the Commission there."
"Together with the regional players, we will be looking to see whether the eligible environmental and transport sectors are really balanced, whether projects contravene environmental regulations, whether the Gothenburg objectives are complied with and whether there is genuine participation and not just a formal invitation to the relevant partners when programmes and projects are drawn up."
"I welcome the Fava report and the Olbrycht report and thank all the rapporteurs."
"I particularly welcome the efforts to strengthen the social and environmental aspects of the regulations."
"In dealing with these funds, we have generally fought hard to ensure that the role of NGOs is strengthened and that greater account is taken of the environment and to stress the importance of access for those with disabilities."
"In welcoming the report by Mr Olbrycht on cross-border grouping of territorial cooperation, I want to stress that this will be of tremendous benefit to border regions and to divided countries such as my own."
"Structural funding should be Community-based and Community-driven, with all sections of the Community fully involved in the process."
"In my own constituency, we can learn a lot from how other countries empower local communities and local democratic structures."
"I look forward to monitoring the progress of the new cross-border groupings."
"In Ireland, they will be particularly important in border counties and in the north-west region, which have experienced deprivation, under-investment and unemployment."
"May I inform the House that there was not a problem with the interpreters this time."
"Mrs de Brún began by speaking Irish."
"Irish is now an official language."
"Yesterday the Praesidium decided that Irish may also be spoken in plenary if prior notice is given."
"This is definitely an instance where work by, and cooperation between, the Commission, the Presidency and Parliament can be evaluated positively."
"Today there is reason to hope that the concerns that protracted discussion of the financial plan would lead to delays in implementing the Structural Funds will prove to have been groundless."
"I would like to stress here that it is especially important to adopt the Community Strategic Guidelines on cohesion policy, and also to finish work on state aid, and state and private sector partnership legislation."
"I believe that the compromise achieved for the Cohesion Fund and the large ERDF projects during the transition stage, applying the n+3 principle, is insufficient and must be retained beyond 2010 until 2013."
"I therefore do not agree with the opinion expressed in Parliament’s report on the Cohesion Fund regulations that the n+2 principle should be applied to all funds, including the Cohesion Fund."
"It must be taken into consideration that the new Member States lack the practical experience and human resources for managing such projects, and therefore the n+2 principle will be difficult to implement."
"I support developing closer links between cohesion policy and the Lisbon Strategy."
"Both these policies are aimed at increasing economic growth and employment competitiveness."
"Mr President, the last time I saw a printed copy of the budget for the Structural and Cohesion Funds for the period 2007-2013 it stood at EUR 336 billion, with a precise allocation budgeted for each of the 25 Member States plus the next two in the queue, Bulgaria and Romania."
"Looking at it from Britain’s point of view, it did not make good reading, so I put the following question to the Committee on Regional Development."
"I have carefully studied the budget for 2007-2013, totalling EUR 336 billion, which I call Plan A, and I see that EUR 139 billion of the total is being allocated to eight of the latest new Members and another EUR 22 billion to Bulgaria and Romania, with a meagre EUR 12 billion allocated to Britain during that period."
"If Britain should decide to withdraw from the EU and thus cancel its contribution, do you have a Plan B?"
"There was of course a deathly hush, but such a situation is far from impossible."
"When the British public finally realises where all its money is going and when the Health Service in particular is so short of funding, a public call for withdrawal is quite likely."
"Mr President, the unification process within Europe is far from complete."
"Regions of the new Member States will continue to trail behind the ‘old Union’ in terms of their levels of economic and social development for many years to come."
"At the same time, as the European Union, we have to face the challenges of globalisation."
"This is why we urgently need to adapt our policy areas to a changing reality."
"I welcome the fact that the European Social Fund, as the Commissioner reminded us, places emphasis on education and on doing away with inequalities in employment."
"It has also decided to invest in human resources, providing opportunities for disabled people."
"New regulations on funds – and funds have always given citizens grounds for optimism – will show that the Union can function effectively, even without a new Constitution, within the framework of the existing Treaties."
"– Mr President, in the words of the President of this House, this debate may be prosaic, but it is important, because what we are discussing is more than 35% of the EU's budget, and I think it would have been worthwhile to devote the whole morning to such a subject."
"That would also have avoided the situation that some Members find themselves in, of having just one minute to deal with a mission impossible."
"I myself have two minutes, and I am grateful to those who allowed me this time."
"Regional policy is vital for the new Member States, as we know."
"It is also important for the others, but it is now the implementation that counts, as our general rapporteur Mr Hadzidakis, and the Commissioner, said just now."
"This implementation must, of course, take place, but it need not necessarily be uniform: the regional priorities must be as variable as the barriers to development."
"We all subscribe to the Lisbon Strategy, but the means to make it successful – which it has not yet been – can certainly not be uniform over the whole territory."
"That is true for all the Member States, not just the newest ones: accessibility for the peripheral regions and the enclaves continues to be a prerequisite for competitiveness and, therefore, for enabling us to get them to meet the EU's general objectives."
"That is why a strict application of the earmarking of appropriations, with the associated risk of exacerbating still further the disparities between and within regions, would, in my view, be a mistake."
"It is vital for regional policy to be visible to and popular with our fellow citizens, in order to avoid further disappointments when they are asked about the future of the Union: in simple terms, we need them to feel involved in the progress of regional development."
"In this regard, we still have much to do."
"Mr President, this debate today is the culmination of Parliament’s work on the extremely important issue of cohesion policy, a policy that involves more than EUR 300 000 million, clearly demonstrating that we are talking about one of the European project’s priorities."
"Removing territorial differences, supporting infrastructures and the economic and social development of our peoples and regions have been the basis of this work."
"We in Parliament incorporated significant changes into the regulations that implement this policy and that have considerably improved its content in terms of the environment, accessibility for disabled persons and the participation of civil society."
"We have recognised the differences between regions within the territory of the European Union: rural regions, urban regions, islands, outermost regions, regions with falling populations, etc."
"We should be pleased about the implementation of a technological fund within the framework of the FEDER, with a view to closing the technological gap, as well as about the ‘phasing out’ in the Cohesion Fund, in order to move towards convergence, acknowledging that, though it is clear that countries with more needs require privileged treatment, there are other regions and Member States that need to make progress in this direction."
"That is sufficient reason to support this policy fully."
"That is the only way we can make progress with the idea that more cohesion also means more Europe."
"Mr President, first I all I wish to congratulate all the rapporteurs on their dedication and commitment."
"Indeed, I agree with Mr Hatzidakis that they have all run a marathon."
"Overall, I must admit to a certain disappointment with the final budget."
"It is certainly less than the Commission and Parliament recommended."
"I believe that this will have an impact on the convergence objectives of the funds."
"As far as Parliament’s work is concerned, however, I am satisfied."
"We have succeeded in obtaining many improvements."
"In particular I want to mention partnership, which is crucial because it involves civil society, environmental partners and NGOs working in close cooperation with all the partners."
"This is a practical demonstration of how Europe can be brought closer to its citizens by involving citizens in the planning and implementation of the programmes, although I agree with Mrs Kallenbach that this must be real, rather than apparent."
"I am also particularly pleased that the funds will support accessibility for people with disabilities and will promote integration of the gender perspective."
"This is a practical example of how Article 13 can be translated into action."
"Mr President, today represents the end of a good piece of work by this Parliament, a good piece of work by the Commission and a rather less good piece of work by the Council, in particular a number of Member States within it – sadly, my own among them."
"I assure colleagues that I will not start apologising for the short-sighted mean-spiritedness of the United Kingdom Government, because I have only a minute of speaking time."
"This is not the package we wanted, but there is more in it to like than dislike."
"The strengthening of the partnership principle continues to need defence."
"Statistical effect is of crucial importance to regions across Europe."
"Accessibility for disabled people and crucially the abolition of double standards between so-called ‘old’ and ‘new’ Member States are all to be welcomed."
"Europe is not about coal and steel any more; it is not about agriculture and fisheries: it is about solidarity and cohesion, it is about where the EU adds value to regional development across the EU."
"This package takes us forward and my group will be supporting it."
"– Mr President, the structural policy of the European Union, as applied today, has limited results because, basically, it is the expression of the social policy of the economic model of free competition derived from the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies."
"Enlargement in 2004 brought with it an urgent need to change the current criteria for granting appropriations, in order to take account of the increase in social and economic divergences between the 25 Member States."
"Divergences are widening to the point at which the criteria no longer apply to regions which still have the same structural problems."
"Unfortunately, the Commission and the Council have not taken any decisive steps in this direction."
"Let us not forget that the European Commission of the Europe of the 15 looked mainly to satisfy the wishes of the old Member States when it came to how appropriations were apportioned and how the contributions of each Member State were calculated."
"However, the most important issue which the new proposals fail to address is a change in philosophy of the Structural Funds, from their current auxiliary function to a means of really promoting social and economic development, so that they can become real tools for social policy and for rectifying inequalities between countries and regions."
"Mr President, by taking the floor in the debate on the regulations on structural fund spending, I would like to draw your attention to three serious omissions relating to the matter."
"Firstly, the appropriations for commitments under section 1B, namely spending on growth and employment, are over EUR 30 billion less than was previously proposed."
"This must have resulted in significant cuts to the resources for individual countries."
"In Poland’s case, these cuts amount to over EUR 3 billion."
"Secondly, the dispute within the Council, which went on for many months, led to a serious delay in the adoption of the Financial Perspective."
"This has contributed to the fact that we are only discussing regulations on the structural funds in the second half of 2006."
"Thirdly, this delay will mean that the so-called Community strategic support framework will not be drawn up until the autumn of 2006 and the national strategic reference frameworks, prepared by individual Member States, will only be drawn up in 2007."
"This situation will mean that the procedures for programming resources from specific funds will be significantly delayed."
"Unfortunately, as a result, 2007 will to a large extent be a wasted year from the point of view of making good use of structural funds."
"– Mr President, all these packages are basically dead letters unless we relax the Maastricht indicators."
"The Maastricht indicators are so suffocating, it is as if we were giving a glass of water to a person whose neck we have put in a noose."
"My country is the only country in Europe which is under surveillance, something like a monetary fund."
"This means that we cannot cofinance the packages in order to get them."
"We failed to get one-third of the third package, with the consequence that we are selling assets, property and corporations so that we can exist as a state."
"Nor shall we be able to get money from the fourth package, because we are under this surveillance."
"Let us relax the Maastricht indicators at long last, so that we can take up the appropriations, so that we can be active as citizens and as states."
"It is a gift that is no gift."
"At the moment, the sums we failed to get from the third package are equal to half the money which my country spends on education and health."
"Improve our standard of living for pity's sake!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating and tomorrow we will be asked to approve the well-drafted reports on structural funds for the 2007–2013 period."
"In this context and as a citizen of Slovakia, a new Member State in the European Union, I realise the great importance of structural assistance given by the economically strong Member States to the new members."
"We truly appreciate this assistance to the Slovak Republic: we are grateful for it and feel beholden."
"In particular, I am pleased by the fact that the agreement between the European Parliament and Council supports the measures proposed by new Member States, also known as the N+3 rules, which address issues such as VAT and housing."
"This is a good and long overdue solution, as evidenced by the fact that all MEPs from the new Member States voted for these proposals during the first reading in this House."
"For this reason, the Greens’ report on the general provisions of the Cohesion Fund seems to be a document we would be better off without, and I do not recommend approving it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, European structural policy has a secure perspective for 2007-2013."
"At last!"
"The compromise was a long and tedious process, but the results are plain: the weakest regions will gain from European solidarity."
"In the economically stronger regions, we support regional competitiveness."
"In the border regions the EU’s emphasis is on supporting cross-border cooperation."
"In that way, Europe seeks to help the regions concerned to get to grips with structural change and overcome high unemployment."
"That is a challenge, especially when growth rates in many countries are lower than anticipated, and the resources deployed amount to only a few percentage points of the recipient countries’ gross domestic product."
"That is all the more reason why we must now press for European money also to be used in the way Europe requires, not squandered on consumption expenditure, not used to finance windfall gains when businesses move in, and not misused by state or semi-state authorities for other than structural policy purposes."
"That is why we need an implementing regulation for the Structural Funds that will create transparency."
"We must all know, and we want to know, precisely what European taxpayers’ money is being used for."
"Parliament must back the Commission in this sensible initiative, because structural and regional policy can only be successful if we use European money in a controlled and targeted way for the most pressing problems."
"Mr President, Mr Špidla, Mrs Hübner, the fact that the Commission and the Council have accepted most of Parliament’s amendments on Social Fund reform really shows how well this House has worked."
"That we have also in the end reached a good compromise on all the points in dispute also shows how well the Austrian Council Presidency conducted the negotiations."
"All 25 states can be well and truly satisfied with the results of this reform."
"Initial and further training and retraining in promising occupations will continue to be supported in the future."
"But support is also given for the first time for finding better ways of reconciling family and working life, because, as we all know, we need to do more than just provide enough crèche and after-school care places if we want to get more women into work."
"What we need are new ways of working and new forms of support that are quite specifically geared to this."
"However, there also needs to be a closer link with European employment strategy, and social exclusion must be curtailed."
"In view of the 20 million unemployed and 68 million people living in poverty in the European Union as a whole, particular attention will in future also be paid to the integration of socially disadvantaged groups."
"The same is true for people with disabilities and now, at the insistence of this House, also for asylum seekers and not only for recognised refugees."
"At this point, it should also be pointed out that it will of course in future again also be possible to have projects to combat xenophobia and racism in training establishments and at the workplace."
"However, a sound general education is a basic prerequisite for good vocational training, and for that reason money from the Social Fund may now also be used to reform education systems."
"And for the new Member States I think it is particularly important that we have included the strengthening of the social dialogue and hence of the social partners."
"In future, no one will be able to steal away secretly, experience speaks for itself."
"Acceptance has been higher where the social partners have been tangibly involved in the development of employment programmes."
"Mr President, the legislative reforms pertaining to the Structural Funds have had a satisfactory outcome."
"It was not an easy task, as the views and interests of the new and old Member States had to be reconciled."
"On the other hand, the needs of the southern and northern regions of the old Member States had to be taken into account."
"As the member representing the northernmost country in the committee, I tried to ensure in particular that the sparsely populated regions in the north of Sweden and Finland would achieve an equitable position."
"The committee reached a position which supported the idea of drawing a parallel between these northernmost regions and the peripheral regions."
"Cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament ensured that a solution on financing would be reached that would safeguard the position of the sparsely populated regions in the subsequent financing period."
"In the future we will have to ensure that this support remains as permanent as the natural conditions which are the basis for it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are voting in favour of a further redistribution of the funds, on the basis of recommendations that our rapporteurs have tried to optimise, particularly at a time of budget shortages, regarding the distribution of resources and main aims."
"Enlargement means a greater number of less developed regions to support and therefore fewer resources than before for the less developed regions in those countries that joined beforehand."
"This must not be underestimated, as often happens."
"Despite the partial acceptance of some proposals, the objective of supporting regional policies based on competitiveness, employment, environmental protection and support for the disabled seems sufficiently focused."
"The trans-European transport network also remains among the priority actions."
"In this connection, I regret to point out that, in relation to my country, it is not at all clear whether the current government will be able to make everyone play from the same score, so as not to exclude Italy from the trans-European transport network; if that were to happen, it would also marginalise Italy’s role in the Mediterranean."
"I shall vote in favour of redistributing the funds because, in spite of everything, the regional and social development funds and the cohesion fund still represent an opportunity for Southern Italy."
"– Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, following the long months of endless negotiations on the financial perspective, we now have a definitive proposal for a regulation on the structural funds."
"Even so, one must admit that these documents represent a compromise that emerged with great difficulty though the competing currents of national interests."
"I should therefore like to commend the rapporteurs, especially Mr Hatzidakis and Mr Olbrycht, who led the most difficult part of the discussion, for their efforts, for their helpfulness and for their ability to take on board the interests of all those taking part."
"I personally believe that if the people are to identify with the EU, they need to be made fully aware of the contribution in the individual Member States."
"The issue of housing is one of the most pressing issues in the pecking order of living needs."
"Unless high-quality, safe housing can be delivered, people cannot work properly."
"I am therefore pleased that in the framework of negotiations with the Council and the Commission, we were able to push through our amendments relating to the eligibility of spending in the area of social housing renovations."
"I also believe it is crucial to pave the way for higher investment in the health system."
"The obvious rule that only healthy people can be economically active applies here."
"As a former mayor, I also welcome the emphasis placed by the Commission on the urban dimension of structural policy, which is stronger in the new legislation."
"Ultimately, these are our cities, and they have a better idea of what activities and projects should be supported for the end users’ benefit."
"I am afraid, however, that the urban dimension and the partnership principle will be upheld only on paper."
"In the case of the Czech Republic, I know how unwilling the State is to invite our cities to take decisions on the form that operational programmes will take – and this applies to the regions too."
"I therefore believe it would be beneficial for the Commission to analyse the extent to which the urban dimension is achieved in the individual Member States."
"The dream of Robert Schumann and Jacques Delors is coming true."
"The European Union no longer has borders which divide people and nations and cause conflict, presenting an obstacle to trade, as well as political and cultural rapprochement."
"Europe's citizens are increasingly able to live within the boundaries of natural regions, which have not been formed through political tyranny and the shifting of borders after wars, but rather as a result of natural and historical development."
"In the spirit of subsidiarity, regions often use cross-border cooperation to carry out their normal business."
"This is one of the greatest achievements of the EU."
"With Romania and Bulgaria joining the EU in 2007 and Croatia joining later, this cross-border cooperation will take on an even greater significance for Hungary."
"For Hungarian communities living close to Hungary, but outside its borders, a Hungarian population of several million people who live in Romania, Slovakia and other neighbouring countries, joint developments have a significant impact on the transformation of borders into virtual boundaries."
"Joint planning and implementation strengthen their sense of identity, as well as cooperation with peoples who have been coexisting for centuries."
"They help dispel prejudices which have been causing ethnic and minority problems for a long time."
"The historical regions where the peoples and nations of Central Europe have lived together for centuries are being restored."
"Economic necessity is reinforcing cohesion between the nations living in the common European family."
"Cross-border cooperation in Europe is a logical and good solution for establishing reasonable cooperation between the multifaceted civil organisations and local authority and government bodies in various locations, and for the extension of the principle of equal opportunities."
"I cannot help but support this, and I am pleased that the European Union is providing significant support for it."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too am delighted at the presentation of the package of almost EUR 308 billion, which on its own represents more than a quarter of the EU's total budget."
"Although some Members of this House find it regrettable that the Council rejected the performance reserve, which would have enabled us to strengthen the economic lever effect, we can say this morning that the reports presented to plenary are satisfactory in that they allow us to move forwards in order to be operational in January 2007."
"It is now up to us to ensure that the appropriations are spent as effectively as possible."
"It is also up to us to promote the projects that provide the greatest added value, and, in particular, to give them greater transparency in order to show our fellow citizens what Europe is doing for them."
"Finally, to conclude, because we have to keep our speeches very brief, may I remind you that, following the long fight over the financial perspective, we now have to win the battle for the EU's own resources."
"When we call for more money, it is because many of us are convinced that the Europe we are building is not only a Europe of peace and cohesion following enlargement, but also the most appropriate area today to combat the effects of globalisation, by promoting not only growth but also employment for our fellow European citizens."
"[] …and thanks to having good rapporteurs, we have managed to catch up."
"It now depends on the national governments whether the new regional policy can be launched in 2007."
"Their job is to make sure that the national development plans are ready and are based on consensus, and, especially in the new Member States, to make up for the lack of progress that we have seen in the past few years."
"They have not been successful so far, but they can achieve success now."
"I welcome the fact that the series of ‘Christmas presents’ given to new Member States – at the time of the Council negotiations in December only for the purpose of acquiring votes – are now being made available to the EU-15 too."
"These benefits are now available to all Member States."
"I am pleased that Parliament has also found a way to support the systematic regeneration of neighbourhoods inhabited by the less well-off."
"In doing so, it has also managed to address the specific situation of the hasty, excessive privatisation of housing in a number of new Member States."
"I support all efforts to ensure total transparency."
"Where assistance is involved, there is also the risk of corruption."
"Openness is particularly important in countries that had been controlled by a single-party system for decades, in order to avoid even the semblance of the governing parties continuing the management and money allocation practices of the previous single party."
"Good laws are being drafted, but we must have a mid-cycle review of how successful the cohesion policy is."
"If required, we will be ready to make it even better."
"I would like to join my colleagues too in welcoming the constructive cooperation of the Council and Parliament."
"I welcome that within the European Social Fund the Council and Parliament have not just supported efficiency and competitiveness against job creation, but also the inclusion of the vulnerable groups in society."
"In fact, competitiveness and social cohesion can only be seen as joint goals, which is why we are Europeans."
"This is how we can make sure that the divisions do not split Europe in two – into new and old Member States, as it had been predicted by many – while ensuring that the internal incidences of poverty and lack of prospects disappear within the individual Member States, too."
"Based on the framework regulation, we can now ask the question: what would ensure a European quality of life for every European citizen?"
"I myself will try to help answer this."
"Mr President, this proposal from the Commission and the Council that we are debating today in this House at second reading is the clear result of our commitment to enlargement of the European Union."
"Nevertheless, I can and must express my concern about the fact that the requests from the European Union’s island regions that their structural problems be recognised have not been included. These problems result from the island regions’ geographical, natural and permanent conditions and special characteristics, which slow down their economic development."
"Declaration 30 of the Treaty of Amsterdam acknowledged that the structural disadvantages suffered by the islands should be compensated for by means of specific measures in favour of those regions, with a view to integrating them into the internal market under the same conditions as the other European regions, improving their access to continental markets and creating a territorial, sectoral and temporal balance in their economic activity."
"Nevertheless, in this case, once again, the specific measures necessary to compensate for the natural, structural, geographical and permanent disadvantages suffered by these island regions have not been taken."
"It is precisely the permanent nature of these problems that makes these specific measures necessary in order to alleviate and correct the inevitable extra cost of being islands."
"For all of these reasons, Mr President, I wish to condemn the fact that, in the drawing up of the regulations on the Funds, account has not been taken of the need to implement a more intensive cohesion policy in those regions suffering from these natural disadvantages, such as the islands. This has been done in the case of the outermost regions, which have been granted favourable treatment."
"What we are asking for for other island regions, although they are not so far away from continental Europe, are measures similar to those provided for the outermost regions."
"We are not talking about granting privileges, but about compensating for the obvious difficulties faced by our islands."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by commending the hard work of our rapporteurs and fellow Members who have made it possible to improve the Commission's proposal from the perspective of partnership, non-discrimination and, above all, balance between the regions of the old and new Member States."
"It is, however, regrettable that the sums devoted to this major EU policy do not match our ambitions."
"In addition, whilst urban policies have been at the heart of a number of debates, the same has not been true of the rural world, the future of which is now linked to the second pillar of the CAP, even though its appropriations have been drastically cut."
"We therefore need to ensure that the Structural Funds mesh well on the ground with the new agricultural Rural Development Fund."
"Finally, I find it regrettable that the Council has decided to earmark the appropriations of the regional policy for the Lisbon objectives on a massive scale, and, what is more, that they did not really consult Parliament regarding the classification of the spending."
"We must remain vigilant, to ensure that the operational programmes in our regions are sufficiently flexible to take account of structural investments, which are still necessary, and of social solidarity."
"Finally, I would remind you that, whilst this reform must, of course, contribute to the objectives of competitiveness, it must, above all, contribute to economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with today’s decision, Europe has decided to invest in a cohesion policy that is rich in prospects, by allocating EUR 308 billion to objectives relating to convergence, social cohesion and the promotion of territorial cohesion."
"In the European Union of 25, 123 million people, equivalent to 27% of the total population, live in regions with a pro capita GDP of less than 75% of the Community average; of these, two-fifths live in regions belonging to the old Member States."
"Cohesion policy helps distribute the benefits of European economic development, by anticipating change and helping areas that are in difficulty, often for structural or geographical reasons."
"This cohesion policy helps limit the negative effects of globalisation."
"One can only support the recent reform of the Structural Funds, those crucial instruments of cohesion policy, because it leads to more efficiency, transparency and accountability."
"The management system has been simplified, with the introduction of differentiation and proportionality in the context of sound financial management, in line with the requests for simplification made by the main actors of cohesion policy: the Member States."
"The new reform is based on the Lisbon and Gothenburg priorities: employment and research, innovation and sustainable development."
"The intention has been to invest in human capital, innovation and the promotion of the knowledge society, entrepreneurship, environmental protection and other areas besides."
"There are, in fact, countless new elements, such as the creation of three new objectives: reducing the number of Structural Funds, strengthening the partnership, allocating more financial resources to islands and regions with geographical handicaps and protecting ‘phasing-out’ regions, which will soon no longer be eligible under the convergence objective."
"Mr President, today’s debate is the culmination of two years’ work on structural fund reform."
"Today we can say that, following difficult negotiations concerning the Financial Perspective and the entire legislative package on cohesion policy, we have achieved a good compromise."
"For the years 2007 – 2013, nearly 36% of the European Union’s budget has been earmarked for structural funds."
"This, in fact, amounts to EUR 308 billion."
"This figure is smaller than we had hoped, but it does provide a basis for drawing up long-term development plans, something that is particularly important for the poorest regions in Europe."
"New regulations will facilitate the pursuing of a simpler cohesion policy that is closer to the citizens and that takes into account the problems of the new Member States in particular."
"These problems include VAT eligibility criteria, municipal issues, creating equal opportunities for disabled people and taking their needs into account."
"Creating territorial cohesion in a European Union where there are great differences in levels of development will not be an easy task."
"Although we already have a legal framework and earmarked funds, we still need the wholehearted commitment of our national and local governments in order to make the best use of the unique opportunity we have created together to foster regional development in the EU."
"I would like to congratulate all the rapporteurs."
"This is another considerable step forward in the history of Europe."
"– Mr President, unemployment in the euro zone may well be lower than ever, but it still stands at 8.8%, and it is for that reason that the Structural Funds and the Social Fund need to be put to work to improve the employability of the people of our Europe."
"I am grateful for the amendments that have been made and also to the rapporteur, Mr Silva Peneda, who has embarked on this debate with a great deal of commitment and energy."
"The Social Fund now concentrates on globalisation and on improving people’s employability."
"It can help with getting them access to work, with the prevention of unemployment, with extending working life and getting more people – women and older people in particular – into working life."
"Cohesion policy could be a symbol of a European mentality, because it is based on open solidarity extending to every region of Europe, especially if the funds are accompanied by regulations that allow even the poorest regions of Europe to use the development opportunities provided."
"Two years ago ten new Member States joined the European Community, typically with poorer regions."
"The regions in these countries have followed a different development path to those in our Western Member States."
"As a result, they also have different problems which we have had to solve."
"Through the work we have done over the past two years, which have included major debates and battles, we have managed to create flexible, effective legislation, which can also resolve the new regions' problems."
"We have every reason to celebrate this agreement."
"If we win the vote tomorrow we will be able to outline an unprecedented prospect for every region in Europe."
"We can create jobs, we can build roads, we can renovate housing."
"In fact, we can start building a new Europe, and we can bring Eastern and Western Europe closer together not only politically, but also in terms of the quality of life of our citizens."
"Mr President, regional policy is second only to the agricultural budgets in constituting the most important European investment in terms of integration and achieving the Lisbon and Gothenbourg objectives."
"For example, the funds payable under competition policy in Objective 2 areas, together with the research and development budgets, form the basis for a development of cohesion policy up to 2013, as well, I think, as thereafter."
"Although, as we heard today, transparency and the production of results will take centre stage over the coming years, not least in the debate on the mid-term review of 2010, what the European people want is for Europe to become visible and tangible."
"This is what Plan D – with D standing for development – is about; it is about more than just the pumping out of money from funds, contrary to what the Member States say as they, meanwhile, collect more money with scarcely any sense of responsibility about it, and the promotion of Europe is not forthcoming."
"I have a question for Commissioner Hübner: can she produce additional initiatives on behalf of the public, as regions and cities have just done?"
"The public and the partners in regional policy ..."
"– Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs on the excellent job which they have done throughout this period."
"The cohesion tools, the Structural Funds, are what brings Europe close to the citizens."
"It is particularly important that the European Parliament managed, through long and difficult negotiations, to introduce important qualitative changes to the texts of the regulations, changes which will help to improve the quality of life of the citizens and to create actions and plans which will not result in divergence, changes which promote sustainable development and the democratisation of procedures to apply the funds through an enlarged partnership and the participation of representatives of civil society."
"At times of crisis and European scepticism, such successes are important and we all need to work not only on promoting them, but also on ensuring they are applied properly."
"The new programming period is difficult."
"The resources allocated to cohesion are inadequate and inequalities in terms of development are acute."
"It is very important, therefore, to have decentralised, flexible procedures with as little red tape as possible which ensure that these resources reach end users in less developed regions in the old and new Member States and are not refunded to the rich countries."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Members of the European Parliament for their wide-ranging and creditable contributions."
"It shows that Parliament has taken a thorough and diverse interest in these matters."
"It has been agreeable to note that one broadly unifying factor is the notion that cohesion policy should not be implemented as an end in itself."
"Rather, the main aim is to bring about equality between people, for their benefit, and to achieve concrete results."
"Another central issue, which I mentioned in my opening address, is partnership and civil society."
"A third issue worth mentioning is the environment, sustainable development and security."
"All these factors will bring the European Union close to the people, as a means of helping them, and they will be an opportunity for making the relationship between the public and the European Union a closer one."
"In addition, I wish to make a brief comment, mainly on two matters: the recycling of unspent resources, and the Lisbon objectives and the Structural Funds."
"For the first time, the Council adopted a position on the matter of the recycling of unspent resources when it was negotiating the interinstutional agreement, and that position was a negative one."
"Owing to repeated requests to do so by the Committee on Regional Development, the country holding the presidency at the time once again raised the matter for debate by the Council’s Committee of Permanent Representatives."
"This committee at the time rejected the European Parliament’s proposal almost unanimously."
"The delegations also refused to make any statement on the matter."
"As I understand it, Parliament and the Commission are to make a joint statement on this issue."
"This, I think, is a good way to proceed."
"The Council, however, will not be able to agree with the contents of the statement, as there is no genuine desire in the Member States to discuss the recycling of unspent resources midway through the programming period."
"The Lisbon objectives for growth, competitiveness, and employment should not, in my opinion, be regarded as opposites within the social and regional dimension."
"On the contrary, the Lisbon objectives, once properly implemented, will ensure that special regional features are taken into account and that in the future too, effective cohesion policy will be pursued."
"My views on the matter can be debated in greater detail at the meeting of the Committee on Regional Development next Monday in Brussels, which I will be attending."
"Finally, may I warmly thank everyone for their high levels of cooperation."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to share five brief points with you."
"First of all, I would like to say that the process that has brought us to this stage of preparation for the next generation of cohesion policy clearly proves that the Community method works and that the European institutions have the capacity to find the consensus that is needed."
"Secondly, what I see today is that we have a policy for the whole territory of the European Union, a policy adapted to the challenges of globalisation, of enlargement, of increased diversity, consistent with the principle of equity, adaptable to very different regional contexts and responding to the needs of territories and cities."
"Thirdly, I leave this debate with a full awareness of your preoccupations: those related to specific situations in individual regions, those related to the need for flexibility on various aspects and those related to the links between the Lisbon Agenda and cohesion policy."
"We will keep them in mind, both whilst negotiating the programmes and during the implementation process."
"Fourthly, I am sure that the Members of the European Parliament will play an active role in promoting this policy in their constituencies, through dialogue with citizens and with all partners."
"We very much count on you."
"Fifthly, the challenge now is to work towards timely implementation, to reinforce management and financial control structures in the Member States and regions to share experience and the lessons already learned, to maximise the benefits derived from good experience and to eliminate the risk of problems recurring."
"We have made this policy a major contributor to Plan D, and we are open to working further with you on it."
"."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have taken part in your debate with interest and I warmly welcome the emphasis placed on social cohesion."
"I feel that the main priority at the moment is to pave the way for the most effective practical implementation of Europe’s structural and cohesion policy."
"We must also hold a dialogue with the citizens that is as open as possible, and develop as far-reaching a concept of partnership as possible, which in effect is what has been emphasised and put forward in the proposals."
"I feel that once we move to the implementation stage, we will enter the next important phase, namely the preparation of further strategies."
"I am very much looking forward to working with you on implementing these strategies and looking for control mechanisms, as well as seeking new strategies."
"After all, life does not stand still and new challenges will certainly arise."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in a few minutes’ time."
"– The regions are the building blocks of Europe; cultural differences and the promotion of regional diversity are among the main characteristics of the Union."
"I am therefore pleased that more than one third of the Union’s budget has been allocated to the Structural Funds for the new 2007-2013 period."
"Supporting regional identity while pursuing convergence at a European level with regard to development and improving conditions for growth and employment is, in fact, an essential precondition for achieving the Lisbon objectives and boosting the economy, especially at local and regional levels."
"It is actually the small-scale realities in Europe that drive the market, and the idea of strengthening competitiveness and involvement at this level, by promoting the partnership between public, private and non-governmental actors operating at a regional level, can only foster economic recovery, and that would benefit the Union overall."
"I hope that the regions will take up this challenge and be able to transform the suggestions and resources provided by these institutions into definite plans for economic and social development, aiming above all at full employment and at the intelligent, sustainable use of the abundant high-quality human, artistic and natural resources that are available to us."
"The structural funds are essential for ensuring that the enhanced prosperity engendered by the single European market is spread move evenly and that less prosperous regions are helped to catch up."
"The creation of a market at European level implies a European responsibility to ensure that all regions benefit."
"My own constituency of Yorkshire and Humber has benefited immensely from the European structural funds."
"South Yorkshire has had the highest level of targeting – ‘Objective One’."
"Much of the rest of the region has also benefited."
"We will be welcoming Commissioner Hübner to the region later this year to see some of the impressive projects that have been financed."
"Although the accession of the new Member States has meant a re-focusing of these funds, I am delighted that the new package agreed for the next seven years will continue to see a continuation of this funding for Yorkshire and the Humber at a substantial, albeit reduced, level."
"I would like to express my support for the Commission proposal on establishing a Community legal instrument in the form of the European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation."
"I wholeheartedly support this initiative."
"It stems from a need to improve current solutions and overcome difficulties in territorial cooperation resulting from the different legal systems and procedures."
"I am convinced that this new initiative will make cross-border, interregional and international cooperation easier and more efficient."
"The Treaty objective of achieving greater social and economic cohesion became particularly important after 1 May 2004, when the European Union welcomed 10 new Member States, including Poland."
"The poorest regions of the European Union lie precisely within the borders of these new Member States."
"However, we cannot look at them from a purely economic point of view."
"We need to see the cultural heritage of these regions and how much they have to offer their partners in cooperation."
"Legal and administrative problems should not be allowed to impede progress and should be solved in a more effective manner than they have been to date."
"I hope that the regulation on establishing a European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation, which represents nearly two years of legislative work, as well as the common position drawn up by the Council and the excellent reports drafted by Mr Olbrycht and adopted by the European Parliament will allow us to achieve this goal and create a model for European integration based on solidarity and harmony."
"– The European Council in December 2005 laid the foundations for the programming of the Structural Funds until 2013."
"The package devoted to the four French overseas departments has been maintained at the same level as the 2000-2006 period, thanks to a sum of EUR 2.83 billion."
"I would like to emphasise this almost completely steady figure, which is due to the eligibility of the French overseas departments for the convergence objective and to their status as outermost regions, at a time when all regions in mainland France, and many regions in the EU, have unfortunately seen their aid cut considerably."
"France, Spain and Portugal managed to get a specific allocation created to take account of the additional costs associated with the disadvantages of the outermost regions."
"I find the lack of visibility of this new measure in the general regulation regrettable."
"I call on the European Commission to show a degree of flexibility in implementing this aid, the procedures for which are included in the ERDF Regulation, because these additional operating costs do not exactly lend themselves to arithmetic quantification."
"The overseas departments perform extremely well when it comes to managing European structural aid, in that they use the funds provided to them regularly and well."
"It is up to them to continue to make good use of those funds."
"The next item is the vote."
"."
"Mr President, it is just a small amendment to get rid of an error that had crept into the text of recital G. We just want to substitute the word ‘undertaking’ for the word ‘regulator’, so that the recital will now read: ‘whereas the issues dealt with by the Committee of Inquiry have a general significance that goes beyond the particular concerns of the European citizens who are directly affected, in particular as regards the adequate functioning of the internal market for insurance products, the correct implementation of Community law and the adequacy of redress mechanisms available to citizens, in particular in cross-border situations where the undertaking concerned is under home-country control’."
"After the words ‘calls for the setting up’, enter the phrase ‘by the end of 2006 of a committee of wise persons’."
"After this, the sentence continues as normal: ‘and report back six months after the establishment of the Committee’."
"This amendment takes place after having also been circulated among the shadow cabinets."
"."
"Mr President, I just want to insert the words ‘in the context of structural and cohesion policy’ into this amendment."
"The words should be on your voting lists."
"Essentially we agree that isolated territories have problems, but we believe this would be better addressed through structural and cohesion policies, so I should like to move that oral amendment."
"."
"Mr President, I shall see whether I can do any better with this oral amendment."
"I wanted to get rid of the word ‘eventually’."
"At the moment the amendment would include the words ‘including eventually NOx emissions’, but I would like to remove the word ‘eventually’."
"The GUE/NGL Group, which tabled the amendment, is content with that."
"Mr President, I am very much in favour of the extension of the EU’s emissions trading system, at an early date, to include the air transport sector, but I am unable to support the final version of this resolution on the grounds that certain paragraphs of it refer to the equal treatment of the various modes of transport and to the introduction of a kerosene tax."
"I would therefore ask that I should no longer be named as a draftsman of an opinion in relation to this resolution."
"Mr President, I just want to make it clear that this does not represent the views of the entire ALDE Group."
"That concludes the vote."
"Mr President, in view of the real floods of migrants, illegal immigration into Europe and associated crime are increasingly becoming a burning problem."
"The only way we will be able to save these illegal immigrants from perishing most miserably on the journey or eking out their existence in the EU under slave conditions is to carry out educational work in their countries of origin and be strict about sending illegals back home."
"That is what is called for now, as we should conclude from the Cavada report."
"Mr President, decisive action needs to be taken against smuggling."
"Smugglers now earn similar amounts to drug dealers."
"The European Union has deployed a large number of measures to combat smuggling, but those measures are not enough."
"I am therefore glad that the European Union is now negotiating with the United Nations and has signed a supplementary protocol guaranteeing that in future joint measures will also be taken with other countries beyond the European Union to combat smuggling."
"I therefore backed the European Union’s signing of the supplementary protocol because it creates a further weapon in the fight against smuggling and thus also against organised crime."
"Mr President, my declaration relates to the second subject area, namely traffic in human beings."
"As in the case of the smuggling of migrants, the European Union also signed an additional protocol on trafficking of persons."
"Human trafficking is another of the major crimes of the present age and generates millions in profits at the expense of individual people."
"The European Union adopts appropriate measures but is not able to deal with the problem on its own, hence the need to seek cooperation with countries outside the Union."
"The United Nations protocol gives us a new instrument of international law, enabling all states affected by the problem to adopt more appropriate measures than hitherto in their efforts to combat human trafficking."
"In this way we are adopting a humanitarian act on the one hand while fighting internationally organised crime with a very efficient additional instrument on the other."
". Trafficking in human beings has reached alarming proportions."
"It is estimated that some 700 000 people around the world fall victim to this crime every year."
"This is a transnational phenomenon that requires a joint response from the international community, coordinated between the various stakeholders involved."
"There needs to be effective cooperation in the fight against organised crime, by means of, for example, harmonising definitions of individual offences in the different national legal systems, mutual legal assistance and joint investigations."
"The international community took a major step forward with the adoption of the United Nations Convention Against Organised Crime, ratified by 121 countries, plus the European Community, which is the first legally binding global instrument designed to combat criminal networks."
"I welcome the fact that Portugal is one of these countries and hope that the other seven Member States that have yet to ratify it will do so at the earliest opportunity."
"I welcome the conclusion of this protocol, which provides for stringent measures to combat trafficking in human beings, especially women and children, by protecting such persons against slavery, sexual exploitation and illegal employment."
"It also offers victims legal and material assistance, and provides for their physical and psychological recovery."
". – Human trafficking affects more than 800 000 people a year."
"This 'trade', which is linked to organised crime, is as profitable as the international arms and drugs trades."
"The aim of human trafficking is sexual or economic exploitation, and it thus constitutes a modern form of slavery, showing complete disregard for the basic right to human dignity."
"It will be difficult and expensive to combat this scourge, because the traffickers' networks are often international, and they benefit from the disparities between national laws and from loopholes in the coordination system."
"I voted in favour of the Council's proposal on the conclusion of two additional protocols to the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime, because they strengthen the coordination and harmonisation of procedures."
"However, even though some progress has been made with regard to stopping and prosecuting traffickers, it is still absolutely vital to give the victims better protection."
"The fact that these people are victims, and the rights related to that fact, need to be better recognised and applied; we need to systematically put forward measures to provide legal, material and psychological aid, and grant temporary residence permits or provide repatriation assistance."
"Those victims who have the courage to denounce their traffickers deserve particular protection, because they often live in constant fear of reprisals."
"– Each year, almost 800 000 tonnes of car batteries, 190 000 tonnes of industrial batteries and accumulators and 160 000 tonnes of portable batteries are placed on the market in the European Union."
"These batteries contain heavy metals (mercury, lead and cadmium) that are harmful to the environment and to human health."
"Despite this, only six Member States have so far implemented a national collection system with a view to recycling used batteries."
"Of those six, Belgium is the star pupil: it collects getting on for 60% of batteries."
"I am in favour of the directive on which we are going to vote, which aims precisely to set up a system of this kind throughout the EU by 2008."
"Some of the proposed measures particularly deserve our support: the general ban on marketing batteries and accumulators containing excessive quantities of heavy metals; the setting of quantified collection and recycling objectives; the requirement to state the true lifespan on the label, in order to inform consumers; and support for research aimed at developing more environmentally friendly batteries and new recycling techniques."
". Given that in 2002 almost half of all portable batteries sold in the EU-15 Member States were eventually incinerated or disposed of in landfills, this report is an important piece of environmental legislation."
"The main points raised in this report cover the most important measures of reducing the harmful effects of battery waste."
"The report requires Member States to ensure that manufacturers design appliances in such a way that spent batteries and accumulators can be readily removed, and that appliances be accompanied by instructions containing consumer information."
"Producers will now be required to finance any net costs arising from the collection, treatment and recycling of waste batteries and accumulators, regardless of when these were placed on the market."
"The capacity labelling of all portable and automotive batteries and accumulators will be introduced no later than 12 months after the date of transposition of the directive."
"I agree that the report should promote research to make batteries less environmentally harmful and to encourage the development of new recycling technologies and that a 50% recycling target should be set for non-hazardous batteries."
". In the depths of darkest East Anglia, are the good burghers crying out for a directive making it compulsory for batteries to be recycled?"
"No."
"I suspect that most people haven’t even thought of it and even if they become aware of this latest over-zealous piece of EU legislation, they will place the dud batteries from their transistor radios in the dustbin."
"In the preamble to this directive it states: 'It is desirable to harmonise national measures concerning batteries and accumulators'."
"Who decided it was ‘desirable’?"
"It is certainly an odd expression to use in this context."
"A woman may be desirable but another dopey set of rules for harmonising the way we deal with batteries and accumulators – I think not."
"However, this legislation places the entire financial burden of introducing these new recycling and disposal facilities on the producer."
"Surely, in a sane world, i.e. one without the EU, when someone buys a product, he becomes responsible for its safe disposal."
"The 'producer must pay for disposal principle' is a part of the EU mindset."
"Stop dreaming up new ways to increase the cost of producing anything."
"Businesses will not be able to afford to pay these extra costs."
". The report before us today adopts the Council common position of 12 June 2006 on the European Social Fund for 2007-2013."
"I wish to state that there are some, albeit not enough, positive aspects in this position and others to which we object."
"Among the positive points, we wish to highlight social inclusion and gender equality. The common position falls short, however, on areas such as the promotion of the quality of work, and a more proactive contribution towards reducing income disparities and social inequality with the objective of genuine economic and social cohesion."
"It is a position that continues to reduce the scope of application to policies closely related to the guidelines and recommendations in the context of the European Employment Strategy and the Lisbon Strategy, which we know has served to exacerbate inequalities and to promote the deregulation of the labour market."
"It is up to the Member States to define their priorities and the areas to be funded; in other words, there is some leeway for the Member States to implement it correctly."
"Hence our abstention."
"I voted for Mr Silva Peneda's report."
"Three quarters of the amendments tabled by our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs were accepted by the Council, acting by a qualified majority, and then by the European Commission."
"The Austrian presidency of the Council played a vital role in securing the compromise; once again, its good work has borne fruit."
"It has breathed life into the concept of 'flexicurity', working for flexible labour markets while defending social security and winning the approval of people in employment as well as those affected by unemployment."
"The European Social Fund contributes to economic and social cohesion and is compatible with the new Lisbon Strategy."
"It fosters employability through the creation of local partnerships and job-creation companies, especially in structurally weak areas."
"It helps to combat youth unemployment and long-term unemployment, to overcome the shortage of skilled labour and to reduce social exclusion and discrimination."
"I welcome the signs of willingness to involve the representative bodies of management and labour more fully in the design and implementation of projects."
"The ESF is to develop into a guarantor of quality that supplements national programmes effectively rather than replacing them."
"It makes important contributions to efforts to meet the challenges posed by globalisation and demographic change and to kick-start urgent reform of Member States' economic and social policies."
". Over the last programming period and now within the enlarged Union, there has been a sense of the growing importance of protecting the environment whilst ensuring economic growth, improving access for the disabled to publicly financed facilities ensuring equality of treatment and eliminating discrimination in all its forms."
"This report has paid particular attention to enabling a greater number of disadvantaged and underdeveloped regions to catch up with those which are more developed."
"The regional competitiveness and employment objective also remains a central element of regional policy and a high level of available resources will be concentrated on those priorities."
"Parliament has cooperated in negotiations with both the Presidency and the European Commission and one of Parliament's main achievements was obtaining a substantial increase in the financial resources dedicated to territorial cohesion, an important objective in the context of enlargement."
"Parliament has not only been successful in the above-mentioned points, but its voice has also been heard in the areas of partnership."
"Under the General Regulation, greater involvement of civil society and NGOs is desirable."
"The Commission will make a statement on the abuse of Structural Funds by organised crime."
". – I voted in favour of Mr Hatzidakis's recommendation laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds, and I was pleased to see that the new generation of programmes will be able to start in early 2007, which is vital for the continuity of activities in the Member States."
"I nevertheless find it regrettable that, following the agreement on the financial perspective, the funds allocated to the structural policy for 2007-2013 are below the initial demands of Parliament and the European Commission."
"With regard more specifically to the regulations, Parliament can take pride in the fact that a number of its demands have been taken up by the Council, in particular greater consideration for disabled people and sustainable development."
"The new regulations will allow us to pursue the European Union's cohesion policy, which aims to develop the poorest areas and to improve the competitiveness of the EU as a whole."
". The adoption today of the legislative package on cohesion, namely the proposal for a regulation on the general provisions of the Structural Funds, is a vitally important factor in the EU Member States and regions being able to finalise the national frames of reference and operational programmes, and begin to use the European funds from January 2007."
"As a result of fruitful negotiations with the Council, the text of the proposed regulation welcomes almost all of the main points that Parliament had raised in its provisional report adopted in 2005."
"It is regrettable that the amount originally proposed by the Commission, which had Parliament’s full support, for specific funding for integrating the outermost regions into the internal market, compensating for their particular difficulties, has not been enshrined."
"In addition to additional funding for the outermost regions, a maximum cofinancing rate of 85% of eligible expenditure has been provided for."
"Most importantly, special transitional – and more beneficial – arrangements have been laid down during the phasing-in stage of the new Regional Competitiveness and Employment objective for the autonomous region of Madeira."
"I shall therefore be voting in favour of this recommendation."
"Although I regret the fact that, on 17 May 2006, the European Parliament validated the next Financial Perspective for 2007-2013, we now have to come to terms with the meagre sums that emerge from it if we are to define the role and determine the size of the Structural Funds for the next few years."
"With this in view, I am delighted with the clarity of the way in which European regional policy has now been constructed, focused as it is on three new objectives that are more coherent and more easily identifiable."
"I am also pleased that the significant reductions in the level of funds now available to the EU will not have disastrous consequences for the outermost regions whose specific handicaps, as well as their underdevelopment, make it crucial for them to receive the aid supplied by Community instruments designed to promote solidarity."
"In this way, the outermost regions will remain eligible for such aid in terms of the ‘Convergence, competitiveness and territorial cooperation’ objective (formerly Objective 1)."
"The additional specific allocation of EUR 35 per inhabitant will also enable us in part to meet their needs."
"Finally, the objective of ‘European territorial cooperation’ will enable the outermost regions to extend the work already done on developing synergies with neighbouring states in the Indian Ocean and the Caribbean."
"For all these reasons, I have voted in favour of the report by Mr Hatzidakis."
"The common position adopted today sets out the interinstitutional agreement giving tangible form to the financial framework for 2007-2013, in which the Structural Fund is EUR 28 billion down on the Commission’s proposal, a reduction from 0.41% of Community GNI in the current financial framework to 0.37%. This will undermine effective economic and social cohesion, real convergence and the redistribution effect of the Community’s budget."
"There has been a significant shift in the objectives of the Structural Funds, whereby the accent is placed on competitiveness and on business interests, in line with the neoliberal Lisbon agenda, at the expense of cohesion."
"The key objectives of the Funds are therefore public-private partnerships, the commercialisation of knowledge and research and the adaptability and mobility of the workers."
"The N+2 rule has been kept and there is no guarantee, at least on the Council’s part, that the money from the Structural Funds that has been cut and not implemented will continue to be used solely in this area."
"I also wish to point out that the concessions granted at the December 2005 European Council on the eligibility criteria for cohesion countries in exchange for a cut in funds can now be extended to the remaining Member States."
"We therefore voted against."
". There are three reasons why the increase in the Structural Funds which, between 2007 and 2013, will represent 35.7% of the European Union’s budget, that is to say EUR 307.9 billion, is a sham as far as France is concerned."
"Although more than 16% of Brussels’s budgetary revenue comes from French taxpayers, the proportion of European regional expenditure allocated to France keeps on falling and has been reduced from 10% in 1994 to less than 8% today."
"Thus, the cantons of France’s Hainaut region, despite being affected by massive unemployment, are no longer entitled to Structural Funds under Objective 1."
"Moreover, the increase in the share allocated to the regional budget is at the expense of the common agricultural policy, of which France is still the main beneficiary."
"European regional policy is, above all, an economic sham."
"In France, the Structural Funds are mainly intended for industrial regions in decline and for the redevelopment of rural areas, in other words for the victims of policy made in Brussels. Such policy is heavily responsible for ruining our agriculture and destroying whole swathes of our industry."
"– I did not vote (abstained) on the amended Hatzidakis report, because in it Parliament basically departs from its initial positions on all the major issues and countersigns the Council's common position, which weakens regional and social cohesion policies."
"In other words:"
"- the resources available have been reduced from 0.41% for the period 2000-2006 to 0.37% for the period 2007-2013."
"Resources have been reduced by EUR 28 billion compared to the Commission's initial proposal, which for Parliament was the minimum financing needed in order to support cohesion and the environment;"
"- it abandons Parliament's position on the recycling of appropriations lost due to the strict application of the n+2 rule for regional policy."
"Thus, the lost appropriations, which are expected to be high, will return to the national budgets of the richest Member States, at the expense of the poorer states and regions;"
"- it accepts clearly weakened financial support, both for the 16 regions which will fall victim to so-called 'statistical convergence', which include three Greek regions (Attica, Central Macedonia and Western Macedonia) and for the 12 'natural convergence' regions, which include two Greek regions (Sterea Ellada and the Southern Aegean);"
"- it agrees to the extension of the n+2 rule to Cohesion Fund projects, which will cause additional difficulties and losses."
"These funds should only go to the very poorest parts of Europe."
"As things stand, the money is going to regions that are relatively well off."
"This is unacceptable."
"– The framework decision on the Structural Funds is being used by the ΕU and centre-right and centre-left governments in order to speed up the objectives included in the anti-grassroots Lisbon Strategy, strengthen competitiveness and increase the profitability of capital, which is being promoted through capitalist restructurings and by striking at the wage and social rights of the workers."
"The resources of the Structural Funds are being channelled to sectors which are of interest to the profitability of capital and, at the same time, 'crumbs' are being given in order to 'defuse' grassroots indignation and bring the working and grassroots class movement under control."
"While social and regional inequalities are worsening in the EU, the weight of the Structural Funds in its budget for the period 2007- 2013 is being reduced from 0.41% to 0.37%."
"At the same time, use is being made of the enlargement of the ΕU and urban statistics to exempt from financing areas which have major economic problems and huge infrastructure deficits."
"The group of the Greek Communist Party in the European Parliament will be voting against the framework decision."
". Under the Council common position on the new Cohesion Fund regulation, in common with the previous financial framework the Funds remain contingent on compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact and the Maastricht nominal convergence criteria."
"That is to say, a cohesion country with a lower level of economic development is penalised twice over."
"Being in a state of crisis it will fail to meet the Stability and Growth Pact criteria, and it will also run the risk of having its money from the Cohesion Fund taken back."
"This is tantamount to blackmail, which is unacceptable."
"We are also very much opposed to the extension of the N+2 (N+3) rule to the Cohesion Fund, taking account of the specific nature and the objectives of this fund."
"It should be borne in mind that this rule, imposed by Germany in the previous Financial Framework 2000-2006 on the remaining Structural Funds, involves a cut in the funds not already implemented within two years (three years). This clearly runs counter to the objective of the Structural Funds."
"This new condition could have an even greater impact than the Cohesion Fund, taking account of the funding of major projects, giving rise to bigger difficulties in implementation and financing."
". Today we have had the debate on Structural and Cohesion Funds and cross-border cooperation."
"As far as the latter is concerned we have had this experience in Northern Ireland for many years and it has worked."
"However, recently this has not occurred."
"ICBAN – one of the longest established funding bodies has through its make-up become unbalanced."
"On the ICBAN board there are twenty members, only three of whom are now from the unionist community."
"The body is no longer balanced and is now discriminating against the unionist community."
"It no longer has the support of unionists in the area."
"This body has responsibility to spend EUR 25 million in the coming years."
"This is an unacceptable situation which must be brought to an end."
"If this discrimination continues then ICBAN funds must be frozen until there is total fairness."
"We have voted in favour of two reports that are aimed at reforming the EU’s Structural Policy."
"The work that is now under way on the reform of this policy area is an important step in the right direction."
"Generally, however, we advocate a more restrictive stance on EU regional aid."
"We do not support regional contributions being used to finance housing or tourist activities."
"Nor do we support the proposed approach to research, which would extend a single research area to various seats of learning, rather than concentrating it on a smaller number of sites."
". I supported amendments in the name of the Verts/ALE Group which sought to adopt guidelines on fair competition, social standards and environmental protection for tramp vessel services."
"These amendments also called for special account to be taken of the specific situation of small and medium-sized ship owners."
"Unfortunately these amendments were defeated."
"The resulting report overall goes against proposals by the Commission aimed at breaking down cartels in maritime transport."
"Therefore I voted against the final report because I believe that in many respects the Commission’s original proposal was better suited to lowering maritime transport costs, without endangering the reliability of services."
"Maritime transport represents approximately 45% of the European Union’s external trade in terms of value and almost 75% in terms of volume."
"Applying the general rules of competition law to international tramp services and cabotage does not in reality present any problem as these activities are already deregulated and operate on the basis of fair competition."
"It is abolishing the exemption, granted in 1986, of liner conferences from the competition rules that, alone, has been the subject of genuinely bitter discussions between all the players in this sector."
"I think that the solutions produced by Mrs Wortmann-Kool’s and my own reports in this regard are perfectly balanced and respect the interests at stake."
"Indeed, there is not at present any evidence that the liner conference sector needs to be protected from competition in order to provide its services."
"In order to preserve the legal certainty of the maritime sector, it seemed necessary, moreover, to lay down guidelines enabling operators to adapt to the new regulatory framework and to facilitate a smooth transition to a competitive regime."
"If all the precautions taken by Parliament in this matter are respected, there is no doubt that maritime transport will benefit."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to explain why I voted against the Lamassoure report on the EU’s system of own resources."
"I voted this way along with the other MEPs from the Czech Civil Democratic Party (ODS)."
"I strongly believe that the reform of the EU’s system of own resources agreed between the Council and the Commission is a decent compromise, which Parliament should not have torpedoed."
"On the contrary, Parliament would have been well advised to show its support for such progress."
"Above all, we welcome the fact that no European tax will be introduced in the foreseeable future."
"Broadly speaking, the current system works and guarantees proper funding of the Union."
"There is therefore no real reason to jettison it and replace it with a new system."
"Accordingly, I cannot accept the critical stance of the Lamassoure report."
"Even after the British rebate is taken into account the EU is scheduled to cost the UK £4 298 million in 2006."
"Considering that the net cost has been of this order every year, it is staggering just how much of our national resources we have poured into the black hole of Europe."
"And for what?"
"Think of the real infrastructural change this vast volume of money could have made if spent internally on the real needs of the UK since 1973."
"Though there are now 25 Member States, the UK this year will contribute one eighth (12.4%) of the total budget revenue of £83 billion required to fund the EU in 2006."
"Little wonder the tide of Euro-scepticism continues to rise."
"At a time of acute pressure on our health service and vital education sector, it is appalling that we are wasting so much taxpayers' money on a failing political union."
"With Blair having agreed to surrender the British rebate by stages and as the real cost of enlargement builds, the situation will only get worse."
"I voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague, Mr Lamassoure, on the proposal for a decision of the European Council on the system of European Communities’ own resources."
"In order to move ahead with the construction of a political European Union, we urgently need to reform its budgetary framework."
"The difficult achievement of an agreement on the financial perspective 2007-2013 by the European Council in December 2006 and the Commission’s proposals do not make the Union’s funding transparent, since it appears that we are getting further away from the principle of budgetary equity which currently underpins the Member States’ contributions to the Union’s operations."
"The debate on own resources, against the backdrop of the prospect of a federal Europe, will probably be one of the thorniest political issues to be faced in the future."
"Nevertheless, in the immediate future and in view of the current deficiencies in European finances and those of the main net contributing Member States, I wonder whether the time has come to set up a great European investment loan in order to fund all of the major infrastructures (space, motorways, high-speed railways, communication technologies, ports, airports, and so on) which are necessary for economic development and social progress."
"We have today voted against Mr Lamassoure’s report on a Council decision on the European Communities’ own resources."
"While it is important that a budget process that is more efficient and transparent be created for the EU, we reject any notion of future tax-levying by the EU on the likes of energy, VAT or corporate income."
"I have chosen to abstain in the vote on the report on the proposal for a Council decision on the system of the European Communities’ own resources."
"As problems and opportunities become more and more cross-border in nature, the European Union is becoming an ever more important forum for solving such problems and best exploiting such opportunities."
"While I hope that the process of better legislating can clear up a whole raft of issues that I believe should be handled at the national level – and indeed why not even the regional level – I see that the majority of areas that are so important for European citizens need a common approach."
"The issues in question are, amongst others, the environment, research and development and energy, these being areas where we can create healthier surroundings with more jobs and long-term growth."
"In principle, I am therefore in favour of a new system of financing for the Community."
"On the other hand, I do not believe that the current contributions from the Member States, which are more a reflection of the ability to negotiate rebates than of what the Member States see as the needs within the EU, should be replaced by a new form of own resources based on energy, VAT or corporate income, as proposed by the Commission."
"That would not be a more equitable system."
"I am, nevertheless, in favour of large parts of the report on which we are voting."
"Clearly, simplification and greater transparency are things that I welcome."
"Over and above the political agreement on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013, the negotiations that took place at the meetings of the Council on 15 and 16 December 2005 confirmed the need to change the own resources system."
"At a time when European integration appears to have stalled – due in particular to the tendency to take refuge in national self-interest and to the disjunction between the people and the Community institutions – the non-transparent nature of this bargaining and the fact that each Member State wishes to view the budgetary issue solely in terms of its own particular interests have highlighted the urgency of providing ourselves with a clear and unambiguous own resources system that, as far as possible, extricates the EU from current contingencies in relation to national budgets."
"It is vital that the European Parliament, as the representative of the nations, take part in this process."
"Mr Lamassoure’s report, which is being put to the vote today, is part and parcel of this process, and its conclusions – which tie up with a large proportion of the concerns expressed above – are along the right lines, designed as they are to bring about a Europe that is in control of its financial resources and closer to the people."
"Even though I should have liked the possibility already to have been mentioned of a European corporate tax as a new own resource for the EU, I have therefore voted in favour of this document."
"The Lamassoure report is basically about the EU bringing about a situation in which it has comprehensible own resources that match its aspirations and that do not depend on contributions by the Member States and its doing so, of course, between now and 2008 and without waiting for the multiannual programming of the budget to come to an end."
"It has to be deduced from all this that Parliament wants to see a European tax, and quickly."
"What is it playing at?"
"This is a veritable assault on democracy in which the ground rules that have only just been established for the next six years are to be changed in barely two years’ time and to be so just after the expected changes in government in several Member States, notably in those whose populations rejected the Constitution."
"An unspoken attempt is manifestly being made to create a state, because an organisation with tax-raising powers is effectively a state."
"It may not have a constitution and it may lack legitimacy, but it is a state all the same, empowered, like the Member States, to put pressure on the taxpayer."
"With its powers in the commercial sphere, the European Union has had properly coherent resources that have genuinely been its own, namely customs duties. Ever since it was founded, the EU has been contriving to destroy those resources."
"What it should, therefore, be doing is reinstating them."
"This would be a sensible thing to do, increasing its resources and protecting the European economies against unfair competition."
". As regards the system of own resources for 2007-2103, the Council opted to maintain the British cheque (except for enlargement expenditure) and to extend similar privileges to the other net contributors, namely Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden, by reducing VAT rates and direct GNI contributions and the increased rate of retention of traditional own resources, as well as ‘cheques’ under the Structural and Rural Development Funds."
"These reductions will be paid for by the other Member States including cohesion countries, which will be penalised twice over. They will be paying bigger contributions to the Community budget and the Structural and Cohesion Funds will be reduced."
"This situation is unfair and unacceptable and on its own justifies our vote against."
"That being said, there are those who advocate a new system for own resources based on European taxes, which we oppose."
"We feel that a fair system of own resources must be based on GNI and on relative wealth of each Member State, whereby the budgetary contribution effort should be the same for all citizens right across the EU."
"This would deliver solidarity and redistribution, alongside spending, bearing in mind the objective of genuine convergence and economic and social cohesion."
". I abstained on the Lamassoure report on own resources even though it included several good ideas for improving the present system."
"I could not agree with the rapporteur's view about the UK abatement."
"I remain convinced that this is justified under the present system and that wider reforms need to be undertaken before any further changes are made to the UK rebate."
". Bearing in mind that the US budget, for one year alone, amounts to USD 2 500 billion, it is obviously untenable for the EU to have, for everyone, a budget of less than EUR 1 000 billion for 2007 to 2013."
"Initially, and in order to give itself some room for manoeuvre without increasing its budget, the European Commission is gradually eliminating the common agricultural policy and Europe’s small farmers in order to recover most of the EUR 45 billion spent each year on the agricultural budget."
"Hence, the unlikely position taken by the European negotiators who, at the meeting of the World Trade Organisation on 30 June 2006, accepted, behind the scenes, a 50% reduction in our customs duties, thereby leaving Brazil with a monopoly on food."
"The basic problem remains intact, however."
"Everyone knows that, as from 2014, Brussels-centred Europe will be doomed to increase its budget and to create a European tax."
"Behind the smoke and mirrors, the Lamassoure report’s talk of own resources raises the political issue that has been dragging on since 1951 and that concerns the actual emergence, by way of a single market and then a single currency, of a political state."
"What the euro did not do and what the Constitution failed to do, because the nations woke up to what was happening, taxation is set to do between 2014 and 2019."
"Taxpayers have been warned."
"The discussion about the EU budget has hitherto focused exclusively on constantly increasing the size of the budget and seeking new sources of revenue."
"Instead of clamouring automatically for a European tax, we should be subjecting the expenditure structure to close examination."
"Billions of euros from our common budget continue to seep out into dubious channels or are cast aimlessly to the four winds."
"For this reason, the first thing we need is a top-class anti-fraud system; secondly, we need to curb administrative expenditure through measures such as the abandonment of one of the seats of Parliament and the assessment of expenses on the basis of actual costs incurred; thirdly, there are billions to be saved by not foisting enlargements on our unwilling citizens."
"In the light of the very technical report by my fellow Member, Mr Lamassoure, concerning the EU’s own resources, I think it vital to draw attention to the idea put forward by Belgium and by Guy Verhofstadt a few years ago: that of giving the EU genuine financial autonomy via the introduction of what has been called a European tax."
"An additional tax?"
"Surely not."
"The idea is simply that, rather than pay what is due to Europe to their own nations, Europeans should be allowed to fund the EU directly, in the way that Americans fund the federal state."
"For the individual European, it is a plan that would, therefore, have no great significance at all from a financial point of view but that would be pregnant with symbolism, since everyone would thus be made aware of the portion of his or her tax devoted to European integration."
"I would point out, incidentally, that Europe costs each European 26 cents per day."
"Although the plan is warmly welcomed by certain Member States (notably Austria and Luxembourg), others remain nervous about an instrument intended, nonetheless, to bring Europe closer to its citizens."
"The plan would also enable us to leave behind the sterile debate between states that are net contributors and those that are net beneficiaries."
"Europe would then, most certainly, have resources in keeping with its ambitions."
". The current method of funding the Community budget has become obsolete, and in recent years the shortcomings have come to the fore."
"Recent budgetary debates have turned into a humiliating exercise in which we end up discussing, one by one, who is and is not a net contributor."
"The current system, with so many exceptions and derogations, has become complex and opaque."
"In this context, the EU urgently needs to reform its funding system."
"I therefore welcome the fact that Parliament has managed to introduce an interim review timetabled for 2008/2009 into the negotiations on the latest financial perspective 2007-2013. This will provide a unique opportunity for a root and branch assessment of the system of own resources."
"As Mr Lamassoure said in his report, I am in favour of a Community budget funding system that is transparent, fair and equitable, one that provides the EU with a financial framework that matches its current priorities and its legitimate ambitions."
"The guiding principle behind any reform should be the financial independence of the EU in relation to the Member States’ current transfers, and the strengthening of the European character of the budget. This will ensure that future debate will not once again descend into a battleground of Member States’ national interests."
". The five biggest non-financial multinationals in the Top 7 since 1990 had assets of around USD 1 280 billion in 2003, in other words over 3% of the world’s GNI."
"The biggest financial multinational, Citibank, alone had that amount in assets, which demonstrates the power that the financial sector wields in the real economy."
"The real aim of what is referred to as consolidating the financial services sector is to consolidate the internal market for financial services and to integrate the financial markets, with a view to scrapping the barriers to the free movement of capital that still exist, and to encourage company mergers and acquisitions, in sectors such as banking, to enable them to compete in the globalised market."
"We are opposed to this trend, as expressed in the resolution before us, of which the euro is an instrument and the objectives of which are laid down in the financial services action plan."
"The gradual financialisation of the real economy has not only led to significant job losses, it has also helped to turn the real economy into a parasite economy by diverting manufacturing investment, and to encourage financial, and subsequently economic, crises due to the extremely volatile nature of the financial markets and the speculative bubbles that they create."
"This casino economy has only increased the profits of the major brokerage firms, especially in the banking sector."
"Hence our vote against."
". The UK Conservative Delegation abstained on the final vote of this report."
"We endorse many of the proposals in the Szejna report on developments in and prospects for company law, in particular, the need to apply better regulation principles, the necessity to take account of the needs of SMEs and the importance of developing best practice which respects the different traditions and systems of Member States."
"We also support many of the detailed proposals for improving transparency and the rights of stakeholders."
"However, there are a number of proposals that we cannot support, as they would introduce additional EU regulations in areas where there would be no demonstrated benefits to the evolution of an effective internal market for financial services."
"We also endorse the benefits for companies of involving their employees in workplace decision-making, but reject the imposition of any ‘one size all’ statutory model of participation."
"We therefore voted against Paragraph 3 and Recital F."
"– Mr President, I wish to explain my vote on the Lucas report, which in common with the other MEPs from the Czech Civil Democratic Party (ODS) was a vote against."
"Air transport has undergone rapid development over the past 40 years, which has led to a 40%-plus fall in emissions and noise."
"There is no scientific evidence that we need the kind of excessive regulation proposed in the Lucas report."
"Raising fuel taxes will reduce the competitiveness of Europe’s air carriers and raise prices for the end user."
"Weakening the competitiveness of air transport will hamper the EU still further on the world stage."
"This is simply further evidence of the current fashion for environmental concerns, which is why we voted against."
"Mr President, I voted on the Lucas report in support of measures to lessen the impact on climate change."
"It is vital that all industries play their part, including the aviation industry."
"However, we need to ensure that measures we propose are both sensible and practical."
"Merely increasing taxes will not by itself reduce emissions."
"Neither can the aviation industry trade emissions with itself: it needs to do so in cooperation with other industries."
"Of course, air travel has increased over the years, as it is no longer restricted to just the middle classes and the rich."
"For example, in the UK alone, 30 million people – i.e. half the population – travel by air at least once a year."
"These people all welcomed the European initiatives that encouraged low-cost airlines and forced the major carriers to reduce their fares."
"Thus the European public do not support the aim of some colleagues in the House to outlaw low-cost budget airlines or force them out of business."
"This same public, though, is concerned about climate change."
"They want a fair and sensible taxation system and measures that must be taken in cooperation between government and industry."
"All these measures must be considered in relation to the needs and wishes of these consumers in a way that ensures that environmental concern is at the very top of the agenda."
". I welcome the Commission Communication of September 2005, which begins to address the most effective ways of tackling the international increase of greenhouse emissions' increase of 73% from 1990 to 2003."
"The extension of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to the aviation sector may be the best way forward to limiting these emissions and to ensuring that aviation, like all other sectors, contributes to reducing harmful greenhouse gases."
"The most important issue moving forward is to examine the effectiveness of the technical design elements for the policy to deliver its full potential for environmental and economic efficiency, while also giving special attention to the situation of Ireland and other isolated territories, which are so particularly dependent on air transport services, both capital and regional areas."
"In addition, the impact on prices and the allocation of emission rights need further examination."
"Given Ireland’s geographical circumstances, aviation is a critical element of our infrastructure, with air services being of vital importance for economic and social reasons."
"Consequently, a competitive market between air transport operators is necessary for Ireland’s economic competitiveness."
"We Swedish Conservatives would like aviation to be included in the European Emissions Trading Scheme."
"That would be an effective and fair way of internalising the environmental costs that aviation causes, in accordance with the ‘polluter pays’ principle."
"We regret the fact that the Swedish Government has chosen to implement a special arrangement for flight taxes in Sweden."
"To do so distorts competition and weakens Sweden’s competitiveness whilst providing only small benefits to the environment, or none at all, in comparison with the introduction of emissions trading for aviation."
"The fact that the report advocates the introduction of a separate emissions trading scheme means that we Swedish Conservatives are unable to support it."
"A separate system means that we risk achieving a lower total reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and, what is more, at a significantly higher cost than is necessary."
"We Swedish Conservatives do believe that emissions trading should be introduced, but this must be done in the right way."
"The dramatic reduction in the price of flying in Europe is a basically positive development that has brought prosperity, freedom of movement and interaction between people."
"We regret the fact that the rapporteur and the majority in this House seem to be of the opposite opinion, and we do not, therefore, back the calls in the report for further tax rises of various kinds on aviation."
". Labour MEPs fully support action to combat the climate change impact of aviation."
"We support the principle of inclusion of aviation emissions in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and ask the Commission to come forward with workable proposals."
"We abstained on some paragraphs in this report which were contradictory or whose implications have not been fully costed or worked out."
". I will be voting for this report on reducing the climate change impact of aviation."
"Aviation is one of the most rapidly growing sources of greenhouse gases."
"In terms of raising this important issue, I agree with the rapporteur almost entirely."
"Nevertheless some of her proposals, for example the immediate introduction of kerosene tax on VAT or all intra-EU flights or the establishment of a separate emissions trading scheme for aviation, have neither been costed nor impact-assessed."
"Equally, the problems of peripherality in my own region of South-West England mean that special attention must be paid to the most isolated areas, such as, in my region, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly."
"In the case of Gibraltar, a particular complex of geographical and political isolation has been caused by the attitude of the Spanish authorities."
"Therefore I look forward to the Commission using this report as the basis for bringing forward costed and workable proposals for action."
". Yes, aviation is a factor in climate change."
"Although aviation fuel has become increasingly efficient in the course of the last 40 years, total fuel consumption has at the same time increased because of the large growth in air traffic."
"A situation must be prevented in which aviation emissions become a long-term major contributor to climate change."
"There is no quick technical solution."
"That is why it is vital to bank simultaneously on integrating the impact of aviation into the Community emissions rights exchange system and on pursuing research, improving the management of air traffic and introducing energy taxation."
"This new sally against climate change should not, however, be engaged in at any price."
"The system to be put in place must not penalise our European airlines in the world market, and any unfair competition with other forms of transport should also be prevented."
"The choices shortly to be made by the Commission in its legislative proposal are therefore of vital importance, and the various options will have to be assessed very carefully."
"I urge the Commission to propose solutions that are rational in both economic and environmental terms."
"It must avoid at any price creating a pernicious system in which the weight of bureaucracy puts European aviation out of the running in the international market."
". British Conservatives have voted in favour of this report because we recognise the impact aviation emissions have on climate change."
"They account for some 4% of carbon emissions in the EU and air traffic movements are set to double by 2020 compared to 2003."
"We are in favour of including aviation emissions in an emissions trading scheme, either by addition to the present scheme or possibly within a more limited scheme."
"This would allow the airlines to cooperate with the national and EU authorities to apply rules that meet their aims of achieving the highest possible environmental standards without unduly penalising EU travellers and, if they are operated on flights into and out of the EU, operators would pay no more than their non-EU competitors."
"Any EU scheme would best be operated eventually as part of a global approach."
"We are not in favour of a kerosene tax or including air travel within the VAT system."
"We do not want to damage the EU air transport industry and the public’s reasonable expectation of cheaper air travel."
"We look to the Commission to learn from its early mistakes in the emissions trading system and to pilot an ETS for the aviation industry."
". Air transport is the most commonly used method of long distance travel, and this has had a serious environmental impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions."
"I feel that emission charging and emission trading licenses is an appropriate way of addressing the problem."
"I also welcome the inclusion in this proposal of internal flights and flights starting or finishing in the EU, and the creation of a single European airspace, which will make it possible to cut down on air routes."
"Nevertheless, I believe that the attention must be paid to the special case of remote, outlying regions that are difficult to access, and therefore highly dependent on air transport."
"I am therefore only supporting the report because the amendment providing for special attention to be paid to the outermost regions and remote regions has been adopted."
"Such regions would have been seriously harmed had the new aviation charges been applied uniformly across the European area."
". Air transport is the most commonly used method of long distance travel, yet the emissions from aviation run counter to the global objective of reducing emissions."
"The measures proposed in this report, especially emission charging and emission trading licenses, strike me as an appropriate way of addressing the problem of the influence of aviation."
"Another important proposal in the report is the inclusion of internal flights and all flights that start or finish in the EU, with a view to preventing market imbalances."
"The report also proposes that a single European airspace be set up, which will make it possible to cut down on air routes, given that more direct flights will involve less gas emission."
"There is one detail, however, to take into account, which is the unique context of the remote and outermost regions."
"I am therefore supporting the report because the amendment providing for special attention to be paid to the outermost regions and remote regions has been adopted. Such regions would have been seriously harmed had the new aviation charges been applied uniformly across the European area."
"Given that access to these regions is difficult and time-consuming, air transport is extremely important to them."
". I voted for the Lucas report on the impact of aviation on climate change."
"I fully support action to combat the climate change impact of aviation."
"I also support the principle of the inclusion of aviation emissions in the Emissions Trading Scheme and hope the Commission will come forward with a workable proposal."
"I abstained on a number of paragraphs simply because I do not believe the impact of the proposals has yet been fully evaluated."
"For example, I abstained on the call for an end to VAT exemption for air transport because it is not clear if this will help tackle climate change or merely hurt the less well-off traveller."
". I fully support action to combat the climate change impact of aviation."
"I support the principle of inclusion of aviation emissions in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and support the call for the Commission to come forward with workable proposals."
"I abstained on some paragraphs in this report which were contradictory or whose implications have not been fully worked out."
"More than a year ago, together with 13 of my Belgian fellow Members in the European Parliament, I signed a petition in La Libre Belgique, asking the 25 Heads of State or Government to go beyond the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol."
"Of the proposals put forward, the one to be given priority was about including emissions from the aviation and maritime transport sectors in the forthcoming climate protection plans."
"That is why I am delighted today with your ambitious vote on the Lucas report, which anticipates a whole battery of measures to combat the environmental impact of aviation including, in particular, the end of the exemption of aviation fuel from VAT."
"The current situation is worrying."
"Aviation emissions cancel out a quarter of the modest results obtained in the fight against greenhouse gases."
"Let me be clear."
"It is not a question of imposing taxes indiscriminately but of bringing to an end an imbalance that does not sufficiently encourage the aviation sector to invest in the new technologies, with the environment being the first to suffer."
"Global warming is the major challenge of the 21st century, and Europe must, emphatically, continue to set an example."
". I agree with the general thrust of this report, but believe that there are still considerable problems with the result of today’s vote: firstly, that the impact of the suggestions is largely uncosted and has a disproportionate impact; secondly, that the Emissions Trading Scheme should include air transport but that there should not be a separate scheme which runs by its side."
"This would undermine the current ETS."
"Some of this report contradicted the very workable proposals of the Commission and as such made little sense."
"Although the objective of reducing the climate change impact of aviation, notably by reducing CO2 emissions, is much to be commended, I think it vital for our Parliament to take account of the situation of the most remote regions of the EU."
"If removing the aviation industry’s exemption from VAT and introducing a tax on kerosene were to become real options, the effect on the economies of the most isolated regions, as well as on the mobility of their populations, would be disastrous."
"That would be true, in particular, for island regions, which have neither road nor rail links with the rest of the EU, and even more so for the outermost regions, in which people depend exclusively on air transport in order to get about."
"I would thank Members of the European Parliament for having adopted my amendment asking that Community legislation give particular attention to the most isolated territories that are heavily dependent on air transport and, in particular, the islands and outermost regions, where the alternatives to air transport are either extremely limited or, indeed, totally non-existent."
". I fully support action to combat the climate change impact of aviation emissions in the Emissions Trading Scheme and ask the Commission to come forward with workable proposals."
"I abstained on some paragraphs in this report that were contradictory or whose implications have not been fully costed or worked out."
"I voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague, Mrs Korhola, on the compromise reached with the European Council on the draft regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council in the field of information, public participation and access to justice in environmental matters."
"I am pleased that wisdom has been applied to this difficult issue, the legal complexity of which has greatly delayed its political adoption."
"The transparency achieved for programmes funded by the European Investment Bank is excellent."
"The role of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) has quite rightly been defined in this measure by referring to ‘responsible’ NGOs."
"The compromise achieved by Parliament’s delegation led by Mr Vidal-Quadras is fundamentally satisfactory and well balanced."
"Adoption at third reading is, in the end, a success for the European Parliament."
"The next item is the Commission statement on the economic and social consequences of business restructuring in Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, record profits on the one hand, plant closures and relocations on the other."
"Many people in the EU nowadays ask themselves the same vexed question every day: when will it hit me?"
"When will my job be on the line? When will it be my turn?"
"In the transformation process in Central and Eastern Europe alone, entire economies have collapsed, and millions of jobs have gone."
"People have understood this, however, because it was the result of Communist mismanagement."
"Yet many are unable to understand what is happening in many industries in the older EU Member States: textiles, shoes, furniture, household appliances, pharmaceuticals and cars – manufacturing industries that have always been considered secure – are hitting the skids."
"Very few people have been prepared for this structural change we are witnessing."
"It is therefore high time to help the many people who have lost their bearings to reorientate themselves."
"The significance of today's discussion extends far beyond the possible closure of a car-manufacturing plant in Portugal."
"It is a discussion about the future of employment in Europe."
"The time has also come to spell out a few home truths."
"Firstly, we have entered a new phase of competition, and the pace of structural change is set to quicken still further."
"We must not close our eyes to that."
"Competition is a fact of life, whether we like it or not."
"Nor is it a question of whether we can survive competition intact."
"The great social question of our time is how many people's prospects will be ruined by this competition; to put it another way, the great social issue of our time is the future of our jobs."
"It is time we faced up to that question."
"Whoever still believes that other issues take precedence is out of touch with the world of today and its challenges."
"We need more sustainable, environmentally safe growth, and we need more and better jobs, otherwise the social face of Europe will turn cold and cynical, which would be an affront to our European principles of shared responsibility between the individual and society, of solidarity, social justice and social cohesion."
"The key word for a European society of the 21st century that seeks to offer its people new prospects is ‘competitiveness’."
"We are all well aware that Fortress Portugal, Fortress Germany, Fortress Poland or Fortress Europe is not an option in the open world of the 21st century."
"We must embrace open competition; we must capture the high ground and draw competition upwards in search of the best solutions, the best technology and the highest standards."
"Secondly, we have launched a common European policy for growth and employment."
"This policy must now be vigorously pursued in Europe, nationally and regionally, otherwise we shall be gazing time and again in dismay at one breach after the other in our social model in the form of closed factories and research laboratories that have relocated overseas – which has already been happening."
"I would warn anyone against the notion that we can easily put up with production facilities moving away because we still have research and development."
"Once production has gone, research and development will follow."
"A policy for growth and employment must be a policy that creates a favourable business climate for all companies."
"It is in business, in companies, that jobs are created, and it is companies that axe jobs too."
"No edict from the government of a Member State or from the EU as a whole can change that in the slightest."
"We can however pursue a policy that creates external conditions which make it possible and attractive for companies to do their work, to expand, to invest and to create jobs in Europe."
"That is the meaning of the term ‘business-friendly policy’."
"Thirdly, an active industrial policy that keeps industry in Europe is more essential than ever before."
"The illusion that industry can now be consigned to museums is just as false as the notion that industry is first and foremost the world’s chief polluter."
"I advise anyone who still thinks in these terms to think again."
"Those who would drive industry out of Europe are playing with the futures of the people who work in industry, the futures of the people who work in industry-related services – sectors that employ not only millions of people but many tens of millions – and the futures of the small and medium-sized enterprises all the way up the supply chain; in short, they are playing with the future of Europe itself."
"We need to maintain a strong industrial sector in Europe with companies that perform in the global marketplace."
"We are not simply looking for European champions; we need leaders in the world market, for our firms are effectively competing in a global arena."
"No government can make them successful; that is down to the companies’ own efforts."
"We can, however, back them to the hilt."
"This was the task of the High-Level Group CARS 21."
"Twelve million jobs in the European Union are linked directly or indirectly with vehicle manufacturing."
"We have spoken to all the stakeholders about what can and must be done to maintain a strong automotive industry in Europe."
"I hope Parliament will understand why, on the issue of future exhaust-emission standards, I argue against a policy of ‘head down and charge’ and in favour of formulating proposals that we can put on the table when the time comes, secure in the knowledge that our high standards are technologically feasible and that they will also be affordable for most people."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are already able to build a car with zero emissions today, but there is nobody I know personally who could afford such a car, and I imagine no one in this Parliament could afford one either."
"We must do our bit to ensure that it remains possible to manufacture and sell European cars – not for the sake of the cars, not even for the sake of those who buy and drive them but for the sake of the people who need those jobs."
"Another thing is that an active industrial policy does not stop at the borders of the old European Union but encompasses the new Member States too."
"Enlargement is not the curse of the European labour force, nor is it the cause of structural change."
"The truth is that, in 17 out of 20 industries, the old EU has a huge advantage; only in three industries do the new Member States now have a competitive edge."
"One of these, indeed, is the car industry."
"That, however, will only help us when China and other newly developed countries become more powerful competitors in the automotive market."
"As for the automotive industry itself – which, of course, was the trigger for this debate – I wish to express my firm conviction that we shall keep our car industry in Europe in the long term, and it will be strong, but it will look rather different in ten years’ time than it looks today."
"There will be consolidations."
"You need only read today’s newspapers to learn of transatlantic talks on that very subject."
"What we can predict with some degree of certainty is a mixed picture – one picture for Western Europe and another for Central and Eastern Europe."
"We shall no longer see any significant growth in vehicle output in Western Europe."
"There will only be a slight increase in demand."
"Productivity is likely to grow faster than demand, and anyone with any knowledge of economics knows what that means: it means that the pressure on car-manufacturing jobs in the older Member States will become even greater."
"As far as we know, the major European manufacturers – and the same applies to General Motors – have no plans to shift any of their production capacity out of Western Europe."
"They will, however – and this is the salient point – establish new production facilities where demand for their products is greatest."
"This trend is already clearly observable throughout the entire European car industry."
"On the plus side, however, we see that not only European manufacturers but those from other parts of the world too are starting to concentrate research and development capacities in Europe once more, especially in the old locations. In this respect too, the European operations of General Motors are no exception."
"Enterprises, ladies and gentlemen, bear a great social responsibility for Europe, and that must become apparent across the board."
"I am not one to criticise every corporate relocation decision out of hand, nor am I entitled to do so."
"Besides, it would be foolish to do so, for the globalisation of production and research is unavoidable if a company is to succeed in the long term in a competitive industry."
"I do, however, criticise those who put short-term profit before sustainable solutions."
"I criticise those who, when they come under pressure, choose to cut and run as the cheapest option, with no regard for the people they put out on the street."
"I criticise those who pay themselves huge salaries but are not worth a penny as responsible managers, because they have driven their company to the wall and squandered the jobs it once provided."
"I want to see companies in Europe that are constantly striving upwards, that take innovation to new levels, that can alter their profile, that train their staff to cope with new tasks too."
"We, of course, have a duty to help them in all of this."
"Yet we must also point out the limits of political action."
"Corporate decisions to close or relocate plants are decisions taken by companies, and no government and no European Union can overrule them, whether in the case of Azambuja or in any other case."
"We do, however, have some very clear rules, and we must insist vigorously on their observance."
"These include the key issue of dialogue between management and labour, for example."
"When a plant is to be closed or relocated, this dialogue must include the following question: what has the company done to give its redundant employees a new future, for example in terms of training, further education and industrial retraining?"
"From this follows another question: what have we done to help it?"
"We also have the instrument of aid for companies in difficulty, which was also used in the Azambuja case."
"Aid awards were authorised in 2002."
"The plant’s difficulties, in other words, are not entirely new."
"Let me make it very clear, however, that the payments of state aid which were authorised in that case and which took the form of investment support from the Portuguese budget were granted under European rules, which stipulate that the beneficiary company must remain at its location for at least five years after making the investment for which it has received support."
"At the request of the Commission, the Portuguese Government is currently investigating whether the plant also received money from European funds."
"If it did, this would be another point on which we should have to insist on strict fulfilment of our conditions, and I can promise you that the Commission will do that."
"European tax revenue is meant to be used to stabilise plants in European locations, not to axe jobs."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the current process of industrial restructuring is largely the result of globalisation."
"The first remark one is led to make is that this new era has helped to reduce poverty around the world."
"It is worthwhile continuing to promote the free movement of goods, commodities and persons, if only in terms of economic growth, which many countries around the world are enjoying in a sustainable way."
"Let us not, however, make the market a sacred cow; although the values that guide our political action acknowledge many of the virtues of the laws of the market, we also understand that the political authorities have a vital role in the regulation and functioning of that market."
"This is a role that the EU and Parliament must not neglect."
"In the draft report on the European social model to be debated here in September, we will urge the EU to adopt an attitude towards third countries with high economic growth that promotes democracy, freedom, respect for human rights, environmental protection, social justice and regulation of the labour market."
"It will be Europe's responsibility, in our view, to play a key role in striking a balance between economic growth and the search for decent social and environmental standards in the emerging world powers."
"If such guidelines are to prevail externally, the biggest concern internally will have to be the focus on increased competitiveness."
"In this regard, I wish to welcome the Commissioner's remarks here today."
"The next steps are contained in the Lisbon Strategy."
"As regards the manner in which to proceed, I should like to reiterate that I still believe that it would be a very good idea to strengthen the Commission's role in implementing this strategy."
"Although globalisation can be seen as an opportunity for European business, the same process, as the Commission has said in this Chamber, also entails risks within the European area."
"One of these risks is the possible disappearance from the industrial map of regions and sectors whose economic base is manufacturing."
"I therefore believe that there needs to be intervention at European level in the definition and execution of public policies that promote regional and social cohesion, with a view to preventing the phenomenon of exclusion."
"This is an extremely important point, because if we want to win over the citizens as regards the European project we cannot allow feelings of loss of hope and confidence to take root in certain regions outside the main population centres."
"I therefore warmly welcome the Commission’s initiative on setting up the Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"Businesses, just like people, are born, they grow and they die."
"The important thing as far as employment growth is concerned is that the birth rate of business should always be higher than the death rate."
"As regards the role of the EU and its institutions, I feel that they should not support political initiatives aimed at keeping alive industries or factories that are untenable in the medium term."
"That would not be the right path to follow; rather it would be something of a false dawn that would feed meaningless illusions."
"The right way forward, on the other hand, should be based on the competitiveness of the European economy, which depends on balanced public accounts, effective education and training systems, justice that works promptly, competitive tax systems, greater flexibility in the labour market and major incentives for research."
"Without competitive economies there is no investment."
"Without investment there is no employment or social justice."
"Parliament should be channelling its efforts into discussing and defining policy instruments that could help increase competitiveness and regional and social cohesion in the EU."
"We naturally support all initiatives aimed at monitoring the use of public funds by private companies and we feel that this kind of support should be associated with medium-term objectives on employment and regional development."
"I believe that it is not Parliament’s job to make judgments on individual cases, which seems to have been at the root of this debate."
"In this regard, I should like to conclude by encouraging dialogue between the parties involved, with a view to achieving the best possible solution that, according to the latest information I have, could satisfy everyone."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful to the Commissioner for his remarks."
"They went straight to the heart of the debate that we must conduct on the future of European industry."
"Azambuja is an individual case, but it represents many others."
"It is symptomatic of a wrong choice of course in European industrial policy."
"There is no disputing that we must remain competitive and that rationalisations are part of this effort, that productivity growth is necessary and that, if higher productivity leads to job losses in one company, these must be counteracted by the creation of new jobs elsewhere or in the same region through innovative investments."
"That goes without saying, and we must make targeted investments to ensure that it happens."
"What our policies must not and cannot condone, however, and what we Socialists in Europe will fight, is the brutality with which multinational giants deal with the lives of human beings."
"In the course of my political career, as the mayor of a German town, I experienced the cold, calculating way in which companies played off national, regional and municipal administrations against each other when it came to investing in locations."
"The imagination of company boards is boundless when it comes to obtaining public investment support as a location incentive."
"This is matched only by their complete lack of imagination when it comes to shouldering their social responsibility in times of crisis."
"This is precisely what we are now observing on the part of General Motors."
"I am grateful to you for what you have told us."
"You will check whether European funds went to that factory; if they did, the company must stay at its Portuguese location."
"That is good news."
"But what happens then in Portugal?"
"It will be the same scenario we witnessed only a few months ago when the Swedish workforce was played off against the German workforce of the same combine."
"Whoever lowers welfare standards furthest, whoever allows the lowest wages, wins the day."
"Fewer social rights and less pay is the basic criterion for location decisions."
"This is a form of capitalism that the people of Europe do not want, and we must fight it."
"If, as in my country, a company – not a car manufacturer in this case but Allianz financial services – makes a profit of EUR 4.4 billion, then decides to sack 8 000 highly qualified staff to maximise its shareholders’ returns, that is not only immoral – I cannot expect morality of a capitalist, nor do I – but also socially irresponsible."
"We must consider how we can use national and European legislation to curb that kind of corporate policy."
"In the case of large groups of companies with global operations, these are, of course, corporate decisions taken by the group, and we have no influence over them."
"But the impact of these corporate decisions affects the whole of society."
"For this reason, we believe that the application of democratic principles to such decisions is part and parcel of economic democracy."
"Hedge funds buy up companies as assets nowadays."
"We live in an economic world in which major funds buy large companies, de-list them as quickly as possible in order to reorganise them as quickly as possible and sell them on at a profit as quickly as possible."
"The company, its location and the entire region are thus reduced to commercial goods."
"That cannot be the economic future of Europe!"
"Accordingly, the way in which the European economy is restructured will determine the future social cohesion of Europe."
"In the second half of the 20th century, the idea behind the European Union, the idea behind the single market in which we live today, was that economic and technological progress should go hand in hand with social progress."
"We have reached a stage today in which maximisation of profits goes hand in hand with diminishing social security."
"If we do not halt this trend and return to what we did successfully in the second half of the 20th century, namely combining economic growth with social security, we shall forfeit the social stability of our European societies – and social instability is always at the root of political instability, which leads in turn to a loss of security."
"For this reason, the restructuring of companies in Europe is a challenge to which we must respond on the social level."
"."
"Mr President, the feelings of those who lose their jobs need no explanation."
"It does not take much imagination to understand the hopelessness, the fear of the future and the financial worries they go through, day after day."
"In that, Parliament stands united: across the political parties, across the European countries there is support for the European social model and the support of the workers and the unemployed."
"When it comes to what concretely should be done, our opinions differ greatly."
"I firmly believe it is a serious mistake to try to protect jobs by preventing modernisation, restructuring and globalisation."
"It may be good for today, but it is disastrous for tomorrow."
"Our answer to globalisation must not be evasion and conservatism but to embrace it and prepare our citizens for it."
"It must not stop restructuring from happening but make the transition for those affected easier."
"That is the starting point for the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats in Parliament when addressing the challenges presented to us by industrial restructuring and globalisation."
"We believe that the European Union can and should play a role, but one of facilitating transition rather than one of obstruction."
"We are not against change."
"We are for change."
"Otherwise, in ten years we will have all our jobs in China or other nice regions outside Europe."
"We are for cooperation, education and economic growth, but they should be brought about with social and environmental responsibility."
"That is our task in Parliament."
"There are a number of issues where we need European politics, not only to keep but to create new jobs all over the Union."
"At the very heart of that we find the Lisbon Agenda."
"First and foremost it is about strengthening the individual."
"Europe can help by encouraging and funding programmes for lifelong learning, language skills and cultural exchange, to mention a few examples."
"They help prepare for a labour market in transition where few jobs can be guaranteed for life."
"There are no jobs for life anymore but there could well be work for life."
"Secondly, it is about strengthening European industry to be competitive in the 21st century."
"By giving access to an even greater internal market supporting European research and innovation, we open new opportunities that will eventually create new jobs."
"Thirdly, to accomplish that, we need strengthened social dialogue addressing issues of change such as the need for companies to facilitate transition for those losing their jobs, and environmental rules for sustainable economic development."
"It has a lot to do with European leadership, about explaining the challenges we are facing and about doing what we can to facilitate the journey into the future by preparing individuals and businesses; but not about making false promises, protecting jobs and hoping for short-term political gains."
"That is the Liberal answer to the challenges of globalisation and industrial reform."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I have listened to you carefully."
"I have also read in the press agencies that the Commission declared that the restructuring and relocation process carried out by Opel was considered to be above-board and was in keeping with the rules of the various European funds."
"I actually believe, and your intention was clear, that there is not really much point in Parliament and some of our fellow Members repeatedly criticising, month after month, global capitalism or total capitalism: we live in a world in which competition is becoming tougher and tougher and in which the future of the car industry is undoubtedly determined more by Renault-Nissan-GM alliances such as those announced, than by processes about which we are speaking today."
"That being said, if we do want to have a role, I, for my part, should like it if you were able to respond, as Commissioner and as the person responsible for these issues at the Commission, to four precise questions:"
"Question one: we have always championed the idea of the European Works Council and industrial relations observatories when it comes to anticipating this kind of change."
"We, in this House, wanted arrangements of the European Works Council kind to be strengthened."
"Do you not believe, from this perspective, that initiatives are steps for the Commission to take with a view to strengthening this legislation?"
"Question two: the Barroso Commission has proposed an adjustment fund for cases of globalisation-related restructuring – I am not sure whether the Opel case is included in this – but what exactly is this fund about?"
"Can you assure us that, during a transition period, this fund will really help workers that are penalised by this type of process to rebuild their careers thanks to training schemes?"
"Question three: you rightly referred to the CARS 21 programme and to the Commission’s focus on research and development programmes and on the cars of the future."
"Supposing that people believe - which I do not – that private cars are a means of sustainable development for the 21st century, particularly for our European cities, it is all the same astounding to note, when we know that environmentally-friendly cars will have to have a hybrid engine, like the Toyota Prius model, for the next 25 years, that European manufacturers are still lagging behind in this area."
"What is your assessment of the research and development programmes in this area and of the marketing of this type of product?"
"My fourth and final point: it is quite clear – and the Opel example is obviously shocking from this point of view – that we are witnessing competition between neighbouring territories: Portugal and Spain."
"Do you not believe that, while respecting the competition rules, it is the duty of the Commission and of the European Union to impose common minimum rules on businesses operating on EU soil, and, while I am not saying that it would be a perfect solution, I am specifically thinking of company tax harmonisation?"
"There you have four forms of action that the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties and promoter of the European general interest, ought to encourage."
"In that regard, I regret to tell you, Commissioner, that we still do not find your Commission either proactive enough or ambitious enough on the various points that I have just mentioned."
". – This debate is vitally important, but it will be even more so if it yields measures to ensure that it is not always the workers and the people who have to bear the brunt of restructuring and relocation of businesses and large economic groups with profits in the millions, as has happened in Portugal."
"At this time, workers from Opel Portugal, part of the General Motors group – and we salute those workers via their delegation here in this Chamber – are going through terrible anguish, as they follow this debate with great interest and hope that they receive from Parliament and the Commission the kind of solidarity that they have had from General Motors workers from EU countries such as Sweden, Germany and Spain, whose futures are also under threat."
"Whilst news appears in the media about talks between businesses in the car industry involving General Motors and others, the Opel Portugal workers, their families and the people and local and regional authorities of the Azambuja region and surrounding areas are living under the threat of unemployment and hindered development that may lead to closure."
"This situation is all the more dramatic given that we are talking about a country in which unemployment and poverty are on the rise."
"Mr Silva Peneda’s remarks are therefore all the more appallingly insensitive."
"Much more attention needs to be paid to industrial mergers and restructuring."
"Community aid must be contingent on long-term agreements on employment and local development."
"Priority must be attached to protecting the workers whenever manufacturing companies are restructured, including complete guarantees that the workers will be fully informed, will be fully involved and will have a decisive influence throughout the process."
"We know that there are alternatives to closing down Opel Portugal."
"We know that with the political will, the company can continue to function as normal. It is a company that has the conditions in place for productivity and in which undertakings have been made that the workers have observed."
"General Motors must keep its side of the bargain and the Commission must take the measures needed to ensure that Opel Portugal functions as normal and that employment with rights is guaranteed."
"."
"Mr President, the restructuring of firms in Europe is due to an increase in manufacturing capacity, the implementation of new technology and the globalisation of the whole economy."
"This process has serious social and economic consequences."
"Production becomes concentrated in economically and technologically stronger regions, at the cost of less developed regions."
"This is particularly visible in the new Member States where whole sectors of industry have disappeared."
"In Poland, for example, light industry and, to a significant extent, the car manufacturing, electronics and mining sectors have disappeared, and with them jobs."
"The progressive globalisation of production and the liberalisation of markets have resulted in a further deepening of economic and social divides."
"Regions which have high levels of agricultural production and a developed network of agricultural and food industries such as sugar, fruit and vegetables and refrigeration in particular, lose out the most."
"Poland is again one of the countries that have suffered most and is located in one of the worst affected regions."
"So who benefits?"
"The ‘old’ Member States and economically powerful industrial regions benefit and will continue to benefit, especially as the European Union is directing most of its efforts towards achieving profits from trade with third countries in manufactured articles, which make up 85% of turnover in goods."
"Agricultural products only make up 15% of turnover."
"This begs the fundamental question: what relation does the policy of the EU authorities in the field of enterprise bear to the basic principles of the European Union, such as European solidarity, equal opportunities, sustainable development or human rights?"
"Mr President, may I start by thanking the Commissioner for his wise and thoughtful comments in introducing this debate and, in particular, for putting the main emphasis on people, because that is central to the subject we are discussing."
"I should just like to highlight two of the important points that he made."
"One was about structural change."
"I totally agree that structural change is here to stay and indeed it will accelerate."
"So the issue is not how we stop it, but how we harness and manage it."
"The second important point to highlight is that the answer is not protectionism, either by countries trying to put up barriers or within companies trying to protect old jobs when the market has moved on."
"I agree with Mrs Ek that nowadays people might not have a job for life any more, but I think people still have a right to expect that they can have a life with a job."
"The question, therefore, is what can be done to help and what should not be done."
"I believe that, as MEPs, we should not have this kind of debate every time a major company closes or downsizes, so that we politicians can show that we care – even though of course we do – and can be ‘seen to be doing something’ in each individual case, highlighting named individual companies."
"I do not think regular debates on this basis are helpful."
"It should not be about us trying to grab headlines back home."
"What I think we can do, and should do more, is to make sure that we help set a regulatory climate in which entrepreneurship can flourish, so that more new jobs can be created and genuinely; as one door has to close, other doors can be encouraged to open."
"I also believe that the greatest form of job security any individual can have is in the skill set they can develop, and that is where our priorities should lie."
"We have to make sure that, when people talk about investment, companies recognise that their investment in people is the most important investment they can make."
"Investment in people by countries is also the most important investment that countries can make."
"If we get that right, we will go a long way towards managing the challenge of change."
"Mr President, my focus, and that of my contribution, will be on the main aspects of restructuring."
"However, I would like to say that I support the Portuguese workers in their efforts to retain and develop their employment."
"I also know from past experience that, as Mr Schulz has mentioned, GM has not always been good at conducting social dialogue, an example being its relations with its factories in Germany and Sweden, when it played the workers in the different countries off against each other."
"That is not a way of behaving that I am fond of."
"I share the view that restructuring is not new."
"Rather, it is something we have always lived with."
"In my home town there was once a rubber factory, but it is no longer there."
"In its day, nearly everyone in the town worked there."
"There will continue to be restructuring in the future as well."
"In some cases, restructuring is badly handled."
"This leads to job losses, and the region in question is hit hard."
"There are, however, also successful examples of restructuring where new jobs have been created and regions have been able to survive and even progress, with longer-term employment."
"So, what is the secret?"
"Well, there are a few key factors. They are social responsibility, participation and a long-term approach."
"Firstly, then, the long-term approach."
"I do not have a high regard for companies that do not themselves have some form of long-term plan of how they are to tackle global competition successfully and that only take subsidies in the short term before then leaving the region in question."
"In addition, participation is needed, by which I mean participation by the most important asset that companies have, namely their staff."
"Employees are companies’ most important resource and should not merely be given information and consulted when changes are being made."
"Employees should be a part of the restructuring process. They should be able to be involved with it and influence it."
"That way, there is no need to go out on the streets and demonstrate."
"That way, new jobs can be created."
"There is also a need to demonstrate social responsibility from very early on and to train staff so as to be able to meet the long-term challenges of the future and for the regions, as it is often companies that play a large role in regions where there is a need to demonstrate social responsibility."
"As far as the automotive industry is concerned, it is an industry that has become increasingly globalised and that consists of an ever decreasing number of companies."
"Restructuring will be needed."
"There are a number of things that we can do at the European level."
"We can, as Mr Jonckheer said, strengthen works councils and the directives concerning these."
"We can work on information and consultation."
"I believe that we need framework agreements between industries and trade unions at the European level in order to be able to manage the changes that will come in the future."
"This will be increasingly important."
"Restructuring is something that we have to live with, but it can be made a success if employees are allowed to participate actively and if the companies involved demonstrate social responsibility."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is worth pointing out that we are talking about real people, who are also listening to us and who therefore require practical responses."
"A year ago, I took the floor in Parliament to talk about the iron and steel industry and about Terni, an Italian city that was witnessing its own livelihood being threatened by the operations of a multinational."
"The opinions expressed by this Parliament were very useful."
"Today, I must come back to this subject by talking about another factory, the Eaton factory, in Piedmont: here, too, the workers are at risk because of the behaviour of a multinational;"
"I should also like to mention Getronix, and others, as we have heard, have talked about Opel."
"In all of these cases, as in the case of Terni, we can and must help."
"We must also intervene so as to prevent all of this from happening again, that is to say, to prevent multinationals – which, I might add, garner profits and even enjoy public funds, including European ones – from using Europe by directly pitting one country against another country, workers against other workers."
"We must decide that dumping and relocations need to be combated with specific rules, because they have nothing to do with competition and the market, but actually undermine social cohesion and burden us all with unbearable costs."
"In order to combat them, practical responses are required: one of which is to genuinely strengthen European works councils."
"Granting more powers to workers and trade unions will also help us to build up an idea of what kind of development Europe must have."
"Some people regard this speculative market as reliable, believing that there might eventually be a positive net outcome in terms of employment, which in fact there is not;"
"I believe that politics must deal with what needs to be produced in this Europe and that we must therefore take action in this field too."
"I believe that those who want to integrate Europe must recognise that the unity, rather than the division, of European workers is a vital asset when it comes to building this united Europe and that it is therefore not dumping, but the upwards harmonisation of rules and rights, that represents a firm commitment for this Parliament."
"Mr President, it is no coincidence that my colleague, Mr Bushill-Matthews, and myself have asked to speak in this debate."
"We come from the West Midlands region of the United Kingdom, a region that has historically been very dependent on the car industry, which has been through many cycles of plant closures and change."
"The other day I went to speak at a school in Coventry and I said to the children: ‘You know where that Blockbuster video store and that supermarket are?"
"In the 1980s I worked in a car factory there that employed 20 000 people’."
"There is nothing new about this."
"We are treating it as if it were new."
"Investment will create jobs and deliver the solution to the problems that many colleagues on this side have talked about: investment in new cars, investment in new factories, investment in robots that will cut the cost of production, and investment in quality."
"I ask Mr Schulz where that investment is going to come from."
"It is going to come from profits."
"What the car industry is short of is not bleeding hearts; it needs more profits to invest in those new products."
"That is going on in the successful companies."
"Another factory I worked in during my 30 years in the industry – the Oxford plant of what was the British Motor Corporation – is now one of the most successful car plants in England, which produces the Mini."
"You see them all over the place, you see them in America."
"BMW – the owners of that plant, a German company – is investing GBP 250 million to make a new car there and we thank BMW for that."
"It is going to create another thousand jobs."
"An engine that was made in Brazil is now going to be made in Birmingham, in my constituency."
"I say to my friends in Portugal – and many of them will be speaking shortly about these issues: come and talk to those of us who have lived through that problem before."
"One of the saddest days of my life was when I went to the Longbridge car plant to meet the receiver of that plant, which had gone bankrupt."
"I started work there in 1967 when it employed 25 000 people, and now I walked into an empty factory."
"That is the reality of industrial life."
"It has been there for a long time."
"The issue is how we deal with it."
"We need better employment, we need full employment, we need retraining, and we need to help people who are made redundant to get new employment."
"If something cannot be saved, we have the responses to it."
"We have been involved at Longbridge, where 5000 people were made redundant."
"We are working at Peugeot at the moment and in other areas."
"Come and talk to us about the practical things that we are doing and stop complaining in this Chamber about the problems."
"We have all been through them every day."
"Let us not have another debate like this."
"Let us think about a positive way forward."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am tempted to go back over Mr Harbour’s remarks."
"While he has experienced redundancies and restructuring, I myself have been made redundant three times due to economic developments and restructuring in the Nord Pas-de-Calais, in France."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament is in favour of a policy enabling businesses to create jobs, to modernise and to promote economic development."
"Yet, when it talks about economic development, the PSE Group is also talking about social support, with a view to creating wealth, but to redistributing it too."
"Europe must demonstrate its European social model."
"That is the reason why we have worked collectively and why more than 80% of us voted in favour of a report on restructuring and employment, in which we state that we certainly need to provide for a form of support, but that we also need to enlighten Europe about what we are and about what we do."
"We voted in favour, by a very large majority, in an effort to say that, if Europe provides economic aid and public money and if it becomes clear at any given time that a form of ‘subsidised tourism' exists, then that money must be reimbursed."
"General Motors, where last year more than 500 000 employees were affected by restructuring, is one such example that is of concern to us today."
"We are not complaining, but we do believe that everyone must be respected, and employees in particular."
"Restructuring is necessary in order to keep our businesses economically competitive."
"It still has many consequences for all that."
"In the case of General Motors today, as in many cases of restructuring, Europeans are awaiting a strong response from the Union."
"Mr Barroso gave us this response by calling on the new Finnish Presidency to embody the Europe of results."
"Well, the Europe of results starts here, in this Chamber, with a strong signal sent out to the employees who are currently in difficulties."
"Support measures must of course be taken, concerning training and aid, but we must ask ourselves as from today how the public money that has been distributed will be paid back."
"Mr President, Commissioner, plant closures like this one in Portugal are not isolated cases."
"In 2005, more than half a million jobs were lost in the European Union through restructuring measures."
"Quoted companies, in whatever country they are based, are registering all-time record profits."
"Sales are going through the roof, and workforces are being drastically pruned."
"Over the last three years, the productivity of companies featuring in the German share index DAX has risen by an average of 6.5%."
"Surely that means they are competitive!"
"When we discuss what to do, we must ask whether the basis on which we grant aid is the right one."
"I shall make you a few proposals, most of which have not yet been given any consideration."
"Is it not safe to assume that aid is primarily awarded for innovative products and processes, for new research and development rather than for plant and equipment?"
"I believe this categorisation can be used to restrict aid awards."
"My second question is this: is it wise to limit the recovery to five years?"
"The amortisation period for equipment is usually 10 to 15 years."
"Logically, companies should repay the money for as long as it takes to write off the capital expenditure."
"Thirdly, when it comes to assessing whether or not support should be granted, should we not insist and verify that companies operating globally comply with the guidelines of the World Health Organization, the International Labour Organization and the applicable emission standards in all their locations?"
"Any company that does not would simply be ineligible for aid."
"Fourthly, is it wise to support companies which are not bound by a collective agreement and which trade unions are unable to influence?"
"In such cases, European taxpayers are paying double."
"We fund the companies’ research and development and their expenditure on equipment, and afterwards they make employees redundant, and European taxpayers are supposed to foot the bill for unemployment benefit too."
"That is surely bad economics!"
"One final point: if we intend to pursue a genuine structural and regional policy, a far closer link must be forged between the company’s need for support and the beneficial regional impact of such support."
"– General Motors is making thousands of European workers redundant."
"Last year 9 000 jobs were lost in Germany."
"This year 900 job losses have been announced in the United Kingdom, and more recently the closure of the Azambuja factory in Portugal, which has been in operation for decades and where 1 200 people work, was announced."
"I should like to take this opportunity to greet the representatives from the Azambuja factory who are in the Chamber today and to express our solidarity."
"When we speak about thousands of redundancies, these are not just big numbers, not just statistics, not just percentages, they are human, family tragedies, and I am appalled that some Members of this House have shown a lack of awareness of this situation."
"The closure of the Azambuja factory affects us all as it could be another stepping stone towards the dismantling of other General Motors factories in the EU and the subsequent relocation of those factories to the east – to Russia and to Asia."
"This is why this debate is worthwhile."
"It is a good thing that Mr Schulz took the initiative of scheduling the debate, to give us a chance to obtain some answers."
"Firstly, what can be done to prevent the closure of the Azambuja factory?"
"This debate should also help multinationals to realise that they cannot simply use and discard; they cannot receive incentives such as Community funding or tax breaks in one Member State and then head off to another in an attempt to obtain further support and more benefits."
"Closing down factories cannot be normal."
"It must be something avoidable and we, and the Commission, must of course do everything possible to ensure that this does not happen again and that the globalisation adjustment fund be implemented when things take a turn for the worse."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the questions posed in the Commissioner’s communication are very important."
"Faced with the changes that have taken place, and that are still taking place, within national and European industry, Europe has the problem of managing industrial restructuring processes, which have an extremely serious effect on workers and on the various regions."
"Mr Harbour was wondering just now what the topic of the future might be. This is my answer: ‘The topic of the future is how to manage these processes’."
"There are many cases nowadays in relation to which problems are arising, problems that go by the name of relocation, non-compliance with trade union agreements, and job losses."
"They range from the case of General Motors to that of so many small and medium-sized enterprises right up to what is taking place, for example, in the Eaton factory, in Piedmont, a business in which the restructuring process and the failure to comply with trade union agreements are seriously threatening jobs."
"In order to deal with this, we need to adopt a firm, Europe-wide stance, involving the effective management of these processes, and this will also increase the consistency of the Lisbon objectives themselves and the social dialogue itself, which is regarded as one of the pillars of this strategy."
"I therefore call for a common position to be adopted in order to give strength and substance to the very action of the European institutions, beginning with Parliament, in this field."
"I should like to highlight one final aspect: it now seems entirely clear that the issue of restructuring requires a review of the Community instruments available."
"Here is just one example – and I should like to hear the Commissioner’s opinion on the matter – if we really want to manage these processes, then we cannot avoid the need to strengthen and reform European works councils."
"We need to update the directive if we want to meet the new requirements in this regard."
"I hope that Parliament as a whole and the Commission can adopt a common position on this."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Azambuja situation is alarming."
"Thousands of workers, some of whom are here in the Chamber today, are under threat of redundancy."
"This applies to thousands of support businesses and workers’ families in Azambuja and neighbouring areas, as well as to the General Motors workers themselves."
"I recently met with the Portuguese Workers' Commission, the Mayor and with my fellow MEP Mrs Madeira, but I should like to say at this point that the issue has a broader, European-level scope."
"We know that General Motors has had strategic difficulties and that it has called for Renault Nissan to step in and help with the management. This does not, however, exempt the company from their responsibilities."
"The resolution that we have tabled confronts General Motors with its European responsibilities, and states very clearly what is happening in Azambuja."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, strategic changes and business restructuring must take into account the fact that workers are human beings and not just factors of production."
"The EU needs to have a clear strategy, a more appropriate means of dealing with such problems if it wants to have a European social model that functions properly."
"The resolution that we tabled is a step in that direction."
"– The situation to which previous speakers have alluded is very real for the workers of General Motors in Portugal. It is also, unfortunately a familiar story in recent times in the EU, as has been mentioned in this Chamber before."
"Businesses receive Community and State aid and incentives to set up in a given region and country, and then relocate, flying in the face of the rules of conduct in place, without any compunction or respect for the hundreds or thousands of workers, and often whole families, who are laid off at the drop of a hat."
"The easy quest for maximum profits and the phenomenon of globalisation cannot justify the economic and social tragedy of the weakest links in the business chain."
"Commissioner, the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, adopted at the December European Council, has neither the remit nor the capacity to prevent all of the situations that have arisen in Europe. This is an international fund geared towards a small number of redundancies and countries on account of the changes happening in world trade."
"More needs to be done."
"For this to happen, the EU must define clearly the plan of action that should be pursued by manufacturing companies in Europe and those businesses seeking to reach this market of 455 million consumers with their products."
"In order for us to be in a position to set an example to the world, we have to begin to demand compliance with the European social model and respect for human rights, and to do this differently."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me make two more brief remarks."
"With regard to the individual case that has featured so prominently in the contributions to this debate, namely Azambuja, the allegation that the company is making enormous profits on the backs of its workforce and the European taxpayer would be rather hard to substantiate, for the days when General Motors recorded profits are long past, both in Europe and in other parts of the world."
"If I remember rightly, the last annual loss amounted to ten billion dollars, which is not by any means chicken feed."
"This case therefore needs to be assessed rather differently from those that Mr Schulz, for example, had in mind when he referred to certain forms of modern capitalism which do indeed have socially damaging effects, as no reasonable person can deny."
"Secondly, there is clearly agreement in this Parliament that structural change is inevitable, and there is also agreement here that it must not be meekly accepted like sunshine or rain but that something can be done when structural change occurs – and indeed something must be done, because people’s well-being is at stake."
"The vital thing that a modern economic policy can do now is to shape structural change in such a way that people are not left by the wayside as its victims."
"That is precisely the aim of our policy."
"A number of very interesting proposals have been made here."
"I should like to focus on at least one of them and strongly emphasise that I, too, am firmly convinced that the reinforcement of employees’ rights in Europe would make it possible to shape structural change in a more beneficial manner."
"In accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received five motions for resolutions(1) at the end of the debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A6–0204/2006) by Mrs del Castillo Vera, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on Implementing the Community Lisbon Programme: More Research and Innovation – Investing for Growth and Employment: A Common Approach (2006/2005(INI))."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the report to be debated next is very closely related to what has just been debated."
"Until now we have been debating the consequences of essentially industrial restructuring for the European economies and, in particular, for workers."
"The report we are going to debate next relates to those measures, approaches or policies that may have a positive effect in terms of resolving the employment situations faced by workers belonging to industries that close or relocate."
"The report that we are going to debate now relates to the factor that is fundamental to any possible solution to these situations and that has a decisive effect on the development of the European economies and hence the European societies' prospects for progress: it is simply the concept of innovation."
"Innovation is the key word; innovation is the concept that could offer us a possible solution to the problems that were being discussed in the last debate and others or, alternatively, take us further away from that solution."
"Within that context and within the broader perspective of revitalising the Lisbon Agenda, the Commission presented a report that was intended to integrate a whole series of decisions that had been taking place since 2000 and until recently, which relate to innovation and which propose a series of measures for improving innovation in the European economies."
"I would like to comment on three essential aspects which are dealt with in my report."
"Firstly, education and training – and I would add mindset, since there is a huge problem here in terms of attitudes to dealing with innovation."
"Secondly, organisation, with a view to ensuring that innovation takes place more effectively. And thirdly, funding."
"With regard to education and training, I believe that they are fundamental – as certain Members pointed out during the previous debate."
"Life-long training, flexible training, training that enables people to adapt to the new needs of the market, are absolutely crucial if we want a society in which there are genuine opportunities for everybody at all times of change."
"Furthermore, I believe that there is a fundamental problem of attitude."
"A society that banishes the values of capacity for enterprise, of effort, of being self-demanding and, ultimately, of innovation which is linked to all of those factors will not be able to survive."
"In this regard, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we must be very aware of what we are facing."
"Others are behind us, others have been successful for a long time, but European society, or a large proportion of European society, licks its wounds constantly, it complains constantly, with the paradoxical result that those with the most wounds are the ones that end up in the worst situation."
"It is therefore essential to promote a change of mindset, in order to restore those values that made European societies great societies that strove forward and that were in the vanguard of all of humanity's activities."
"I genuinely believe that this is fundamental and, of all the aspects that we could discuss and which appear in this and in other reports, I would like to focus on this essential dimension: we in the European Parliament, in the Commission and the Council must reach a great agreement, a great pact, in order to ensure that the values of effort, of being self-demanding, of taking action, of enterprise, are instilled in Europeans from their birth and in their training."
"If not, we will be left behind."
"The clock is ticking here as well."
"If we do not move forward, European societies will be left behind, and we will be largely responsible for that."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate runs on seamlessly from the debate that we have just had on the automobile industry as an example of restructuring."
"We all agreed that structural change has been with us since a long way back and will continue to be with us for a long time."
"I also got the impression that most people here in this House were of the opinion that the right answer to structural change is innovation."
"Structural change takes place when a product or a process is no longer modern enough."
"The answer cannot be to take it lying down and to leave it up to others; instead we must face up to this competition through innovation."
"The Commission would like to get to the point at which the capacity and readiness for innovation are understood as a leading political, social and economic principle of the European Union."
"This is not merely a technical exercise; innovation is in fact something that first has to be mentally understood, something that has to be willed."
"This also requires the readiness to accept change."
"We have put innovation at the centre of our strategy for growth and employment for good reason: because a non-protectionist economic order, one that is based on freedom, can only succeed by means of innovation."
"It needs a society that supports and promotes innovation, and it needs a political framework that promotes innovation."
"That is precisely what we are doing, and on two levels."
"We are doing this on the level of the Member States, and it is very important that there is a wide-ranging emphasis on innovation policies and initiatives in the national reform programmes for the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, and that the Commission accords the highest priority to innovation in its reassessment of the Lisbon Strategy this year."
"On the level of the European Union we have recently set out a great number of initiatives, all of them aimed at promoting innovation: from the subsidy rules that as was specifically requested earlier in the debate are specifically directed towards innovation, through to the general financial tools for setting up new and innovative businesses, all the way to means to enhance the use of intellectual property and to develop capacities for research and development."
"We are striving for an innovation policy that forms an integrated whole."
"I am glad to be able to tell you that, at the Commission’s meeting with the Finnish Presidency yesterday in order to prepare the programme for the Presidency in the second half of 2006, innovation was at the top of the agenda, and was treated as the most important theme."
"I am very confident that this Finnish Presidency is especially suited to advancing the theme of innovation, because Finland is a prime example of how an innovation policy that is willed, focused and intelligently carried out can achieve the extensive modernisation of a country, making it competitive on an international level."
"I always think that we should learn from the good examples of others, and in this case we should do just that."
"– Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur and to thank her for including the position of our committee in her report almost as it stood."
"The promotion of technological research and the acquisition of scientific knowledge are the major challenge facing Europe in the 21st century."
"Nonetheless, research, development and innovation are defined as complicated, demanding and costly procedures which require special political, economic and social management."
"Thus, in order to achieve this specific objective, we need, among other things, to implement pioneering decisions and design high-risk investment programmes."
"However, what is mainly needed is the creative mobilisation of communities and the dynamic participation of the workers, both in the production and reproduction of scientific knowledge and in the new potential that it offers."
"This finding could very soon be proven in the following four lines of action:"
"- by constantly upgrading the infrastructure of and action by educational institutes and research centres, given that the driving force behind development is the acquisition of knowledge by man;"
"- by disseminating scientific knowledge in the field of production, by redefining both the infrastructure and workers' skills and qualifications;"
"- by applying a policy to increase jobs and to redistribute income fairly, given that high productivity and poverty result in recession and unemployment;"
"- by fundamentally reducing working times, so that workers can regain their creative spirit and redress the balance lost between work and family life."
"The technological revolution presents two diametrically opposed economic and social prospects: on the one hand, the creative challenge and, on the other hand, the threat of extended inequalities."
"Whether we will produce and use scientific knowledge in a way that highlights once again the Europe of development, knowledge, solidarity and equality will depend on our political choice."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to take my turn in congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs del Castillo Vera, on the work she has just done on this subject that is so important for the future of the Union, and, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, I should like to draw your attention to three points."
"The first point concerns research."
"I should like once again to point out that the Union has fallen behind in implementing the Lisbon Strategy in the area of education and training."
"I did, moreover, stress this point in my report entitled ‘Education as the cornerstone of the Lisbon process’, which was adopted last October."
"It has to be said that things are moving too slowly in this area, which, as the Commissioner was highlighting, ought to be a priority for the future of the European Union."
"My second point concerns the role of universities in research and the brain drain."
"I believe that it is more important than ever to highlight the major role assigned to universities in terms of creating and disseminating knowledge."
"As such, we strongly recommend that more importance be attached to them by means of developing synergies between the higher education sector, research, lifelong learning and the production sector."
"There is an urgent need for the European Union to stem the brain drain effectively and to put in place all appropriate measures to attract excellence to EU soil."
"Finally, the last point that I wanted to highlight concerns job creation."
"There is also an urgent need for the Member States to make better use of the European funds allocated to them."
"I wanted to draw your attention here to the Member States that have rightly made job creation a key feature of their projects by investing more than 35% of the ESF funds in modernising their education and training systems."
"."
"Mr President, we are talking about growth and employment, namely the Lisbon Strategy."
"Research and innovation are an integral part of the success of the Lisbon Strategy, as is collaboration between science and industry, in other words a knowledge-based economy."
"Mrs del Castillo Vera’s report, on which I congratulate her, and the European Commission’s proposals accurately highlight what we lack in Europe."
"First of all, we lack financial resources."
"In the 2007-2013 budget, paragraph 1a, competitiveness, was cut the most."
"It was cut almost by half."
"Let us reiterate: we cannot achieve success for Europe without investment in research and innovation."
"We need to increase funding for science and new technologies in all countries."
"This task is the first and foremost objective for the whole European Council and future presidencies."
"National budgets are just as important as European budgets."
"Secondly, we lack ways of expanding knowledge and sharing knowledge."
"It is vital to create a real partnership within and between Member States and to exploit the potential of the whole Union within the framework of large consortia."
"It is vital to create a European research and innovation area, as innovation is an important word here, and to make optimal use of resources."
"Only transparency and exchange of information can ensure synergy between different programmes at Union, national and regional levels."
"In order to achieve this, it is necessary to create a single information technology programme for the whole Union."
"There is, however, another key to the success of the Lisbon Strategy, namely a real single market for goods, labour, services and capital."
"Without a single market it will be difficult for us to achieve success in research and innovation, science and new technologies."
"Only a real single market will give us better opportunities for growth and employment."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, research and development are of crucial importance to increasing Europe’s growth potential and to creating new jobs."
"The EU cannot become competitive by reducing wages but must instead pin its hopes on developing new technology and human capital."
"In spite of the Lisbon Strategy’s objective of turning Europe into the most dynamic, knowledge-based region in the world, Europe constantly limps behind the United States and Japan when it comes to research and innovation."
"I think that, in this report, we have put our finger very precisely on those areas in which Europe fails to live up to its own objectives."
"Europe does not create enough knowledge and neither shares it effectively nor funds it sufficiently."
"Research is important, but we must also bear in mind that most European companies are not high-tech gazelle companies. Instead, they are small, traditional businesses."
"Those businesses too must also be innovative and become better at exploiting new market opportunities for new products and at devising new business processes that make better use of employees’ potential."
"The report succeeds in offering a broad perspective on the development of knowledge."
"I am particularly pleased about the integrated access to labour market and education policy, since it is only by combining businesses’ conditions for innovation with social, labour market and education policy that we can create space for employees’ creative potential."
"A highly qualified workforce adapts better to businesses’ quickly changing needs, and education also helps to spread knowledge."
"Europe has a need for more and better investment in education."
"I should also like to emphasise that I consider equality to be a crucial dimension of the EU’s Lisbon Strategy."
"We cannot afford to ignore the equality perspective if we are to achieve our objectives for the competitiveness of the EU."
"It is estimated that the EU must attract and train between 600 000 and 700 000 new researchers in order to fulfil our research needs, and this figure does not take account of many older people’s withdrawal from the labour market."
"We simply cannot afford to ignore the research potential to be found in the female half of the population."
"Last of all, I should like to point out that, in our innovation strategy, we should, in my view, incorporate sustainability in relation to both the environment and social inclusion."
"Sustainability should be the basic principle, enabling us to ensure that the EU moves forward and thinks both in the long-term and globally."
"In this area, Europe clearly has a head start, which can in itself help ensure that we achieve the goals we set in the Lisbon Strategy."
"– Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen, you have spoken on the theme of innovation."
"At a time like this, when the Football World Cup is on, the image that comes to mind in connection with this topic is that of the Japanese: they played wonderfully up to the penalty area, but then they did not score a goal."
"Then there was the match between Brazil and Ghana, where the Ghanaians gave perhaps the best showing of any African team, but did not score any goals."
"It is much the same with we Europeans when it comes to innovation: we are brilliant at inventing things, and we are brilliant when it comes to reaching the penalty area, but we cannot convert this into goals."
"I am therefore grateful to you, Commissioner, and to the rapporteur as well, for this report and for your statements."
"I would also like to give my compliments to the rapporteur, who had to deal with shifting majorities in the committee, which led to there being light and dark aspects to this report."
"I will start with the darker aspects."
"Let us take for example the problem posed by patent law."
"The law clearly demands that the Member States end the dispute about languages so that we can have a European patent."
"This formulation is too weak: since then it has become a question of much more than languages."
"What is needed is to find a skilful, interesting and intelligent combination between the London Agreement and the patent litigation system, in other words a litigation system where we very clearly have to create a court that would be responsible for dealing with patent law."
"Another important point is the reporting responsibilities that we demand for SMEs."
"We are asking the Commission to define a responsibility to report on how innovation potential is being measured."
"In doing so, however, we are quite clearly creating more bureaucracy."
"If we ask the Commission to demand these reports then it will do so from small and medium-sized enterprises, and they will thus be additionally burdened with bureaucracy."
"That is the wrong way to go about things."
"The correct way to proceed, however, would be to adopt those points that will find a broad majority in this House: for example, if we were to promote business enterprises in Europe in such a way that failure in business were to become a genuine possibility, one that we could recognise and accept - as we can see in Anglo-Saxon countries."
"We should introduce measures to prevent the best researchers and innovators from leaving Europe, and we must create infrastructures so that European researchers can once again be at home in Europe, since there are indeed many researchers in the world who would gladly move back to Europe."
"We could also arrange additional subsidies for especially creative small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Together with the Commission, this House has adopted the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, the CIP and I am grateful to everybody that this succeeded in first reading in which we make pre-seed money, that is, risk capital available for these particular initial stages."
"Of course, there are standards too."
"I am glad that we have turned to the issue of standards, since through standards and better standardisation mechanisms we could reproduce the success story that we saw in the case of GSM – Commissioner Bangemann was the one who initiated this."
"Lisbon is not dead, but I would prefer Liverpool, since the Liverpool Process would mean that we could be three-nil behind at half-time in the Champions League Final and yet still win."
"That is precisely where we now stand."
". – Mr President, to continue with the football metaphor, we have seen teams like Brazil, which has fielded great players – superb players – but which has not played as a team."
"When it comes to innovation, the large and the small must play together."
"The team is Europe, and we all need to combine our efforts in order to succeed."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs del Castillo Vera on her excellent report and thank her for her open and inclusive attitude to drawing up this proposal."
"I would also like to emphasise three points."
"Firstly, when it comes to innovation, small is beautiful."
"If we want to create stable employment, if we want to instil a new culture that favours innovation, then it has to be instilled in the thousands and thousands of SMEs throughout Europe."
"The report therefore recommends that particular attention be paid to this point, in order to ensure the participation of small and medium-sized businesses and in order to achieve the necessary change in the field of innovation."
"Secondly, I would like to point out that innovating also means opening up."
"It means promoting the flow of information, it means that we need an innovative strategy, in which there is a balance between the protection of industrial property and the free dissemination of technical knowledge and free and unhindered competition."
"In that way we will be able to promote solidarity, knowledge and greater social cohesion."
"Finally, I wish to say that innovation is green."
"Innovation means new methods for strengthening energy efficiency, ecotechnologies and clean production, in order to achieve a more competitive economy that creates more environmental and social well-being."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I shall not continue the themed link with football."
"I do, however, wish to express my view that the Lisbon Strategy has failed in respect of growth and employment."
"Politicians often put blame on globalisation as if it were an anonymous phenomenon that cannot be influenced."
"It is not."
"At heart, it is political decisions that govern the impact of globalisation."
"As regards research and development, they are an investment in the future."
"This report, however, refers to area after area in which the EU has thus far failed in research and development."
"The report highlights factors of significance in changing this situation."
"I would like to point out that the basis for all successful research and development is a large degree of freedom within research, with as little regulation and control as possible."
"This means freedom for individual researchers, but also freedom for state and regional aid for research and development."
"That is often where the knowledge is."
"For this reason the comprehensive regulation proposed gives rise to a certain amount of concern."
"What research needs is not more regulations but more freedom and resources."
"Like all other policies, the policy on research and development is not gender-neutral."
"Female researchers have great difficulties in terms both of the recruitment of new researchers and of access to research capital."
"This uneven distribution obviously has serious consequences for research and development."
"If the Lisbon Programme’s research and development programme is to be a success we must exploit the skills of female researchers."
"I support the idea put forward in the report that future research must prioritise the environment and sustainable development."
"This, together with the exploitation of female skills in research, could mean the difference between success and failure."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, in an age of innovation continual further development and research are necessary, since trusted technologies become out of date all too quickly."
"We cannot remain static; instead, we need continual advances."
"That is a truism, and one with which we are all familiar."
"It is known that for many years our work in research and development lagged far behind that of the frontrunners, USA and Japan."
"Even if this is, in the meantime, slowly beginning to change, there still remains a lot to do."
"We have to create better conditions for innovation."
"To this end we require an up-and-coming generation of researchers capable of competing on an international level."
"The low proportion of graduates in technical and scientific disciplines, combined with the brain drain towards competing economic systems that offer the temptation of self-led research should give us cause for concern, as should the problems that our universities have in retaining qualified lecturing staff."
"We will also, finally, have to stand by our small and medium-sized enterprises, with which the greatest potential for innovation and job creation ultimately lies."
"If we fail to do this, these small and medium-sized enterprises will reduce their research and development activities, because they will be unable to take advantage of our complicated EU investment programmes."
"– Mr President, I welcome the Commission's new approach in examining European research in conjunction with what is happening in innovation."
"Allow me to congratulate Mrs del Castillo before commenting on two points which, in my opinion, could strengthen the momentum of innovation in Europe."
"Point one: small- and medium-sized companies need to be networked with large companies and industry."
"Why?"
"Because small companies are especially innovative, often more innovative that big companies."
"However, they are usually short of stable and suitable financing, while industry and big business have the capital, but are not always open to investing time and human resources in experimentation."
"Consequently, such joint ventures could have huge advantages both for small and large companies."
"Point two: greater emphasis is needed on public procurement contracts."
"Why?"
"Because public procurement contracts can, I believe, increase demand and function as a remedy to market vacuums and failures."
"Because, among other things, I consider that we need to seriously examine the promotion of open European competitions in line with the corresponding American model."
"Consequently, the Member States and the Commission must sound out the opportunities that exist."
"Finally, Commissioner, I should like to take the opportunity of this report to ask you: what European structures are presently supporting innovation in the European Union?"
"Is there or is there not a need for more initiatives?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for an excellent report."
"Despite all the fine speeches, we still do not invest enough in European research and development."
"The most recent data show that we still lag behind both the United States and Japan, and as for the new competitors, they are catching up with us, as was mentioned a moment ago."
"Top-level research will not be transformed into innovation and employment with money alone, however; we need to create an innovative climate, which the Commissioner also spoke about."
"That will be the main feature of a modern industrial society."
"It will not come about by kicking a ball around, and it will not matter who runs the fastest, but rather who thinks the fastest."
"It is a matter of our attitude and willingness to embrace a coherent strategy in order to achieve results."
"When there is no innovative climate, money or strategy, you do not need anything else for failure."
"Public administration, universities and business should pool their strengths and specialise."
"Actually, the problem is that the differences between the Member States are enormous, and the speed at which things travel varies greatly."
"The creation of a single market in researchers would be a goal worth supporting."
"The best researchers need to be where they can do the best research and innovation work."
"Several special Union programmes, such as Descartes or Aristoteles, have increased the mobility of researchers, but there remain barriers, which actually drive researchers overseas."
"European research policy must cover investment in the working conditions of researchers."
"This way we will establish innovation-based competitiveness."
"By its own example, Finland has shown that it is possible to build competitiveness founded on research and innovation based on a welfare society."
"I would like to thank Mrs Pilar del Castillo Vera for the initiative shown in raising matters which are so important for Europe."
"I would like to stress that information is a fundamental factor which Europe can exploit to increase its international competitive advantage."
"Providing resources and ensuring a competitive environment is the best way for the EU to help improve scientific research potential in Europe because it is not only ineffective for Member States to implement such programmes on their own, but it is often too expensive."
"The EU should more effectively combat the brain drain by offering its best USA-bound scientists better scientific research conditions and funding."
"I agree that the universities play a vital role in establishing and spreading information, and so, cooperation between higher education, research and the manufacturing sector should be consolidated."
"In order to increase investment in scientific research, improve European competitiveness and create more jobs, we need increased and more effective contributions to information and innovation."
"Although, generally speaking, each state is responsible for encouraging increased and improved investments, in striving for a common market, the EU should contribute to these efforts with funds from its own budget, and thus, stimulate the more rapid development of scientific research and innovations."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate our rapporteur, who has addressed the key points and who spoke, in her speech, of an improved climate."
"I believe that the climate of creativity goes even beyond the climate of innovation."
"Mr Verheugen has banked on the inventiveness of the Finnish Presidency, and rightly so: there are grounds for examining the Finnish education system, and, in doing so, one would see that this country has dared to go beyond ‘employability', that monstrous term that European bureaucrats have coined in order to promote entrepreneurship, and this from as early an age as possible."
"Next, Commissioner, I believe that the Lisbon Strategy is a fine example of the European Council's way of behaving like the Sandman."
"In 2000, the Council launched a prestigious idea, and, five years later, it has to be said that nothing has come of it and that the budgets have not taken account of the will of the Heads of State or Government to increase the research appropriations."
"So, above all, let us do our work."
"I am grateful to the rapporteur for having mentioned the European Council’s annual report calling for monitoring of these appropriations, which we are promised year after year but which do not materialise: it is time that the national budgets were adapted so that we might finally succeed in creating synergies in research."
"I should like to launch a new appeal in this connection."
"It has come to my attention that the new European Research Council, which is due to be created by the Seventh Framework Programme, was going to give rise to a huge amount of bureaucracy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I believe, if such is the case, that that would be going beyond what both the Council and Parliament wanted."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the Commission on the timeliness of a document that provides for practical and important actions aimed at creating a scientific and technological policy that is effective in terms of achieving the Lisbon objectives."
"I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report, which provides a very realistic diagnosis of the obstacles that the European Union needs to overcome in order for those actions to achieve the desired results."
"I shall refer to three issues."
"Firstly, the need to create a single market that is attractive to researchers."
"It is clear that, in order to achieve the objectives it has set, the European Union needs more properly trained researchers and it needs to be able to use its human resources by promoting cross-border cooperation."
"To this end, we must combat the brain drain effectively, we must provide incentives for the best foreign researchers to come to work in Europe, we must promote scientific education amongst young people, improve the working conditions of research staff, remove obstacles to mobility and promote the conditions necessary for women to be able to take part in the scientific and technological field under equal conditions with men."
"The football metaphor is of no use to us here, ladies and gentlemen: in order to make progress intelligently, the team needs to be mixed."
"Secondly, I would like to refer to the need to support the research capacities of SMEs."
"In this regard, I would like to stress the importance of the instruments proposed in the CIS and in the Seventh Framework Programme to improve SMEs’ access to funding, lack of which is their main obstacle when trying to improve their innovating capacity."
"I would finally like to stress the proposal to strengthen the Structural Funds intended for research and innovation."
"The Structural Funds have been reinforcing R+D structures on the basis of a territorial distribution of resources by means of convergence criteria."
"It is therefore important to promote coordination between the different Community R+D programmes with the fundamental instrument of regional development policy: the Structural Funds."
"Mr President, those are the three points I wished to stress of a document that may be very useful in our future work."
"To begin with, allow me to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs del Castillo, for her report capturing the entire scope of the issue of development in the area of research and innovation and suggesting quite a few ideas for how to improve the current situation."
"In my contribution I would like to emphasise the very important role of the implementation structures that may significantly influence the future success of European support programmes in the areas of research, development and innovation, including the Seventh Framework Programme and the Programme for Competitiveness and Innovation."
"The extent to which these programmes, in which we put such great stock, prove to be successful will depend on how well they are attuned to the needs of the target groups, particularly small and middle-sized businesses, universities, research centres and institutions."
"If my information is correct, the European Commission, namely the DG for Enterprise, is working on a new, more effective model of business support networks – Euro Info Centres and Innovation Relay Centres – with the aim of reducing administrative burdens."
"It is envisaged that these networks will be restructured through the development of consortiums at the NUTS I or NUTS II level."
"I regard the steps that the Commission has taken to boost efficiency and dismantle bureaucracy as being quite correct."
"On the other hand, I would like to urge you, Commissioner, in implementing these steps, to take into account the need for close interaction between entrepreneurs, research centres and universities, on the one hand, and intermediary institutions on the other."
"A regional level NUTS II for establishing consortiums is the minimum level required in order to provide sufficient geographical coverage for the comprehensive range of services essential to the job of successfully implementing European policy in this area."
"A decision favouring NUTS I, in other words the central level, might decrease the administrative burden on the European Commission but would definitely not contribute to reducing red tape at the national level; on the contrary, it would diminish the chances of the target recipients gaining flexible access to support programmes, particularly in outlying regions."
"An equally important requirement for the envisaged consortiums should be to ensure the comprehensive range and high quality of support services."
"The establishment of consortiums through a shared network of Euro Info Centres and Innovation Relay Centres will encourage comprehensive and flexible service provision, while fulfilling the original aims of these Centres and generating much needed synergism."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs del Castillo Vera, on her report."
"I should like to broach two subjects: the issue of building the European research area and the issue of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Building the European research area means building the single market for that most precious of commodities: knowledge."
"For that reason, we must apply the same determination to the construction of this market that Europe, as a whole, applied to the completion of the monetary Union and of the single market for other goods."
"We will be launching the seventh framework programme in a few months’ time, and the Union still presents a very, indeed overly, varied landscape of national and regional systems for research and innovation and, consequently, we are not working together as a team."
"This is to the detriment of systematic cooperation and efficiency."
"If we want to fulfil the Lisbon Strategy, then all of the actors involved, in the public and private sectors, at regional, national and Community levels, will each have to make a contribution through complementary and synergistic measures, and develop systems that are not merely political but consistent and mutually compatible."
"As regards small and medium-sized enterprises, many sources attribute the fall in productivity, and therefore in the productivity of the Italian economy, to the fact that there is little innovation in Italy."
"This is because, in many Italian companies, there is a perception that new technologies are basically pointless or superfluous."
"This negative attitude is linked to the small scale of our businesses, which have an average of four employees, but, although the phenomenon is particularly serious in my country, it also concerns most of Europe."
"In this connection, I propose that, over and above the various support measures for small and medium-sized enterprises provided for by Mrs del Castillo Vera's report – which I fully support – we launch training initiatives aimed specifically at small entrepreneurs, to make it clear to them that innovation has become necessary for survival."
"Finally, I call on the Member States and the regions, while acknowledging research and innovation as a top priority, not to lose too much time in transposing the legislation and in starting to implement the various programmes and actions, because time is precious when it comes to innovation."
"We, Hungarians, are proud of the fact that during the last century we gave the world about a dozen Nobel prize winners."
"However, we do not remember nearly as often that these outstanding intellects, almost without exception, gained this recognition far from their homeland."
"Most of these scientists received this honour while carrying out research in the United States."
"After some time, a team of Hungarian scientists at the famous Los Alamos research centre in the United States were referred to as Martians."
"In fact, everyone in America jokingly referred to them as Martians later, because their superior intelligence made it seem as if they had come from another planet."
"However, they were not from another universe, just from a different continent, Europe."
"It was the better research conditions and greater recognition which made them take the knowledge they had acquired in their homeland to the United States."
"This is a 20th century story, but we should not think that the 'brain drain' has stopped."
"Europe still produces the most outstanding intellectual giants."
"However, if we look at a summary of the statistics on research and development, the alarming conclusion we come to is that we are still at a serious disadvantage in this area, compared with the United States and Japan."
"The report tabled before us correctly states that this lagging behind is due, on the one hand, to the fact that Europe is not producing a sufficient amount of research results which can subsequently applied in the business sector."
"The gap between theoretical knowledge and its practical application is seriously holding back Europe's competitiveness."
"The other reason for lagging behind is still the lack of resources."
"Achieving the target of allocating 3% of the EU's GDP to research by 2010 already seems like an illusion."
"It is clear then what needs to be done: allocate more resources, strengthen applied research and give more recognition to researchers as a profession, because without such action, the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy will remain beyond our reach."
"Mr President, it is a European paradox that while we have a high level of basic research, we have a relatively low level of innovation."
"In Poland, this has been influenced by the fact that many branches of industry have been taken over by foreign companies which have their research institutes, design offices and laboratories in their own countries."
"In fact, our industrial research base has been shut down in recent years."
"Research results have not been effectively translated into streamlined production methods and services or innovation."
"This is partly due to multinational corporations choosing to compete in the field of research and innovation."
"Inventors of new ideas and patents have also had difficulties in gaining measurable profits."
"Other problems have included the blocking of possible competitors from the European Union by international corporations such as Microsoft with the aid of patents, limited budgetary resources and the restricted financial resources for military research."
"That is why we should, first of all, simplify the mechanisms allowing inventors to gain personal profits not only from patentable inventions but also from other inventions."
"Secondly, we should limit the monopolies of international companies which use their patents to block European competitors."
"If a patent granted in the Union blocks the growth of innovation in a given field through deliberate non-application for a given period of time, I would suggest that the idea behind the invention should be made available, free of charge, to other users."
"Thirdly, any large company should have to use their profits to create a technical progress fund for streamlining and innovation."
"It is a solution that has already been implemented in Poland once before."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises, however, could focus their resources with the aid of organisations such as chambers of commerce."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, innovation, research and growth constitute the biggest challenge for the European Union as a whole."
"I therefore appreciate the optimism and efforts of the rapporteur, who has tried to identify new ways of meeting Lisbon Strategy goals in this report on her own initiative."
"For Europe to be able to compete with the United States and Japan, countries taking the lead in the application information and communications technology, we need to boost the appeal of careers in research by offering incentives, an attractive environment and remuneration schemes that will motivate students to undertake research while studying at university."
"Member States are expected to play a special role in promoting investment in research and innovation, while facilitating and broadening public and private sector partnerships, particularly those with universities."
"Key to Europe’s success are the vital small and medium-sized enterprises, which account for 65% of European GDP."
"These businesses in particular need support in the area of innovation and research, as they underpin the growth of services and markets based on new technologies."
"A basic precondition for establishing the framework for a conducive business environment is the availability of sufficient funding from the EU budget."
"For example, supporting the use of venture capital creates possibilities for accumulating financial resources for the development of creative ideas, ensuring the competitiveness of businesses at the start of their operations."
"We must remember to nurture entrepreneurial spirit from early on, as it serves innovation and encourages demand from the public for innovative goods and services."
"It is essential to make information on research and innovation available to the business community at large, and we must therefore build and support information centres at the regional level as well."
"These centres may then contribute to enhancing nationwide and cross-border cooperation."
"Allow me to make one final point: the year 2010 is rapidly drawing closer and it is becoming obvious that the European Union must transform the Lisbon Strategy objectives into action and must do so as soon as possible."
"– It is evident, Madam President, that the United States of America and Japan have overtaken Europe in three vital fields."
"These are growth, research and production."
"We know that Europe is capable of developing a lot more than it is developing at the moment."
"We also know that the unemployment lines are too long."
"And we have adopted an attitude where we stretch out our fingers and point them towards recently industrialised countries."
"Today we talk of China, tomorrow India, and the day after tomorrow Brazil."
"However, this is not the truth; the truth is that Europe has not taken the initiative into its hands, nor has it understood the importance of renovation, research, technology and informatics."
"In fact, we imposed upon ourselves a target of 3% of GDP."
"We are now saying that this is a difficult target to reach, and the countries – I shall conclude here – the countries which benefit from structural funds should dedicate part of this sum towards the achievement of this goal."
"Madam President, the rapporteur very aptly described the most important premise of the Communication."
"She sees in it a new stimulus for the principle behind the Lisbon Agenda, which many Europeans still view as the European Union’s ‘trademark’."
"The Communication simply recommends that the European Union should continue to favour research and innovation as vital stimuli for change in contemporary society, something it has declared to be a priority for many years, and that it should above all view economic development as a decisive instrument for stimulating the job market."
"The ten new Member States staunchly support the creation of increasingly more attractive operating conditions for modern research centres in Europe."
"There are clearly certain concerns, justified by the fact that there are still visible legal and administrative barriers for scientists from Central and Eastern Europe wanting to participate in this research."
"The fact that the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has accepted the amendments tabled to the report is therefore all the more welcome."
"These amendments were tabled with the scientists from that region in mind, especially those at the start of their careers."
"It should also be emphasised that the committee has shown significant interest in the problems faced by small and medium-sized enterprises."
"In the rapporteur’s report, we even find a proposal to take particular account of the specific situation of micro enterprises and small enterprises."
"The scientific world views this as an appropriate framework for putting pressure on the European Commission to create an information database which will provide a record of the current state of scientific research."
"It will also be a kind of guarantee, bearing in mind the increasing expectations of the scientific world, that intellectual property rights will be protected."
"This kind of new economic policy should create new opportunities for flexible choice of economic instruments that ensure, in accordance with the message emerging from our debate, continued growth in employment."
"Madam President, six years after the start of the ten-year Lisbon Strategy, it is still difficult to call the European Union the most dynamic economy in the world."
"Catching up with the United States or Japan still remains an ambition, a dream."
"It is hardly surprising that actions do not follow words."
"The European Union has earmarked only 1.93% of its GDP for scientific research and development, whereas the USA has allotted 2.59% and Japan 3.15% of GDP to this field."
"Low investment in research and development, as well as a lack of sufficient support for innovation, will not increase the potential for growth and employment in the European Union."
"That is why it is extremely important to guarantee the appropriate budgetary resources for aid instruments to small and medium-sized enterprises, such as the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme or the JEREMIE initiative."
"As well as fostering entrepreneurship and stimulating innovation, we must also continually invest in scientific development."
"Scientists should be given appropriate career opportunities and financial conditions to conduct their research."
"Otherwise, institutions in the United States or Japan will continue to succeed in tempting away brilliantly qualified European experts with better offers, and it will be these countries for which they win future Nobel prizes."
"– Madam President, the use of technologies and innovation in economics, business and commerce unquestionably makes a decisive contribution to soaring increases in the productivity of labour and to the creation of new, quality jobs."
"The rapporteur, whom I honestly congratulate on the composite presentation of her report, therefore justifiably points out that, despite the fact that the European institutions recognise the vital importance of promoting research and innovation, the European Union as a whole is still failing to make adequate use of its potential, either in terms of human resources or in terms of funding capacity."
"National reform programmes do of course all recognise as a challenge policies on research, innovation and their applications."
"For financing, it is not as important, in my opinion, to achieve a maximum target in terms of percentages as it is to reform public research systems, in tandem with the restructuring and the promotion of the efficacy of university scientific institutions and research programmes and, in general, with the spreading of interest in knowledge and research to renewed education systems and to effective lifelong learning programmes."
"Facilitating joint ventures between the public and private sectors and cross-border cooperation are equally important investments for more research and the successful dissemination of innovation."
"Alongside state financing, the proper management of Community financial resources and financing mechanisms by the Commission and access to loans from the European Investment Bank is expected to safeguard an increase in research activities, especially by small and medium-sized companies."
"Within the framework of regional convergence in technological pioneering and development and the completion of the single job market, I consider that it would be a good idea to promote the participation of small and medium-sized companies in European technology platforms."
"However, the maximisation of returns is achieved with the promotion of human resources, with excellence and with creative cooperation between higher education and lifelong learning agencies and the business and manufacturing sectors."
"Thus Europe will become a global competitor in research, just as it has in football."
"Madam President, the discussion which ended a few minutes ago dealt with very similar issues."
"All the speakers described the situation very well."
"In order to develop, one must invest."
"That includes investment in scientific research and innovation."
"Parliament’s motion for a resolution features this truism, as well as a detailed analysis of the situation and the direction that future actions should take."
"However, the statements that Europe does not seek to acquire new knowledge, that it cannot share knowledge and that it does not support knowledge financially all have a very ominous ring to them."
"This must change!"
"We must begin to invest more in basic research, and we have to expand the scope of public funding for research and development."
"Otherwise, we may be shooting ourselves in the foot."
"Unless we take the necessary steps, we will move from being a modern and dynamic Europe, which is regarded as attractive by many citizens of other countries, to being a technical, technological and economic backwater which Europeans will not want to live or work in, let alone like."
"First of all I should like to thank the rapporteur for proving that we can turn ‘globalisation’ to our advantage by responding appropriately to contemporary social processes, despite the fact that this word resonates across Europe as a threat."
"In particular, she has brought our attention to three areas of weakness: the generation of new knowledge, cooperation in generating and using new knowledge, and funding."
"I should also like to draw attention to three areas that will, in my opinion, be crucial to the successful implementation of the Lisbon Programme: first of all, research; secondly synergising national and European policies and, finally, the European Technology Institute."
"Firstly, the Commission has, in cooperation with the European Parliament and the Council, submitted a suitable proposal for the 7th Framework Programme for Research."
"We must bring negotiations on this research programme to a close as soon as possible so that we can start implementing it in time."
"Financial resources for this programme were pruned considerably during the financial perspective negotiations, which is why the research budget must be implemented in its entirety."
"There is no justifiable reason for any further reductions in these resources."
"Secondly, EU–level measures can encourage individual Member States to take their own measures."
"We will only achieve satisfactory results if we combine EU–level action with that made by individual Member States."
"I therefore urge the Commission to follow carefully the action taken by individual states and give public prominence to examples of successful states or successful practice."
"Thirdly, it is also important to synergise areas of education, research and development, on the one hand, and economy on the other."
"It is important that the Commission acts to promote such cooperation – I am referring here to the European Technology Institute."
"In order that this proposal should not remain merely a political project, we must be acutely aware of the views of all interested parties."
"We have to foster genuine growth within the European Research Area and prevent finances from being cut further and used for the expansion of bureaucracy."
"Thank you!"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 a.m."
"This own-initiative report on the implementation of the Lisbon programme comes at the most appropriate moment now that we are on the eve of finalizing the negotiations on the new Cohesion Policy legislative package."
"The revival of the Lisbon strategy's growth and employment objectives is an important aspect of this renewed legislative framework as too much delay has already been taken on the aim of making Europe the most dynamic and competitive knowledge based economy."
"In this respect, I can only support the report of Mrs. del Castillo Vera and its emphasis on improving the European research and innovation environment."
"More specifically, I would like to welcome the focus on the potential of small and medium size innovative enterprises for achieving Lisbon agenda's objectives as well as the demand to foster public and private funding to optimise Community's financial support."
"Finally, I it is worth underlining, according to Mrs. del Castillo Vera own-initiative report, that there is indeed an urgent need to better harmonise the coordination and the cooperation between the different national strategies if we really want to raise Europe's growth and employment potential."
"The next item is the report (A6-0206/2006) by Mr Calabuig Rull on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on a policy framework to strengthen EU manufacturing towards a more integrated approach for industrial policy (2006/2003(INI))."
"."
"Madam President, before I begin my speech, please allow me to make a brief reference to the serious accident that took place yesterday in Valencia and that cost the lives of 41 people."
"As some Members know, I was born in and I live in the city of Valencia and I would therefore like to begin by expressing my sincere condolences and solidarity to all of the families of the victims of this tragic accident and wishing all of the injured a speedy recovery."
"The fact is that a drama on this scale is incomprehensible in the present day, and I hope that the specific causes of this accident will be fully clarified so that no other family ever has to experience such a tragedy."
"With regard to the report that we are debating today, I would like to begin by congratulating the Commission, in particular Commissioner Verheugen and his team, on the Communication that they have presented on the future of the manufacturing industry."
"In view of the challenges we are facing, we cannot remain passive or take a defensive position, but we must also recognise that the invisible hand of the market is not going to provide a sufficient response."
"An initiative that puts industrial policy back on the table and promotes the conditions necessary to safeguard the European Union's manufacturing industry’s future is therefore an appropriate one."
"Europe's aspiration must be to remain a great industrial power and it must not be content simply with developing the services sector, whose future is often intimately linked to the existence of a solid industrial base."
"The Member States and the regions must not therefore wait until times are critical, with the irreversible consequences for industry that that entails, before taking action."
"We are not talking today about a policy of subsidies for great industrial dinosaurs; that model represented a bottomless pit for public resources and hindered the creation of new opportunities for creating stable jobs with futures."
"The European manufacturing industry is facing several important challenges all at the same time, such as enlargement, globalisation and relocations."
"There is no question, however, that the Union’s greatest challenges are coming from the outside, in particular those resulting from globalisation and specifically the competition from the emerging Asian countries."
"These challenges mean that we must change mindsets and take advantage of new opportunities."
"The present industrial structure of the European Union’s economy as a whole does not put us in the best position to confront the current process of globalisation."
"The European Union’s trade is still concentrated in medium and high technology and low or intermediate personal qualifications, which exposes the European Union to competition from producers from emerging economies."
"Our competitive advantage must come from knowledge and quality, and not low prices."
"However, that often means sectoral adjustments with social consequences."
"Although responsibility ultimately lies with the private sector, these consequences must be dealt with through specific resources, such as the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"This Communication recognises that the use of the different industrial policy instruments needs to be adapted to the context and the specific characteristics of each individual sector."
"The Commission also proposes seven new extremely important cross-sectoral policy initiatives: increasing the protection of intellectual property rights and combating counterfeiting, the creation of a high-level group on competitiveness, energy and the environment and support for access to new markets for our products in a fair and reciprocal fashion."
"This new policy must be complementary to the work done in the Member States and, in this regard, we have advised that it will be necessary to do more work on the problems faced by the new Members."
"This new approach must seek consensus, involving key agents, social interlocutors and Member States in the process of political decision-making at an early stage."
"The new industrial policy must promote investment in people’s qualifications and equipment so that people can adapt to change and take advantage of the new opportunities that it offers."
"Training and flexibility are precisely the Union’s most important resource and competition parameter."
"We are talking about competition based on R+D, on innovation, quality and design, on infrastructures, on new ways of organising production and on investment in pioneering sectors."
"These measures are urgent, since European industry’s competitors are moving quickly in that direction."
"I would like to end by stressing the need to increase the transfer of knowledge and the application of the results of research to new products and processes."
"Technological platforms are of particular importance for this objective, which are a model that has led to successes but that must find mechanisms to give SMEs access to the results of the technological platforms and to apply the latter’s innovations."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am extremely grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Calabuig Rull, for his report, which accurately reflects the intentions of the Commission and also gives a fair and appropriate assessment of them."
"We are, then, united in our opinion that Europe must and will remain a strong location for industry."
"Industry still remains a decisive economic factor for Europe, although it is no longer the only one."
"Manufacturing industries directly employ 34 million people in Europe and produce three-quarters of all the goods exported by the European Union; more than 80% of all expenditure on research and development by the private sector in the EU comes from industry, and of course a large proportion of all services depends upon it being strong and competitive."
"Indeed, we in Europe have no reason to feel ashamed."
"The competitiveness of European industry is outstanding in many areas, and it is not as if we had fallen behind in this sector."
"There are some areas in which competition has become harder and where we are having difficulties, but in an astonishing number of areas Europe is a world leader and also a leader in terms of technology."
"When we tabled our proposal on industrial policy for the 21st century, we agreed that we must not fall back into times of state control, bureaucracy and interventionism, but that we need to enhance the conditions for industrial activity in Europe to such an extent that Europe remains, or becomes, an attractive location for industry. This implies a definite renunciation of protectionism and state intervention, but also a firm offer of help in promoting and developing more competitiveness."
"The different horizontal and sectoral initiatives that the rapporteur has already mentioned bring us closer to this objective."
"I would in particular like to point out that some of the horizontal initiatives that the Commission proposed last year have in the meantime become very important topics, for example, increasing capacity for innovation, defending intellectual property rights or also access to third markets a major topic that is currently being discussed in the Doha round."
"I would in particular like to draw your attention to the importance of better lawmaking for modern industrial policy."
"If any sector of the European economy complains about too much bureaucracy and too many long-winded regulations, then it is this one."
"As you know, we have taken up this cause with great care."
"I should also like to reiterate that the purpose of the current review of Community law is not to reduce any standards, for example, less environmental protection or less consumer protection; instead, it is intended to make the rules as effective and as modern as possible, in order to reinforce the competitiveness of our businesses."
"I fully share the rapporteur’s opinion on the problem of qualifications, and I am very grateful that he has highlighted this so clearly."
"For the future of the manufacturing industry in Europe it will be more and more important to have sufficiently qualified workers at our disposal."
"In some Member States we already have a qualification problem, and part of the unemployment in Europe is due to the fact that certain qualifications are not available where they are actually needed."
"On this issue, too, further coordinated activities will most certainly be necessary on the part of the European Union and the Member States as well."
". – Commissioner, I hope this debate will make the Commission pay greater attention to the importance of the various industrial sectors in the EU, and to its vital contribution to the creation of wealth and jobs."
"Consequently, investment must be made in strengthening existing companies. Importance must be attached to the most vulnerable industrial sectors and to the consequences of the liberalisation of world trade, which are already being felt."
"There can be no continuation of a policy of negotiations within the World Trade Organisation that overlooks the various industrial sectors, jobs with rights, regional development and economic and social cohesion."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs sought to warn about these issues in the opinion that I am presenting and that the majority in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy took into account."
"I wish to emphasise the need to protect the workers whenever manufacturing companies are restructured, including ensuring that the workers are kept fully informed and given a decisive influence throughout the process."
". – Madam President, I would first of all like to thank Mr Calabuig Rull for his fine and result-oriented cooperation, and would also like to thank the Commission, in particular Commissioner Verheugen, as the proposal submitted by the Commission is most serviceable, indicating a new direction for industrial policy."
"Our group supports the draft resolution of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy; we helped to produce it and it reflects our own opinions."
"On the other hand, we will be requesting split votes for some of the amendments, where the powers of the Member States are encroached on."
"This is a danger we will not countenance."
"The Commission does not have sole responsibility: the Member States themselves are also responsible for many areas, and they must discharge these responsibilities."
"For us, modern industrial policy is a means to ensure that Europe remains an attractive location, and to safeguard competitive conditions in the context of globalisation."
"Competitive industry is indispensable if the services sector is to be reinforced, as Mr Calabuig Rull has pointed out."
"Industrial policy therefore forms the basis of, rather than a hindrance to, efforts towards opening up new markets in the services sector."
"Industry, characterised by high quality standards and technological advances, was and still is the motor of economic development in Europe, and all measures concerning the environment and climate protection must be judged in terms of energy policy, to see whether they contribute to improving the framework conditions."
"Of course, when we say that the Member States bear the responsibility for many measures, then we must consider whether we do not go too far in certain respects."
"Better coordination: yes, European responsibility: no, sectoral groups of experts: yes, competence and strategy plans for enterprises and regions: no, employee participation: yes, but general veto rights for works committees: no."
"I am convinced that if we follow these examples we can further improve Mr Calabuig Rull’s report, and, all told, that together with the Commission we can work out a serviceable instruction manual for future industrial policy in its relation to other policy areas."
"."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thanks go to the rapporteur for an excellent report, which we support."
"Do we really want to become the leading knowledge-based economy in Europe and indeed the world, or do we prefer to try and get by by staying with the old ways, with the help of subsidies?"
"That is the question."
"Even the old industrial sectors can thrive and be competitive if there is financial support for their modernisation."
"For example, training and innovation can help procure a good workforce for the future."
"Nokia is a good example."
"Did you know that many years ago Nokia was a well-known manufacturer of shoes and boots?"
"It is a long way from shoes and boots to the mobile phone."
"In the accelerating and ever more fiercely competitive global economy, European competitiveness can only be maintained by investing in research, development and innovation."
"We are all agreed on that, but it just is not happening."
"However, competitiveness has also been sustained through untenable means, such as mass layoffs and sudden moves in production."
"It is as if we had come to a lake and fished it empty and then moved on to another lake and fished that one empty as well."
"This sort of European overfishing cannot be thought of as a wise move."
"Employees in companies are flexible, and in many countries very flexible indeed, but the lack of any protection in non-manual work acts as a brake in an innovative society."
"Job satisfaction and employees’ ability to cope are important, and they can help to ensure that we have an effective and lasting workforce."
"According to the latest report by Eurofound, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, job-related stress has increased, and it has done so continuously in recent years."
"The result is absenteeism though illness, a drop in work efficiency and even people allowing themselves to be excluded from the job market."
"Especially worrying is the fact that the demands of work have grown, especially in the female-dominated sectors."
"If the Chinese work themselves to death, we should at least work with a smile."
"."
"Thank you Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a widely-held belief that the future of European development largely depends on the ability of society and the knowledge-based economy to deliver results, but we often sadly underestimate the fact that, as part of this ambitious outlook, we need to draft, relaunch and enhance an entire policy relating to the sectors, including the traditional sectors, of our production and of the European productive system as a whole, from agriculture to services, and from the core businesses of the manufacturing sector to construction."
"There cannot in fact be an economy based solely on intangible networks, information and software without a solid foundation of manufacturing, producing primary goods, ranging from finished products to machinery, and from essential goods to luxury goods."
"An economic system is solid if it enables all of its production sectors to grow economically and if it is able to provide these sectors, including traditional production sectors, with ever stronger and more robust injections of technological innovation in processes and products; if it is able to introduce huge amounts of research, diversification and the ability to keep up with new developments, thus maintaining our position in the world market and defending the size of Europe's balance of trade."
"As you said, Commissioner, the support given by the Commission and the Member States to their strategic sectors is not dirigisme or public interventionism, policies that have been superseded in the integrated market and in the European and global free markets, but it is the ability to promote industrial policies that can cope with, anticipate or manage changes, that can create an attractive environment for international investments and that, in short, can manage the many crises in the European productive system and cope with future challenges."
"Two new developments have been highlighted by the rapporteur and by the other speakers, which I too would point out: finally, after years in which it seemed that the sectoral approach had been largely surpassed, we are beginning to realise once again that we need to understand what is really taking place in the strategic sectors in our Europe."
"As regards the other aspect, an industrial policy is understood to mean an integrated policy, which requires integrated, practical measures, but this policy must also be designed – and this is where we call on the Commission to make an extra effort – by bearing in mind all of the various aspects: purely industrial aspects, research aspects, energy aspects and commercial aspects."
"We are well aware that, in order to tackle the global market, we must equip ourselves with more and more resources and give impetus to the Commission's work, too, as we have seen done for the textile sector and other sectors."
"Yet, all of my fellow Members from the various countries of Europe know that what struck the textile sector, that is to say, that kind of whirlwind of extremely low-cost production originating from certain parts of the world, may strike yet other production sectors that are important for Europe."
"We therefore call for an effort to be made along these lines; we call for the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, too, to take account of this aspect relating to sectoral restructuring, to the ability to help workers retrain for new jobs and to the professional skills that are of use to an integrated system that is able to innovate, as my fellow Members have also said."
"Next, I should like to refer to small and medium-sized enterprises: we all know that Europe's production structure is based on the reality of these businesses, which is not only a reality in terms of production but a reality that revitalises the regions and gives impetus to regional policies."
"I want to say to you, Commissioner, that this Commission is the one that we value, one that is not passive in the face of Europe’s problems and changes, but able to perform a strong coordinating role."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the weaknesses in the Commission's draft cannot be laid at Mr Calabuig Rull's door: in our view, the real weakness is the fact that this framework does not yet have a strategic outlook."
"In our opinion, and in this I agree with the previous speaker, a successful strategy would need to be based on clarifying the interaction between industrial, regional, competition, trade and, last but not least, environmental policies."
"In connection with our complaints about these analytical weaknesses, we are concerned by the fact that industrial policy is determined by high level groups that have recently been springing like weeds from the soil of Brussels but that are dominated by a few large industrial companies."
"We see one problem with this as being that democratic controls are being weakened in this field, and another as the virtual lack of any say whatever in these high level groups for small and medium-sized enterprises, which employ 50% of all workers in the processing industry."
"Where industrial businesses in Europe have failed in recent years because they were unable to innovate, that was certainly not always due to poor policies, but down to the fact that certain business leaders have completely failed to recognise their workers’ potential for innovation, or the need to innovate at all."
"Madam President, on the face of it, this report contains a number of sensible ideas: it talks about the crucial role of industry in a modern economy, even though, for years, the myth of a post-industrial society focused entirely on services has prevailed."
"It calls for the negotiations conducted within the WTO to take into account the specific characteristics of each sector, or the specific problems of each Member State, which is something of a cultural revolution but which will never be applied by the Commission, for which the European Union represents a single entity."
"The report demonstrates confidence in the bilateral agreements when it comes to settling the problems of market access encountered by your manufacturers, particularly in emerging countries, and the application of the principle of reciprocity in respect of international trade. This runs counter to the belief in multilateralism that has been reaffirmed on numerous occasions in this House."
"The report is very sparing in its criticism of unfair competition and counterfeiting, against which Brussels fights so half-heartedly."
"This is indeed all true but, in essence, it is just meaningless talk, and nothing has changed."
"The European Parliament’s report, like the Commission’s communication, still proposes the same timeworn and disastrous formulas."
"The standard policy of competition and liberalisation, for example of the energy market, efforts to mitigate the effects of globalisation, which is regarded as inescapable and, in essence, beneficial to shareholders, the modernisation of intellectual property law, the symbol of which is the software patent – which was rejected by users and SMEs in the sector - and the simplification of legislation, such as the REACH Directive - that 1 200-page convoluted text that is jeopardising the European chemical industry."
"This is the usual litany of policies that have been conducted for years, with the aim of making people believe that what is required is a European industrial policy that is not provided for by the Treaties and, above all, with the aim of preventing the Member States, when faced with the resulting de-industrialisation and social disintegration, from taking matters into their own hands."
"The debate on this report is suspended."
"The remaining speakers will have the opportunity to take the floor this evening."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0312/2006)."
"We will take the following questions to the Commission."
"Is the Commission aware of the difficulty it may have placed many of my constituents in the recent interjection on UK football broadcasting rights?"
"In some cases, football is now extremely expensive to watch, because people must pay for more than one channel subscription, with more than one company in order to watch certain matches."
"Is this a fair decision when it economically alienates people from enjoying a sport?"
"How can people on low incomes afford to follow their teams, if they have to buy more than one subscription?"
". The Commission believes that the result of the Premier League media rights auction, which was carried out in compliance with Commission Decision 38173, will have beneficial effects for English football fans."
"The longstanding monopoly of BSkyB concerning the broadcasting of live Premier League matches has ended as a result of this auction."
"In the auction BSkyB acquired four packages – 92 live matches – and Setanta acquired two packages – 46 live matches."
"Setanta has now emerged as a viable competitor and will be able to exercise both commercial and pricing pressure on the former monopolist BSkyB."
"The choice for English football and sports fans has also improved."
"Setanta is now in a position to offer an attractive alternative sports programme, including live Premier League matches."
"The Commission acted in full compliance with EC competition rules and to the benefit of English consumers."
"It remains to be seen whether costs for consumers will indeed increase."
"In a market where at least two players are present, individual operators will have to consider carefully whether they can continue to raise prices for their packages without losing customers."
"It is also far from certain that the acquisition by a single operator of all live Premier League rights would have led to lower costs for English football fans."
"In the absence of any constraints from competition, it is not impossible that a single operator would have raised the prices for its sports services without compensating for the increase in price by increased choice, as is now available."
"The Commission also notes that English football fans who last season wished to watch more than the 88 live matches offered by BSkyB in its basic sports package also had to sign up for a second subscription channel from BSkyB, Prem Plus."
"The concept of two separate subscription channels is therefore not a novel one for football fans in the UK."
"This is quite an exciting question for some of us."
"This is not really an issue of dealing with monopolies, because we support the Commission on this prime objective."
"The issue in this case is that I have a constituent who has disability problems; he watches television and wants to watch just one subscription channel."
"I put it to the Commissioner that we might have something of a law of unintended consequences here."
"You have tried to do the right thing in dealing with a monopoly, BSkyB, but in fact, with Setanta, you have created a situation in which my constituents will have to pay two subscriptions to watch the same amount of football."
"Is that something that the Commission could investigate?"
". The question is quite clear."
"One of our principal objectives was to end BSkyB’s longstanding monopoly concerning the broadcasting of live Premier League matches and I think that this objective has been achieved."
"In particular Setanta has now emerged as a viable competitor to BSkyB and will be able to exercise commercial and pricing pressure on BSkyB."
"The sale of the live TV rights to two rival broadcasters already provides consumers with a greater choice than before."
"How much of an impact this will have will depend on the commercial strategies of BSkyB and Setanta."
"It is far too early to say whether the level of competition that this has introduced will be enough."
"However, given the position of third parties and of the national authorities, if the consumer does not benefit from the FA Premier League’s current process, it is inevitable that there will be more discussions at national level about these issues in the future and that would be the time to deal with the Premier League."
"The Commission’s Article 9 decision cannot and should not prevent this."
"As the honourable Member is aware, not all the competition problems have been resolved, nor would I want the decision to be used against national authorities or courts should they wish to intervene further."
"I am extremely grateful for the efforts, help and support of the OFT and Ofcom in this case."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner, on this auspicious evening for German – or possibly Italian – football."
"Can I ask if you are serious?"
"Trying to break up the TV monopoly over premiership football has been a complete dog’s breakfast."
"As a football fan, I still have absolutely no choice."
"I have to subscribe to BSkyB another channel if I want to follow my team."
"Does the Commission appreciate that buying a random collection of football matches is not what 90% of people want?"
"They want to follow their team."
"Why have you cut up the cake in the way you have?"
"It should be cut up so that I can choose to watch my team’s matches, not get a couple of them and twenty matches I do not want to watch."
"Will you look at this again?"
". I shall answer the first question."
"Am I serious?"
"Yes, I am quite serious."
"I am aware that sometimes that type of decision is not welcomed by all the honourable Members, but I am also aware that I need to fulfil my responsibility."
"I take the concerns expressed by British consumers and by the honourable Members very seriously, because I wish to reduce costs and increase choice for consumers, not the opposite."
"However, I also believe that the result of the Premier League auction will have beneficial effects for English football fans in both the short and long term."
"Consumer welfare cannot be measured solely by considering the position of a person who wants to watch all the matches of one specific team."
"British sports fans will now have the opportunity to view a significant number of the live Premier League matches and other sports through Setanta, which offers seven channels at the moment, including, for example, live Scottish football, live European football and live rugby."
"They will be able to do so without having to subscribe to Sky Sports, an option which previously did not exist."
"It is also worth noting that, according to press reports, Setanta is considering showing matches via a pay television service on the digital terrestrial platform Freeview, which would make Premier League matches available on digital terrestrial TV for the first time, so that is really something to offer."
"– Commissioner, multinational companies have had their sights on television broadcasting rights to sports events for many years, as have, recently, subsidiaries of the large sporting federations."
"The arrival of subscriber television in the life of citizens has radically changed its social role."
"Now, among other things, citizens are obliged to pay in order to enjoy sporting events and mobile telephony and the Internet are knocking at the door of this new phenomenon."
"How is the Commission addressing this onslaught?"
"Does this mean that citizens without the necessary subscription should be denied access to the Olympic Games, world cups and international events?"
"Finally, what is being done about the list of sports which the Member States must propose and notify to the competent committee of the European Union, for which broadcasting on free rather than subscriber television is mandatory?"
". I should like to underline once again that, when considering the application of EC law in the context of sport, it is important to draw a distinction between sport insofar as it generates economic activity and sporting rules as such."
"Insofar as sport generates economic activity, it is subject to EC law, including the internal market and competition rules in the same way as other economic activities."
"So far so good!"
"Of course, as reflected in the Nice Declaration, the Community takes account of the inherent social, educational and cultural aspects of sport when taking action under the Treaty."
"The Commission has followed this line in applying EC competition rules in individual cases and this approach has been confirmed by the European courts."
"When engaged in economic activity, sport governing bodies should, like any undertaking, ensure compliance with EC competition rules."
"I said that not all competition problems have been resolved, nor would I want a decision to be used against national authorities or courts should they wish to intervene further."
"It is clear that competition in itself creates economic activity; this makes competitors more alert and that is beneficial for the consumer and, in most cases, results in more diversity, more quality and a better price."
"In light of the recent referendum, what immediate changes in the relationship between the EU and Montenegro are envisaged and what additional support is the Commission now considering?"
". Following the referendum of 21 May 2006, which was conducted according to international standards and resulted in the victory of the pro-independence vote, the subsequent declaration of independence by the Montenegrin Parliament, as well as the reaction of the European Union at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 12 June, Montenegro and the European Union are now in the process of establishing diplomatic relations."
"The Commission intends to submit a proposal to the Council shortly, requesting authorisation to negotiate with Montenegro a Stabilisation and Association Agreement based on the negotiating directives of 3 October 2005, which concerned the former State Union of Serbia and Montenegro."
"In the same context, I would like to inform the House that we shall present a modified negotiating mandate for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia."
"Both countries, Montenegro and Serbia, have a concrete European perspective, like the other countries of the western Balkans."
"Here the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is the first stepping stone, while the ultimate goal of this process is EU accession at a later stage, when each of the countries is able to fulfil the necessary conditions."
"This European perspective of the Western Balkans was confirmed by the European Council in the middle of last month."
"The Commission will intensify its monitoring of developments in Montenegro, which will now have to face, on its own, all the responsibilities of its relationship with the European Union, including implementation of the European Partnership and the need to substantially strengthen its administrative and institutional capacity."
"This autumn the Commission will issue a separate annual report for Montenegro, which will include specific recommendations for the way ahead in the country."
"Montenegro, like other countries in the region, will benefit from assistance under the forthcoming pre-accession financial instrument as of 2007."
"Finally, the Commission intends shortly to open an office in Montenegro, which will be responsible for dialogue with the authorities and with civil society, the monitoring of reforms and the implementation of the financial instrument for pre-accession."
"I should like to correct you, Madam President."
"You said that the question concerns the ‘problem’ of Montenegro."
"I believe it is a challenge rather than a problem."
"I am delighted to hear the Commissioner say that the Commission is considering opening an office in Podgorica."
"I welcome that initiative very much."
"Does he feel that this would be helpful in promoting tourism in Montenegro?"
"I believe that the Adriatic coastline there offers great opportunities."
"He spoke about possible membership of the European Union."
"Has he any idea of the timescale?"
"What sort of period would he like to see before an application for EU membership came from Montenegro?"
". The question by the honourable Member is extremely pertinent and important, especially from the point of view of the Republic of Montenegro and its citizens."
"The primary duty of the European Commission office in Montenegro will be to promote European integration and to promote the relationship between Montenegro and the European Union."
"Thus indirectly it will certainly help to facilitate such economic and social development, including the development of tourism activities that will benefit the country and citizens in time."
"As regards forecasting when Montenegro might be able to meet all the conditions of accession and thus accede to the European Union, I will leave that to the betting agencies."
"From the point of view of the Commission and the European Parliament it is more important that they ensure the quality of the accession process rather than its speed."
"We have to emphasise substance more than schedule when we talk about accession negotiations or the pre-accession phase as now faced by the Republic of Montenegro."
"– Commissioner, I would just like, once again, to ask you to make it absolutely clear that Montenegro has exactly the same prospects for accession as all the other countries in the region under the Thessaloniki Declaration, and that, with particular regard to the issue of minorities, Montenegro has an exemplary policy in this domain."
"Secondly, I would just like to ask what the situation now is with regard to Serbia."
"With whom are you negotiating – the former federal level, or the former republic level in Serbia?"
". The honourable Member raises a very critical question."
"I can assure him and all of you that the Republic of Montenegro has the same prospects for the ultimate goal of EU membership as the other countries of the western Balkans."
"It is therefore in the same position as all the countries of that region."
"Minority rights are a critical condition."
"They concern all the countries of the region and we are stressing the need for minority rights to be respected in all the countries in that region, as well as in other candidate countries."
"That is mentioned in our report, which will be presented next autumn, most likely in October or November."
"As regards the level of negotiations with Serbia, until recently we had negotiated with Serbia and Montenegro at two levels, on the basis of the twin-track approach, with the State Union on the issues that fell within the competence of the State Union and with the two republics on the issues that fell within the competence of the two republics."
"Now we want to consolidate the substance of the negotiations achieved so far."
"Once the Council has adopted the new negotiating mandate for Montenegro and the modified mandate for Serbia, we can continue the negotiations on the basis of this consolidated result – in the case of Serbia, of course, once it is cooperating fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia."
"This method minimises any technical disruption, and with Serbia, for instance, we can resume the negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement immediately once Serbia is cooperating fully with the ICTY."
"In the past month, the Commission has conducted on-the-spot inspections of a number of major energy undertakings with the aim of establishing how competition is developing on the European gas and energy market."
"Ensuring fair competition on the energy market is of decisive importance to healthy European economies."
"Since, in parallel with these measures, we are debating the launching of a possible common European energy policy, and the findings from the inspections must be used in devising the strategy, I propose that we should publicise the inspection process at the appropriate level, with reference to its results."
"I should therefore like to ask the Commission what the current state of play is in the examination of the sector and what the main results of the measures so far taken have been."
"When can a final result be expected?"
"Is the Commission planning any further steps to complete the internal energy market?"
". As the Commission confirmed on 17 May 2006, it has indeed recently carried out on-the-spot inspections of a number of major energy companies in Europe."
"It is not possible to comment further on these ongoing investigations."
"As you are aware, inspections are carried out under Articles 20 and 21 of the EC regulation and form a normal part of the Commission’s enforcement activities in the competition field."
"In general, inspections are carried out because the Commission has reason to believe that the companies concerned may have violated the anti-trust rules established in Articles 82 and 81 of the Treaty."
"Article 28 of the regulation prohibits the Commission from disclosing information acquired during an inspection, except in limited circumstances."
"However, as required by Regulation (EC) No 1/2003, the Commission publishes all its decisions in due course."
"The Commission is also carrying out a sectoral inquiry into competition conditions in the EU gas and electricity markets."
"This is a distinct exercise from the individual investigations and inspections to which the honourable Member refers, but the extensive information about the functioning of the energy markets that is gathered during the sectoral inquiry will of course help to inform any enforcement action taken by the Commission in individual cases."
"The main preliminary findings of the sectoral inquiry were published in February 2006 and identified a number of existing barriers to competition."
"For example, national wholesale energy markets are still highly concentrated, with few new competitors entering the sector."
"There is also far too little integration between the national markets."
"Infrastructure and supply functions are so closely connected that it is difficult for new suppliers to enter the market, which means that consumers are denied choice."
"There is a lack of transparency, so new competitors also cannot get hold of the information."
"They need to get a foot in the door."
"Finally, prices do not appear to respond to changes in supply and demand."
"Tackling these problems will require a combination of regulatory and structural reform and robust enforcement of competition rules."
"The Commission is committed to taking any necessary enforcement action if that proves justified."
"The sectoral inquiry will be completed by the end of the year."
"The Commission will then decide whether any further measures are required in order to improve competition conditions in the gas and electricity markets."
"The information gathered through the sectoral inquiry will also play an important role in the ongoing formulation of a common European energy policy, as agreed by the spring European Council."
"The Commission is also conducting a review on implementation of the European regulatory measures in the energy sector."
"This work is being led by the Commissioner in charge of energy, Mr Piebalgs, and the Commission will report to Parliament and to the Council at the turn of the year."
"That report will also reflect on any further action that is needed to complete the integration of Europe’s energy markets."
"All the information gathered during the sectoral inquiry and the review of implementation of the liberalisation directives, together with other information received through consultation with the stakeholders, will of course play a key part in the formulation of a common European energy policy."
"Thank you for your reply, Commissioner, even though you were unable to go into any specific details about the investigations."
"With your permission, my additional question will also be of a general nature."
"Like you, I believe that there may be problems with the development of the internal energy market."
"My question is: will competition policy instruments be sufficient to resolve these problems in the future, or does the Commission feel that it may be necessary to set up a European energy regulation body, which would obviously deal primarily with cross-border transactions?"
"Thank you very much."
". The honourable Member rightly touched upon the question of whether this is enough."
"I have explained to the honourable Member that the Commission has already initiated a number of investigations where it appears that anti-competitive behaviour contributes to the problems identified by the energy sector inquiry."
"However, competition law cannot open markets by itself, as the Member will be aware."
"We need to complement our enforcement through an improved legal framework, increasing transparency, improving cross-border coordination, etc."
"Regulatory changes may be needed for us to reap the full benefits of our energy markets."
"Once we have the full report of the inquiry into competition conditions in the energy sector, we will reflect further on what changes may be required."
"My colleague, Mr Piebalgs, is looking at the level of current implementation of the existing liberalisation directives in the energy sector."
"Depending on the results of that review, further measures to liberalise the markets will be considered."
"Full structural unbundling is one option to consider."
"The Member will certainly conclude that we will take measures when we can see that there is something rotten in the state."
"– Commissioner, at the moment, energy trading, and particularly energy imports, generate high profits at international level."
"Discussions are currently underway regarding reinvesting these profits in Europe, which would mean OPEC, Russia, and perhaps China too in the near future, cornering the European market."
"What is your view of this future situation with respect to competition?"
"To give a practical example, Gazprom is buying up the larger energy companies in Europe."
"What action will the Commission take in this respect, in order to safeguard the security of our energy supply in future?"
". As the honourable Member rightly mentioned, there has been quite some change to the whole energy market scene."
"Europe needs stable relationships with the main producers outside the EU too."
"However, this does not and must not prevent us from ensuring that there is an integrated, competitive market within the EU."
"An open and competitive, flexible and interconnected single EU market will guarantee a secure energy position for the future as it will make the European market attractive to external suppliers; so that is all part of the game."
"Such a market will also be open to embracing new energy mixes."
"It will be able to muster the internal strength needed to master the international challenges in this field."
"Question No 37 will not be taken, since it deals with a subject that is already on the agenda for today’s sitting."
"Since they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together."
"How does the Commission assess the situation in Russia with regard to human rights and prison conditions, in particular for the prisoners Platon Lebedev and Mikhail Khodorkovsky?"
"What comment can you make to us about human rights violations in the Russian Federation and how do you assess the situation for prisoners in Russia in this regard, in particular for Platon Lebedev and Mikhail Khodorkovsky?"
". The Commission follows the human rights situation in Russia very closely and, through the EU’s political dialogue with Russia, as well as the regular human rights consultations, we are able to raise issues relating to democracy, human rights and the rule of law with Russia."
"We have raised concerns about the situation of prisoners in Russia in the human rights consultations and we have reminded the Russian authorities of the need to respect internationally recognised standards."
"In that respect, Russia’s agreement to publication of the reports by the Council of Europe’s Committee for the Prevention of Torture would be a positive step forward."
"With regard to the specific situation of Mr Khodorkovsky and Mr Lebedev, we are aware of the concerns expressed about the judicial process – the verdict and the sentence – and their current situation."
"The European Union has repeatedly underlined the need for the judicial system to be seen to operate fairly and transparently if it is to command the confidence of both the Russian population and the international community."
"We will continue to monitor the issue of the prison conditions in Russia, including the situation of those two gentlemen."
"– Commissioner, many thanks for that very detailed reply."
"I would just like to follow up by asking whether the Commission Representation in Moscow has already got in contact with the families of the prisoners, or whether it could do so."
"Secondly, the prisoners have clearly been subjected to unjustified punishments that also contravene Russian law: penalties that could extend their sentences and imprisonment far away from their homes are both contrary to Russian law."
"I would therefore just like to ask you to draw this to the attention of the Russian authorities."
". The lawyer for these two gentlemen contacted our delegation again just last week, and we are of course in ongoing contact."
"I would be pleased to take up the issue you raised in your second question, namely whether the penalties lengthening their sentences and imprisonment too far away from their families are too severe."
"We will happily take that up."
"– Do you not see a connection between the examples of contempt for the freedom of the media, the restrictions on civil society in the new Act on NGOs, the human rights violations in Chechnya and the conditions under which these prisoners are being held?"
"The connection is that they do not actually comply with Russian law."
"These men were convicted in Moscow Oblast, so they should also serve their sentences there, but after their show trial, which I witnessed myself, I do see a connection there."
"If it is possible for something to be treated with contempt here, then it will be."
". Every one of these cases must be assessed separately, for they concern very different things, all of which, of course – as you so rightly say – have to do with universal human rights and people’s fundamental freedoms."
"However, the issue of the NGOs, for one, is very definitely being reviewed, and the legal position on them largely corresponds to that in other countries."
"What matters is the manner in which the laws are applied, and that also, to some extent, is the case with the conditions under which prisoners are held; that too is very much an implementation issue, and that has to be our starting point."
"I should like to ask you about the Khodorkovsky case."
"Recently Anatoly Yermolin, a deputy in the Russian Duma, spoke in the European Parliament and reminded us of the attack on Mikhail Khodorkovsky."
"He was injured recently."
"Mr Yermolin stated that only the attention of Russian democratic forces and especially the democratic countries of the West can save his life."
"Do you think that the Commission is paying enough attention to that case?"
". I can confirm that the Commission will continue to follow the issue of prison conditions in Russia, as I have just pointed out, including the situation of Mr Khodorkovsky and Mr Lebedev."
"It will do so with a view also to considering whether the EU as a whole should raise this matter at the next round of human rights consultations."
"– It was, of course, the dispute about Mr Khodorkovsky that was the ultimate trigger for the current energy policy situation, since it was by nationalising the energy sector and creating a monopoly in it that President Putin exerted pressure."
"What I would like to know is what shape bilateral cooperation with Russia in matters of energy policy will take in the future."
"I can tell the honourable Member that, where energy is concerned, we are only just beginning negotiations, but we have already – at the European Summit in Sochi – addressed in no uncertain terms the important issues of transparency, reciprocity and rules that are fair to all, and these will of course form an important part of the partnership and cooperation agreement, the mandate for which the Commission has just adopted, as soon as we start negotiating with the Russians."
"These basic rules will, then, have an influence, and there will be agreements specific to each sector later on."
"In recent years Iraq has suffered from a distressingly high number of hostage-takings."
"Most reported instances are high profile because they involve foreign aid workers, journalists and reconstruction engineers."
"Yet the number of kidnappings involving foreigners in Iraq is actually very small when compared to the thousands of Iraqis taken hostage."
"Experts agree that the hostage-taking in Iraq is perpetrated by a large number of criminal and terrorist groups for a multitude of reasons – but more often than not the motivation is financial."
"Particularly worrying therefore are the recent indications that a number of EU Member States have paid enormous ransoms to criminal and terrorist groups in return for the freedom of kidnapped nationals."
"The paying of ransoms is a particularly unwelcome and short-sighted step, as far from discouraging hostage-taking, it encourages its proliferation, putting foreigners and Iraqis alike at greater risk."
"In this context, what steps can the Commission take to establish common guidelines and codes of conduct for EU Member States when they are faced with this threat in Iraq and beyond?"
". Of course we very strongly deplore the critical security situation in Iraq and the situation that makes life extremely difficult for Iraqis and for the foreigners there."
"We condemn all forms of violence that hamper the day-to-day life of ordinary Iraqis and prevent the country from entering into the state of peace and stability it really deserves."
"The practice of hostage-taking constitutes a serious threat to the population."
"Informal reports indicate that the reasons for kidnapping range from political to purely criminal motivations and there is no excuse for that."
"Kidnappings are devastating for all those involved and our sympathies are extended to families, friends and colleagues and whoever is affected."
"It is, however, within the competence of the Member States to pursue the individual cases of EU nationals taken hostage."
"Regarding the Iraqi nationals, it is very important that Prime Minister al-Maliki tries to stop the violence through national reconciliation initiatives, although we also have to concede that the situation is not yet stable."
"This is the difficult situation we are in at the moment."
"Certainly paying ransoms is not a viable solution to the problem of hostage-taking in Iraq and the Commission has made it clear that it discourages such action."
"Commissioner, thank you for that full substantive answer, which I fully support."
"I wanted to draw your attention to the kidnapping of a Member of Parliament and minister, Taiseer Najeh Awad al-Mashhandani on Saturday."
"Sadly another minister, the Deputy Minister for Electricity, Mr Raad al-Hareth, was kidnapped this morning with 19 bodyguards."
"As I said in my question and as you have commented, many thousands of ordinary Iraqis out of the sight of the media are kidnapped every day."
"Kidnapping is a crime that leads also to child slavery, to human prostitution internationally, and to child soldiers, as well as to the miseries you have already commented on in Iraq."
"I know that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, which came into being in September 2003, brought out a manual which is being published this year."
"I believe that this action, which only talks about several hundred kidnappings a year, is simply inadequate in the United Nations."
"Can the Commissioner call upon the European Commission delegation to the United Nations, on behalf of all of us, to make very strenuous representations to strengthen the fight by the United Nations against this particularly heinous form of crime?"
". I can only say that I would indeed immediately support such action and I will instruct the Commission delegation to the United Nations to see whether more can be done."
"I completely agree with you: there really are so many heinous acts there that we must all try to do as much as we can."
"However, I have to repeat that ultimately, of course, this is also the responsibility of each and every Member State; but we will certainly try to support those actions that the UN has already taken."
"– Since we know that Iraq is of immense economic importance to us, in other words that it is important not only in terms of the human rights situation but also in terms of the economic situation, what, then, can the Community do to make the country more stable?"
"What Community programmes or cooperation programmes can be put in place to make Iraq more stable and more secure?"
". There are masses of programmes for this purpose."
"The fact is that we have, ever since 2003, been working very hard to stabilise Iraq, and we have spent to date EUR 513 million in doing so."
"We have also, for example, set aside another EUR 200 million for this year, although I have to say that the programmes are very broadly based."
"There are on the one hand programmes that are run through the World Bank and UN funds and are aimed at meeting the population’s basic needs for such things as, for example, education, health care and water."
"There are also, however, programmes the primary object of which is to build up the most important ministries, those being the ministries of commerce and energy."
"Provision is also being made for efforts to make Iraqi society more democratic, such as the elections and referendums, which were held under UN supervision, and for which the Commission gave financial support; we will, of course, continue to strive to make a contribution to national dialogue and reconciliation."
"Another EUR 200 million – which is a lot of money – has been set aside for this year."
"It is now time to begin the practical work in preparation for the renewal of the EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, as the current agreement is due to expire in 2007."
"How does the Commission envisage the future agreement?"
"Is it intended that the agreement will be limited to the four road maps for common spaces?"
"Is it intended to widen the scope of the current agreement or, indeed, to narrow it? How will the Green Paper on a European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy, adopted by the Commission in 2006, be reflected in the new agreement?"
"Various signals are coming out of Russia regarding a possible future agreement."
"Some Russian politicians and political analysts are expressing the opinion that the EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement signed in 1997 was not helpful to Russia because it was unfair and had been dictated by Brussels."
"What is the Commission’s view of statements of this kind?"
". Just today, we have approved a recommendation to the Council with draft negotiating directives for a new agreement with Russia."
"Following internal EU discussions, the Commission then held exploratory talks with Russia, which have now resulted in broad consensus on a general approach."
"As a result of the last EU-Russia Summit in Sochi, we were able to agree on the following."
"Firstly, the aim is to conclude a new, legally-binding, very broad and comprehensive agreement, which should be durable and capable of facilitating the future development of relations."
"Secondly, we would agree to avoid a legal vacuum."
"That means no withdrawal from the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement that exists at the moment."
"We are both committed to implementing the ‘roadmaps for the four common spaces’."
"This agreement should adopt a strategic approach to the relationship and it should emphasise that respect for common values represents an essential basis."
"It should also build on the objectives of these common spaces."
"In particular, we want to include the further development of our trade relations, depending on the progress of Russia’s accession to the WTO."
"Of course, as I said before we want to further consolidate the energy relationship, on the basis of the most important principles, which are reciprocity, fairness and equality."
"Thank you for your answer, Commissioner."
"There are some signs that Russia is increasing the pressure in regard to energy policy."
"For example, a Polish company is now buying a Lithuanian refinery, Mažeikių Nafta, and Russia has immediately started to interrupt the oil supplies."
"Would it be possible during the G8 meeting in St Petersburg to pay attention to the question of energy policy?"
". It is very important to note that this energy question shows that today we have an interdependent relationship with Russia."
"That means that we are an important customer for Russia."
"We buy 25% of its gas, 27% of its oil and some of its uranium."
"That is also highly important for Russia."
"So that will certainly be one of the major questions raised during the G8 meeting with Russia."
"It was also a very important and central question during the Sochi Summit."
"With regard to other questions, there will be a sort of monitoring centre, which will very carefully control and check what has been done on the other side."
"But I believe it is most important that first we find the right principles."
"Those principles should be anchored and then we can fine-tune these questions in sector agreements and take a very concrete approach."
"During yesterday’s meeting with the Finnish Government in Helsinki, Mr Barroso said that a free trade agreement with Russia is possible."
"However, there are some governments who think that this can be achieved only if Russia becomes a full member of the WTO."
"What does the Commission think about this and what is now the way forward after this initiative by Mr Barroso yesterday?"
". I have indeed said before that, in the long term, further development of our trade relations is possible, but it depends on the progress made with regard to Russia’s accession to the WTO."
"Of course, this depends first and foremost on the WTO."
"Then we have to see how we take the idea of a free trade agreement forward."
"It is certainly a mid- to long-term goal, that is clear."
"– Commissioner, you described the situation as regards Russia in a great deal of detail, and I am very grateful to you for that."
"What I would like to know is whether you – or the Commission – think that Russia and other states in its orbit are capable of being reliable partners in the future where the supply of energy is concerned, and – since you have yourself quoted the figures – to what degree the European Union is dependent on either Russia or Ukraine."
"Can we have confidence in their reliability?"
"On the basis of the experience we have had with Russia over many years, its reliability as a partner can be taken as read, but we also have to realise that the difficulties with Ukraine were a wake-up call for us."
"That is why it is so very important that we find, in future, a solution to energy supplies that is both market-based and transparent, for we in the Commission are fundamentally persuaded that, while prices must reflect the market, the adjustment of market prices, among other things, in Ukraine must happen gradually rather than overnight, and that no pressure must be brought to bear."
"I welcome the contribution Directive 2004/38/EC(1) makes with regard to better integration of European citizens."
"However, I regret the use of the expression 'droit de séjour permanent' in French, which is a contradiction in terms as the word 'séjour' implies temporariness."
"Moreover, can the Commission guarantee that full equal treatment of EU citizens and nationals of a country includes the issuing of a real identity document and not simply a residence permit, as is the case in Belgium for example?"
"The residence permit is not of the same value as the identity document and the name itself is scandalous and insulting to citizens who emigrated decades ago and have spent their working life and raised a family in their host country."
"."
"Madam President, the Commission does not believe that the expression ‘right of permanent residence’ is necessarily a contradiction in terms since the notion of residence, which is understood to be the period during which a person lives in a place, may be long, or even permanent."
"Furthermore, this notion has not been the subject of the kind of remarks suggested by Mr Tarabella, whether during the preparation of the text by the Commission, during the discussions on the directive at the Council or here, in the European Parliament."
"As regards the second observation, the Commission notes, as a preliminary point, that, as stipulated in Article 18 of the Treaty and confirmed by the case law of the Court of Justice, the right of residence derives directly from the Treaty for EU citizens whose residence papers serve only to acknowledge that right."
"In line with that idea, one of the major objectives of Directive 2004/38/EC was to simplify the administrative formalities attached to the right of residence."
"In accordance with this text, EU citizens do not have to obtain a residence permit in their Member State of residence, as simply registering with the competent authorities is enough, and this, I might add, is only required if the host Member State deems it necessary."
"In that case, a registration certificate is immediately issued to EU citizens, on presentation of their identity cards or passports and of proof that they fulfil the conditions attached to the right of residence."
"After five years of continuous lawful residence, EU citizens obtain permanent right of residence, which is no longer subject to any conditions, and, if they should request it, the host Member State must send them a document attesting to this right."
"To conclude, as the same Directive 2004/38/EC also stipulates, the Member States, acting in accordance with their legislation, shall issue to their citizens an identity card or passport indicating their nationality or, as the case may be, renew such documents."
"It follows that a host Member State may not issue identity cards, in the strict sense of the word, to non national EU citizens."
"These citizens must always have their identity cards, or passports, as issued by their countries of nationality. These should refer, as stipulated, to their identities and nationalities and, if required by the host Member State, citizens should have a certificate, issued by the latter, stating their right of residence."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for that information."
"I wanted to speak on behalf of the many non-Belgian citizens of the European Union who live in Belgium, and in some cases have been doing so for several decades, who have built their careers and their professional and family lives there and who – although you have replied to me on this matter – actually find the term 'residence' shocking, because they are not ‘residing’: they have chosen that country, which is their host country and will continue to be so until the day they die."
"What may appear shocking, in fact, is that, when these citizens board a plane in Belgium to go to another country in the Union, the document granted to them cannot be used as an identity card, and they are asked for their passports."
"Madam President, this situation, which has been described as ‘shocking’, is certainly one of the consequences of the application of this directive."
"Clearly we are also pursuing what you rightly define as ‘concrete cases’; and I assure you that if we were to establish that there had been violations in the implementation of this directive – which not all Member States have transposed into national legislation – we should exercise the powers that the Commission has in such cases."
"During their meeting in Vienna on 27-28 May, EU Foreign Ministers apparently failed to reach an agreement on a Commission proposal to use the bridging or 'Passerelle' clause of the Nice Treaty to move more competences in Justice and Home Affairs from the third to the first (Community) 'pillar'."
"What is the reaction of the Commission to this failure, and what other concrete proposals will it put forward to increase effectiveness, democracy and transparency in decision-making on JHA issues?"
". The Commission is convinced that the moment has come to make full use of the possibilities offered by the current Treaties and particularly bridging clauses."
"That will set in place the conditions necessary for reaching our goals in the interim period before the entry into force of the Constitutional Treaty."
"However, the Commission can confirm that it is on the whole ready to contribute to the debate on the use of the bridging clauses as shown by covering this matter in the political review of the Hague Programme presented on 28 June."
"Initial reactions from the vast majority of Member States have been very positive, and it came out from the informal meeting of Foreign Ministers of 27 and 28 May that most Member States endorse the Commission’s approach as anticipated in the communication of 10 May on the future of Europe."
"This determination to make progress was confirmed by the June 2006 European Council conclusions, which call upon the incoming Finnish Presidency to explore, in close cooperation with the Commission, the possibility of improving decision-making and action in the area of freedom, justice and security, on the basis of existing treaties."
"However, this is clearly an issue that needs to be carefully prepared at the highest political level."
"The Commission welcomes the intention of the Finnish Presidency to have an in-depth debate as the logical next step."
"The Commission is convinced that Parliament will help to stimulate this debate as usual in institutional matters."
"I know that President Borrell has recently again encouraged the Commission to take such a way forward."
"I am convinced that it is a matter of the utmost importance for the Parliament and a unique opportunity to bring freedom, security and justice matters closer to the citizens, thus increasing the efficiency, transparency and accountability of the legislative process."
"You will probably know that just yesterday the Prime Minister of Finland confirmed, at our meeting in Helsinki, his full determination and the determination of the Finnish Presidency to hold further discussions, starting with the informal Council of Interior Ministers, which will take place in Tampere at the end of the September."
"Thank you, Commissioner Frattini."
"In the six weeks since I tabled this question much has happened, especially the Frattini package of last week, if we can call it that."
"I sincerely congratulate you and the Commission on that excellent package of four bold and ambitious papers."
"Have you considered how we might reach out to citizens with a communication strategy to make sure that they understand the situation – not the arcane details, but that they understand, for instance, that Member States have not implemented the anti-terrorism laws?"
"Pressure needs to be put on their governments to translate the rhetoric into action, to achieve progress on fighting crime and terrorism and upholding human rights."
". Yes, of course we are thinking about this communication strategy."
"In my own view, the best way to show the public how important it is to abolish powers of veto is to give them concrete examples."
"One such example is an initiative concerning a minimum standard with regard to procedural rights, where we are still in a stalemate after two years of discussion precisely because of the unanimity system."
"Again, for example, when we talk about cross-border police cooperation, we are still blocked after 18 months of very difficult discussions because of unanimity."
"These are concrete examples for the public."
"Does the public think it is useful to have procedural rights or police cooperation at European level?"
"Then please help us."
"How do you propose to ensure all this cooperation and informing of the public, if the Commission is behind in preparing an information system, which would allow the Schengen Agreement to work in the new and old Member States, so that information can be exchanged?"
"In Lithuania, we have heard that the new Member States will not be able to join Schengen on schedule and the package you proposed just now will probably be difficult to implement because there is no information system in place which would hold the required data."
"."
"Madam President, I can only confirm what the Council of Europe stated just a few days ago: that is, our pledge to make every effort to meet that deadline of autumn 2007."
"I am aware that there are some technical problems, but I am also aware of the political decision that the Council of Europe confirmed some days ago, which we are obliged to respect and to cause to be respected."
"We are committed to this."
"There is really very little interest shown in the issue of disabled persons serving prison sentences."
"To all intents and purposes, no EU programme even those such as the programme to combat social exclusion, the programme to combat discrimination, the employment incentive measures programme, eContent or the European Social Fund covers the issue of the social rehabilitation of disabled prisoners."
"Furthermore, very little of substance is to be found in EU documents from 2003 which, as everyone knows, was the year of the disabled."
"There is thus an obvious need for the Council, Commission and Parliament to address this important issue."
"I should accordingly like to know what stage has been reached in the drafting of appropriate EU regulations governing disabled persons in prisons."
"One of the most pressing needs is for appropriate educational programmes to be introduced with a view to enabling such persons to adjust to labour market requirements."
". Competence concerning disability is generally a matter for Member States under the subsidiarity principle."
"The needs of all people with disabilities are taken into account in all Community policies in order to achieve equal treatment."
"These include disabled ex-prisoners."
"The importance of employment opportunities for people with disabilities is well recognised and is reflected not only in the European employment strategy but also by the European Council."
"You will remember its conclusions of spring 2006."
"In terms of other programmes, the Commission’s disability action plan contained in its Communication COM(2005)604 outlines what has been done with respect to all people with disabilities in the European Union."
"Concerning the possible competence of the European Union under the third pillar, there is currently no EU legislation governing the status of disabled persons in prisons."
"That is mainly due to the fact that any action on judicial cooperation in criminal matters that aims at approximating rules applicable in Member States is, according to the available legal basis, conditional upon the requirement that such an action is necessary to improve cooperation between the Member States."
"Many proposals made by the Commission provided for in the Hague Action Plan aim at facilitating the social rehabilitation of offenders, even if they are not specifically devoted to the rehabilitation of disabled prisoners."
"There is, for example, a project presented by Austria, Finland and Sweden on the transfer of prisoners."
"I will consider, together with my colleague Mr Špidla, how measures undertaken or planned in this area of competence could be supported and complemented by measures that can be taken under the third pillar."
"Madam President, I would like to ask a general question."
"If, in accordance with the rule of law, the disabled are quite rightly obliged to respect the law like all other citizens – they can be sent to prison, for example – why do the principles of equal participation not apply to the job market?"
"Why are disabled people not given the full opportunity to make use of their qualifications?"
"Why can modern democracies not meet the standards expected of civilised societies in this matter?"
"Madam President, I am well aware of these real problems."
"I believe that action by Europe outside the ambit of obligatory European laws, which cannot be introduced in this area, can be offered in the context of the struggle against discrimination."
"We are ready to look at any possibility, including measures that would help the social rehabilitation of ex-prisoners. As I have said, I shall consider this with Mr Špidla."
"The dismissal by the Wackenhut Security Transport Company of Petros Kefalas a trade union activist, the Secretary-General of a Company Employees and White Collar Workers Union and a leading company unionist, for lodging a protest with the Director-General against the unfair dismissal of a colleague, was a retaliatory measure designed to intimidate the workforce and discourage union militancy at the workplace."
"The dismissal was the work of a 'tripartite coordination body representing the government and the two sides of industry' which is now seeking to 'legalise' the measure with the 'endorsement' of the SEB Confederation of Greek Industry whose members are subjecting employees to intimidation and harassment."
"What view does the Commission take of such punitive dismissals of trade unionists and the climate of intimidation being created at the workplace and what does it think of moves to restore trade union backing for Petros Kefalas?"
"Madam President, freedom of association is a general principle of Community law; the European Court of Justice has clearly recognised this."
"There is an important article – Article 12 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union – which envisages the right to freedom of association at all levels, in particular in trade union matters."
"Freedom of association must therefore always be respected."
"We also have Article 137 of the Treaty of Rome, which more specifically states that its provisions shall not apply to the right of association."
"What is the consequence?"
"There exists a freedom of association very clearly set out in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights; but the Treaty does not acknowledge the authority of the Commission to intervene, for example, against a private business that violates the right of association."
"In these cases it is the task of the national authorities, and in particular the judiciary, to guarantee respect for this right."
"This is clearly a matter to be resolved by the courts, simply because there is no concrete provision in the Treaty that would empower the Commission to intervene."
"– Commissioner, punitive dismissals of workers are becoming general practice."
"The company Wackenhut, following the dismissal of the trade unionist Petros Kefalas, unleashed a new action against Nikos Besis, which is still ongoing."
"A short while ago, I left a hearing of trade unionists who represent workers at the Opel car factory."
"Over and above the individual differences which exist, Opel too is threatening to dismiss thousands of workers."
"In our opinion, the new employment legislation being formulated is also creating and inflating the sails for the dismissal of thousands of workers."
"What measures is the Commission taking in order to safeguard trade union representation and the application of employment legislation to job targets?"
"Madam President, you have excluded me from the list."
"My question was included on the list."
"If that is what the Commissioner wants, then I will bow to his wishes, but if it was your decision, Madam President, then you should know that it is genuinely unacceptable to thus deny a Member of Parliament the opportunity to debate in this House with the Commissioner."
"I would also inform you that you have not asked me to take the floor for six months now."
"That cannot be so, Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, for we have very often both been here for Question Time, and I know that I have very often given you the floor, since you are among those who – I am very glad to say – are very assiduous participants in it."
"Nevertheless, the fact is that we can still only have questions in blocks of time, with twenty minutes per Commissioner; that is how it is laid down in our Rules of Procedure, and the second part, with questions to Commissioner Frattini, had taken us well over twenty minutes already."
"It is at that point that I have to interrupt."
"The questions will be answered in writing."
"We have now moved on to the third part of Question Time, as the Rules of Procedure require."
"I am sorry."
"There is nothing intentional about this."
"Madam President, I should like simply to confirm to the honourable Member that the definition of trade union representatives and therefore their protection is a definition that exists in a large majority of Member States. From this it clearly follows that tangible protection is feasible."
"I share your general concern about dismissals carried out as reprisals against trade unionists."
"In many countries the judiciary takes very firm and decisive action in such cases."
"I believe that when grounds of reprisal have been ascertained, the judiciary should take particularly strong measures."
"It is the only possible course of action, but such action may not be taken by the institutions of the European Union."
"Article 20 of Law 3301/2004 (Greek Government Gazette 263, 23 December 2004) exempts the Greek Government, local authorities and legal persons governed by public law from the obligation of executing certain types of court judgment, such as interlocutory measures and orders for payment."
"Article 4E of Law 3388/2005 (Greek Government Gazette 225, 12 September 2005) extends this exemption to include legal persons governed by private law in the broader public sector."
"Legal commentators claim that these provisions infringe citizens' rights."
"In its answer to a previous question (E-4752/05), the Commission stated that: 'Before the Commission can submit any comments on this legislation, it is necessary to complete its examination of the documentation that has just been received and if necessary also ask the Greek Government for clarifications.'"
"Has the Commission examined this matter?"
"What are its comments on the provisions concerned at this point?"
"Does it consider that they are consistent with Community legislation?"
"What measures does it propose to take?"
"Madam President, we have replied to a previous written question."
"I can only confirm to the questioner that we received the supplementary documentation from the complainant not long ago."
"The subject is extremely complicated, in that it involves different areas of Community law."
"This is why – as I have been informed – the Commission staff have not yet finished their study of the supplementary documentation."
"I can assure the questioner that our intention is to speed up considerably the study of these supplementary observations and to give a definitive response, even though this is a matter of extreme legal complexity."
"– That is more or less what you replied about a year ago, that you are examining the matter."
"I therefore ask you: when we have laws prohibiting the enforcement of judgments by the Greek courts vindicating workers in matters of insurance measures and payment orders, how does the Commission have the right to filibuster and procrastinate, thereby justifying the arbitrariness of the Greek Government at the expense of Greek justice?"
"A short while ago, in reply to my honourable friend Mr Toussas, you said that it was a matter for the courts."
"When the law prevents the enforcement of court judgments, will the Commission again remain inert?"
"Madam President, honourable Member, I wish to express my regret in this connection and can also understand your disappointment."
"We started to study these supplementary documents the moment they reached us, that is to say at the end of last year, in December 2005."
"Like you, I am perfectly aware that a long time has elapsed; but there are – according to what I have been told – legal difficulties that do not only concern the regulation that the complainant considers to have been violated."
"There are other provisions that are affected; and I can only tell you that I shall pass on a request to the competent Directorate-General and to Mr Špidla that this technical study should be considerably speeded up."
"Like you, I am aware of the situation."
"– Madam President, my question is not a supplementary question on this matter;"
"I too merely wish to express my surprise, because I had question number 54; this is my second term of office at the European Parliament and this is the first time in my experience that the list setting out the order of questions has not been adhered to as announced."
"I too would like you to tell me if this is an invention of yours today or something you are being accustomed to, something you have the right to do because, if it is, then we too have no need to carefully monitor the order of questions in order to be ready to come and listen to the Commission's reply."
"I thank you in advance and trust that this will not happen again, because it is an insult to us, given that we submit our questions in time and respectfully wait our turn."
"As you yourself said, that was not a supplementary question, but I really would ask you to have another look at what the Rules of Procedure say about how Question Time is organised."
"It was conducted perfectly correctly, and the order of questions was not disrupted."
"Those questions that cannot be dealt with orally will be answered in writing, and your Question No 54 will be one of those that gets a written reply."
"– Madam President, I should like to ask the Commissioner to organise evening classes for the honourable Members on what comes within the jurisdiction of the Member States and what comes within the jurisdiction of the Commission, so that the honourable Members do not have to keep asking the Commission to act as guardian on national matters."
"Madam President, my answer is simple: I absolutely will not allow myself either to request lessons or to give them to anybody, still less to this Parliament."
"I am listening respectfully to what you are telling me."
"– It really is a serious matter when an honourable friend from Greece expresses herself in such a manner against her fellow Members in plenary."
"Allow me to say the following, without political chitchat and with a sense of responsibility and a sense of the time which is so valuable to us all: the European Commission and the Council and numerous members on the opposite bank have very pragmatic sensory organs in their concern to address problems which have to do with employers, and the mechanisms of the European Commission and the Council and the Member States are quickly activated."
"However, when it comes to the workers' problems, we see deliberate filibustering ..."
"Since that is not a point of order, I shall not allow the honourable Member to speak further."
"Further to its answer at the February II part-session to my question H-0060/06(2), what response did the Commission receive from the Irish authorities to its request for 'further clarification' with regard to the transposition by Ireland of the Posting of Workers Directive (96/71/EC)(3)?"
"Does the Commission now believe that the directive has been correctly and fully transposed by Ireland in line with the criteria established by case law of the European Court of Justice?"
"What action has the Commission now taken or is it proposing to take in this matter?"
". Following the Commission’s reply to the honourable Member’s question earlier this year, we have asked the Irish authorities for clarification as to the implementation in Ireland of Directive 96/71/EC."
"The deadline for the submission of observations by the Irish authorities has not yet passed."
"Once these observations have been received, the Commission will assess them and of course, if necessary, decide on a further course of action."
"In the meantime, we have adopted a new communication concerning guidance on the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services."
"In this communication we have announced the adoption in spring 2007 of a report that will examine the situation in all Member States, of course including Ireland."
"Would the Commissioner agree that at this time, when migration throughout the European Union is increasing, implementation of the posting of workers directive is crucial in order to ensure that there is no race to the bottom and that migrant workers are not exploited by unscrupulous employers?"
"That is unfortunately what is happening in Ireland at the moment, as a result of the failure of the Irish Government to properly implement this posting of workers directive."
"Madam President, honourable Member, I certainly share your opinion that full and firm application of the directive on the posting of workers is essential."
"I too am totally convinced that inconvenience to workers who are posted and transferred must be completely and fully avoided."
"That is why, as has already been said, we are not confining our study to individual cases like the one that has been verified in Ireland, which we are assessing specifically; we have decided to carry out a full appraisal, country by country, of the extent to which the directive has been put into effect."
"This is because, as you have said, we cannot limit ourselves to one specific case that has developed into a crisis: we must know whether and to what extent Member States are fully applying this directive, which is very important."
"On the issue of the race to the bottom, I should like to ask you to comment on the statement by the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, when he said that when enlargement happens in January, Ireland may not open the market to workers from Romania and Bulgaria, because other Member States are not so doing and because of the concerns as to what will happen to the Irish market in relation to this race to the bottom and the rights of workers."
"Could you comment on that in particular, and would you urge other Member States to do what Ireland did in relation to the new Member States already here?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I can only say that Ireland, which up till now has been one of the few Member States to recognise the full right to mobility of workers from the new Member States, has not encountered any particular inconvenience as a consequence of this decision."
"You know perfectly well, honourable Member, that the Commission gives strong encouragement to all states – let us say the old Member States of the European Union – to open their labour markets to the new Member States of the European Union and their workers."
"We have found – Mr Špidla has done so in one of his documents – that the flow of workers between the new Member States and those old Member States that now permit it is not so great that it is likely to distort the working conditions and internal labour market of those countries, which also include Ireland."
"I do not wish to comment on what the Prime Minister has said; but I will say that the Commission envisages that countries must recognise – even if after a transitional period, which we hope will be brief – that the citizens of the new Member States of the European Union have the right to free movement."
"The point I would like to raise with the Commissioner relates to the whole question of the transposition and implementation of directives."
"One of the problems with the refusal by Member States to implement or transpose directives is the Commission’s tardiness in taking punitive action against such Member States."
"The whole process of taking effective action against those who refuse to implement Community law needs to be speeded up urgently."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the Commission’s attitude reflects its need to understand the situation before taking any decisions."
"We are dealing with a complicated subject."
"Next spring, when we shall have an overall appraisal of the stage reached in the application of the directive, we shall take action against those states who do not apply it or who apply it incorrectly."
"This does not rule out the possibility that in individual cases, such as the one in Ireland that has been brought to our attention, the Commission will have specific powers to take action against the country if the responses given to us are unsatisfactory or if, despite the responses of the Irish Government, it emerges that there has been a violation or a non-application of the directive."
"It is clear, however, that the Commission must know exactly how things stand before taking any initiatives, especially if such initiatives lead to action against a Member State."
"We are talking here of a cardinal principle of the rule of law: if there is an accusation against anyone, for example a country, they must be put in a position to defend themselves before judgment can be passed on them."
"The next item is the report by Mr Calabuig Rull on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on a policy framework to strengthen EU manufacturing – towards a more integrated approach for industrial policy (2006/2003(INI)) (A6-0206/2006)."
"Mr President, in reality, in all of the debates on reports that have taken place today, we are discussing the same thing."
"Firstly, the restructuring and relocation of industry and the impact of funds aimed at alleviating this situation; secondly, innovation; and now, once again, strengthening the manufacturing industry in the European Union."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no question that European industry is currently facing a process of globalisation of the economy that is making competition conditions increasingly tough."
"As far as I can see, nobody doubts the fact that, the more competition there is, the better the final prices for citizens."
"Nevertheless, jobs in certain European industrial sectors, in particular SMEs, are under threat as a result of structural problems that must be tackled."
"The European Commission’s Communication is an important step in terms of ensuring that the Lisbon Strategy reaches the manufacturing sector."
"Europe has a high level of external openness, but Community exports mainly come from medium-level technology sectors, unlike US and Japanese exports, which are predominantly high-technology exports."
"Furthermore, our specialisation indices differentiate us from our main competitors and make us vulnerable in a series of sectors."
"We have recently seen, for example, textiles, footwear, furniture, construction and ceramics in this kind of disadvantageous situation."
"Political and cross-sectoral initiatives are of course necessary in order to improve the conditions for this sector, in the fields of research, training, innovation, patents, access to third-country markets, combating unfair competition practices when they take place and reciprocity in external trade."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur and the other Members for the new ideas that they have contributed to this document."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe’s industrial sector is a pillar of the Union’s economic system."
"The manufacturing industry in the European Union, which accounts for a fifth of production, employs some 34 million people; and three-quarters of exported goods are manufactured products."
"We can therefore define manufacturing as the decisive factor for our economy. For this reason I consider that the greater part of manufacturing production should remain in Europe."
"This will not come about spontaneously; favourable conditions need to be created."
"The basic requirements are therefore investment, research and innovation."
"Although the manufacturing sector invests in research and industrial innovation, the total amount of this investment is not enough to sustain competitiveness with other countries."
"More financial resources are required, and we need a European space for research and a single market for researchers."
"Nevertheless, research and innovation are not sufficient to guarantee a strong European industry: we also need different policies, which should be synergistic and coherent."
"I am talking about identifying international practices that are likely to have a negative impact on the competitiveness of European businesses."
"The European Commission has recently published a document stating that there is evidence of serious distortions of the market, for example in the footwear sector in China – and, I would add, not only there – and the document speaks of direct state intervention in the management of businesses, specially favourable tax breaks and interest-free loans."
"I am against dirigisme and protectionist policies. Like Mr Mandelson, I support a free market – but a free market with rules for all, not just for some."
"I request that this principle should underlie European policies, starting with international trade policies, especially when there are confirmed cases of unfair competition and counterfeiting."
"The challenges of the global economy also apply to European industry and need to be solved quickly."
"I am pleased that the Commission has responded to the situation faced by EU industry and has put forward policy provisions to strengthen EU manufacturing."
"Significantly, the Commission stresses that there are industrial policy problems which must be solved at European level."
"These are matters of competition, common market regulation and social and economic cooperation."
"In truth, we need a new approach to industrial policy."
"With national and corporate competence, EU industry is expanding sectors, which use medium and high level technology and low or medium qualified labour, and therefore, is becoming less competitive when compared to countries with growing economies."
"However, the implementation of a new approach requires long-term action."
"Member States cannot reorganise their economies in a day."
"This is particularly true for the new Member States."
"In WTO talks on China's membership, the EU was represented by the European Commission which did not take into account future members' industrial situation."
"Paradoxically, the EU has a common trade policy, but does not have a common industrial policy."
"The textile, leather, footwear and furniture sector operations forecast in the Commission's communication are based only on research into competitiveness, the economic situation and place of manufacture, while, at a horizontal level it is forecast that these sectors will be reorganised."
"However, the results of this possible reorganisation will be of use to those companies which have transferred production or to countries which do not see a future for industry in the EU."
"This is demonstrated by the Commission's anti-dumping research, which aims to take into account the interests of businesses that have transferred production beyond the EU."
"Meanwhile, Member States’ industry is left to face unfair competition."
"Thus, the Commission should not prepare decisions, which contradict a communication that it has prepared itself, and implement protectionism of separate business representatives."
"In addition, I urge the Commission to prepare a long-term forecast and guidelines for the competitive development of EU industry during 2030-2050."
"– Mr President, I consider the Commission's systematic and analytical approach to the matter to be very important."
"I also consider that the report by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has made some important points."
"I shall reiterate some on which I tabled amendments and which form part of the text."
"1."
"Trade: this is an important link in the manufacturing chain and, together with services, demands suitable attention."
"2."
"Evaluation: systematic evaluation of initiatives, such as by high-level groups, innovation panels and working parties, can give us useful conclusions."
"3."
"Nano sciences and nano technologies: their role can be decisive for all sectors of European industry and this should be borne in mind."
"4."
"Primary wealth, research potential and any other comparative advantage of each area must be taken into serious account in local strategy plans."
"Finally, I am sorry that the following two points which, I believe, are important, were not adopted:"
"Point one: I consider that it would be useful if environmental technologies were a separate sector in the 27 sectors being studied."
"Point two: I consider it necessary to link training provided with the dynamic needs of the market both in terms of the number of trainees and the subject of training courses."
"Finally, I would like to congratulate and thank the rapporteur on the seriousness with which he approached the matter."
"Mr President, it would be a tragedy if Europe confined itself to developing only the services sector."
"As we all know, in today’s environment there is an intertwining of different sectors, be they manufacturing, services or trade."
"The document states that the manufacturing industry in Europe provides employment for 34 million people and 20% of EU output."
"I do not think that the figures are ones to be proud of: they should be higher."
"In fact, in my own country – the smallest in the European Union – the relative percentages are even higher."
"However, we must welcome the positive side."
"Firstly, the manufacturing industry is being seen as a generator of new innovative products; secondly, there is the development of a coherent industrial policy at European level."
"On the negative side, the Structural Funds could go a long way to strengthening industry and, therefore, I disagree entirely with the cut in the amount to be allocated under the financial perspectives."
"I believe that countries that are less rich can attain the 3% threshold we have set by using part of the Structural Funds themselves, which would lead in the direction of cohesion."
"Secondly, more importance must be given to market access."
"It is useless to have a shop with state-of-the-art equipment if you have no customers."
"To conclude, we must believe in European manufacturing: it has potential for wealth and jobs."
"However, we must also take decisions that are difficult: decisions to change and adapt to the new realities of the industrial environment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party."
"Within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy and the ambitious objectives that it sets in connection with development and competitiveness, and taking account of the central role played by small and medium-sized enterprises in the European economic scene, I consider that some of the comments made by the rapporteur are of fundamental importance."
"I refer in particular to the theme of complementarity between the global and the local approaches."
"Like the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I acknowledge that local specialities and characteristic products and workmanship are the life-blood of the European manufacturing sector. The value that they add stands out in the international trade scene."
"The promotion of each country’s specialities in terms of human and material resources will thus enable us to tackle the low level of certain competencies in Europe and the drain of know-how and skills away from the regions where they belong."
"Taking these specialities as a starting point, we shall gradually be able to take more vigorous action against dumping in order to provide concrete support to revitalise the internal market."
"Integrated strategies and action plans, such as those launched by the European Union and the United States against counterfeiting and the piracy of intellectual property, can be best put into practice through local strategic plans."
"Starting with these, it will be possible to work hard to achieve the protection of all workers and their specific requirements. This is a ongoing imperative in the regulation of European and world trade."
"Mr President, when we debate European industry there may be cause to ask the question, ‘where are our leading industries today?’"
"They are in those areas where we have opened up to a global economy."
"Europe’s very strongest industry is to be found in those areas and in those companies that are active throughout the world."
"In other words, I believe that there is reason to emphasise what has been said in the debate in this House today, namely that the European economy is more dependent than other parts of the world on the global economy."
"Without the global economy Europe would not have the manufacturing industry that we have today."
"It is against this background that I would like to state that there are three important points to make when we debate the future of European industry."
"The first point is that competition is the best basis for innovation and for new industrial structures."
"When we look back, it is indisputable that it is through being open to enterprising spirit and to entrepreneurs that Europe has seen its biggest and strongest industries rise and prosper."
"Secondly, it is important for us to ensure that we open the way for the next generation of companies, be they in the manufacturing industry or the services industry, which will in any case come together in the future."
"This says a great deal about what we have to do before the various free trade negotiations and the WTO negotiations."
"We must not pursue a policy that involves us protecting old-established industry, which will not provide the new jobs of the future."
"We must instead open the way for European companies to be active throughout the world."
"This means, in particular, in the global economy, where we will see a billion and then further billions of people develop into heavyweight consumers."
"If Europe and European industry do not have full access to the market developing there then we will not be able to have the leading industry in the world."
"We would then be condemning ourselves to the fate of becoming a regional economy."
"We thus need an openness that ensures that Europe can be a world-beating economy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what we are discussing today is something that has to do with our future, and it is the Lisbon Agenda that clearly defines what that future is to be."
"What we want is new jobs and growth, and in order to achieve those things, we need, quite simply, the world’s markets, on which we need to be able to sell our products and services."
"The Doha negotiations – which in fact have to do with the ‘Singapore issues’ and aim at reducing customs duties and quotas and opening up markets – are currently undergoing a very grave crisis."
"Quite naturally, or so I believe, much of our industrial policy is decided on the global market, and hence the great worry about whether the Doha round will be completed, and how things stand with Kyoto, about whether we have yet carried out all the economic analyses that will assure us that achieving the Kyoto targets really will contribute to growth and to the success of the Lisbon Strategy."
"When it comes to the possibilities for investment and for the creation of jobs in Europe, we are talking here in terms of hundreds of billions."
"We have spent years debating our budget for the years leading up to 2013 and have worked it out in very precise detail."
"I have to be perfectly honest and say that what I find lacking where major decisions such as Kyoto are concerned is any debate on the substance."
"We debated the Basel II package, which is now being implemented in Europe, although not elsewhere."
"While we must, in particular, protect our own industry’s intellectual property, we must also, at the same time, use these same rights as a means to greater success internationally."
"We had a debate this morning on how we might make structural improvements to our industries, and this is where the tradition of family firms, in which investment carries on from one generation to another, and which create markets in each succeeding generation, is so very important, and we must not forget these small and medium-sized businesses."
"This ought to be a major consideration as we look to the future."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m."
"The next item is the recommendation for a second reading by the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the Council common position with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and the Council laying down technical requirements for inland waterway vessels and repealing Council Directive 82/714/EEC (13274/1/2005 C6-0091/2006 1997/0335(COD)) (Rapporteur: Renate Sommer) (A6-0208/2006)."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, everyone has gone to watch the football, and I wish I were with them, since the match is being played in my electoral district in the beautiful Ruhr, but it must not be forgotten that there is something venerable about the directive that we are considering and it is to that that we must give our undivided attention, for the work of this House must not be allowed to take second place to football, even to a footballing event like this one."
"As we now move to the second reading of the draft directive on the technical requirements for inland waterway vessels, we are handling a relic from the previous century, for it was as long ago as December 1997 that the Commission submitted a proposal in respect of the previous directive, 82/714/EEC, which was superannuated even then, but is still in force today, and this proposal’s first reading in this House was in October 1998."
"Then, on 1 May 1999, came the Treaty of Amsterdam, and with it codecision on transport matters, and so the first reading had to be repeated in September 1999, although Parliament reiterated its position from the ‘first’ first reading – a never ending story!"
"A few months into the new century, in July 2000, the Commission came up with a modified draft, which took account of Parliament’s wishes."
"What is this all about?"
"It has to do with creating, once and for all, the same conditions everywhere for European inland waterway transport, the intention being that updated technical requirements should ensure that traffic on Europe’s internal waterways is safe and problem-free."
"In order to do this, the Community’s technical requirements had to be harmonised with the standards governing navigation of the Rhine, for safety considerations had previously led the Central Commission for the Navigation of the Rhine not to recognise the technical approval of vessels on the basis of the former directive."
"The directive to be revised – 82/714/EEC – also has other defects, among them the fact that it does not apply to passenger ships and floating plant such as construction vessels, and the safety requirements are, of course, as they were in the 1970s."
"Free shipping on all the EU’s inland waterways is, however, dependent on the harmonisation of the technical requirements and safety standards with the highest standard, and that applies not only to the free movement of goods but also to the guaranteeing of high safety, environmental and social standards."
"Until now, Community law has been capable of being applied only where the provisions of the Convention of Mannheim are not in force; that Convention, which was signed on 17 October 1868, determined the principles that still largely apply today to the navigation of the Rhine, although the Central Commission for the Navigation of the Rhine had already been constituted under an annex to the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna in 1815."
"Up to now, then, the EU has been unable to adopt any legislative act applicable to the Rhine, even though 80% of all goods transported on European inland waterways travel on it."
"Only since an additional protocol to the Mannheim Convention entered into force in December 2004 has the mutual recognition of ships’ certificates been possible, and, in fact, the most important aspect of the new directive is the introduction of a standard ship’s certificate for inland waterway vessels within the EU."
"That has something to do with legal certainty."
"There were still a few problems with the inclusion of sports boats of between 20 and 24 metres in length, which might well fall within the scope of both this directive and the so-called sports boats directive, No 94/25/EC, although this latter directive governs trade in sports boats and is, then, an internal market directive regulating the access of sports boats to the market."
"The revised directive on technical requirements for inland waterway vessels goes further than what is laid down in the sports boats directive only where safety considerations on inland waterways make this necessary, and so it does not contradict its provisions."
"I might add that experience with sports boat traffic on the Rhine shows that the owners of sports boats have no problems with those rules applicable to the Rhine that are comparable to the technical regulations in the revised directive."
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism took the line that the technical regulations in the annex to the directive, including those in Chapter 15, ‘Special provisions for passenger vessels’, which, because of protracted negotiations and long translation times are still as they were during the 2004 negotiations, should be covered by the comitology procedure."
"The committee was in favour of an amendment to this effect, that being the only way in which it can be ensured that the harmonisation of the existing legal systems can be accomplished without delay and also that industry and trade be afforded legal certainty, and so I ask you to give your support to this one amendment at second reading too."
"In conclusion, I would like to use this opportunity to express to the Council and the Commission, but also, of course, to my colleagues, my warmest thanks for their good cooperation on this dossier."
"In thanking the House for its attention, all I can say now is ‘ship ahoy!’"
"Mr President, Mrs Sommer, whom I consider heroic for taking part in the debate at this hour, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that there is broad consensus today on the Commission's proposal, and this thanks to the political will of all of the parties and to the cooperation of the technical experts."
"I want to thank you, Mrs Sommer, for your personal and important contribution to building this consensus."
"The Community legislation harmonising the technical requirements for inland waterway vessels dates back to 1982."
"This legislation provides for a certificate with which an inland waterway vessel may navigate on any EU waterway, except the Rhine."
"However, two thirds of transport by inland waterway in Europe takes place on the Rhine."
"Our proposal, which dates back to 1997, therefore has three objectives:"
"Firstly, to update the technical requirements with a view to bringing the safety of vessels in line with technological progress;"
"Secondly, to make it possible in the future for the Community certificate to be recognised for navigation on the Rhine;"
"Thirdly, to establish a comitology procedure for regularly adjusting the technical requirements in the future, in the light of technological progress and of the development of the rules in force on the Rhine."
"This matter remained at a standstill for a long time within the Council because of the issue of admitting vessels with Community certificates to navigation on the Rhine."
"Once this point was resolved, however, the Council was able to reach a political agreement."
"The adoption of this directive will be a real step forward in terms of harmonising the rules, which is what we call for in the NAIADE action plan."
"It will make it possible to implement a single system for the entire network of European Union waterways."
"The technical requirements will be harmonised to ensure a high level of safety, particularly for passenger ships."
"The future validity of the Community certificate on the Rhine will promote competition and will create genuinely fair conditions for river transport within the internal market."
"We will maintain this level in the future, in cooperation with the Central Commission for the Navigation of the Rhine."
"As for the amendment adopted by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, we support it, and I am delighted that a compromise has been reached among the three institutions."
"I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to assure you that the Commission is aware of the anxieties expressed by some owners of large recreational craft in certain Member States."
"The text that you will adopt will make it possible for the majority of these concerns to be addressed."
"Unlike Directive 94/25/EC, which provides for market access for recreational craft in the Community, the new directive on technical requirements for inland waterway vessels, for its part, provides for safety of navigation on all waterways."
"A 20-metre long vessel warrants requirements additional to those needed simply for marketing."
"Moreover, excluding recreational craft less than 24 metres – and not 20 metres – long from the scope of the directive would render the rules applicable on the Rhine different from those applicable on other Community waterways."
"That could cause problems when it comes to recognising the Community certificate for navigation on the Rhine and could stand in the way of the idea of having a single certificate for vessels in the Community, namely the Community certificate."
"Finally, the directive permits a number of derogations for existing recreational craft."
"I am specifically responding to Mr Watson on this point, as he was the person who drew my attention to it: existing recreational craft may continue to operate provided that their breach of the requirements does not represent an obvious danger."
"I would add that Article 7 permits those Member States whose inland waterways are not connected to the waterways of other Member States to depart from all or part of this directive."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I can, in any event, assure you that the Commission will ensure that it pays special attention in the comitology procedure to the chapter on recreational craft, in order both to prevent any contradiction of, or incompatibility with, Directive 94/25/EC and to clarify and shed light on any points that may seem unclear."
"."
"Mr President, as the rapporteur said in her introductory remarks, a happy outcome is worth waiting for, and she was not wrong in that."
"The document currently before us, and, in particular, that which this House could – and did – contribute to it, is something that can help promote free inland waterway shipping, and that free inland waterway shipping is what we need."
"If we want to make the flow of traffic through Europe more generally compatible with the environment, we need proper rules, consistent with each other, for inland waterway transport, and the Commission, in its midterm review, is quite insistent on that – Vice-President Barrot should take note of the fact that I was listening very carefully the last time."
"What is called for, however, is not just one single regulation, but the interlinking of all rules applicable to inland shipping, and we must make improvements to the planning of routes, that is to say, the TENs, to the support frameworks – including Marco Polo II – and, not least, the technical rules and regulations, and must bring them up to present-day standards."
"A happy outcome is worth waiting for, and our group, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, thanks Mrs Sommer, the rapporteur, for the valuable work she has done."
"We hope there will be large majorities tomorrow, and will play our part in bringing them about."
"We will have a few more things to do to the network."
"As you have just said, Mr Vice-President, Naiades is the next draft act whereby we have to ensure that the opportunities are actually used and that Europe’s waterways as a whole can make a substantial and constructive contribution towards handling the flows of traffic."
"What is important in this regard, particularly in relation to Naiades, is that we must not concentrate only on Western Europe: rather, especially now that the Danube is open, we must ensure that the whole European waterways network may grow together into a sound, proper and safe unity."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, reference has already been made to the Naiades action programme, and that which we have not yet negotiated today will at last accord inland waterways the attention and support on the part of the European legislator that are rightfully due to them."
"Today, of course, we are taking a less spectacular decision, but one that is nevertheless long overdue, in that this House, at second reading, will be agreeing to the harmonisation of technical regulations for inland vessels, thus bringing to an end a legislative process that has been going on for nine years now."
"This directive adapts Community standards to the more extensive ones contained in the Convention on the Navigation of the Rhine, and this, as we see it, guarantees free competition on all internal waterways with the same high safety standards applying in every instance."
"At first reading, and in the Common Position, this House and the Council made various amendments."
"Like the rapporteur, to whom I am most grateful for her report, I, too, take the view that these amendments are generally acceptable and add to the original Commission proposal in a reasonable way."
"We endorse the view expressed by Mr Grosch and Mrs Wortmann-Kool in their amendment on the subject, that certain types of vessel are subject to two sets of legislation, and, even though we have now been advised that the two sets of legislation are quite different, we do nevertheless think that the amendment is sound, and what we would welcome at the earliest possible opportunity is the revision of the technical annexes of the relevant directives in order to remove the duplication."
"Apart from that, what both my group and I want is for the legislation to be completed without delay."
". – Mr President, inland shipping is on the up and that is a good thing."
"We in this House can do no other than heartily welcome such a substantial contribution to sustainable, safe and competitive transport through Europe, for it cannot be taken as granted that transport will be like that; it is important that the right conditions be created for it."
"Mrs Sommer's report provides one of the necessary building blocks, for harmonised technical regulations for transit on internal waterways mean equal conditions for everyone and hence a fine, manageable and safe fleet."
"What gives us cause to welcome this report with even more enthusiasm is the fact that it represents the conclusion to a process that has lasted for some ten years."
"I am particularly pleased to note that relations between the institutions in the inland shipping sector have been no obstacle to this agreement, and I believe that this manifestly fruitful cooperation is being extended to other areas too."
"This is something we will need to talk about later on."
"Turning to the content, I am pleased to note the standards demanded of the vessels."
"Even though the sector must make the necessary effort to satisfy these demands, this does indeed indicate that the quality of the fleet has gone up beyond any doubt."
"In view of the potential for water-borne transport, that is both very welcome and essential."
"I am also satisfied with the procedure for making further adjustments and improvements to the directive."
"It is certainly not perverse to leave such a technical enterprise to the specialists."
"I am given to understand that a number of proposed amendments are on the table at this very moment."
"I hope that the specialists will find a solution to the possible discrepancy between this directive and Directive 94/25/EC, and I strongly support the amendment to that end."
"In conclusion, I want to thank Mrs Sommer for her efforts."
"I hope that this stage will make a positive contribution to improving transport on inland waterways."
"Mr President, passion for football, which has become a global and European passion tonight, offers me the opportunity to express my passion for Europeanism within the context of the transport sector as well."
"I am speaking as a Member from a Member State, Spain, whose rivers stopped being navigable some time ago and which is suffering from a drought that is becoming structural, thereby making it less and less possible for that navigability to be restored."
"I am therefore speaking as somebody with a healthy European envy of those countries that do have navigable waterways, both for passengers and for goods."
"As the partner of a German, I well remember the admiration I felt when I saw the Rhine some years ago, because until then I had heard talk of river motorways, and I had even worked in that field, but I had never known what they were."
"It was the impression of seeing the Rhine with such well-regulated, organised, stately and at the same time efficient traffic that taught me what we were talking about and how Europe was getting to grips with such important transport routes."
"I am therefore delighted as a European that this debate is finally coming to a successful conclusion, thanks to Mrs Sommer and also to my colleague Mr Stockmann."
"This will make it possible to harmonise river navigability, in terms both of social safety rules and of environmental rules, including the proposed non-reduction in those countries where that danger exists."
"It only remains for me to express my hope that my city, which in 2008 will hold the international Expo on this very issue of water and sustainable development, can implement projects to restore the navigability of the River Ebro, amongst others, as a collective means of passenger transport, and naturally to promote its use for sporting and tourism purposes."
"I am therefore delighted that the safety and social rules also apply."
"My dream is that, in the not too distant future, goods crossing the Pyrenees from Spain into France via a central tunnel will then travel along the Canal de Midi and the network of French canals and finally to the Rhine, whose ideal and wise regulation we are today turning into European law."
". Mr President, Mrs Sommer, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you for this enriching debate."
"It has confirmed that the Commission’s proposal, dating back to 1997 is as topical as ever."
"I am particularly grateful to Mrs Sommer, your rapporteur."
"Parliament is thus confirming its commitment to inland navigation, and this directive will make it easier to implement a single system for the entire network of European Union waterways."
"This agreement constitutes an important stage, which is in line with our strategy for harmonising rules at European level, as is recommended by the NAIADE action plan, and it will thus help to increase the competitiveness of inland navigation within the Community."
"Mr President, I wanted to say these few words of thanks to all those Members who kindly contributed to this excellent piece of work."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Sommer has already, today, quoted the German saying according to which a happy outcome is worth waiting for, and I believe that might be the case when it comes to this legislation on EU-OPS."
"I do not want to spend a great deal of time reviewing the lengthy process whereby we worked out what we want, which involved us in two first readings and various proposals from the Commission over a period of six years."
"It has become clear to me that we MEPs are production line workers, and certainly many people have been working on this one."
"I would like, once more, to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for the good work that Mr Simpson did during the previous Parliament, and, in particular, for the constructive cooperation with all Members during this one."
"I am also appreciative of the good work the Commission has done as a mediator, particularly that done by Mr Salvarani – since both he and I are being kept from watching the football today, I am grateful to him for being here – and not least for the Council’s willingness to compromise."
"The negotiations have produced a respectable result and one that adds value to Europe."
"Following the liberalisation of the European air transport sector and the great enlargement of 2004, we have now at last succeeded in harmonising all those technical standards and administrative regulations that have a bearing on the safety of civil aviation, and now it is high time we took the continuing expansion of air travel into account."
"The laying down of safety standards – ranging from construction to the rules on the transport of hazardous goods, by way of regulations on instruments – takes up nearly 500 pages."
"Until very recently, there was controversy about sections O and Q, which deal with the training of cabin crew and the working hours, in-flight hours and rest periods of pilots, and that is not surprising, since this is where the safety issues also touch upon the social benefits of the persons concerned."
"I do nevertheless think that we have succeeded, here too, in defining a provisional platform that, for many countries, amounts to a marked improvement in safety standards."
"Before second reading, the Committee on Transport and Tourism made some important changes. Firstly, we wanted to add a safeguard clause to prevent the situation arising in which, in countries with higher standards in law or in collective wage agreements, there would be an inevitable reduction in these standards with consequences for safety and for the social benefits of the personnel on board, and we succeeded in doing that."
"Secondly, it became apparent from hearings and from numerous studies that cumulative fatigue in pilots as a result of inappropriate scheduling was a problem in need of further investigation even after the result we have achieved, and the Council has proposed that this problem be put back on the agenda in three years’ time."
"We in this House do not think this is enough, and we have been able to secure a new scientific/medical study after only two years, relating to both sections, including Section O."
"Thirdly, the cabin crew were, right up to the last minute, raising with us their concerns about the upgrading of their status, and I believe that our amendments do justice to that insofar as it has a bearing on safety."
"In negotiations with the Council, we have managed to secure an undertaking that further harmonisation and better quality training will remain under consideration and that there will be a study into these issues too."
"I too take the view that the safeguard clause is applicable to the very varied approaches taken in Europe to certification and the issue of licences, so any loss of status in individual countries is not to be attributed to our legislation."
"Fourthly, when we started work on EU-OPS, no account was taken of the special situation of express freight services at night, and on that, too, we and the interested parties have arrived at a compromise that makes proper provision for their specific flight schedules while not compromising safety standards."
"Let me sum up by saying, once again, that a happy outcome is worth waiting for; whether it actually will be a happy one is something that will emerge from further work on the transposition of this directive."
"I ask all the groups in this House to give their support to this compromise that we have reached with the Council."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the harmonisation of the very highly divergent regulations applicable to civil aviation in Europe, particularly to the hours that flight crew work, is urgently needed."
"At this time of the year, millions of Europeans are once more setting off on their holidays, and doing so by air."
"There has been an explosive increase in air travel over the last 20 years in Europe, and, as air travel now knows practically no national boundaries, it is an anachronism that very different regulations should apply to air safety from one country to another."
"The object of this regulation is to at least make these rules more closely approximate, and that is an aim that is, as far as I am aware, supported by all the groups in this House, so we can content ourselves with making changes in a few areas, for example to the rules that put crew on freight flights at a disadvantage, where changes really do have to be made."
"We must not, however, make the mistake of adding features that deal only with social security and labour law to a technical regulation that is meant to serve the interests of safety in the air; mixing these together would make the regulation’s direction less clear and tend to weaken it."
"Nor must we try to interfere in collective agreements between unions and employers, which are subject to labour law; such collective agreements cannot be the subject of action on the part of the state, not even action by the European Union."
"If we do not lose sight of the fact that the regulation is intended to do no more than make air travel safer, then I am sure that passengers will, in future, be able to expect comparable technical safety standards, irrespective of the airport in the European Union at which they embark on their flight."
"For that reason alone, this regulation is deserving of support."
"I am most grateful for the sound work done by Mr Stockmann, the rapporteur."
"."
"Mr President, Mr Barrot, we are coming to the end of a long - a very long – road for those who have been in Parliament since 1999."
"We have witnessed the very difficult development of this draft regulation, firstly with the report by Mr Simpson - who is not present in this Chamber, but to whom we must pay tribute - and then with the extremely careful and shrewd work of Mr Stockmann, who has made it possible today to conclude the regulation."
"I believe that Parliament, as you said, Commissioner, can pride itself on having given this draft regulation a respectable social complexion."
"As you said, the human factor has a major part to play in the field of air safety, as it often does elsewhere."
"One problem remained to be solved, which might have appeared of secondary importance: the human factor certainly refers to the flight deck crew, but it also refers to the cabin crew."
"We had difficulty in concluding because we wanted to settle the matter at the end of this second reading and not enter into a conciliation procedure."
"That is why 37 of us Members from different political backgrounds – I pay tribute to Mrs de Veyrac – acted in what may be regarded as an untimely fashion and tabled a number of amendments aimed at clearly and explicitly integrating subpart O into the scientific assessment and revision work."
"I believe that, thanks to Mr Stockmann’s mediation, these amendments finally convinced people that a compromise was possible and persuaded the Council to accept it without going any further."
"Consequently, if the compromise amendments, as they were drafted this week, are adopted – I am thinking of Amendments 22, 25 and 19 – then, in accordance with our Rules of Procedure, there is no longer any reason for us to vote in favour of the amendments tabled by 37 Members."
"That is therefore my wish, expressed with a sense of our having fulfilled our duty and of our having, in the course of this week, made some decisive progress."
"I am grateful to the Commission for its openness in this regard."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I think this moment represents a step forward where this dossier is concerned."
"Although it is certainly true that we have been working on it for a long time, we are now close to an agreement that can enable us to raise safety to a high standard and make competition between airlines more honest."
"The question now arises of whether the compromise that is on the table is a good one."
"We all know – and a couple of us have already said so – that it is not ideal, but there are times when the best is the enemy of the good."
"Right now, though, we have to take what we can get, for there is indeed something to be said for the compromise that is now before us: there is no levelling-down, there are rules for the cabin crew, rules for night flights by freight carriers, and results as soon as possible from the EASA study – after two years instead of after three."
"We now have to seize the opportunity to move forward two steps at once."
"First, we must now approve the compromise, and I was glad to hear Mr Savary say just now that, if the compromise is approved, we should not take matters any further."
"Once we have approved the compromise, we will have a European basis on which we can work, on which the Commission, moreover, can begin to work, but then for everyone rather than for the limited number of Member States that can allow themselves higher standards."
"That is the first step."
"The second step will then be that, once, European rules are in place, we can improve them and work on certain aspects of them, so that – and let me repeat: not just for certain Member States who can allow themselves that sort of thing – the standard can be raised."
"This is the way we have to do it – in these two stages."
"If we miss out the first, if we fail to make the compromise, we cannot go any further."
"I understand very well the criticism levelled by some members of specific categories of personnel and the questions that they raise, for those questions have to do with safety, but when I asked them, ‘would you rather have this than nothing?’ they answered every time: ‘No, no, we want something!'"
"I think the rapporteur has done everything possible to move all the boundaries as far as possible."
"The possibility that we now have of concluding a compromise and to start out with a Europe-wide regulation constitutes an opportunity that we must seize whatever else we do."
"If we reject the compromise, I am convinced – as are the shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteur – that we will be left with nothing, and that we will be even further away from the objective that we want to reach."
"I would, in any case, like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, and also to the Commissioner for the work he has put in."
"I think it is a pity that the Council is unwilling to move further on a number of points and is holding fast to a sort of reasoning that I do not find readily comprehensible, but, if the compromise that we have hammered out is approved, there is no risk whatever of us ending up empty-handed and making the situation worse rather than better, so, thank you, Mr Savary, and thanks to all the other Members, and I think we can look forward to a good result tomorrow."
"."
"Mr President, this is an enormous package that we have before us, and, in the course of the last few months, only a few points have been left over for us to consider, although they are very important ones."
"The Council spent six years haggling over this compromise and, in doing so, evidently ignored the problems of the flying crew."
"The consequence of that was that pilots’ flying times and the working conditions of cabin crew were open and controversial issues for our discussions in the committee."
"I really do want to thank our rapporteur for the really very considerable amount of work he did to put this report on a good and sound footing."
"It has to be said, though, that there was no discussion in the proposal of the problems posed by shift work and the fatigue – that is, the physical and mental effects of irregular working hours – which does, of course, have effects on safety."
"The solution we have come up with, according to which a proposal has to be submitted within two years from now, is a compromise, and it would have been better if it could have been agreed on at once, but we should be glad to have achieved it at all, and glad that the Council has signed up to it."
"It is now up to the Commission to do something positive by taking these factors – which are without doubt indispensable – into account and producing a new proposal."
"While I am on the subject, let me say that I am not exactly happy with the exception made for personnel on freight flights, but I will agree to it for the sake of compromise, hoping as I do that the Commission will take a responsible approach to the analysis of working times."
"One difficult point, of course, was the prohibition on regression, about which the Council was not willing to talk, and on which the Member States were unable to give way."
"It is now up to them – and they will bear responsibility for this – as to whether working conditions, where they are better than what was proposed, improve, get worse, or remain unchanged, and whether, where bad working conditions still prevail, they can at last catch up."
"– Mr President, the policy of the European Union also functions in the aviation sector on automatic pilot, strengthening the competitiveness of the monopoly aviation companies in order to increase their profits."
"In our opinion, there are two basic factors that relate directly to the strengthening of flight safety rules: the human factor and the state – the airworthiness – of aircraft."
"Although trade union representatives have from time to time officially expressed their acute concern about the intensification of the exhausting working times of workers and about the deterioration in training provided for cabin crews being promoted in the relevant regulation, unfortunately these elements are not taken into account."
"It is a well-known fact that the exhausting working times of cabin crews increase flight safety risks."
"Another basic parameter, which was the subject of a letter from qualified Olympic Airways aircraft engineers dated 8 October 2004 and the corresponding reply, which I have here, from Mr Barrot dated 18 January 2005, concerns pre-flight checks."
"At this point, I would draw your attention to a very serious matter."
"In the second paragraph of Mr Barrot's letter, in reply to the trade union representatives who are responsible for checking the airworthiness of aircraft, it says that, as far as pre-flight inspections are concerned, the analysis of the current legal situation at European Union level (law 2042/2003) confirms that pre-flight inspections do not qualify as technical inspections."
"For goodness sake. If pre-flight inspections of aircraft are not technical inspections, then what are they?"
"We really consider that aircraft inspections by organised engineers in accordance with Part-66 (Aircraft Maintenance Personnel Licensing) need to be restored."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank the rapporteur Mr Stockmann for his very good work in finding a compromise between many and highly divergent opinions."
"I believe that the most important matter for those present, chiefly members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, is to reach agreement after six years of work on that version of the reading that is also acceptable to the Council."
"To procrastinate on amendments and regulations setting technical requirements and administrative procedures in such a fast-growing business sector as aviation is, I believe, no longer permissible or forgivable."
"For this same reason, namely the development of the sector, we must insist on a two-year deadline for completing the evaluation of Section Q. With regard to the compromise reached with the Council on the so-called non-regression clause, I believe that it is sufficient and I do not give credence to the concerns that have been expressed regarding mistrust of some European Union Member States which might, so it is thought, reduce flight-capacity time-limit safety standards to the lowest mandatory EU standards."
"Finally, the Community-wide recognition of steward training programmes and the possible licensing of stewards as an additional means of increasing aviation safety will also have a very important effect, one that is often discussed in Parliament and especially by the left wing: it will allow members of this profession to compete within the Community and receive equal pay and social guarantees, regardless of whether they are from old or new Member States."
"I will not use the time remaining to me so as to allow the honourable rapporteur to watch his team play."
"– Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, let us just rejoice, for this House’s tenacity and the Commission’s support have made it possible for this dossier to be completed after all."
"We can look back on five years, on a great deal of work and a great deal of sweat, so let us just rejoice!"
"Secondly, Commissioner, I urge you to take your courage in your hands; what we ask of you is that you re-examine the special arrangements for night express flights."
"The Council would say it saw that as an excuse for inaction, but be bold, do something, make some proposals!"
"I believe it to be a simple fact that there is a difference between the living circumstances of pilots of passenger aircraft and those of freight aircraft."
"In conclusion, I would ask of the Vice-President and all Members some understanding for why I am not making full use of my two minutes."
"In this House, there is agreement all round; on the television, there is something really exciting, and I am sure you will understand when I say that I am going to go for the more exciting option."
"Mr President, what we are debating can be regarded as a technical matter, but what we are actually concerned with here are two very fundamental issues that we have taken up in the European Parliament."
"One of these is the safety of aviation as a means of transport, and one that is in increasing use every day."
"More and more people are dependent on aviation in their everyday lives, but is also important for industry."
"Also at issue are the precise limits of human ability under difficult and dangerous conditions."
"To what extent is it possible to work difficult hours and still maintain a high level of safety?"
"It is questions such as these that the European Parliament has found important and that have caused us to devote so much time to this issue."
"I would like to thank Mr Stockmann for the truly excellent cooperation from which we have benefited and for the high-quality compromise that we have now reached."
"I am also amongst those who believe that we should vote in favour of the compromise, as we do need regulations at European level."
"Pilots and cabin crew are the key personnel in the air when it comes to safety."
"For us as passengers it is never acceptable for safety to be interfered with in order to keep prices down or in order for companies to be able to drive each other out of business."
"Pilots’ working conditions have been quite carefully examined in the past, and competition must not be allowed to cause a deterioration of those conditions."
"For this reason, the review after two years is very important."
"Regulations on working time must be backed up medically and scientifically within EASA by Europe’s foremost experts in the field of working time, rest, sleep and fatigue."
"Cabin crew must also have sound knowledge and training, and this applies to all cabin crew."
"Their working duties have changed and become increasingly important in the wake of 9/11."
"We must therefore also contribute to achieving high safety levels and high levels of competence for cabin crew, and we are doing this through the compromise."
"As a final point, the agreements in place differ between Member States."
"I think it important that those Member States that have better legislation or collective agreements should not be forced to fit in with a lowest common denominator."
"We need non-regression."
"Mr President, I would like to express my appreciation for Mr Stockmann’s report."
"He deals with a very broad and important subject which concerns the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the harmonisation of technical requirements and administrative procedures in the field of civil aviation."
"We should pay particular attention to a comprehensive approach to a question which is of significant importance to the proper functioning of air transport, and should include safety standards and healthy competition."
"The need for a detailed approach is demonstrated by the document itself, which consists of around 480 pages."
"The procedures presented in the regulation are specific and precise."
"They refer to the aircraft itself, including its navigational and communications equipment and procedures for technical staff."
"They also apply to the flight parameters and the air crew."
"The legislation deals with the issue of certificates, limitations on flight time and staff duties, as well as vital rest times for staff."
"They also cover matters dealing with airports and regulations for the activities of air operators, including issues relating to aircraft fuel."
"Moreover, the regulation deals with the question of meteorological conditions and guidelines on procedures to be followed in the event of limited visibility or other dangerous situations."
"There is a clear attempt to maintain where they already exist, and to introduce where they are not yet entirely compulsory, unified principles and criteria for action and implementation of the appropriate technical conditions in order to guarantee the highest possible level of air transport safety."
"The very intensive growth of air transport which we have witnessed requires absolute compliance with procedures and maintenance of strict technical discipline."
"It is therefore necessary to harmonise operating regulations relating to commercial air transport."
"It is also important to ensure that EU regulations are respected in all Member States and that carriers and airline operators from outside the EU and which fly to EU Member States be obliged to respect them unequivocally."
"I have some knowledge of the matter, as I hold a PhD in technical sciences specialising in aviation, and have had the opportunity to teach aviation students at Rzeszów Polytechnic, including future airline pilots."
"This allows me to state that the compromise solution proposed is responsible and to the point."
"Of course, it will also be very important to implement systematic and comprehensive monitoring of the legislation adopted."
"In this context I support the compromise solution achieved and call for it to be adopted."
"Mr President, Michael Ende did not give his ‘Never-Ending Story’ a proper ending, and we, in this House, have done markedly better."
"Now that Mrs Sommer has produced her report, we have almost given the EU-OPS regulation one."
"Mr Simpson and Mr Stockmann have done a very good job, for which both of them deserve thanks."
"The labour law, social security and, above all, safety regulations applicable to air transport need to be properly brought up to date, but Mr Gewalt has already, and rightly, pointed out that the role of the European legislator in all these areas is a limited one."
"All this has taken a while, but we now have before us a good report, and one that – as many Members have confirmed – represents the best possible compromise between the airlines and the trade unions."
"The amendment makes full provision for the flying times, working times and rest periods of the cockpit and cabin crew and limits their maximum time on duty in the air to 13 and 11 hours respectively."
"It is now up to the interested parties in the industry – the companies and the trade unions – to do the best they can with these requirements, and it is for the Commission to do more work in this area and to guarantee, by means of appropriate safety regulations, that the people currently setting off on holiday can feel safe when it is by air that they do so."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, my colleague, Mr Stockmann, for being generous enough to acknowledge the value of Mr Simpson’s initial work."
"I would like to pay a warm tribute to him tonight for having made such a success of it. His tenacity and flexibility have helped to achieve the great success that we all wanted to see."
"I can still remember how, at the beginning of this debate, which I experienced with Mr Simpson in a different capacity, we were presented with a text to harmonise the technical rules and administrative procedures for civil aviation, that is to say, to move on from the JAR-OPS to the EU-OPS, and we were surprised to find that it was a text with a black hole in it: it lacked the sub-section Q, relating to restrictions on flight time and activity and to rest requirements."
"That began one of those fascinating stories of European integration which, if at some point it is taken on by a good story-teller or film-maker, will surely help to restore our citizens' passion for Europe."
"There was a text in a drawer in the Commission which was growing in the darkness, which was improving, but we did not really know what it contained."
"There was a group of European pilots and cabin staff who wanted that text to finally be adopted and there were certain airlines that did not think it was a priority, under pressure from growing competition, to operate the sector in a manner that would lead to the emergence of new competitors and that would make any proposed restrictions a serious burden, even if they were intended to improve safety."
"Furthermore, they had the support of their Member States."
"Finding a solution seemed difficult, but we have almost found one, thanks to the passionate and joint work of everybody and to the European Parliament’s will to approve a complete text, with essential aspects for safety, aimed at people, pilots and cabin staff and with requirements on training, professional recognition and strict respect for flying and rest times, which must be regulated and harmonised in order to fully guarantee safety, without delay, in a sector which is growing exponentially and which is fully open and competitive."
"We therefore welcome this prior commitment tonight, which will become a first step in consolidating the European citizens' confidence in the civil aviation sector."
"It also represents a mandate for the European Air Safety Agency to exercise responsibility, and we hope that the agency will soon apply all of this Parliament's recommendations."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Stockmann, for the outstanding work he has done in negotiating a more than satisfactory agreement with the Council and the Commission."
"We can be delighted at this result for a number of reasons."
"Firstly, this agreement concludes a matter that has been on the table for six years, and it is a good thing to thus be able to avoid the conciliation procedure and a further delay, even though six years is far too long for an area like air safety in which it is crucial to act quickly."
"Secondly, the amendments on which the Council and the draftsmen came to an agreement take up the bulk of the requests that we made to the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"That seems important to me, especially when it comes to the non-reducing clauses, which guarantee that this text will be unable to bring about a reduction in safety in the Member States in which the standards are higher than the basic standards featuring in the regulation."
"Finally, I am particularly pleased about the provisions that deal with the issue of cabin crew."
"Together with Mr Savary and a number of our fellow Members, we have tabled two amendments relating to the concerns expressed by this profession."
"I am delighted to observe that the compromise amendments take account of these remarks and I am convinced that the regulation thus amended is a coherent and balanced text: I hope that we adopt it tomorrow by a very large majority."
"I should like to point out off the record to our German and Italian fellow Members that I purposely wanted to be brief in order to enable them to follow the last few minutes of this evening's important event."
"Mr President, Mr Vice-President, I would like to start by seizing this opportunity to thank the rapporteur, Mr Stockmann, most warmly for this fine report; it is a particular cause for rejoicing that he has managed, despite the problematic underlying issues, the various interests at stake and the length of time that has elapsed, to safely guide this report through to the point where it can be voted on."
"There are various reasons why this ‘EU-OPS’ regulation represents an important milestone in the history of air safety: the amount of air traffic in Europe is continuing its constant upward trend;"
"European airspace is one of the most overloaded of the areas in the world through which aircraft pass; and, if the safety of air passengers is to continue to be guaranteed everywhere, then the further development of uniformly high standards of safety is a matter of urgent necessity."
"The black list, which was published a few months ago thanks to Mrs de Veyrac, has already set high standards for airlines – mainly those from outside Europe – and similarly high standards now need to be applied to the European ones."
"Pilots from certain EU Member States will have the pressure taken off them as a result of the new framework conditions established by EU-OPS in respect of limits on working and rest time, and that in turn will improve passenger safety."
"The European Air Safety Agency (EASA) will be producing a medical/scientific study on this, which will serve as a basis for the Commission’s proposed revisions."
"In my own report I will be discussing at length the EASA’s functions and areas of responsibility."
"I would like to take this early opportunity to observe that uppermost in my mind is the safety of the passengers and of all the crew, and that I will not lose sight of that while drafting my report."
"Mr Stockmann has already made a considerable contribution in this respect, and has, in doing so, made civil aviation a good deal safer already."
"I will endeavour to play my part in ensuring that firm arrangements are made for the allocation of powers to, and coordination of, the various air safety agencies, with it being clearly indicated who shall be required to comply with the agencies’ instructions."
"."
"Mr President, we need to conserve our strength, so I will be very brief."
"I should like straightaway to thank Parliament for accepting a compromise negotiated among the three institutions and I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Stockmann."
"Parliament’s contribution has enabled us to make significant progress."
"It has thus enabled us to identify the areas in which work needs to be done, particularly in cooperation with the European Aviation Safety Agency."
"I should like to state in this connection that, in line with the compromise amendment tabled, we are going to carefully examine the specific circumstances of night flights."
"As regards controls, we have two levels of these: those managed by the European Aviation Safety Agency, which are designed to see whether the European rules are being applied properly by the Member States, and those managed by the Member States."
"We are making sure that the controls are enhanced."
"Mr President, I hope that this text will be adopted by a large majority and will thus make it possible to improve air safety in Europe, to guarantee fair competition and to make it easier for staff to move around within the Community."
"I wish to thank Parliament once again for its contribution."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m."
"The next item is the report (A6-0174/2006) by Mr Seppänen, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council directive on the supervision and control of shipments of radioactive waste and nuclear spent fuel (COM(2005)0673 C6-0031/2006 2005/0272(CNS))."
"."
"Mr President, the proposal that is the subject of Mr Seppänen’s report aims at modifying and replacing Directive 92/3/Euratom, which lays down a Community uniform administrative procedure applicable to the shipment of radioactive waste."
"I would first like to recall the aims of this proposal, which are: to ensure consistency with other Community legislation on radiation protection; to ensure consistency with international conventions; to clarify the procedures; to simplify the structure and wording of the existing directive; and to enhance certainty, firstly by explicitly including transfers of spent fuel for re-processing – the same control procedure is now applied to all shipments of spent fuel, independently of the intended use – and secondly by generalising the automatic consent procedure."
"The consent of Member State of transit and of destination is assumed after a reasonable deadline."
"This proposal takes into consideration the experience of application of the existing directive."
"It further takes fully into account the opinion given by the European Economic and Social Committee on 9 June 2005, as well as the informal discussions held at the Council and in Parliament during 2005."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Seppänen, for the excellent report he prepared, which has received the strong support of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"The amendments mainly seek to clarify the Commission’s proposal, and are therefore welcome."
"I am therefore confident that the Council will take duly into consideration the content of Parliament’s opinion, insofar as it might contribute to improving the directive."
"The Commission will present positively the inclusion in the directive of the amendments in the Seppänen report."
"I would like to encourage you to adopt the recommendation submitted by the ITRE Committee, as this represents the best way to promote our common objectives."
"It enhances certainty with regard to the Community uniform procedure which is applicable to the control of shipments of radioactive waste and nuclear spent fuel."
"I look forward to the forthcoming debate."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I thank you for your interesting view."
"This report was adopted by the committee with a very large majority, and I wish to thank the committee members, who tabled many good amendments to the proposal, for their very high levels of cooperation."
"During the drafting process, I thought it was important for us to insist that it should be written into Union legislation that each Member State should have the right to ban the importation of nuclear spent fuel for disposal."
"This principle is written into the IAEA Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste."
"The European Parliament endorsed the adoption of the Joint Convention at one point, and Euratom is a party to it."
"Thus there is general acceptance in the Union of the principle that a Member State need not take delivery against its will of spent fuel from other countries for disposal in its own soil."
"Although the issue is a straightforward one in principle, in practice it is not."
"There has been resistance in the Commission to the idea that this right of a Member State should be written into Community legislation."
"The Commission may well be encumbered by the sort of thinking that proposes that the free movement of goods, written into the Treaty, should also apply to spent fuel for disposal."
"According to this way of thinking, nuclear spent fuel is just the same as any other good."
"Because, according to the Community treaties, goods must be allowed to move freely within the Union, the Member States should not be accorded the right in the Union’s primary legislation to ban the importation from other countries of nuclear spent fuel when it is storing its own nuclear spent waste in its own soil."
"Even in this sector, there would seem to be a craving for free trade."
"The members of our committee supported the rapporteur on this."
"The right of Member States to ban the importation of nuclear spent fuel has now been written into the articles of the directive in Parliament’s report."
"As it has been written into the articles, the provision is legally binding."
"If it had merely been written into the preamble, it would not have had the same legal status: it would just be describing political will, without any legal force."
"This principle and the entire report were adopted by the committee with such a degree of consensus that the report would not have needed to be opened at all for amendments in plenary."
"I nevertheless supported the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in its request to have a plenary debate on amending the directive."
"In my opinion, they should make known their reasons why Member States should deal with the disposal of nuclear spent fuel themselves, without allowing radioactive waste or spent fuel to be exported outside the Union for reprocessing or disposal."
"I would justify this request with reference to the Union’s expertise in nuclear technology, which is of a high standard, and its strict regulations on safety."
"I fear that there are lower standards and laxer legislation in possible external recipient countries."
"If nuclear power is to be used, one is taking huge radioactive risks, and those risks have to be controlled in those countries which produce nuclear energy."
"Problems that can possibly be solved together within the Union cannot be transferred to third countries outside it."
"For this reason, I support the many amendments tabled by the Greens, even if there was not enough general sympathy for them on the committee."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission for its willingness to withdraw the first proposal and to take account in its second one of what was said in the debate in this House, as a consequence of which we have met each other halfway."
"The same goes for the rapporteur, who was prepared – although he has since become rather less so – to work together with the major groups and the Commission in finding a rational way forward."
"The report we now have before us is a sensible one, and it is one to which we can give our support, although we do not think that the amendments tabled by the Greens are worthy of it."
"Taken as a whole Mr Seppänen’s draft report enjoys the support of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, but we will reject the substance of the amendments that were, contrary to our original agreement, resubmitted, and we do so on the basis of Articles 31 and 32 of the Euratom Treaty, which have to do with health and safety."
"I would like to point out that this is not a codecision procedure, and that we are only to be consulted."
"Account has been taken of new considerations, such as, for example, the extended scope for spent fuel rods, disposal and reprocessing or the automatic consent process for the transport of material within the Community and out of it."
"We cannot agree to what the Greens have proposed."
"Amendment 23, in particular, which envisages the requirement for the most extensive information in advance, cannot be seen as anything other than an incitement to widespread demonstrations, and Mrs Harms stressed that they would happen."
"Having failed to get this sort of thing accepted once before, she has now taken it up again."
"We would be dealing much more honestly with one another if we were to find common ground on the still open issue of final disposal rather than adopting hardened positions according to which one side of this House is right and the other is getting everything wrong."
"I want to express my thanks to Mr Seppänen for his willingness to meet us halfway, and I believe that we can very largely agree to the report in its present form."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s proposal on the directive concerning the control of shipments of radioactive waste is balanced and takes account of many of the suggestions made by Parliament during the debate on the previous proposal."
"I commend this attempt to update the previous directive and to clarify it from the procedural and terminological point of view."
"The inclusion of nuclear spent fuel in the remit of the directive is equally commendable."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament is therefore substantially in agreement with this text and would like to compliment Mr Seppänen on his report and his contribution."
"We have requested a separate vote on Amendment 6 because we do not think it possible to exclude the restrictions and controls that are to be found throughout the directive from the legislative provisions of the transit countries’ regulations."
"The amendments proposed by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance express a concern that we can share."
"Nevertheless, I think that the Commission’s text – Article 13, to be precise – already sets limits to exports, in particular to those countries that do not have sufficient technical, legal and administrative resources at their disposal to guarantee safe disposal of radioactive waste."
"We shall therefore vote against the Greens’ amendments."
"I also agree with the structure of the proposal and should like to thank the Commission and Mr Seppänen for their work."
"."
"Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on the hard work he has put into successfully preparing an excellent report that deals with such a difficult and controversial subject."
"The amendments submitted in this report undoubtedly significantly improve the Commission’s latest proposal and certainly constitute an important improvement to the original directive on the supervision and control of shipments of radioactive waste."
"One of the most noteworthy contributions made by the rapporteur in substantially improving the Commission’s position is his stance in firmly establishing the right of every country to prohibit foreign nuclear spent fuel from being finally stored in repositories in or on its soil."
"This right is fundamental and paramount."
"In my view, only a very small number of somewhat equivocal issues remain as yet unresolved."
"I shall mention only two such problem areas, which in fact are interrelated."
"The exact definition of nuclear waste and nuclear spent fuel is still not entirely clear, so that some nuclear waste may, depending on its intended use, sometimes be regarded as nuclear spent fuel and vice versa."
"This may lead to confusion."
"In any event, and oddly enough, both of these hazardous materials are still legally speaking considered to be goods so far as EU legislation is concerned."
"As a consequence of this, a Member State, after receiving only a simple notification, is on occasion obliged to have extremely dangerous consignments travelling through its territory by land, sea or air and subjecting its citizens to the potential perils of a catastrophic nuclear contamination accident."
"This happens without that state having the right to prevent such shipments from taking place in the first place."
"I know that coming up with a solution to this problem and implementing it is not at all easy, but somehow we must find a way whereby Member States can have the last word, after being fully informed, in clearly reasoned decisions to accept or not the transportation of nuclear material – or any other hazardous material for that matter –through their territory."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, first of all, to thank Mr Seppänen for being so very aware of the problems as regards the market conditions for such a difficult commodity as nuclear waste or spent fuel rods."
"I would like, once more, to explain two amendments from my group that are of particular concern to me, namely Amendments 24 and 25, which deal specifically with the export of nuclear waste and spent fuel rods to third countries, and my particular concern is with exports to Russia."
"Those who make it their business to know about these things will already have heard the names of Mayak or Chelyabinsk, sites in the Urals where, for decades, not only Soviet waste but also, and increasingly, European waste is reprocessed or accepted for storage, and where incidents keep occurring."
"It is not only, however, when accidents occur, but also in the normal course of operations, that enormous amounts of radioactivity are discharged, causing serious pollution in the rivers and lakes of the Urals, to a considerably greater extent, moreover, than that seen in some parts of the exclusion zone around Chernobyl."
"The situation we have ended up in makes dual standards impossible; since such facilities could not be operated in the EU, Europeans should not be sending their waste there for storage, disposal or reprocessing, and it can no longer be really demonstrated that reprocessing – that is, the further recovery of these nuclear materials – is still going on there, since no comprehensible summary whatever of what is reprocessed and reused is available to the public."
"If we continue to allow thousands of tonnes of nuclear waste from the European Union to be exported to Russia, then we are taking upon ourselves a responsibility even and ever greater than that which – I emphasise, since it is not only now that the export is starting – we already bear for the lamentably poor state of the environment in the region around Mayak and Chelyabinsk and of the health of the people who live there."
"I am positively convinced that the responsibility for resolving the problems with nuclear waste should generally be accepted by those countries that dump these problems on the world."
"It is not Russia that is responsible for our nuclear waste, but rather our own countries themselves."
". – Mr President, first of all, of course, I must congratulate my group colleague Mr Seppänen on his outstanding report; he is right to stress the primary responsibility that is incumbent on the Member States where the storage or processing of nuclear waste is concerned, and they certainly have one when it comes to refusing to accept waste from outside their own borders."
"While that is a fundamental right that must under no circumstances be undermined by European regulation, I do believe that national responsibility goes even further, in that those who produce nuclear waste can never shrug off the responsibility for ensuring that it is processed and stored in a proper manner, even if that is done in another country."
"The way in which EU Member States now ship their rubbish to such countries as Russia, only for it to be there stored under grossly unsatisfactory conditions, is nothing short of scandalous."
"Europe’s negligence with nuclear waste makes victims of the local population and of the environment."
"If countries choose to use such a dangerous and environmentally-unfriendly source of energy as nuclear power, they should be required to clear up their own refuse themselves rather than dumping it on the people of poorer countries outside the EU."
"Those who really do want to do something practical to address the problem of nuclear waste in Europe should first give their attention to where it comes from, or else they will simply be fighting a running battle."
"It is particularly disappointing to see how nuclear power, after a period deservedly spent on the fringes of the energy debate, is now creeping back on to the European agenda, for, being neither environmentally friendly, safe, nor good value, it is not an acceptable alternative, and the problem with waste is a good example of why it is not one."
"."
"Mr President, I should like to say to the Commissioner that when I look at the report, which clearly identifies radioactive waste as deadly, I wonder why we still see nuclear power as an option, even, as I have seen in some new lobbying efforts, passing off nuclear energy as 'green'."
"This directive focuses only on Member States which are active participants in the production of nuclear energy and on those that accept the waste."
"Ireland neither produces nuclear waste nor reprocesses it."
"We are not factored into this report, yet we need to be protected because we have Sellafield, a British reprocessing plant, very close to our shores."
"The Irish Sea – the narrow strip of water that separates us from Sellafield – has, because of Sellafield, become the most radioactive body of water in the world."
"Sellafield is expanding and preparing to take more and more radioactive waste for reprocessing."
"Any waste coming from continental Europe will most likely be shipped through the Irish Sea, putting us at additional risk."
"We in Ireland seem to have no say in this."
"We are seen as passive bystanders."
"No one looks for our consent."
"We are able to reject the fuel, but not to reject the risks when our neighbours accept it."
"We have, as a country, chosen to remain nuclear-free."
"That should be respected, both in terms of accepting waste and in terms of the risk of waste being transported through our waters."
"In the area of smoking, legislators have come to recognise the significance of passive smoking and have taken measures to defend the people who are near the smoker."
"We need to recognise the effects and risks of reprocessing, shipment and reshipment on everyone, not just the countries of origin and destination that are making money from the nuclear business."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that, after more than a year and a half in Parliament, Mr Seppänen’s report is finally being voted on in plenary."
"In committee we have achieved a broad majority consensus on drawing up the amendments necessary to improve the Commission’s proposal, which we believe the Council is prepared to accept."
"In particular, I would like to stress the new system for notification and authorisation of shipments of radioactive waste and spent fuel which I believe maximises the use of the automatic consent procedure, which was originally stressed by the European Economic and Social Committee as an essential element for the proper functioning of the internal market."
"Furthermore, the amendments voted for in committee fully conform to the proposal’s initial objective, which is to bring the legislation in force into line with the Joint Convention of the International Atomic Energy Agency."
"To this end, Parliament has insisted on faithfully reproducing the definitions of the Convention, as well as the scope of the directive."
"With regard to the amendments presented by Mrs Harms, I would like to make a couple of comments: firstly, that the Convention makes the conditions allowing Member States to export radioactive waste and spent fuel very clear, and secondly, the fact that her insistence that the information on shipments of these substances should be made public largely contradicts her argument in committee when she warned of the danger of those substances falling into untrustworthy hands."
"I am sure that Mrs Harms appreciates the risk that would be caused by that sensitive information being accessible to everybody."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Seppänen for his excellent work and all of the shadow rapporteurs for their own excellent efforts and their cooperation throughout the process and I would like to reiterate my support for the amendments approved in committee."
"Let us hope that the House is aware that what is to be voted on tomorrow is not a question of ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to nuclear power, but rather a proposal to make the transport of these substances safer."
"I would like to congratulate the draftsman and stress that the directive being debated is important for each country in the European Union, especially those operating nuclear power stations."
"The Commission's proposals to cooperate in the transportation and burial of nuclear waste or spent nuclear fuel reflect the spirit of EU solidarity and look to the future."
"On the other hand, there is no doubt that radioactive waste transportation inspections and the advance authorisation system must become stricter."
"Having shut down Ignalina nuclear power station's first reactor and with plans to shut down the second in three years’ time, Lithuania faces a storage problem with spent nuclear fuel."
"At the moment, waste is being buried temporarily in special areas."
"If it is decided that a new modern nuclear power station should be built at Ignalina with the help of neighbouring countries, the directive being debated would become even more relevant for the entire region."
"I would also like to stress the need to encourage scientific research into the neutralisation of nuclear waste."
"This could also be a priority for the EU’s 7th framework programme for research."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, France stirred up a wave of indignation when it classified the shipment of radioactive waste as an official secret."
"It was thus denying local elected representatives and local communities the right to be informed of the fact that trains containing highly dangerous radioactive material were travelling across their land."
"As recently as 16 May 2006, a member of French civil society was kept in police custody because he was in possession of an impact study concerning the EPR project's ability to withstand a disaster involving the loss of an airliner also classified as an official secret."
"By adopting, with vague words, the French idea that 'information regarding shipments (…) is handled with due care and protected against any misuse’, Parliament’s Committee on Industry, Research and Energy is in fact proposing to institutionalise official secrets at European level."
"Is the European Parliament, the all-round world champion in promoting and demanding transparency and democratic control on the international stage, going to go back on what it has said and done and make an exception of the nuclear issue?"
"Our Parliament would lose a great deal of credibility if it were to make obscurantism the rule where highly radioactive waste is concerned."
"We know that burying is not the solution when it comes to managing nuclear waste."
"That is why we reject the plan to build a European nuclear dump in Bure, in my region, or anywhere else."
"Furthermore, going along with the proposal to delegate the management of nuclear waste to third countries – Ukraine or Russia for instance – is irresponsible."
"The idea is ethically and morally reprehensible when it comes to nuclear waste which, let us not forget, must be monitored forever."
"In the meantime, the acceptable solution – and this is the response that I wish to give to my fellow Members from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - consists in storing the waste within nuclear power stations."
"That is the only place in which it is secure, and that is without mentioning the fact that this move would stop the process whereby waste is toured the length and breadth of Europe by road or rail."
"Finally, the question is: how long will Europeans have to wait for transparency of information to be applied to the nuclear sector?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, unless we ensure the stability of our system, adopt clear rules and meet our international commitments in the field of energy, all talk of economic growth, a rise in employment and an increase in the competitiveness of the European Union will not be rooted in solid reality."
"Whether we like it or not, the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy objectives is inextricably linked to the question of energy, including nuclear energy."
"In fact, nuclear energy lies behind a good 30 per cent of the electric power generated by 154 reactors in Europe."
"When confronted with these figures, the opponents of nuclear energy, and indeed members of the public as well, raise concerns about nuclear waste."
"The time is now ripe to amend the existing 1992 Directive on the Supervision and Control of Shipments of Radioactive Waste and Nuclear Spent Fuel in line with the development of contemporary society, which is exactly what the Commission proposal does."
"Particularly praiseworthy are the simplification of the current Directive, the clear definition of procedures and the definition of the use of languages."
"Moreover, the rapid development of technology today facilitates the re-use and material recovery of as much as 96 per cent of all highly radioactive waste."
"For this reason, I support the proposal for the harmonisation of nuclear spent fuel management procedures, regardless of which procedures will be used in the coming period."
"I firmly believe that this document deserves our support."
"Allow me, finally, to express a hope that we will act coherently and constructively and that we will abide by the opinion of the competent Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"I also hope that we will not unnecessarily weigh down the above Directive in the European Parliament with additional text or amendments, making it hard to implement before we have even begun."
"On the subject of health and safety, Articles 31 and 32 of the Euratom Treaty are not only providing a basis for the law in the process of being amended, but they also constitute an obligation for us."
"Bearing in mind the health and safety of Europe's citizens, we must keep nuclear legislation up to date."
"In accepting the Seppänen report, I firmly believe that we are doing enough to meet this obligation we have, and that we are making Directive 92/3/Euratom more effective."
"I feel that it is extremely important that the legislation is on the correct middle course, in several respects."
"First of all, it ensures the close monitoring of radioactive waste and of the spent fuel, which is now being re-processed, without the application of unjustified restrictions and bans."
"Secondly, it guarantees citizens' safety, without imposing, in exchange, a disproportionate burden on economic operators."
"Finally, although the regulation widens the scope of the legislation, it does not break away from the principle of subsidiarity."
"In other words, although the new legislation provides people with new guarantees, Member States remain responsible for creating regulations specific to national particularities, as well as for ensuring the operation of the authorities that guarantee the enforcement of these regulations."
"However, the latter also means that apart from jointly refining the legislation providing a stable basis for safety, it is also necessary to ensure the effective operation of the national authorities that constitute this framework, so that every citizen in the European Union can enjoy the greater safety offered by the new directive."
"All the above is vitally important for the future of Europe's energy supply too, because we should be aware that the success of this complex operation is also the key to ensuring that people have confidence in nuclear energy."
"() Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, first of all, to thank the Commission for taking this initiative, for it is timely that it should give some thought to the essential things in the European Union, among them safety standards and the extreme risks involved in this technology, and that there should be awareness of the fact that the currently existing safety standards differ to the utmost degree and are, in many cases, in need of better monitoring, of, that is to say, what is termed a peer review or of some other means whereby they may be reviewed objectively and transparently."
"As I see it, the question arises of what the position is in this area as regards consultation between the Commission, Parliament, and the relevant Member States, or of what is going on as regards the new strategy, according to which the Council’s nuclear working group is, in effect, seizing powers exclusively for itself and treating our other partners in the European decision-making process in a manner that has no place in the present time."
"We should be trying to establish a balance by taking, right now, responsibility for monitoring and transparency, which are becoming ever more necessary in this extremely sensitive area, rather than waiting for an accident to happen somewhere and only then looking for the responsible or guilty parties."
"We should also be taking competition seriously, considering such questions as which costs arise from the removal and disposal of waste and also in connection with the safety and security of transports and the standards according to which these things are done."
"This is where the European Union needs to act, and I would ask you all, bearing in mind the fact that the Euratom Treaty has been in place for fifty years, to embark upon a serious debate and put issues of safety and transparency centre stage."
"."
"Mr President, as today’s debate has shown, there is broad support for the rapporteur’s report."
"I should like to thank Mr Seppänen again for his excellent report, which has the support of a strong majority in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy."
"Concerning the issue of the prohibition of any export of radioactive waste and spent fuel out of the Community, I would recall Article 13(1)(c) of the proposed directive, which further prohibits exports of radioactive waste and spent fuel to countries that do not possess the necessary administrative and technical capacity for safely managing the spent fuel or radioactive waste."
"The Commission will issue strict criteria for deciding that."
"It is for Member States to decide whether to authorise a shipment to a third country on a case-by-case basis, following strong guidance to be issued by the Commission."
"That is the answer to the question that arose during the debate."
"I strongly believe that we need as much transparency as possible when we deal with energy issues."
"That also applies to nuclear energy."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.30 p.m."
"The next item is the Council Statement on the presentation of the programme of the Finnish Presidency."
"We welcome the Prime Minister of Finland and his Secretary of State for European Affairs, as well as the President of the Commission."
"Mr Vanhanen has the floor first, on behalf of the Council."
"Mr President, Mr President and Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, honourable guests, I warmly thank you for this opportunity to come and discuss the priorities and main objectives of the Finnish Presidency with the European Parliament."
"It is an exacting task to discharge the responsibilities of the Presidency in the European Union, but at the same time it is a great honour and privilege, and Finland welcomes the challenge."
"As the country to hold the Presidency, our collaboration with the European Parliament has got off to a good start."
"I would like to thank the President and all the other Members of the European Parliament who attended the meeting between the Finnish Government and Parliament in Helsinki."
"Furthermore, several parliamentary committees and political groups have visited Finland and engaged in productive discussions regarding the aims of our Presidency."
"Ever since Finland joined the EU it has supported efforts to make the work of the Union’s institutions more effective and improve the close cooperation that exists between them."
"As the country to hold the Presidency, we will work in close and effective cooperation with the European Parliament."
"By that I do not just refer to Parliament’s role in the codecision procedure as a legislator on an equal footing with the Council, but in a wider context, promoting the key aims of the Union."
"Finland’s own national parliament, the , is celebrating a special anniversary."
"This year it is 100 years since the unicameral parliament was founded and universal suffrage established."
"Everyone, men and women alike, at the same time had the right to vote and the right to stand for election."
"We are proud of this landmark in the history of our democracy."
"In Finland, the parliament is closely involved in the handling of EU affairs, and it has a lot of influence."
"Perhaps this experience that we have of fruitful cooperation with our parliament has in turn made it so natural for us Finns to engage in close cooperation with the European Parliament too."
"There is no overlap in the work of the European Parliament and that of the national parliaments: each has its own role to play in Union affairs."
"Basically, however, they have the same fundamental mission: to strengthen democracy in the Union."
"During its Presidency, Finland will endeavour to persuade the Union to look outwards and ahead."
"We must reflect on what sort of a Union we want to see 10 to 20 years from now, and how that is to be achieved."
"As Europeans, we need to identify the historical forces of change in our time, and respond to and embrace them."
"It is a major challenge for the EU to face up to the reality of globalisation."
"The world that surrounds the Union is changing and if we are not careful we will lag further and further behind."
"That would be disastrous, above all for the future of our children and future generations."
"For their sake, Europe must stop looking inwards and consider its position in the global context in the longer term."
"The world around us will not wait."
"Our future requires us to take concrete action now, even though its effects will only be visible later on."
"In recent years participation in decision-making in the Union has left something to be desired and the public are more critical about that than before."
"I nevertheless dismiss the pessimistic talk of a crisis in the Union; instead, I believe that the problems we have at present can be overcome."
"The agreement reached on the Financial Framework and progress with the Services Directive are examples of the Union being able to take important decisions when the political will is there."
"I believe that it is there in all the Union’s institutions."
"The European Union is a community of values, which exists for the people."
"That is why its reduced legitimacy and its diminished justification and credibility in the eyes of the people must be taken seriously."
"This perception that the Union’s legitimacy is suffering is partly due to the fact that the public does not know what the Union does for them."
"Many issues that have a real impact on people’s lives, such as the right to reside, work and study anywhere in the EU, are taken as a matter of course."
"People forget that they are possible precisely on account of the Union."
"Lack of information, however, does not explain everything: the Union has also to be able to improve the way it does things."
"It needs to deliver results, the effects of which the people can see in their own lives."
"The Union’s basic premise, peace and stability in Europe, is still relevant."
"I was personally reminded of that on my trip to Croatia a few weeks ago: they want to join the Union so that they and their children will never again need to witness another war."
"Many other people, who have lived their whole lives in peace, tend, however, to take peace and stability for granted."
"As a result, that no longer seems enough on its own to give the Union legitimacy."
"As many of you have often said, the Union must be able to demonstrate the benefits it offers to its citizens in other ways too, and more tangibly."
"The best way to demonstrate the necessity of the Union is to deal with its basic tasks effectively, especially its legislative work."
"That we can and must do right away on the basis of the existing Treaties."
"Europe cannot wait around for new rules on decision-making: it needs to start improving the way it functions straight away."
"The Union needs to show that it can achieve results that impact on human lives and not just quarrel about institutional matters."
"Improved effectiveness will mean that bold decisions will need to be taken by Europe’s leaders and decision-makers."
"We cannot just think about the here and now, or future elections; we have to think about the interests of future generations."
"That is why decisions also need to be taken which will perhaps be painful now, but which will help shape the future."
"There must also be a willingness to compromise on national points of view and consider Europe as a whole."
"The Union must focus on the essential, and work effectively for it."
"That means the sort of action that results in added value compared to what the Member States could do alone."
"This added value can be achieved in the areas of welfare, security and freedom."
"If we are to realise these aims we need to start with the right approach."
"Transparency is essential: our citizens need to know how the decisions that affect them are made."
"The growing political debate in Europe is in the interests of everyone."
"You also have a crucial role to play in this."
"I am pleased that we in the European Council decided to increase the transparency of Council sittings."
"Finland, as the country to hold the Presidency, will implement comprehensively the principles adopted by the European Council to increase the transparency of the Council’s work."
"Finland will aim to contribute to the issue of transparency in other ways too, in all its practical work and activities."
"We shall aim to ensure that all essential information is available at our EU Presidency website as quickly as possible."
"Sometimes practical solutions like this do more to provide genuine access to information than mere political statements."
"During its Presidency, Finland will steer its resources towards better regulation, that is to say, quality of legislation, and attention to the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality."
"This will not merely be a case of pruning legislation."
"In the European Union we need new legislation, but we must keep existing legislation up-to-date."
"This way the Union can influence and react dynamically to the changes in the world around it."
"In this we support the work of the Commission."
"The Presidency will invest time and effort in ensuring that decision-making takes careful account of the economic, social and environmental effects of legislative proposals."
"Our goal will also be to expedite the implementation of Commission proposals that aim to simplify and update legislation."
"The work of the Council will be based on the Annual Work Programme for 2006, which we drafted together with Austria."
"Cooperation between successive Presidencies is very important for continuity."
"With Austria it has gone well, and we intend to continue the cooperation in just the same positive spirit with Germany, which succeeds us."
"The Finnish Presidency is committed to working through the Union agenda and all the issues on it effectively, efficiently and impartially."
"I shall briefly mention here the issues that the Finnish Presidency intends to highlight in particular, but that does not mean that we would not attend to other matters just as diligently."
"There is need for progress in all sectors."
"Finland wants to promote the debate on the Union’s future."
"Connected with this debate are the very real issues of the future of the Union’s Constitutional Treaty and EU enlargement."
"I am pleased that the European Council decided in June that, with regard to the Constitutional Treaty, it was time to move on from mere reflection to a more proactive stage."
"This twin-track approach is the right one: we will improve the way the Union functions in line with the current Treaties, whilst at the same time we start to ponder the future of the Constitutional Treaty."
"During its Presidency, Finland will start consultations relating to the future of the Constitutional Treaty."
"These consultations with the Member States and EU institutions will form the basis of a report to be produced during the first half of 2007, when Germany has the Presidency."
"I am convinced that the Treaty negotiated with the Member States is essential for an expanding Union."
"In Finland the Government presented a proposal on the ratification of the Treaty to the Finnish Parliament at the start of June, and Parliament will deliberate on the matter in its autumn session."
"In this way, Finland is adopting a position on the negotiated Treaty."
"Union enlargement is one of the key issues for the Finnish Presidency."
"I am personally convinced that the enlargement of the Union has been a success story."
"Not only is enlargement a crucial tool for strengthening stability and democracy, it is also one of Europe’s strategic responses to the challenges of globalisation."
"Recent analyses show that the latest round of enlargement was of clear benefit to both the new and the old Member States."
"In June the European Council held an important debate on the Union’s absorption capacity."
"I am very pleased that this was not set as a new accession criterion."
"No new accession criteria should be set for applicant countries, but at the same time the existing criteria must be adhered to unconditionally."
"The bottom line is that the Union should remain an open Community."
"European states that meet the membership criteria should be able to join."
"During our Presidency a decision will be taken on the accession date for Romania and Bulgaria."
"Membership negotiations with Turkey and Croatia will also be taken forward on the basis of the progress they have made and the Commission reports."
"The Finnish Presidency will also support the European Perspective of the Western Balkans."
"The current year will in many ways be crucial for the future of the Western Balkans."
"The process concerning the status of Kosovo is likely to reach a conclusive phase in the autumn."
"The Presidency hopes that the parties will achieve results in the exacting negotiations entered into under Martti Ahtisaari by the end of the year."
"A vital area during the Finnish Presidency will be the competitiveness of the Union and its Member States and their success in global competition."
"These we will make efforts to address over a broad spectrum during our Presidency in the various formations of the Council."
"A fundamental question is where Europe will find the foundations for economic growth."
"Finland’s answer is that it will be found in such areas as innovation, energy solutions, the quality of work and productivity, openness in global trade, immigration and a competent social security system."
"It is the Member States which have the principal responsibility for competitiveness."
"The onus is on them."
"The Union must have its own part to play too."
"Finland will strive to achieve results with regard to the Seventh Framework Programme for research."
"The same goes for the regulation on chemicals, REACH, the Services Directive, the Working Time Directive and the regulation on international roaming."
"We want to make headway in developing a wide-ranging innovation policy."
"In Council legislation work and at the meeting of the Heads of State and Government in Lahti we will focus on initiatives designed to create a favourable environment for generating innovation and adopting it effectively."
"We are talking about a demand-driven innovation policy."
"The Heads of State and Government at Lahti can expedite the necessary decision-making process."
"If there is to be a wide-ranging innovation policy there will have to be more effective cooperation and decision-making in the Union, for example, in standardisation, in the protection of intellectual property, and in the development of the financial markets."
"It will be just as important to add momentum to student and researcher mobility, enhance cooperation between universities and expedite the creation of European centres of excellence."
"I would also like to stress how important the positive effect of competition resulting from an open global economy is on innovation."
"Europe needs to boost the mobility of its intellectual and material resources."
"The cornerstone of innovation policy is the Union’s internal market and its further development."
"The obstacles to an internal market that functions effectively must be removed, so that the benefits of economic integration can be fully felt."
"The internal market is the very foundation of the EU."
"This should not be forgotten."
"The market in services is of major importance in this, and it is excellent that we are nearing a settlement on the Services Directive."
"The role of the European Parliament has been crucial."
"I hope that the directive can be finally adopted immediately at second reading in the European Parliament."
"External relations regarding energy are also on the agenda at the meeting of the Heads of State and Government in Lahti."
"The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, has been invited to the dinner that takes place after the meeting, where he and EU leaders will have an opportunity for some informal discussions."
"Europe’s economic success depends very much on securing a reliable supply of energy at a reasonable price."
"All Member States are affected by the challenges of rising energy prices, reliability of supply and climate change."
"Energy policy choices are largely national affairs."
"The European Union, however, needs common energy policy guidelines, and, in particular, a coherent policy on external relations with regard to energy."
"During the Finnish Presidency we want to promote the strategic debate on how we need to make our objectives on energy policy visible in the Union’s external relations."
"Energy consumption and the choice of energy sources are closely related to the most serious threat to the environment of our time, climate change."
"With regard to climate policy, it is especially important to promote the discussions on the development of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change after 2012."
"The Finnish Presidency will try internationally to promote discussion that could result in the EU’s objective of establishing an ambitious regime for climate change that covers all major countries."
"A comprehensive approach would not only work to promote a response to the climate challenge which is as effective as possible but would protect EU competitiveness."
"Both these issues, energy and climate change, will be high on the agenda at summits with third countries during the Finnish Presidency, including the 10th ASEM Summit between the EU and Asian countries, to take place in Helsinki."
"I am well aware that millions of Europeans fear global competition and that, as a result, they also oppose many changes."
"This fear was in evidence in the debate on the Services Directive, for example."
"It needs to be taken seriously."
"I would stress that we should not try and boost competitiveness in Europe no matter what the cost and regardless of the consequences."
"There needs to be a balance between reform, social security and environmental sustainability."
"Frequently, however, new working methods and modern technology benefit both economic growth and social welfare, and reduce emissions into the environment."
"To preserve Europe’s welfare societies we will need to boost competitiveness, reduce unemployment, and improve labour productivity."
"The results are to be achieved through close cooperation with the social partners."
"A new balance between flexibility and security is the goal here."
"Finland will therefore host an extraordinary social summit just prior to the Lahti meeting of Heads of State and Government, where these issues will be discussed."
"The Union’s external relations are linked to the economy, as its external action is based on its economic strength."
"We are an attractive trading partner, and that means that we have influence."
"The EU has become a global actor, which cannot afford to pause to reflect when dealing with external affairs."
"During the Finnish Presidency, the EU’s international role will be consolidated and the coherence in the way it acts and functions will be reinforced."
"The Union has a far more comprehensive range of tools at its disposal than many other global players."
"They must be used with consistency, whether it is regarding policy on external relations, trade, development cooperation or human rights."
"The voice of the Union will only be heard around the world as one of unity if the Union is united."
"We intend to develop the Union’s crisis management further."
"Rapid deployment troops must be fully ready to respond by the start of 2007."
"Coordination of civil and military crisis management will continue."
"EU relations with Russia and the Northern Dimension will be priority areas during the Finnish Presidency."
"The Western Balkans, transatlantic relations and Asia will also be high on the agenda."
"EU-Russian relations will not just be limited to the issues of trade and energy: the aim is for a broad-based partnership, in which European values and global interests unite us."
"The goal will be Russia’s ever closer involvement in democratic European cooperation in the various sectors of society."
"For that we need more dialogue between the EU countries and Russia, as well as student exchanges, cultural collaborations, and the active involvement of civil society."
"During the Finnish Presidency there will be discussions regarding the new framework for the EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which expires at the end of next year."
"Regarding the Northern Dimension, we have now come a long way: the political framework agreement is to be signed in the autumn."
"The development of the Northern Dimension is also of value in respect of other forms of cooperation in the Baltic region."
"In addition to all this, we will obviously devote our efforts to the crises in the Middle East and other regions."
"We are very concerned about the situation in the Palestinian territories, on which important separate talks are being held today."
"In external relations the unexpected is the rule rather than the exception."
"Finland is also ready to take its presidential responsibilities seriously should the unexpected occur."
"During the Finnish Presidency, a thorough political evaluation will be carried out on the progress achieved in the area of freedom, security and justice."
"We need concrete action, effective decision-making and the rigid implementation nationally of the decisions that have already been taken."
"In 1999 the Tampere Summit showed the way for the ambitious and democratic development of justice and home affairs."
"Now, in 2006, the assessment of the Hague Programme will provide an opportunity actively to push ahead with European cooperation in this area."
"The public expect effective action on the part of the European Union in the fight against international criminality, people trafficking and terrorism."
"During the Finnish Presidency the political will of the Member States to commit to more effective decision-making, especially in the area of policing and crime, will be put to the test."
"The work can be improved if the Member States are ready to switch to a system of qualified majority decisions and communitisation in this area."
"The most recent European Council called on us to consider this in conjunction with the Commission."
"I would like to emphasise that cooperation on policing and crime is not just a way of scoring points."
"We do not intend to get the Constitutional Treaty through by the backdoor, because the changes can be implemented on the basis of the Treaty of Nice."
"Finland would also like to endorse the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition in judicial cooperation."
"If judgments and decisions by the legal authorities in another Member State are implemented as they stand, this can be a very real way of boosting the efficiency of large-scale, cross-border criminal investigations and speeding up legal proceedings."
"A good example of this is the European arrest warrant, which has resulted in shortening the time it has taken to extradite suspects from more than six months to as little as just one day."
"Recent events, such as those in the Canary Islands and Malta, have once again made illegal immigration headline news."
"We need to take a thorough look at the range of options that the Union has, including agreement on common policies on legal immigration."
"More effective border control is just one part of the solution, albeit an important one."
"The importance of cooperation with the countries of origin and transit involved in illegal immigration cannot be overstated."
"We need to ensure that the Union’s common asylum system is in place by 2010."
"The Union must be able to guarantee protection to those who need it, with reference to comparable procedures and legislation."
"Attention also needs to be paid to the external dimension of questions relating to migration and partnership with our neighbours."
"As I said at the beginning, cooperation between the institutions at both European and national level must be developed further."
"Today I would like to thank you in particular for this opportunity to present the priorities of the Finnish Presidency and discuss with you how they may be promoted."
"I await your comments with interest both today and at any time in the future, in this plenary and in other contexts."
"The debate on Europe’s development is an important one, regardless of the political differences."
"The leaders of the political groups in the European Parliament, for example at the public meeting in Helsinki at the start of June, have demonstrated the will and ability to move forward with the European agenda."
"We in Finland too are used to engaging in productive cross-party political cooperation."
"It is also a natural thing to do at European level."
"I hope that working together, as we will be during the next six months, will produce the best possible results."
"I look forward to being here again in the European Parliament in connection with the summits that are to be held during the Finnish Presidency."
"We live in a time of enormous challenges."
"The Union needs to look to the future, boldly embrace reform, and demonstrate the political will needed to develop Europe."
"I believe that in many cases the right answer is more Europe, not less."
"As it is about to begin, this Presidency has already been described as a sort of transitional phase."
"It would deal with the day-to-day business and prepare for a time when the preconditions for tackling the Union’s major issues are close at hand."
"It needs to be said very clearly, however, that, although the European Union might be in something of a wait-and-see mood, the rest of the world around us is not going to come to a halt."
"It would be the wrong way to treat Europe’s future generations if we were to close our eyes to the historic challenges we face and just wait around for a better time to come."
"That time is here and now."
"."
"Mr President, I am delighted that, after the excellent Austrian Presidency, we can now work in tandem with the Finns."
"In Helsinki a few days ago, Prime Minister Vanhanen and I agreed that our two teams should work as one."
"Let us join efforts between the Presidency, the Commission and Parliament."
"Europe needs the clear, dynamic harmony which Finland brings."
"I welcome the presentation by the Prime Minister, Mr Vanhanen."
"He has shown that the next six months present an opportunity to demonstrate what we mean when we talk about a Europe of results, to deliver on important dossiers of concern to our citizens, to move towards the next stage in the constitutional question, to steer the discussion on enlargement. In short, to follow the twin-track approach which I outlined to this House last month – an approach that was endorsed by the European Council – to move from a period of reflection to a period of engagement."
"Let me pick up just some of the themes raised by Prime Minister Vanhanen."
"I shall start with a simple, important point concerning enlargement."
"It is one of the most successful policies of the European Union, an extraordinary achievement in exporting freedom and opportunity across our continent."
"Many of us here today have benefited from this policy."
"We should be proud of our enlargement policy."
"I was very pleased that the last European Council reaffirmed that we will honour existing commitments."
"However, on enlargement, as on so much of European policy-making, there is a popular debate with which we must engage."
"I welcome that debate. I want that debate."
"It is important to show that Europe does not enlarge by default, that enlargement is a conscious choice that is of benefit to all, that far from being a negative factor, an enlarged Europe is a precondition for a powerful Europe, for a Europe that really counts in the world."
"That is why this autumn the Commission will report on the enlargement process as a whole, to set up the debate at the December European Council."
"This will include the analysis of the capacity of an enlarged Europe to function properly."
"This will be a serious, rigorous exercise."
"Nothing else will satisfy the public demand for more certainty and confidence."
"We must take the same serious and correct approach to Turkey."
"I welcome the fact that negotiations are under way."
"It will be a long road, sometimes a very bumpy one."
"What matters is that we are open, honest and fair."
"Turkey must fulfil its commitments, just as the European Union must fulfil its commitments."
"Turkey’s commitments include respect for the Ankara Protocol."
"Each Presidency brings its own particular expertise to the European Union."
"In Finland’s case it also brings a deep knowledge of and cooperation with its neighbours, including Russia."
"I strongly support the emphasis placed by the Presidency on the relationship with Russia."
"Earlier this week the Commission adopted a recommendation for a comprehensive agreement that we hope will bring – because we believe it is in our interests as well as Russia’s – a new quality to the European Union’s relations with Russia, building on the existing partnership and cooperation agreement."
"We are proposing to move towards a free trade area to be completed once Russia accedes to the WTO."
"At the same time, we propose a partnership approach for energy, based on mutual interests and agreed principles."
"Next week Prime Minister Vanhanen and I will travel to St Petersburg for the G8 Summit to determine, I hope, a new framework for the global energy challenges which require a global response."
"For energy, as for climate change, we need this global response."
"We will follow this up in turn at the October and December European summits."
"It is clear that on Russia – as on so many external issues – Europe has greater power when it works in a united and coherent way, and I hope the Member States will approach this issue precisely in that way."
"The Commission looks forward to the Finnish Presidency taking forward the negotiations on the next generation of Northern Dimension partnerships."
"The ultimate result should be a shared policy with common ownership by all players, including Russia."
"The Northern Dimension will become a permanent forum on northern issues and concerns."
"In this context, the Commission has taken good note of this Parliament’s aspiration to establish a parliamentary forum."
"The European economy is picking up pace."
"This is good news and we should build on it."
"I welcome the Finnish Presidency’s intention to drive forward the new Lisbon Strategy and to focus on research, innovation and education – the knowledge triangle."
"In this area, as well as in others, we must move from reflection to engagement, to real delivery."
"Political support must now be translated into concrete actions which create a more innovative climate in Europe."
"My Commission will prepare a short paper on innovation to prepare for the Lahti informal summit."
"We must promote the European Research Area, including the European Institute of Technology, which should be a flagship project and symbol of the knowledge-based European economy."
"We must accelerate the drive to ensure open and interoperable standards and promote those standards worldwide."
"We must promote effective mechanisms – like venture capital – to finance innovation by European companies, having in mind also small and medium-sized companies."
"Last week the Commission adopted proposals for an ambitious programme for increased security and more efficient justice for Europe’s citizens in a way that respects and protects their rights."
"This is a key feature of our Europe of Results agenda."
"I share the Finnish Presidency’s determination to move this dossier forward."
"The European Union will return to Tampere for the informal Justice and Home Affairs Council in September, to deepen European integration in this crucial area."
"The case for deeper and more dynamic European action is clear: against those who plot against our values, freedom and democracy; against those who traffic in human beings, especially women and children; against illegal migration and those who exploit people in the workplace."
"We should not wait for the next tragedy in order to advance European integration in these areas: we must act now to prevent it."
"We must implement better what already exists."
"For example, everybody agrees that sexual exploitation of children is a repugnant crime, yet only five countries have transposed the framework directive."
"Everybody agrees on the need to act against terrorism and organised crime, yet several Member States have not transposed effectively key legislation, such as the framework decision on terrorism."
"To achieve our goals, we must improve our procedures."
"It is not coherent to proclaim the ends – on the fight against crime, terrorism, illegal immigration – but not provide the means."
"The Commission believes the Community method, including proper European democratic scrutiny by this Parliament, should be spread to police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and legal migration."
"That is what we said in our Citizens’ Agenda paper of 10 May."
"We are therefore now proposing to use the existing Treaty articles to make this change."
"The Commission is opening the interinstitutional debate and based on the results of that debate we will present formal proposals."
"I very much welcome the clear remarks made just now by Prime Minister Vanhanen."
"We know there are political sensitivities, and we are ready to address those political sensitivities, but our procedures must catch up with reality."
"Any step we take to improve our cooperation in security and justice matters must be matched with an extended protection of the individual citizen’s human and civic rights. This is for us a question of principle."
"Law is the source of strength of the European Union, not intergovernmental backroom deals outside Parliamentary scrutiny and judicial review."
"That is why I also welcome the commitment of the Finnish Presidency to everything associated with the transparency agenda."
"Transparency, subsidiarity, better regulation should not be seen, as sometimes they are seen, as just technical matters; they are political matters."
"It is the democratic accountability agenda of our Union and we, the European Commission, stand ready to move forward on all those issues – transparency, better regulation and real subsidiarity – because this is a question of democratic accountability."
"I have picked out only a few of the priorities of the Finnish Presidency."
"There are other priorities we fully share, including matters of immediate concern such as the deadlock in the Doha trade round."
"The last few presidencies have helped the European Union resolve internal problems or lay the path towards their resolution."
"Now we need a change of gear from reflection to engagement, to a Europe which is looking forwards and outwards."
"I welcome this."
"An open Europe, a more self confident Europe, a forward-looking Europe is what we need."
"Let us renew our energies to engage more deeply, more coherently and more effectively with the world around us."
"By exporting our values, by promoting our interests in the world, we can strengthen our identity and confidence."
"I look forward to doing just that in the next six months with the Finnish Presidency and with Prime Minister Vanhanen."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the world is going crazy about football, but Europe has already won."
"The world champion will be from the European Union, and the four best teams come from its Member States."
"The President of the Commission has just been talking about self-confidence."
"So let me say that self-confidence is what we should have – but without being cocky."
"Peaceful competition – which is what the footballers are now teaching us about – is a wonderful thing, and that peaceful competition and fair play are what we need in Europe and throughout the world."
"If we take them as the basis for our actions, we will be successful."
"Who better to embody that truth than Finland?"
"Mr Vanhanen, the meeting we group chairmen had with you in Helsinki was a good one, being effective, professional, transparent and unspectacular, for it is generally the case that failure is the lot of those who announce – or seek – something spectacular, for they cannot come up with what they promised."
"Europe is like a chain; so, too, are the presidencies."
"We have had an Austrian Presidency; the Presidency is now held by the Finns."
"After them will come German, Portuguese, Slovenian and then French Presidencies."
"Every link in this chain must be strong."
"It is when this continuity is present that all presidencies are successful."
"Experience shows that it is not just the presidencies held by the so-called big countries that are successful, but, very often, on the contrary, the smaller countries were."
"We wish the Finns much success and are right behind you."
"It is on 25 March 2007 that we will be commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the Treaties of Rome, and this date falls within the German Presidency rather than the Finnish."
"We very much welcome the Commission’s proposal that there should be a joint statement by the European Council, the Commission and Parliament."
"Our group proposes that work on preparing the substance of this statement and the organisational aspects of it should begin under the Finnish Presidency, and we propose that a working group be set up to deal with the preparations at the political level."
"While the next presidency must of course be involved in this, the work must be started now, under the Finnish Presidency."
"It is not only the Summit that is to be held on 25 March, important though that of course is, and in respect of which the German Federal Chancellor has extended an invitation to Berlin, but there is also some sort of event to be staged in Rome, where the Treaties of Rome were signed fifty years ago, and I am given to understand that the Catholic Church wants to organise something."
"I would be very glad, my good Mr Cohn-Bendit, if the Greens, with whom we are in friendly competition where the unification of Europe is concerned, were to get involved in the same way as business and the trade unions are, for this Europe is something in which we all share, and is not the property of any one political family; it is for that reason that everyone should get involved."
"When Mr Schulz comes to make his speech, he will tell us all about how the Greens should behave."
"I am always reticent about giving advice and do not want to use my speaking time to answer Mr Schulz’ interjections."
"Something that you, Mr President of the European Council, will have to address is the relationship with Russia."
"While that is something that we, of course, very much welcome, we also argue that we need Russia to be a solid, stable, and – it is to be hoped – democratic partner."
"It has to be said, though, that we have to stop making it a matter of policy to give the Russians hugs and pats on the shoulder; while we say ‘yes’ to shared interests, including in energy supply, we also have to tell the Russians that human rights have to be guaranteed."
"A few days ago, I had a visit from the lawyer acting for the industrialist Mr Khodorkovsky."
"The way in which this man is being treated in Russian jails is quite unacceptable, and there are many other examples of this sort of thing."
"Where these things are concerned, we have to make our voices heard."
"Mr President of the European Council, the President of the Finnish Parliament, Mr Lipponen, told the conference of parliamentarians that we, the Austrian Presidency, and the Commission organised in Brussels, that there is also to be a conference of Members of this House and members of the national parliaments."
"This is something of which we are very much in favour, believing as we do that we in this House and the national parliaments must work much more closely together."
"If we do this, dismantle certain prejudices that exist, and work together on the European project, then success will be ours."
"On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I wish your Presidency much success."
"Where our shared future in Europe and in the world are at stake, we will be right behind you."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in order to pay tribute to the Italian football team, I shall begin my speech in Italian."
"Mr President, you see before you an unhappy German group chairman, but a happy socialist one."
"Most of my colleagues from Italy are not here this morning."
"Their absence is excusable."
"In his speech, Mr Vanhanen said that ‘we need more Europe', and he was right, for the things your presidency has chosen as the headings for the chapters in its programme – such things as the challenge of globalisation, the new Lisbon strategy, energy, partnership – all these things are now beyond the capacity of nation states to resolve."
"Not one single EU Member State, be it large or small, can now handle the challenges, whether economic, environmental or social, that we face today, and it is for that reason that we have to develop the European Union further, the reason why we have to entrench it."
"Indeed, there are those who say that we want to offer our people, who face this global challenge, the framework that Europe needs in order to keep its head above water in international competition, and what they need is more Europe."
"For the sake of consistency, though, if they are to have this ‘more Europe’, they have to supply the framework that Europe needs."
"In this Union of 25 – which will soon comprise 27 states – we cannot resolve the challenges that you rightly described with the means at our disposal; it is not possible."
"That is why your decision, as a consequence of what you described, to ratify the Constitution, was a way of saying, ‘we need this instrument’ and was, as such, a logical, right and therefore consistent decision to take."
"In so doing, you have sent out the right signal at the very outset of your presidency, and that is something of which we Social Democrats are very much in favour."
"Mr President of the Commission, you said, ‘we want to be a team with the Finnish Presidency of the Council’."
"That is terrific, and we are right there with you on that, but, in his speech just now, Mr Vanhanen had this to say:"
"‘I am convinced that an enlarging Union needs the Constitutional Treaty that was negotiated by its Member States.’"
"– Enlargement and the Constitution are two sides of the same coin."
"I now read in a report from Reuters – I have no idea as to whether it is true or false; you can explain that to us – that you, after the meeting with Mr Vanhanen, what one might call the teambuilding in Helsinki, told a press conference that we could also enlarge on the basis of the Treaty of Nice."
"The Reuters report may well be wrong, and in that case you should tell us what the truth of the matter is."
"I am grateful for the opportunity given to us to talk about the third pillar."
"The deficit that you described, and also the examples that the President of the Commission adduced of the failure to transpose legislation on security policy and third-pillar cooperation, are things that need to be dealt with."
"Nowhere are the European people more in favour of power at the European level than when it comes to the combating of organised crime, a well-ordered immigration policy, a safe asylum policy and properly secured borders, but nowhere – as Mr Barroso rightly said – are we less effective than in these areas."
"You are right to say that we need the ‘passerelle’ clause, but that has nothing to do with any ‘cherry-picking’ approach to the Constitution."
"You only have to read the Treaty of Nice to see that it already provides for a transfer from the third pillar to the first, subject to unanimous approval by the Council, five years following its entry into force, and so we are acting within the bounds set by a valid Treaty."
"While we are on this subject, let me make a final observation."
"When talking about the third pillar, we are talking about the chapter that also describes citizens’ freedoms and rights in Europe."
"When talking about the Constitution, we are also talking about the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but then we must, even now, start asking the Presidents of the Council and the Commission to be more pro-active in dealing with the populist development in Europe, of which we in this House are made aware on a daily basis."
"We now have, in the European Union, governments – and that is bad enough – that are supported by right-wing populist parties, some of them openly racist and xenophobic, and these are sitting in the European Council – not as backbenchers in some parliament or other, but as active members of European institutions."
"I myself saw an example of this during yesterday’s debate on Francoism, in which one of the speakers was a non-attached Member of this House, whose son is the Deputy Prime Minister of Poland; here, in this House, he openly defended the Franco regime."
"This is not some sort of random event; the fact is that more and more governments in the European Union are starting, through their failure to take action against it, to make populism respectable, and that constitutes a serious threat to fundamental freedoms in Europe."
"I would ask the President-in-Office of the Council to take a more serious approach to addressing this issue, not least at Council level, for when democracy is threatened, it is most often from within rather than from without."
"."
"Mr President, with the Finnish Presidency’s emphasis on productivity, accountability and transparency, ‘Finlandia’ is music to Liberal ears."
"The programme you have presented today, President-in-Office, reflects both the strong reforming tendencies of your government and the egalitarian and innovative impulses of a nation which repeatedly tops the league tables for education, innovation and development."
"Liberal values will be on the march with your Presidency."
"I would like to refer to just a few areas which my group feels to be important. First, the market-driven programme."
"Priorities like completing the internal market, particularly in services and the energy sector, are key goals for us in the months ahead, as are efforts to deliver a directive on the portability of supplementary pensions and promoting market openings for new technologies."
"The latter will pay more long-term dividends than any government-funded initiatives on research and development, and provide the growth and jobs and prosperity that our Union desperately needs."
"As regards Article 42 – justice and home affairs – your Presidency is right to focus on areas where European Union legislation adds value to citizens’ lives, but in the modern world a wanted man can be halfway across Europe before the policeman has his boots on."
"It beggars belief that the law still has borders, when criminals do not."
"For too long, key initiatives on police and judicial cooperation have been stalled in the Council, and even those decisions taken lack the democratic scrutiny that protects our human rights and civil liberties, as we have seen with the inadequacies of data protection legislation."
"President-in-Office, the time has come to heed our call to apply the footbridge clause provided for in Article 42 and to make policy in justice and home affairs democratically."
"The transparency initiative, which has found one of its key supporters in your Presidency, is one way out of this anti-democratic cul-de-sac."
"Liberals and Democrats seek your assurance that safeguard clauses will be used sparingly or not at all."
"But true transparency requires that the transposition, implementation and enforcement of legislation be given much more attention than it has to date."
"Three years ago, we demanded that Member States draw up concordance tables showing how they transposed EU directives into national law."
"Let citizens see for themselves which parts of the law come from Brussels and which reflect the hobbyhorses of national governments."
"Otherwise, poor implementation and gold-plating will continue to fuel the fire of Brussels-bashers."
"Yet, since your Presidency started three days ago, I see changes are already afoot."
"The comitology decision, which gives Parliament the right of recall, giving us equal powers to Council to make sure the law is applied, is a very important step."
"With greater power comes greater responsibility and I hope that our House will bear that in mind when it meets today to discuss much-needed parliamentary reform."
"President-in-Office, you have a big agenda: the agenda of dealing with Asia and the ASEM Summit; the agenda of dealing with Russia."
"We wish you success in this and we ask you to think not just of engagement, but of promotion of European values, of human rights and democracy, so essential to the development of our world."
"We wish you success in finding a way forward to an agreement in the WTO, so valuable to our economy and that of developing countries, and we wish you great success with enlargement, though we know that is also in the hands of another very competent Finn, Commissioner Rehn, who is here with us today."
"In conclusion, you spoke about public fears of globalisation."
"These can best be overcome by developing a European consciousness."
"As Lönnrot did for Finland in the Kalevala, we need to draw on aspects of our common history to create a common consciousness."
"I wish you the wisdom of Väinämöinen."
"I hope that for the people’s lasting pleasure you compose mighty songs for Europe’s children."
"For his people’s lasting pleasure, mighty songs for Suomi’s children."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, your speech, Mr President-in-Office, has left me quite stunned."
"You decorated all your proposals with words like ‘we must, ‘we have to’ and ‘we need to’, and, in itself, everything you said is true, but at no point did you tell us how and why you plan to reach these targets, and you never told us how they would be prioritised."
"So, let us start by assessing the situation in Europe – and in this I am repeating some of what Mr Schulz said."
"We are currently facing a worrying development in Europe: in Slovakia, the social democrats are allying themselves with the extreme right to form a government; similar developments are taking place in Poland; and in the Netherlands, the centre-right government, in an attempt to hold on to power, is forming an alliance with the populist extreme right."
"It is the same trend, and, indeed, when you say that 'Europe is a combination of values and the capacity to take action', what do you think the relationship is between values and action?"
"You have not said anything about that."
"Allow me, like Mr Poettering, to return to another problem, that of Russia and energy."
"At the moment, Europe is giving the impression that it is under Mr Putin's thumb, because it is afraid of losing its energy, and when we are afraid of losing our energy, we no longer have any energy at all!"
"That is the reality of the situation in Europe, and I saw no trace of this observation in the Finnish position."
"Do you remember the commotion caused in Finland when a member of your Green party said that the Duma was not democratic?"
"Something that is self-evident to all caused a scandal in Finland."
"I would therefore advise caution."
"In addition, you talked about illegal immigration, but, before we talk about illegal immigration, we need to discuss the need to organise legal immigration."
"Until we are able to organise legal immigration, we will continue to have illegal immigration."
"You referred to the Council of Europe and its discussions on the possibilities for enlarging Europe, but why did you not refer to its discussions on the CIA and the situation where a major international secret service institution can operate in Europe without anyone being informed – neither the European Union nor the European governments?"
"Why did you not mention the French or German secret services, who have illegally been to interrogate people in Guantanamo?"
"That is the reality of Europe."
"These are the issues you need to talk about if you want to save the rule of law in Europe."
"Even so, the Presidency needs to seize with both hands the reality of the European Union, and not content itself with making an assessment like the ones we can read every day in the newspapers."
"You have not given Europe a direction."
"That is what your speech was lacking."
"."
"Mr President, during the previous Finnish Presidency seven years ago significant steps were taken towards federalising the Union."
"At the time a basis was created for establishing an area of freedom, security and justice; in other words, the communitisation of the Member States’ civil legislation."
"That policy is now being continued."
"During the previous term the militarisation of the Union was also begun and military institutions established for it, under whose leadership preparations are in place for military operations in Africa early next year."
"Training for these is going on in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, although no one is going to the source of the chaos in the eastern parts of the country."
"In major political issues during the Presidency the Finnish Government will not obtain the backing of its own people."
"An indication of that is the resistance to the Government’s proposal to ratify the defunct EU Constitution in the Finnish Parliament this autumn."
"According to an opinion poll, just 22% of the Finnish people are in favour of ratification, as proposed by the government."
"This Constitution will never come into force anywhere."
"Its ratification is a waste of time, although that is what the Commission, among other bodies, wants."
"Commissioner Olli Rehn, after all, has adopted a position on this on behalf of the Commission, although the matter does not fall within the Commission’s competence."
"Commissioner Rehn’s attitude does not befit a Member of the European Commission."
"Some Member States, furthermore, have proposed to Finland that the Constitution should be ratified."
"Finland’s acceptance is a sign of subservience."
"Neither is Finland showing any regard for the power of the people or democracy in France or the Netherlands."
"According to an opinion poll, the Finnish people oppose any military alliance for the country."
"The Finnish Government is making a mockery of the will of the people in this matter too by making the supply of EU combat forces one priority area."
"Mr Vanhanen’s Government has yielded to the EU’s will by abolishing the requirement under national law for a UN mandate as a condition for the mobilisation of a combat force division."
"The UN is being prepared for illegal wars with no UN mandate, even though, from the legal standpoint internationally, a precondition for legal military action is in fact a UN mandate. Our group opposes these attempts at the militarization of the EU and involving the EU in illegal wars."
"Civil servants in Finland are trained in dealing effectively with matters relating to EU enlargement, Structural Funds programmes, the REACH regulation, the Seventh Framework Programme on science and research and many other day-to-day issues on the EU’s agenda."
"These also include the directive on services and free trade, which our group has viewed critically."
"Openness and transparency, which Finland says it promotes, would be increased by Finland’s own decision to make known in public the recipients of EU agricultural aid."
"Our group actively supports the policy on Russia and thinks that Commission President Barroso’s proposal for a free trade agreement with Russia is an interesting start and one which the Presidency needs to respond to."
"We wish Finland success in all the various matters it has to deal with on a daily basis."
"."
"Mr President, I should like to welcome the President-in-Office and the President of the Commission to the Chamber."
"When the incoming Presidency sets out its programme, it can often sound a little stale or bored and the reaction to it is also stale."
"That is why it is unfortunate that some of the brilliant ideas from the Presidency on the future it envisages for the European Union have not been taken up properly."
"Looking at the different Presidency programmes – whether the Finnish Presidency, the previous Austrian Presidency or even the advance programme for the German Presidency – we can often see continuity in one area, but we can also see the individuality of the country taking over the Presidency."
"One of the key elements we in the European Union must focus on is our relationship with the countries to the east of the existing European Union borders."
"You, President-in-Office, have proved your ability and skill in building up the relationship with Russia."
"It is not just about energy, but also about neighbourhood policy, cooperation and geopolitical stability, because there are so many issues in the former states of the Soviet Union that can create uncertainty and instability within the European Union."
"We have to be careful of that and we look to you to utilise your resources and skills in those areas."
"Secondly, on the question of transparency and openness – and people often speak about transparency without fully realising or understanding what it means – the most transparent thing Parliament, the institutions and the Presidency can do is to deliver on their commitments."
"That is why, President-in-Office, the ideas being proposed on improving justice and home affairs, promoting alternative energy – although I might disagree with you on other aspects of climate change and their solutions – and new ways of creating biofuels, bio-energy and bioethanol are the way forward."
"You and some of your ministers will need to be courageous in standing up to the lobby groups that want to push us down a single road."
"The best approach is the multi-track approach, taking the best from each individual part."
"The President of the Commission rightly referred to the importance of research and technology and innovation for the European economy."
"If we in Europe are not ahead of the rest of the world in our ability to create new ideas and new innovations, we will lose."
"No matter how good our tax regimes or infrastructure, if we do not have the brains, intelligence and capacity to utilise and exploit those ideas, then we will fail."
"I think some of the ideas your Presidency is putting forward on research and development will yield dividends for us. The protection of intellectual property should be one of your concerns."
"Finally, I have not so far mentioned football, but I have to mention one aspect and that is that football is a game of two halves and even extra time."
"It may be that we need extra time rather than applying the clause under Article 42 immediately."
"Let us ensure that we have consensus in the Council before moving forward."
"."
"Mr President, listening to Mr Vanhanen’s speech I experienced that déjà vu moment – we have been here before, because it is the same speech with every incoming Presidency."
"I started to ask myself, Mr Vanhanen, who do you really represent?"
"Are you here today giving us the express will of your own nation?"
"Well, I wonder, because the last comprehensive Eurobarometer poll carried out in autumn 2005 showed that only 38% of your fellow countrymen think membership of the European Union has been a good thing."
"Therefore the message from them is pretty clear: they do not want more Europe."
"And yet here you are today telling us that the medicine the rest of us need is that we must have more Europe, we must have the Constitution, we must press ahead."
"What you represent is the professional political class in Europe, who of course are all in favour of the European Union."
"My view is that it was an absolute democratic disgrace that, at the recent Brussels Summit, all 25 Heads of State and Government agreed to end the period of reflection and to begin to implement the Constitution against the wishes that the Dutch and French people expressed in their referendums last year."
"So public opinion does not matter a damn, does it?"
"It is business as usual and you are going to press on with enlargement; you are going to press on with a common asylum policy despite the fact that your own countrymen and virtually nobody else wants it; and I heard you say you are going to press for ‘better regulation’."
"Do not make me laugh!"
"The fact is, this is already a bureaucratic, over-regulated model and there will not be any real economic growth until we deregulate and free up our businesses."
"If you were a democrat and not an EU nationalist, you would put a case for free and fair open referendums, so that the peoples of Europe could express their will."
"I will not be holding my breath."
"Mr President, I ask that Mr Farage’s description of the President of the European Council as ‘not a democrat’ be recorded in the Minutes."
"Mr President, the statements made by the Finnish Presidency appear to indicate that it wishes, and I quote 'to restore the hugely deflated public confidence in the EU’s organisations’."
"Although that is, of course, a very commendable goal, it is just a little strange that the source of such sentiments should be the Finnish Government which wants the Finnish Parliament to ratify the moribund European Constitution no matter what, even though this Constitution, following the French and Dutch referendums, is no longer of any legal or democratic-political value whatsoever."
"That is in any case a bad start for restoring confidence, but it gets even worse now that the Finnish Presidency has announced that it would consider any breakdown in the accession negotiations with Turkey as, and I quote 'personal failure’."
"It is obvious, though, not only that Turkey is not a European country and can never become one geographically, politically, economically, historically, culturally and so on, but also that the majority of European citizens do not want this Turkish accession at all."
"Instead, they seek to restore and further develop the best possible friendly relations and economic contacts with our neighbour Turkey."
"The fact that the Finnish Presidency is now personally committed to promoting this Turkish accession come what may is at odds with the overblown declarations about restoring confidence and respecting the democratic views in Europe."
"It also unmasks as a lie the European claim that the negotiations can still be open-ended."
"In view of the fact that Turkish accession is being rammed down our throats, I would urge you to stop the nonsense about democracy and respect for public opinion."
"Mr President, Prime Minister, Finland is taking over the helm of the EU at a time when the Union needs leadership more than anything."
"That is why it was a pleasure to listen to Prime Minister Vanhanen’s message on Finland’s objectives."
"Finland is thoroughly prepared to succeed in its Presidency."
"That has been visible, for example, in the way we Finnish Members have been contacted."
"That is a good thing, because it is Finland’s, and not just its Government’s, Presidency."
"Finland has proposed that the Union should put time and effort into innovation and competitiveness, transparency, energy, the Northern Dimension and external relations, as well as finding a solution regarding the fate of the Constitution."
"These are aims that I could not agree with more."
"After all, a united and competitive Europe has always traditionally been the goal of the Finnish National Coalition/Conservative Party and the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"Finland, however, should take a look in the mirror when it comes to progress on the European Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"The government’s approach in particular to the European defence dimension has been woefully inconsistent."
"The Finnish Government has normally taken a critical view of closer defence cooperation."
"Our Government has only yielded when it has realised it was in a minority in the Council."
"In the end, it was demonstrated in practical terms that the development which the Government had been opposing was the right one and good for Europe as a whole, and not just Finland."
"Prime Minister, security is not created through isolation."
"Closer cooperation is needed if we are to improve the security of the European people and global stability."
"Our citizens also expect that."
"As you said, the EU has become a superpower, which cannot afford to pause to reflect in its external action."
"What then could the Council do under a Finnish leadership?"
"There are several concrete proposals on security in the Constitutional Treaty."
"They include a solidarity clause, enhanced cooperation on crisis management, closer defence material cooperation, and the obligation to assist other Member States in the event of a military attack, that is to say, mutual defence."
"Most of these have already been introduced in one way or another, though not the security guarantee clause."
"The development, however, has become tangled."
"It is high time we implemented Maastricht’s lofty goal: a Common Foreign and Security Policy, an essential component of which is also a common defence system."
"If I can quote the wise words of the Prime Minister, we should not just wait around for a better time to come."
"That time is here and now."
"Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, Finland’s success during its Presidency might be measured by how well Finland chairs the debate on Russia and negotiates with that country."
"Surely not many will accuse us any longer today of Finlandisation!"
"Energy is a weapon of foreign policy, but it is also a weapon in the struggle for global resources, for energy."
"The energy issue has become a sensitive barometer of the relationship between the European Union and Russia, one which could also lead to conflict."
"We want security of supply, and Russia wants a reliable customer."
"Is this such an impossible equation to balance?"
"That is what Finland is now trying to do, as Finland and Russia have been operating that way for many years now."
"One or two revolutions notwithstanding, the oil has been flowing as normal."
"The Russians have begun to take a positive view of the Northern Dimension, but now have doubts about the new European Neighbourhood Policy, because they do not want to be compared with countries in the south or the northern Sahara."
"The Northern Dimension must become an important forum for northern issues."
"The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement needs to be reformed."
"It was out of date when it started, and, just as Mr Poettering said, we want a stable, democratic and developing Russia."
"Russia cannot be forced into it, however, and we all have experience of that."
"During its Presidency, Finland will not be like Mr Berlusconi: there will be less play-acting and a little more honesty."
"Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the Finnish Presidency will freshen up a tired EU."
"That, at least, is what we Finns want to believe."
"History has shown that the presidencies of small countries have often brought with them a breath of fresh air."
"Now the Northern breeze is very welcome."
"Its coolness is invigorating."
"Close, tangible cooperation with Russia is important for the entire EU, both economically and politically."
"As a neighbouring country, Finland has a special interest in getting talks under way and making rapid progress with them."
"Despite the fact that we share a border, Finland is not one of those countries which are suspected of promoting its own interests at the expense of a common European policy."
"Concrete action is expected of the Finnish Presidency in energy policy, environmental policy, and, in particular, cooperation in the Baltic region in all its respects."
"Secondly, I would like to raise the issue of transparency."
"The Prime Minister said that transparency is essential."
"What is most important with regard to transparency is public access to documents, because the openness of meetings can sometimes be rather deceiving."
"Only through transparency will EU policy be comprehensible to people and will the public and national decision-makers be able to monitor it, and this monitorability and accountability are important."
"The EU must have the support and approval of its citizens, and, for that, transparency, monitoring and accountability are important factors."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Prime Minister, I am sorry but your approach is more that of a careful civil servant or an apprentice rather than a leader, let alone visionary."
"Your basic position is to attend to processes which are already well under way in the Union, which is vitally important, admittedly, but not enough."
"A leader must face up to the challenges which global and European developments bring with them."
"You barely acknowledged the importance of climate change."
"There is not even a mention of climate change in the list of priorities for the Finnish Presidency, even though it concerns the future, not only of Europe, but of all humanity."
"It really is not enough to list the meetings which are on the agenda."
"We need a proactive, creative approach on the part of the EU President."
"Otherwise, there will definitely not be any global agreement on how we are to continue protecting the climate after Kyoto, which is to say after 2012, which is already quite close."
"The inclusion of new countries in particular needs a completely different approach from the one you just proposed."
"One of our greatest challenges is the explosive growth in the flow of illegal refugees."
"You merely proposed more effective border controls, police cooperation and asylum procedures."
"This is very discouraging indeed."
"Europe needs to develop an immigration policy fast, so that people from elsewhere in the world can move here to work completely legally."
"It is wrong and cruel to regard poor immigrants as illegal workers without rights."
"One internal challenge which we face is discrimination against minorities, such as homosexuals, and I hate all the fuss that was stirred up which the European Parliament intervened in on two occasions this year and asked the Finnish Presidency to do something about."
"You did not say anything about this."
"Why not?"
"Where is your leader’s approach?"
"In the Council, do you intend to take forward the decision that was taken on the fight against racism and xenophobia?"
"You spoke too of transparency, which is welcome, but there are contradictions in what you say."
"Before, Finland said it would promote transparency, but in the Finnish weekend newspapers you say that you do not intend to increase transparency."
"Today you spoke about developing internet search services."
"What, then, is your policy on transparency?"
"Is it just technical trickery or the development of the transparency of decision-making itself?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have already said on other occasions that, until we change our liberalist approach, we will struggle to get out of the crisis that Europe is in."
"It is this approach that is jeopardising the social and environmental objectives, which we are nevertheless trying to achieve."
"Let us take energy: energy cannot be regarded as a commodity like any other, it is the key issue of the future, which requires us to go down the road of the Kyoto Protocol and far beyond, to switch to renewable sources, by abandoning fossil fuels, and not to run the unacceptable risks of nuclear energy use; it requires fairness and solidarity and not conflicts, trade wars or even, as is sometimes the case, military wars; it requires another vision of the economy, of society, of politics and of democracy."
"Europe is talking about an energy community, and that is a good idea, but, in order to exist, that community requires the aforesaid choices to be made, and made together with the others – from Russia to South America and to Africa – and not against them."
"In a few days’ time, the G8 will take place in St Petersburg, and, even though we find the venue very controversial and unacceptable, Europe must present those proposals there, as they go hand in hand with the concept of energy as a common resource of the future."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, in the debate on the programme of the Finnish Presidency I would like to draw attention to a significant obstacle in relations between the EU and Russia."
"Finland, which has traditionally had good relations with Russia, needs to make headway on at least two matters."
"The first is Russia’s use of fuel supplies as levers of political influence, both on the EU Member States, and on other countries."
"Russia, which wants good relations with the EU, must put a stop to such practices, and this is something that the EU should demand at the next summit."
"Secondly, Russia is applying for membership of the World Trade Organisation, in which the EU is a major player, yet she is blocking the import of many products to her markets, thereby infringing WTO standards."
"A telling example of this is Russia’s ban on imports of Polish foodstuffs for the past seven months."
"Although Poland has since eliminated all of the grounds for which these exports were blocked, the Russian side has failed to raise the restrictions."
"Given this situation, it should be impossible for EU representatives to agree to Russian WTO membership without that country finally resolving the issue of access to its markets, including access for goods of Polish origin."
"I hope that the Finnish Presidency will make efforts to resolve the above issues."
"Mr President, my dear fellow member of the Convention Prime Minister Vanhanen, I think it was brave of Mr Vanhanen to offer to begin the ratification process for a treaty that should have been dead and buried after the referendums in France and the Netherlands."
"Why is there now a lack of courage in Finland?"
"Why does he not dare put the Constitution to a referendum?"
"On the same day as we visited the Prime Minister in Helsinki he got his President to sign the draft Constitution, to which she is opposed."
"This happened just a few hours after Finnish television had published an opinion poll showing that only 22% of Finns back the Constitution, while 48% oppose it."
"I think that Mr Vanhanen should be hiding behind his prime ministerial gown."
"At the Convention, the Prime Minister worked for transparency, democracy and proximity to the people and supported the call for the Constitution to be put to referendums in every Member State."
"Make the requirement for a referendum in every Member State a condition of acceptance by Finland, thus putting into practice the transparency you heralded."
"Put all the documents from the entire legislation process on the website."
"Open up all meetings to the public unless a majority of the countries actively request this not to be done."
"The Prime Minister signed the draft at the Convention with his own hand, in common with all the other elected representatives there."
"Put it to the next meeting of the Council of Ministers."
"Twenty of the 25 governments have also signed up."
"The draft can be adopted by a simple majority of the 25 Member States."
"Promises ought to be kept."
"I call on our Finnish President-in-Office to be brave and stand by his signature."
"I am sure that the Prime Minister would only make enemies in the EU’s secret COREPER government."
"The peoples of the whole of Europe would love him if he were the one to open the locked doors to this remote Union."
"I hope that there will be something to say thank you for in December."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party."
"I fully agree with the priorities of the Finnish Presidency and, in particular, with the emphasis placed on reviving the role of our institutions, both at European level and at international level."
"As regards the first aspect, as regards, that is, the institutions’ relationship with the citizens, there are many strategies that can be undertaken: dialogue, democracy, debate, as the Commission is proposing, are certainly among these, but I feel that three actions in particular could really send out a strong signal to Europeans regarding our political will."
"They are: i) to conclude the period of reflection in order to relaunch the constitutional process in practice; ii) to make the decision-making process and, I would add, the administrative process, more transparent – in this connection, I am grateful to the Finnish Presidency for its commitment along these lines, a commitment that, I hope, will have concrete results; iii) to try to find a convincing and practicable solution to the issue of Parliament’s having two seats, a problem that certainly does not contribute to the image of efficiency and circumspection that we want to present to our citizens."
"On an international level, as Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen has declared, the EU is a community of values and its starting points are peace and stability."
"One of the commitments the EU has made in the eyes of the international community is to promote these values outside, as well as inside, its borders."
"I therefore hope that the Council will be able to support the requests that will come from Parliament in this connection, regarding the instruments that must finance international cooperation and the promotion of democracy and of human rights."
"In this sector, too, it is in fact important to guarantee a strong, consistent and effective commitment in addition, once again, to transparency in decision making and in the implementation process, so as to ensure that we give due credibility to our actions."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by wishing the Prime Minister well as he embarks on his work."
"His profile in the this week said that he had built his own house and loves gardening."
"With someone so practical in his approach to life, I am sure we can also look forward to a very practical Presidency."
"The new Presidency wants to develop a transparent and effective Union."
"The issues of transparency and openness are ones the British Conservatives have been championing for many years."
"The opening of Council meetings, despite the crass attempts by the new British Foreign Secretary to preserve secrecy, is a step in the right direction."
"We will watch carefully to see that the letter and spirit of openness is upheld in the coming months."
"I also welcome the Presidency’s wish to scrutinise the effects of legislation and improve its clarity."
"However, we have long argued for proper assessments of whether some legislation is actually required at all."
"The initial presumption must always, in my view, be against legislating."
"Proper impact assessments should also be undertaken before embarking on new laws and I hope the Presidency will make progress on less legislation and less regulation being an essential part of the reform agenda that I would like to see Europe develop."
"I welcome the support for a collegiate approach to the Presidency."
"It certainly makes sense for two or three incoming Presidencies to get together to agree priorities and to pursue plans based on a longer-term programme."
"Six-monthly stop and start policies often do not work when we need long-term planning and reform."
"I hope the Presidency will work closely with President Barroso on the economic reform agenda."
"There is no room for complacency."
"The drive to make Europe more competitive does not begin and end with summit conclusions."
"The need for reform is as urgent as ever and I hope the Presidency will champion the kind of liberalising and reformist economic agenda that we have long urged."
"Finally, can we please sort out the vexed question of the seat of this Parliament once and for all?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, The Finnish Presidency of the Council – as Mr Vanhanen has again demonstrated today – is one with a very sober approach, and, though it might sometimes be rather too cool in its utterances, I can say, thinking of the problems that it will have to deal with, that things are going to hot up quite a bit from time to time."
"One problem to which both you and the President of the Commission alluded is the issue of Turkey."
"You will be aware that we regard the opening of negotiations with Turkey and the progress of those negotiations as very serious matters, but you will also be aware of our absolute insistence on Turkey discharging its legal obligations, Although we would wish – and it is good that Commissioner Rehn is here to hear this – to see, in parallel with this but not dependent on it, everything possible being done to give the Turkish population of Northern Cyprus a better chance of doing as they desire and drawing closer to the European Union, with the Cypriot Government also doing everything in its power to open up new ways and new channels in order to foster new trust between the two ethnic groups."
"If you succeed in doing both these things, that is to say, getting Turkey to do what the law requires of it while also moving things forward in Cyprus, that would be a very great triumph indeed."
"Turning to South-Eastern Europe, I can do no other than confirm that we would also like to see you taking further steps to show all of them – including the Serbs – the road to Europe at this very difficult stage."
"Let me turn, thirdly, to Russia. It is only right that you should place both energy and Russia high up your agenda."
"There are two things that we regard as vitally important."
"Firstly, where energy is concerned, a legally binding framework needs to be agreed on by Russia and the European Union, and, if not the energy charter – concerning which Mr Barroso has announced new initiatives – then it must be some other legally binding framework that is transparent to both parties and valid in both of them."
"Secondly, it is vitally important that Russia should pursue a neighbourhood policy similar to Europe’s."
"We both have interests in our common neighbours, but, while we offer them one thing or another, Russia often brings political pressure to bear on them."
"I would like to see you get Moscow, too, to offer its neighbours something."
"In that way, we could end up competing with one another in terms of what we can offer, rather than there being offers from one side and political pressure from the other."
"Mr President, I have a request for you, Mr Vanhanen, now that your work on extending the competence of the EU is to be taken further."
"I fully support your proposal to change cooperation in legal affairs so that we will now have majority decision-making."
"This would indeed mean stepping up our joint effort to combat terrorism and the terrible trade in women."
"As I say, I have a request for you, Mr Vanhanen, from one Liberal to another, so to speak."
"Make sure that we do not end up on a slippery slope."
"There are many worrying signs."
"Examples include the cases involving data protection, the handing over of passenger lists, the CIA flights and now the most recent case involving the company Swift, which has allowed American authorities to monitor European bank transfers."
"We must be vigilant in ensuring that our fundamental freedoms are not violated and that we do not compromise our rights unduly for the sake of the fight against terrorism."
"By this I mean that we must not unduly compromise our freedom for the sake of our own security."
"There is a very fine balance to be struck here, so think about this when you get down to work."
"Work well, and with zeal!"
"Mr Barroso, from one small country to another: have a good match tonight and may the best team win!"
"Mr President, President-in-Office, as a representative of the European Free Alliance stateless nations, such as Scotland, Wales and Catalonia, I note that Finland, as well as leading the EU and celebrating a hundred years of restored independence, was the first nation in the world to grant full political rights to women."
"As more and more small countries such as Catalonia, Montenegro and my own, Scotland, seek to reassert our right to independence, we look to Finland and the other small Member States of the EU as role models."
"I welcome your stated commitment to transparency and subsidiarity."
"However, if we are really to restore public credibility in the European Union, as we both want, we must do more than simply retable the existing Constitution text."
"EU credibility in Scotland, for instance, will not improve if the disastrous common fisheries policy is further entrenched."
"This wasteful trek that we must make to Strasbourg each month does not help."
"I also welcome the President-in-Office’s stated intention to consult on the Constitution, but we need to consult not only each other in the institutions but also the public and take note of what they say."
"Mr President, following on from the Austrians, we now, with the Finns, have for the second time the Council Presidency occupied by a neutral EU Member State, or perhaps I should say a formally neutral EU Member State, for, when I look at the Finnish Presidency’s programme as regards foreign policy, and military policy in particular, things are exactly as they were, and, in some respects, even more so."
"With the official purpose of providing security for elections, 2 000 EU soldiers are to be deployed in the Congo, yet we know – and the German defence minister has himself said – what this is actually all about; it is actually all about safeguarding Germany’s and the EU's economic interests, and now – or so I see from the plan – the Sudan is the next country to get the treatment, this time with NATO involvement."
"The EU is constantly embarking on new military adventures, and that I do regard as fatal."
"The ‘battle group’ is to be put into service during the Finnish Presidency – something I regard as problematic – and, lamentably, we are still pushing the constitutional treaty even though it has been pronounced dead."
"Why do we not, at long last, give up on it?"
"I would urge you to do an about-turn, and commit yourself to a truly civilian Europe, with no more billions of taxpayers’ money being spent on militarisation, and to act like a state that really is neutral."
"Although the debate about Europe’s future requires an ambitious and decisive presidency in the second half of 2006, this morning’s presentation makes me fear the worst."
"Allow me to start with ambition, or the lack of it."
"I criticise you for clinging onto the rejected European constitution."
"By doing so, you, the Finnish President, prevent a fresh, ambitious debate about the future of the European Union from being initiated."
"That is not all, though."
"The Finnish Presidency, which trumpets its commitment to transparency, is keeping Europe painfully divided."
"While you know that the text of the twice rejected constitution should at least be amended, you have the intention of ratifying this European constitution during your presidency."
"How can this be justified to the citizen, and – more to the point – the Dutch citizen?"
"I am also concerned about your lack of decisiveness."
"Will you really mind the shop single-handedly while we wait for Chancellor Merkel?"
"How decisive is a presidency which, by way of an interview given by its Foreign Affairs Minister to the , indicates from as early as 1 July that it does not expect a great deal from the consultation round with the Member States?"
"I do not often experience the pleasure of agreeing with the analysis of Mr Leinen, chairman of our Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"I do, however, share his view that the Council is sending out a confusing message."
"The Finnish Presidency must unambiguously choose between the rejected constitution or a new treaty framework."
"My preferred choice, by the way, would be the more ambitious second option."
"I would therefore call on the Finnish Presidency to display now the ambition and real decisiveness that are called for."
"Mr President, I am pleased that the Finnish Prime Minister mentioned more effective European institutions today."
"This is a major issue at the moment, when the European Union is at a crossroads."
"In my view we should not restrict the competences of the Council, but increase those of the European Parliament as the body elected by the citizens, and restrict the competences of the Commission, in whose election the citizens have had no say."
"I am pleased with the Finnish Presidency’s support for the idea of greater transparency for European institutions, as transparency is a vital issue."
"It is a good thing that the Presidency has been positive in assessing the latest EU enlargement;"
"I believe that in the coming six months there will be a good atmosphere for the next gradual and sensible expansion of EU structures."
"When the President of the Council speaks of the need to work towards greater European competitiveness, I hope that this is not mere words, and that the Council will translate this promise into concrete action, for instance in the services sector, and that there will be an end to all the restrictions that the unfortunate Services Directive in its current form imposes in this field."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, you are not in the easiest of positions, Mr Vanhanen, sandwiched between an Austrian Presidency that had a respectable record and a German Presidency that is already attracting some significant attacks."
"This suffocating position should have given you greater determination to be daring, so that Finland can be the Presidency of practical invention and of long-term progress."
"Unfortunately, instead of surprising us, you have disappointed us."
"Your speech was lacking in spirit."
"We were treated to a catalogue, a hotchpotch of ideas in which you took great care not to leave out a single facet of European policy, but that is not what we are expecting from you: what we want is concrete action."
"I will give you a few examples: you should concern yourself with the cost of calling abroad using a mobile phone, which penalises so many Europeans; and you should also provide real support for the implementation of Galileo."
"What we expect from you is that you use your influence in the Council to achieve more proactive developments in judicial and police cooperation."
"You also have another task, that of the European Union's own funding, because it has been unable to provide itself with a budget."
"The Council has been unable to give itself a budget that matches the ambitions publicised by the European Union."
"It would be a great shame if we had to return to the leitmotif of 'we cannot go any further, the Council is standing in the way'."
"Nevertheless, why do you not share with us your experience of a true forestry policy?"
"Wood is a renewable resource, and it thus meets criteria that are of interest to Europe in the context of climate change."
"You spoke about energy, but what we ask is that you be strong: strong when confronted with Russia, because power is all that Russia understands."
"Then, when we talk about Europe's borders, listen to the European Parliament, which is concerned about taking account of the European Union's absorption capacity."
"To conclude, and this may be the only positive note in my speech, I would like to lend you my support in your government's declared desire to show greater firmness with regard to Turkey on the issue of Cyprus, because the Turkish invasion is the only barrier to reunification of the island."
"As you can see, there is much to do if your Presidency is not to be a wait-and-see Presidency."
"Mr President, I welcome the Finnish Presidency, which I assume will be carried out with the usual Finnish efficiency and professionalism."
"Finland has a lot to teach us, particularly in relation to the importance of investment in high-quality education and also how to balance economic efficiency and social justice."
"I welcome the President-in-Office’s speech, which boils down to three points."
"There are three priorities for the Council at the moment: action, action and action."
"Citizens do not love processes, they love outcomes, and we will be judged by our outcomes."
"On Friday we, in the United Kingdom, will mark the anniversary of the horrific events of 7 July 2005, when 52 of our citizens were blown up in a terrorist attack."
"I well remember the sympathy and solidarity that I received from my colleagues here in the European Parliament at that time last year, and that which we showed to our Spanish colleagues the year before at the time of the Madrid bombings."
"Our citizens expect Europe to make them secure."
"We had another event on 21 July, which fortunately was unsuccessful."
"However, because of the European Arrest Warrant one of the suspects was brought back to the United Kingdom from Italy in a matter of weeks."
"That is precisely the sort of action our citizens want to see."
"We need to deliver on better security cooperation."
"We also need to deliver on better security as a whole. We still have great shortfalls in our crisis management capabilities."
"That is because Member States say they will do something and then do not deliver. Let us make delivery by Member States our absolute priority."
"Similarly, on migration policy, let us have a fair, effective policy that links development and migration policy, one that makes our borders much more secure."
"Let us, on energy, recognise that we have a single market."
"Let us follow through on that logic."
"Let us drive forward the whole single market agenda, which is still too incomplete."
"I welcome your commitment to better regulation, President-in-Office, but as you have heard today the biggest gain in better regulation will be to stop the European Parliament wandering around Europe, so that we can better focus on legislation."
"Mr President, I want to thank Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen for his comprehensive presentation."
"I would especially like to endorse his concern regarding the justification of the Union’s existence, its legitimacy."
"The virtual collapse of the Constitutional Treaty in the referenda that were held reflects not so much the immense control the people have over legislation but the suspicion and distrust which they feel with regard to the European Union."
"There is good cause for this."
"The huge amount of EU legislation, with all its meticulous detail, the vast and ineffective bureaucracy and the wholly disproportionate amount of monitoring and supervision make the Union objectionable."
"That is why the Prime Minister’s promise to invest more time and energy in better legislation, in particular, is important."
"I agree with Prime Minister Vanhanen that the Union must focus on the essential and do that effectively."
"Regarding the Constitutional Treaty, Finland has a splendid opportunity to take the initiative and show real leadership by initiating consultations regarding the extent to which it can be taken forward and what it should contain."
"If the EU is to succeed in the context of global competition it will have to be made more competitive."
"Research, product development and training are crucial."
"Hopefully, the Presidency will quickly succeed in simultaneously introducing legislation and programmes so that the meagre resources contained in the financial frameworks can start to be used."
"Finally, I would like to mention agriculture, although there is no separate mention of it in the programme."
"In practice it is the only area of policy in which the EU regulates the private citizen’s level of income."
"Our largest industrial sector, the food industry, is also dependent on it."
"Hopefully, the Presidency will succeed in protecting our agriculture at WTO talks, where it is the object of furious attack."
"At the same time I hope that the preconditions for sustainable and competitive agriculture are assured everywhere in Europe, including the peripheral regions, in accordance with the decisions of the European Council."
"I wish my country, Finland, every success in its Presidency."
"– Mr President, there is no need to delude ourselves that anything will change during the Finnish Presidency."
"It will continue to implement the same reactionary, anti-grassroots policy and militarisation of Europe for the next six months, as its programme confirms."
"Its first choice is cooperation to resuscitate the European constitution, even though it was condemned and rejected by the people of France and the Netherlands."
"Promotion of competitiveness to increase the profitability of Euro-unifying capital through even more oppressive exploitation of the workers."
"Tax relief for capital and new taxes for the workers within the framework of the development of European Union regulations."
"Green Paper on employment law in order to abolish every legal right won by the working-class movement through its struggles."
"As for relations with Russia, they are the much sought after counterpart to competition with the USA."
"However, what are particularly insulting are the pressures which the Finnish Presidency says it is preparing to exert on the Member States to start trading directly with occupied northern Cyprus, ignoring the fact that there is an occupying army and ignoring the pseudo-state in order to satisfy unacceptable Turkish demands."
"We must not allow this."
"We shall support any action by the working-class movement against this policy."
"Mr President, in recent debates I have heard two definitions of the Finnish Presidency."
"The first was that if the EU does not actually regress in the next six months the Finnish Presidency will have been a success."
"The other definition was that Finland’s principle task is to prepare for Germany’s forthcoming Presidency."
"It is not like that, however: Finland has a lot more to offer Europe and the Europeans."
"The especially important priorities, Russia and energy, are areas where Finland has much expertise."
"It is with regard to these issues that the EU must take the biggest step forward."
"We totally lack a common policy on Russia and we cannot negotiate with Russia on an equal footing before we have one."
"Prime Minister, you were quite right also to mention that here in Parliament there are many issues in progress which should be brought honourably to completion."
"They include REACH and the Financial Regulation and many other matters which are those very small steps which will help the EU to move forward."
"You also mentioned enlargement, which I see as one of the most important issues and an immense challenge."
"It is in fact impossible to push forward enlargement which is too fast and against the will of the people and the Constitution at one and the same time."
"The Romanian and Bulgarian issue will come up during the Finnish Presidency and it is important to show our citizens that the criteria are being adhered to."
"The importance of this still obviously needs stressing, especially with regard to Turkey."
"The criteria must be adhered to for the people to have confidence in the EU."
"What the people expect more than anything is obviously deeds and vision."
"The old view of why the EU exists is no longer enough for our citizens."
"Accordingly, it is time we established a new, common, definite idea of what the EU will like be in 10 or 20 years’ time."
"This is the issue that I think would be absolutely right for this Finnish Presidency to begin work on."
"It certainly will not be brought to completion but it is important to start working on it in order for the relationship between the people and the EU institutions to be able to continue in a positive mood."
"Mr President, the President-in-Office is famous in Finland for cooperation and consensus."
"I sincerely hope, President-in-Office, that when you meet the social partners at the social summit in October, you will make real progress, because no progress can be made on the wealth and values of the European Union Member States without broad, consensus-based cooperation."
"President-in-Office, when we talk about flexicurity, which I am happy that you and President Barroso have embraced as an important basis for cooperation, it is extremely important that it is not just flexibility – which Mr de Villepin in France would like to see – but both flexibility and security in a combined and globalised modern version."
"That can only be done in cooperation with the social partners, which I hope you will take the lead on."
"You have all the prerequisites to do it and I am sure you will."
"As I have emphasised this morning, my second appeal to you is that you combat crime, terrorism and human trafficking."
"Since you relaunched the Finnish Presidency in Tampere, this must now be the time to turn that into reality."
"I hope that, using the clause, we shall see the Finnish Presidency ending up with a very clear result for all our citizens."
"– Mr President, Prime Minister Vanhanen, Mr President of the Commission, I believe that the Finnish Government has set itself the right priorities."
"We say ‘yes’ to strengthening the Common Foreign and Security Policy, including raising the profile of security policy."
"We say ‘yes’ to more competition and to greater transparency in EU legislation."
"We also say ‘yes’ to a calm debate as part of the constitutional process, as the Prime Minister no doubt has in mind for his country’s Presidency."
"As he can see, we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the European Parliament have great confidence in the success of the Finnish Presidency."
"All of this is taking place against the background of the Prime Minister’s recent statements in the Finnish Parliament, however."
"He said there that the Union no longer shares a common core, and that instead coalitions are formed depending on the individual case."
"The common European interest is taking second place to intergovernmental cooperation on a case-by-case basis."
"We should like him to do something for the common European interest, for the European core, and thus also to set an example for the subsequent German Presidency."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have won the FIFA World Cup, but in political terms, too, the European Union is on the attack once more, it is achieving joint success, and it has increased its common objectives once again."
"I would ask the President-in-Office of the Council to be a strong captain of his Council team and to increase teamwork with his fellow players – cooperation with Parliament, for example, was one of the reasons for the success of the Austrian Presidency."
"I would ask him to continue this course of strengthening cooperation and involving Members."
"Cooperation with Parliament is not the same as cooperation with national parliaments We are here to be the Council’s partners and co-legislators – not to monitor it."
"We are on a par with the Council; it is the Council, rather than the national parliaments, that is our opposite number."
"Secondly, on the subject of transparency, I would ask the President-in-Office to ensure that this catchword becomes legislative reality, as transparency is a precondition for putting an end to the double game involving domestic and European policy."
"I ask that he ensure that all citizens of the Member States learn of the transparency of the Council’s role as legislator; and that he advertise transparency and give EuroNews a slot in the schedules of all public broadcasters."
"Thirdly, on the subject of enlargement, the only way of inspiring confidence is through observance of the rules and consistency in our negotiations."
"If the Ankara Protocol is not implemented, the accession negotiations with Turkey must be discontinued."
"I recommend the President-in-Office to follow the example of the enlargement of the euro area, and that of the discussions on enlargement of the last six months."
"For this reason, I would also ask the President of the Commission to clarify his comment on the preconditions for enlargement, which may be technically correct but, politically, has caused confusion."
"When we say that Nice is not enough, we must make it clear that, before we embark on the next major enlargement – namely the accession of Croatia – we need a new constitutional treaty."
"Finally, I would ask the President-in-Office of the Council to ensure that results are achieved with regard to the Services Directive, the Working Time Directive and the Television without Frontiers Directive, and also regarding cross-border payments."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in my speech I will deal with three points from your speech and add a challenge."
"Firstly, I would like to welcome the fact that the Finnish Government, on taking over the Presidency, has stood by its word and ratified the Constitution, which has now been supported by the majority of the States and people of Europe."
"That is a fact that must be emphasised, because we all agree that it is necessary, not just in order to enlarge, but also in order to function."
"Secondly, with regard to the issue of security and the fight against terrorism, I would like to thank you for the support that you and other members of the European Council gave us at the beginning of the process of overcoming violence and achieving peace in my country, Spain."
"Thirdly, I would also like to stress that the process of creating a Community immigration policy — and you mentioned the case of the Canary Islands — began in Tampere and we must make a serious effort to speed it up."
"Finally, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, last week in Geneva I had the opportunity to meet Mrs Lehtomäki, Minister for External Trade and Development, at the negotiations of the Doha Development Round."
"That is a very important challenge and it must be given concrete form during the Finnish Presidency."
"I believe that it must be given a prominent place on the agenda, in order to safeguard our future and take on our responsibilities."
"Mr President, I am reassured by the Prime Minister’s determination to focus on the Balkans and advance their progress towards the EU."
"Prime Minister, I know this is a European not a Finnish project, but you are particularly well placed with your former President, Mr Ahtisaari, involved in the status talks on Kosovo and your former assistant, Olli Rehn, as the Commissioner for Enlargement."
"The EU has a heavy responsibility to get the balance right between encouragement, as in the case of visa facilitation which will be debated tonight, and pressure, for example on delivering war crime suspects to The Hague – particularly as regards the challenge in Kosovo."
"I am reassured by your energy in that direction."
"Secondly, the EU is dysfunctional in the area of justice, home affairs and human rights."
"On the one hand, there are the delays and dilution of measures resulting from the national veto."
"Almost five years after agreeing on an EU anti-terrorism law, some Member States have still not implemented it."
"On the other hand, we talk a lot of rhetoric about human rights, we preach to third countries, but there are credible indications of complicity by many EU countries in illegal rendition and torture."
"We do not convict terrorists, but we are at best passive with regard to human rights breaches in the war on terror."
"This is a toxic mix and I ask you to look at the contrasts and contradictions in this area."
"– Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I find your programme clear, practical and credible, which has not been the case with all presidencies."
"Some of your priorities strike us as essential, including the issue of Russia and energy."
"We have to be clear on the Russia issue."
"There is no point in negotiating only with Russia on the issue of energy."
"Russia is an extremely important partner that we must bring into international affairs, because that way we can also influence human rights and democracy in that huge country."
"A further priority that you put forward, with which we agree, is that of the Europe of results. This is an area that the President of the Commission has been pushing and that has been fought for, in spite of the difficulties with the Constitution."
"The Europe of results is closely associated with growth and employment."
"It must be said that the intergovernmental method that has been pursued for the Lisbon Strategy has led to disappointingly mediocre results."
"The Commission must be given the responsibilities and the resources that it needs to draw up a roadmap, whereby we can grow and can create more jobs, just as we have done for the internal market and the single currency."
"What is currently in place is not working and will be a further disappointment for our citizens."
"Lastly, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I feel the period of reflection on Europe in 2020 that you have suggested is most welcome."
"We have to start today to think about the Europe that we want in the future, and it is in this pragmatic, open and, hopefully, transparent vein that I have faith in this Finnish Presidency."
"I hope that at the end of the Presidency I can come here with words of congratulation for you."
"– I shall not be going on the attack."
"I shall leave that to the Portuguese national team tonight, which I hope will beat France."
"You said, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that we are living in a time of challenges, such as globalisation, climate and demographic challenges, and that we must look to the future with courage."
"We agree."
"The Lisbon Strategy will help us to meet these challenges and to realise the knowledge triangle of which Mr Barroso spoke."
"The Lisbon Strategy is the best instrument at our disposal for modernising the European economy, for boosting employment, for creating more jobs and for delivering social cohesion."
"In other words, more and better Europe."
"Finland is a successful example of economic competitiveness based on knowledge and innovation."
"It is a shining example of modernisation and progress."
"The Finnish Presidency is therefore in an excellent position, and has a major responsibility, to provide impetus to the Lisbon Agenda."
"I should like to ask whether the Finnish Presidency is prepared to do this."
"My second question concerns the policy on equality between men and women."
"Finland has special responsibilities on this issue, too."
"What practical measures will Finland propose to the Council to promote equality between men and women at all levels?"
"Mr President, as the European Union's newest members we have learnt a great deal from Finland, and from you personally."
"You have had recent experience of the accession process, which is why we are extremely confident that your Presidency will be sensitive to those concerns and problems associated with integration."
"In fact, the date of entry two years ago only marks the beginning."
"We have to continue to fight for the same treatment, equal rights within the European Union and for the same standards, after all, the great historical undertaking of reunifying Europe and trying to catch up is a long process."
"This is clearly highlighted by the debate on the service directive or Lithuania's membership of the euro area, which provides a clear indication of the current uncertainties and, unfortunately, the distrust shown towards new members, as well as the application of double standards."
"This is why it is very important that when we are talking about the European Union's further expansion, we must not forget that it is also our job to deal with the impact of the last, and biggest expansion so far, in 2004, as well as to focus on the European Union's capacity."
"The European Union's recent expansion, combined with current events, highlight how important it is to strengthen a common Europe's basic democratic values."
"In fact, a short time ago, Martin Schulz had some harsh words to say during the campaign against extremism; but not only can we speak out about it, we can do something about it too."
"You have among your ranks the Socialist Party that recently won the elections in Slovakia, which has chosen a partner whose main political message amounts to making attacks on minorities, such as Hungarians, Gypsies and gays."
"This should sound alarm bells throughout the whole of Europe."
"It also draws attention to how poor the European Union is at defending minorities across the whole of Europe."
"This is why progress must be made in the planned European Human Rights Agency's activities during the Finnish Presidency."
"Finland, which pursues an exemplary minorities policy, must show us the way on this matter."
"During the Finnish Presidency, 23rd October marks the 50th anniversary of the revolution, which involved a kindred people, the Hungarians."
"Nowadays we often talk about the European Union being in crisis."
"Let us help to renew the EU by drawing encouragement and strength from one of the 20th century's most significant struggles for freedom in resolving the problems we face today."
"I wish the Presidency every success!"
"Mr President, Mr Vanhanen, Mr Barroso, I share the Finnish Presidency’s view of globalisation as a challenge."
"I also think it good that the Presidency has struck a balance between, on the one hand, flexibility and, on the other, social protection or security in the midst of change."
"I look forward to a solution being found to the Services Directive during the Finnish Presidency."
"This will be based on Parliament’s proposals, which have specifically achieved this balance between, on the one hand, openness and flexibility and, on the other, security in the labour market and protection for public services."
"There is an issue that I think the Finnish Presidency should get to grips with."
"Parliament’s proposal and the proposal by the Commission and the Council make no mention of agencies that supply temporary workers."
"At the same time, such agencies are growing in importance all around Europe."
"There is a proposal from the Commission concerning agencies that supply temporary workers."
"We have responded to it, but it has been blocked by the Council."
"It is now time for the proposal to be unblocked so that we might obtain an agreement and a framework concerning these agencies."
"This is an area in which the Finnish Presidency can act."
"I welcome the fact that you are taking the initiative concerning the Working Time Directive."
"This is also about achieving a balance between health and safety – no unduly long working hours – and, at the same time, flexibility."
"We in Parliament are convinced that, in order to achieve flexibility, no opt-out is needed."
"There are other instruments for promoting flexibility."
"I look forward to solutions in these areas and also share Mr Rasmussen’s view that solutions must be sought in cooperation with both sides of industry."
"Mr President, Mr Vanhanen, ladies and gentlemen, ."
"We speak Latin in Europe."
"As a citizen of Rome and as a citizen of Europe, I am grateful to Finland for having taken the decision to inaugurate this half year's presidency of the Union in Latin, as well."
"However, mine is more than just a formal expression of gratitude."
"The decision has a profound meaning: Roman civilisation, the heir to Greek civilisation, represented Europe’s first, crucial unifying element."
"The Latin language, the major infrastructure, the law, the huge internal market and, lastly, the were the foundations into which Christianity, as the true bridge between Western and Eastern Europe, dug its roots."
"An important European archaeologist and writer, Valerio Massimo Manfredi, wrote: ‘Rome was above all a great ideal.’"
"Paraphrasing those words, we could say: ‘Europe is above all a great ideal.’"
"We cannot give up on making this great ideal a reality, giving Europe basic legislation that will enable it to provide 450 million citizens with answers to the problems that concern them most: immigration, security, competitiveness with emerging countries, the energy issue, the definition of borders and job creation."
"The President will have our support."
"Finland has the important task of continuing the work done by Austria and paving the way for the next half year under the German Presidency, which will be key to finally establishing the Constitutional Treaty that Europe needs in order to be closer to its citizens."
"In Rome, we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Treaties."
"Let us see to it that, like those who, in ancient times, took pride and felt secure in the guarantees they obtained from the institutions when becoming Roman citizens, any future European citizen, from whichever part of the world he or she comes, will also feel secure and take pride in living in an area in which human rights, peace, security and freedom are guaranteed and protected."
"Only then will we have met our challenge, and will the great ideal have become a reality."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, it is with great pleasure that I accept the aims that the Finnish Presidency has set itself for the coming six months."
"Translating words into action on the matter of the Constitution and further engagement in the matter of EU enlargement are key issues at a time when the EU is in the throes of an identity and leadership crisis."
"For that reason it is particularly important to strengthen collaboration on a common Eastern policy and a common energy policy."
"The issue of diversifying energy sources and supply lines is extremely important for the security of Europe’s energy supplies."
"The European Union must establish a joint and uniform standpoint on the issue of oil and gas supplies."
"It should not be assumed that building a single line from a single supplier means real diversification."
"Investment in renewable sources of energy and saving energy are necessary, but they will not be sufficient to cover growing demand."
"Europe must become politically and financially involved in projects looking for new sources of energy and conduct a joint policy, based on solidarity, towards suppliers."
"I also attach a great deal of importance to Finland’s role in drawing up a common Eastern policy."
"Here connections with Russia should be instrumental in finding a golden mean for the EU’s Russia policy."
"I also look forward to the improvement and development of cooperation with Ukraine, as political support for Kiev will help to consolidate Ukraine’s pro-European policy."
"It will also be important to raise the issue of Belarus at international forums and in discussions with Russia."
"Mr President, among many other things Finland is famous for its Finnish sauna. I hope that the Finnish Presidency will bring us, in the end, the same feeling of freshness and relaxation as one gets after spending an hour or two in a Finnish sauna."
"Mr President, the Finnish Presidency will not just be a transitional presidency, but a key presidency from the viewpoint of the EU’s most important strategy, the growth and jobs strategy."
"This will decide the future of Europe, but you have to start somewhere."
"In the revised Lisbon strategy, we decided that we need to start from research, innovation and technological progress."
"We will be unable to do this, Prime Minister Vanhanen, without launching the 7th Framework Programme on time."
"A common position of the European Council is needed as early as July to allow Parliament to start work on the second reading in September."
"I appeal to Prime Minister Vanhanen to ensure that this is done."
"There has to be constant collaboration between the Council, the Commission and Parliament if we are to finish the job in November at the latest."
"However, what is important as well as the 7th Framework Programme is funding for research and innovation from national budgets."
"I wholly support Prime Minister Vanhanen’s statement on this."
"Our greatest weakness as Europeans is lack of innovation."
"I believe that the European Institute of Technology will be able to help us here."
"We already have an excellent European education system, and we do not need to reproduce it."
"We have reasonable research, but we lack innovation and the latest technologies which are decisive to growth and employment and which are important for our strategy."
"A decision on the EIT is an important task for the Finnish Presidency."
"The triangle of knowledge – education, research and innovation – is Finland’s strongest card."
"The decisions on these matters have therefore come at the right time."
"We wish Prime Minister Vanhanen success."
"Mr President, I am much obliged to Mr Vanhanen, who made it clear in his speech that he wishes to win over the public, to further the development of Europe and to move over to specific action."
"I congratulate him on this motto – it is a motto for the future, and has my full support."
"We want specific projects, and the Services Directive is one such project."
"Mr Vanhanen has expressed the desire to conclude the Services Directive at second reading in autumn."
"I am confident that we can succeed in this, as the decision of the Council of Ministers to incorporate and further develop Parliament’s fundamental demands provides the basis for doing so."
"I am confident that it will prove possible to reach a compromise on the Services Directive under the Finnish Presidency."
"I should very much like to see this."
"This is an expression of the common will to make a commitment to the community of values for the public."
"After all, that is what we want to achieve – and Mr Vanhanen expressed this very clearly in his speech: we want to develop the community of values, determine Europe’s future and ensure not only that we have a free internal market, including for services, but also that there is respect for citizens’ rights, labour law, social legislation, consumer protection and patient protection."
"That is what we want to achieve, and it is also the way to really ensure that citizens say ‘yes’ to Europe in future."
"That is the best thing we could achieve."
"The matter of prime importance is the Constitution for Europe, and that is the best present that Mr Vanhanen could give himself on the 100th anniversary of the right to vote in Finland."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Finland is the first Council Presidency since the enlargement of the European Union on 1 May 2004 to hail from the shores of the Baltic Sea, which the enlargement by eight countries has of course made a ."
"The Finnish Presidency is therefore in a position to develop strategic dimensions that are also connected with the Northern Dimension, as there is also a non-Member State bordering on the Baltic Sea, namely Russia."
"Finland’s experience makes it particularly well placed to develop relations in this region that could be extremely constructive, and that also include issues such as security of energy supply."
"We are pinning our hopes on Finland in this matter."
"My second point is that the Finnish Presidency, in cooperation with the Commission, must make at least the first attempts to achieve a new balance between enlargement and the European Union’s capacity to cope with this."
"We must hold out the prospect of EU membership to many countries, but this cannot always mean full membership."
"We must find other ways – and, in the Barroso paper, both the European Council and the Commission declared their intention to take essential initiatives in this matter."
"We shall wait until December and see how far we get with this discussion."
"My third point is that history has shown that the EU is only strong where we have Community Europe, as only there is it capable of action, and only there does it show continuity."
"That is why an enlarged EU renders it particularly necessary to take the approach of a constitutional treaty."
"I am obliged to the President-in-Office of the Council for committing himself to the ratification of this Constitutional Treaty."
"This matches the position of the subsequent German Presidency, which means that there should be constructive cooperation on drawing up the declaration to be made by Germany at the end of its Presidency."
"I think I can even say that this should be the position of all the Community institutions, in order to enable the Constitutional Treaty – with regard to which we need to be much more imaginative – to enter into force in 2009. Cherry-picking will be of no help to us here, as it would destroy the approach we have to take of explaining to the public in persuasive terms why we need a constitutional treaty – which gives it more rights and brings greater transparency."
"We need not only a Europe that works, but also a Europe of democracy and transparency."
"That is why this Constitutional Treaty is so important."
"Mr President, Mr Vanhanen, ladies and gentlemen, you, Mr Vanhanen, like the President of the Barroso Commission, often referred in your speech to the need to give a boost to the Europe of results in order to regain the citizens' trust, naturally without pitting this Europe against the Europe of values and of the Constitution."
"When it comes to dividing up the work that exists in this Parliament, I, as rapporteur for REACH, belong to the category of sherpas, of those who work to deliver results, like my colleague, Mrs Gebhardt."
"For this reason, I very much welcomed the fact that you have included among the priorities of your Presidency the conclusion of the legislative process on REACH and that you have done so by including it in the ‘competitiveness’ chapter."
"The main purpose of REACH is, of course, to protect human health and the environment, but it is also a powerful incentive for innovation."
"From this perspective, both the Council and Parliament have done an excellent job over the years of work that we have behind us, because they have reconciled their positions to a great extent and have made this instrument much more usable, and have done so, too, in an effort to boost innovation."
"I am sure that, under your Presidency, an agreement at second reading will be possible."
"Both legislators will nevertheless have to make progress."
"A small amount of progress, since there has already been a great deal of convergence, but progress will still always have to be made."
"I am saying this to you because there will be those who advise you to stand firm and make no concessions."
"I, on the other hand, am willing to make progress and I am sure that you will be too."
"Mr President, Mr Vanhanen, Mr Barroso, as a representative of Sweden, which is not only a neighbouring country but also a sister country, I should like to say that the prospect of the Finnish Presidency fills me with pride and high hopes."
"We have, to the very highest degree, not only an overlapping history and geography but also a shared experience of the present."
"We became members of the European Union at the same time and are still counted as being among the new Member States, with all the freshness of approach that that can bring with it."
"We have seen how enlargement of the European Union in recent years has totally changed our world thanks to European cooperation, in the context of which the Baltic Sea is now eminently a sea that links countries together."
"We have an internationalised economy, which is manifestly a precondition for prosperity and employment rather than a threat to our prosperity."
"We have an economy whose individual strands are becoming ever more closely interwoven."
"We are also cooperating on establishing a common battle group, which is the only thing that unites small countries."
"Finland is also an example for those of us who expect a lot from your Presidency."
"I am thinking of Finnish energy policy, in which you can combine increased competitiveness and reduced dependency on surrounding countries with greater attention to the environment and to the Kyoto objectives."
"I am thinking of Finland’s unique ability to handle relations with Russia, giving this Presidency an opportunity to lay the basis for a sound policy on Russia for the whole of the European Union."
"I am thinking of our experiences of enlargement, which oblige Finland resolutely and single-mindedly to take the issue of continued enlargement forward, with not only clear demands being made but also a clear objective pursued, partly with a view to its being possible for Turkey to become a member of the EU."
"With characteristic openness and single-mindedness, Finland should also, of course, ensure that it turns the European Union into a form of cooperation that is open, transparent and easily accessible to its citizens."
"I wish you good luck."
"High demands are being made because a clear example has been set."
"Mr President, many in this House are of the opinion that the Union’s credibility in the eyes of the people needs improving."
"For that reason, Finland, during its Presidency, wants to see confidence-inspiring action which has importance for people’s everyday lives."
"The people have a right to expect cross-border cooperation to be implemented in all aspects of life, including, for example, the fight against crime, and not just the internal market."
"Criminals move freely from one country to another and network across national borders."
"On the other hand, the police authorities in the Member States fail to maintain contact with each other and lack mutual trust."
"The criminals have too much of a head start."
"That is why Finland needs the support of the other Member States and this Parliament for its work when the decision-making process in justice and home affairs is being improved."
"Mr President, I agree, Prime Minister, with the Europe of results."
"For many people war was a very long time ago and they take peace for granted."
"The European Union must therefore win the citizens’ confidence by achieving tangible results with regard to today’s problems."
"I would therefore like your Presidency to achieve greater successes, better results."
"The European Union must serve to tackle trans-national threats, such as terrorism and organised crime, and to calm the citizens' fears about globalisation."
"It must also help to properly manage migratory flows, including effectively fighting illegal immigration."
"This is a dramatic and topical issue in my country – you have mentioned the case of the Canary Islands – and in other countries of Southern Europe."
"It leads to great suffering and the loss of human lives."
"I therefore hope that during this six-month period this problem will be treated as a priority, and not just Russia and energy."
"It seems to me very appropriate that Finland should now be taking over the Presidency and that it should make progress on a European immigration policy."
"The Tampere European Council represented an historic milestone in the construction of the area of freedom, security and justice."
"Mr President, the conclusions of the Seville and Thessaloniki European Councils stated that the issue of migratory flows should start to occupy a prominent place in the European Union’s relations with third countries."
"This seems to me to be a fundamental element in the approach we should take."
"The Union must demand that countries of origin and transit cooperate closely in the fight against the drama of illegal immigration and in the ordered management of these flows."
"It must ask them for – and help them to achieve - better border controls, more effective combating of mafias and readmission agreements."
"There are things to do in our countries as well, including putting an end to unilateral legalisation measures and improving the material and human resources at our external borders."
"Funds are also needed and I regret that of every one hundred euros budgeted for in the financial perspective just fifty cents are allocated to immigration issues."
"Finally, I shall briefly mention another of your Presidency’s priorities: enlargement."
"This six-month period will be the final stage in Romania and Bulgaria's efforts to join the Union on 1 January 2007."
"This is the common objective that we all share and I trust that the report that the Commission will present at the beginning of the autumn will confirm that date."
"Mr President, Prime Minister, Mr President of the Commission, I wish to make three points."
"Firstly, I will speak about the Presidency."
"The Presidency needs three things to succeed."
"First it must be well prepared."
"The Finns have once again prepared themselves admirably."
"Secondly, it must be objective."
"The Finnish Presidency will once again be an excellent, objective one."
"We also need a little luck with the agenda and I think we have some."
"The other point relates to transparency."
"I would like to make a concrete proposal for the Lahti Summit."
"I suggest that the first three speeches, yours and those of the President of the Commission and the President of the European Parliament, are shown on camera to us all openly."
"I will make the third and final point in English in order to get it across: it has to do with competitiveness and football."
"There is an interesting correlation."
"In the World Cup the more competitive you are in football, perhaps you are slightly less competitive in the economy; the more competitive you are in the economy, the less competitive you are in football."
"My proposal to Prime Minister Vanhanen for Euro 2008 is: please keep the Finnish economy competitive and push our team through to Euro 2008 as well."
"Those two things can go hand in hand."
"Good luck to the Presidency."
"."
"Mr President, I kept diplomatically quiet on the subject of football."
"Our task, however, that of the Council, Parliament and the Commission, is to ensure that the world’s four – or preferably 25 – best are European: that is our common responsibility."
"I tend to agree with many of your assessments and opinions regarding my speech and my style of presentation."
"I am perhaps slightly civil servant-like and it may well be that I tend to make lists, but I do not intend to change my style."
"I know that I will not get away with rhetoric with hardly any of you and I am not even going to try."
"Nevertheless, this debate has showed that there are such passionate views on many of these European issues that perhaps it is going to take a cool head to reconcile them all."
"This might be a better solution than strident rhetoric."
"In this I have received very much good advice and guidance."
"I cannot now comment on all your speeches."
"I would like to start, however, with Mr Titley’s speech, as he is a sort of godfather to us."
"Some time ago, he drafted a report on the Finnish Presidency and was the first Member of the European Parliament whose acquaintance I briefly made when we were on the same committee jointly set up by the Finnish and the European Parliament."
"He gave me some good advice: action, action, and action."
"That will also hopefully describe the Finnish Presidency."
"Mr Poettering made the apt comment that the presidencies form a six-month chain."
"It is therefore also natural that the same issues that you have heard many times will appear on the Finnish Presidency’s agenda."
"If I remember, one of you grumbled about this."
"This chain is necessary."
"You sit in the European Parliament for five years."
"The Commission sits for five years."
"There is a natural long-term aspect to all this among you."
"For the Council, the long-term aspect has to be established through mutual cooperation between the presidencies, because we need continuity."
"We have to devote our energies to that."
"We need the involvement of everyone in next spring’s 50-year anniversary festivities and declaration, and I have welcomed those ideas that have been put forward here in this part-session."
"I agree with Mr Schulz’s powerfully expressed view that the Union needs those tools which we can use to respond to all the challenges that are important to us."
"To his comments on the need for enlargement and a new treaty I reply that there is not the slightest conflict of opinion between Commission President Barroso and myself."
"As it is, we have the mechanisms for enlargement, but everyone knows that common sense says that we also need a new treaty, at least in the longer term."
"Thank you to Mr Schulz and Mr Watson for your support and for the firm but healthy pressure you exerted in order that we should achieve progress in decision-making under the third pillar."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit made the criticism that I did not raise the issue of legal immigration."
"It occupies a position of importance in our programme and I mentioned it."
"I mentioned it in connection with factors relating to Europe’s success."
"We also need legal immigration for Europe to succeed."
"It is one path towards European success in global competition in the future."
"Mr Seppänen criticised Finland’s aim to ratify the Constitution, saying that we do not respect the results of the French and Dutch referendums."
"We certainly do, but we also respect Finland’s right to adopt a position itself on the negotiated Treaty, that broad-based compromise which was at one time reached."
"We also have the right to express our views on it and we do so with reference to our own constitution and the consideration of matters and ratification procedures which it establishes."
"Mr Crowley made special mention of new sources of energy, and I fully agree with what he said in his speech."
"Mr Farage said that a common asylum policy in Europe is laughable."
"It is not."
"On the contrary, we need a common asylum policy."
"That is exactly what Europe needs, as with a lot of other things which are vitally necessary in internal and legal affairs."
"It is with regard to these very issues that we need an area of freedom and justice."
"We need common standards and common regulations, and we need common action very much along the same lines."
"We need both cooperation between our countries and a clear mandate for the European Union."
"Mr Paasilinna raised the sensitive question as to whether energy policy is for some in the world a weapon."
"That question is raised very frequently."
"Our reply is that energy policy should not be used as a weapon in global policy."
"On the contrary, the EU line should be that energy policy is a normal part of business."
"It must be business-based, and should clearly work both ways and give the same rights to all concerned parties."
"It must be based on long-term, reliable agreements and market prices."
"This way, when we act we can benefit from one another."
"The energy policy between the EU and Russia in particular is part of a strategic partnership."
"Russia needs European technology and the money that we spend as well, and we need Russian energy."
"This partnership can serve to improve both the EU’s and Russia’s success globally."
"Mrs Jäätteenmäki made special mention of transparency and I fully agree with what she said when she remarked that what was most important was public access to documents."
"We are expecting the Commission to produce a document to debate on the review of a Community Regulation on transparency, and, during our Presidency, we will submit it as a topic of discussion in the Council."
"Furthermore, everything that was said on the issue of climate change in the debate, including what Mrs Hassi said, will be taken into consideration."
"Mr Kirkhope stressed the importance of assessing the effects of legislation."
"This is also a fundamental part of this policy of better regulation."
"This will be the responsibility of the Commission, the Council and Parliament: all those involved in legislative work."
"We must consider our legislative work a basis for impact assessments."
"As I said in my speech, they relate to both the effects on our competitiveness and the environment and the effects on social welfare."
"This needs to be part of the normal legislative process."
"Mr Swoboda’s speech on the issue of Turkey was a wise one."
"I fully support what Commission President Barroso drew attention to regarding Turkish negotiations in his speech."
"Mr Pflüger described Finland as neutral."
"I must correct him on that: Finland is a member of the EU."
"We were at one time a politically neutral country, during the time of the Iron Curtain."
"Now we are a member of the Union, part of this community of values, which has a common policy and, moreover, a common foreign policy."
"He criticised the fact that we are leading the Union into military ventures and mentioned, by way of example, the operation we have begun in the Democratic Republic of the Congo."
"That is all about ensuring that there are democratic elections."
"That is just the sort of task that the Union should be engaged in."
"It gives firm support to those basic values which our existence relies on."
"Mr Rasmussen mentioned the extraordinary social summit which we are holding and the fact that in choosing between flexibility and security the people need to feel that they have security."
"This will be an exacting task when we are introducing reforms."
"In responding to the challenge of globalisation we need to be able to make reforms in such a way that we also lead the world in terms of the economy and employment, but that has to happen in such a way that the people too can have confidence in it."
"In this respect, the social partners have an especially important role to play."
"At that summit we mean to speak a little about the model of consensus which Finland, for its own part, has used with some success to achieve certain kinds of results."
"Finally in this regard, I will address Mrs Estrela’s question on equality."
"The introduction of a regulation on the founding of a Gender Equality Institute is now being considered."
"Hopefully we will achieve a result there."
"Similarly, during our Presidency we will focus attention on such issues as the trafficking of, and violence against, women."
"Mr Buzek mentioned what in fact is the most important of the Finnish Presidency’s priorities: innovation policy."
"The Seventh Framework Programme is an important component of that."
"The EIT is an important initiative and a suitable structure needs to be found for it."
"In general, however, during this six-month term you will be hearing the phrase innovation policy over and over again."
"That is the message we want to drum home in the Union."
"Moreover, if there is something I hope the Finnish Presidency will be remembered for, it will be that we never stopped talking about innovation policy and how important it is."
"In fact, Mr Buzek gave a very graphic description of the sort of elements innovation policy should embrace."
"Then, regarding Mr Brok’s speech on the importance of the Baltic region, I have to remind you that it is now a common sea."
"I was happy to note what you had to say, and we intend to keep the issue of the Baltic a current one."
"The progress we are making on the Northern Dimension is enough to provide us with the tools we need to improve the situation regarding the Baltic too."
"To Mr Hökmark of Sweden I can only say that for 700 years we were the same country as Sweden, and in a few years’ time we will be celebrating the fact that we went our separate ways."
"Now for the last 11 years, on the other hand, we have been part of the same community within the framework of the Union and we enjoy a very close partnership."
"I would like to end with a comment on Mr Millán Mon’s speeches on the situation in the Canary Islands."
"Hopefully there is something symbolic about the fact that Finland, the northernmost country in the Union, has wanted even to send a border patrol and a surveillance aircraft to the Canary islands to help and demonstrate solidarity, and show that the problems that we have in different parts of Europe, even with regard to illegal immigration, are shared by all of us."
"We need to show solidarity within the Union."
"These are issues which we all have in common."
"I would also like the Finnish Presidency to act in such a spirit in the Union over the next six months."
"Thank you, Mr President, for the opportunity to speak here in Parliament, and I hope that we will enjoy the most fruitful cooperation with Parliament, its committees and its political groups over the next six months."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that all the important points have already been made, but I hope that you will just allow me to stress one or two points, returning in particular to questions that were raised during the debate."
"First of all, we are very much in favour of the approach referred to as the 'Europe of results', but let me make it clear that the Europe of results is not an alternative to the Europe of values, but, on the contrary, the means of strengthening adhesion to those values."
"It is a question of taking two paths at the same time, each of which can strengthen the other."
"Our vision of a Europe supporting real projects is very much built on the idea that we need to strengthen the conditions needed to create a Europe with a dimension of social cohesion and justice, a Europe with a political vision, a Europe that is willing to use its weight, to exert its influence and to promote its values throughout the world."
"That is why we think it is important to follow these two paths at the same time."
"To respond to the question I was asked regarding the link between enlargement and constitutional reform, I have said many times that Nice is not enough."
"In an enlarged Europe – and we are already an enlarged Europe – we need to reform the institutions to make them more effective and more democratic, and to improve the coherency of Europe's actions in the world."
"In addition, the Constitutional Treaty negotiated between the Member States was already designed for the Europe of 25, which gives added strength to the idea that a Europe of 27 or more Member States will need institutional reform."
"That, indeed, is the Commission's position."
"With regard to the specific priorities of this Presidency, I would like to stress something that emerged very clearly from the debate: the importance attached to innovation."
"We think that the Lahti Summit could be a great moment for Europe if the Heads of State or Government can actually now agree to produce concrete results as part of the innovation agenda."
"As several of you emphasised here today, Europe has many excellent universities and research institutions, but it lacks the capacity to translate all this activity into more concrete results for the economy and for the competitiveness of our continent."
"We therefore need to improve the connection between knowledge, science and research, on the one hand, and concrete results, on the other, and innovation is the key to that."
"Finland can use its considerable experience and its specific authority to help us to produce concrete results."
"Another field in which our actions are going to be judged over the next six months is that of freedom, security and justice."
"This debate has made it clear that there is broad support for the idea that we must do more at Community level, too."
"There is, of course, an intergovernmental dimension – we could do more in terms of cooperation between the governments – but we also need a Community dimension in certain domains, such as the management of both legal and illegal immigration."
"The problems currently being experienced by some of our Member States, such as Spain, are not just their problem, but are shared by the whole of Europe."
"It is clear, in these circumstances, that we cannot separate legal and illegal immigration, and that we need a European approach in this area."
"I think that, on this matter, all of us – the Finnish Presidency, the Member States and us – are going to be judged at the end of these six months on our willingness to produce, on the basis of the existing treaties, better results in terms of security and justice, including, of course, when it comes to immigration."
"Another issue that Parliament regards as extremely important, and that is also a priority for the Finnish Presidency, is energy, and, in this field, we must make ourselves quite clear, particularly with regard to relations with Russia."
"First of all, we are in favour of a constructive partnership with Russia with regard to energy, but, as was clear from the strategic paper prepared by the Commission, we do not simply propose to develop good relations with Russia, but also to diversify."
"The solution to Europe's energy problems is diversification: diversification of the country of origin, the country of supply and the country of transit, and also diversification of our sources of energy, in particular by increasing investment in renewable energy."
"So, the solution for energy is to diversify, and not to lock ourselves into a relationship with a single partner, however important that partner may be."
"Secondly, and still with regard to relations with Russia, let us be quite clear: in the negotiation mandate that we presented to the Council regarding our relations with that country, the first point on the list is not energy, or even trade – no, the first point relates to human rights, respect for democracy and respect for the rule of law."
"That is the precondition for developing a special partnership with a country with which we do, of course, want to build a relationship, a country that also wants to build a relationship with us."
"If I may, I would like to make one final point regarding the continuity on which Mr Vanhanen spoke so eloquently."
"It is true that we, the European Parliament and the Commission, have a five-year mandate, and that the various Presidencies each have a specific purpose, but there is sometimes a problem of continuity over time, as was also identified during the negotiations regarding the constitutional treaty."
"On this point, I think we are starting to make progress, as the Austrian Presidency showed."
"The Presidencies are all connected, and it is a very positive sign that the constitutional issue of the granting of a mandate has been clearly raised."
"On this subject, I support the pragmatic approach determined by results, and also the constructive approach chosen by the Finnish Presidency."
"Ladies and gentlemen, when we were talking about a Europe of results, we did not know that the football was so soon going to show Europe's ability to be the best in terms of results."
"Some of you gave in to the temptation to use the football World Cup to show that we can, in this field too, be proud of our results, but I think, as you have stressed, that, when it comes to the economy, competitiveness, our competition-based model and our values, we can and must produce more results."
"I am sure that we will be able to do so during the Finnish Presidency."
"The debate is closed."
"During its period the Austrian Presidency has faced some real challenges, now Helsinki has to face some of these aspects too."
"One which is deservedly prominent among them is the future of the Constitutional Treaty, which requires more consultation and a higher profile."
"I would like to welcome the initiative from Finland, which envisages better legislation, in addition to compliance with the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity."
"We should make new decisions, as well as update the old ones, taking into consideration economic, environmental, but mainly social aspects."
"I agree with President Barroso when he says that the sense of balance the Finns have can bring some harmony to the EU's stormy political climate by guaranteeing an opportunity to promote the innovative policies of the European Union."
"Increasing researcher and student mobility, along with consolidating European know-how are basic elements in making this progress."
"It is already extremely important for Europe's citizens to be familiar with the EU's institutional system, how it operates, and with the decisions that have an impact on their lives."
"Therefore, I greatly applaud the Finnish Presidency's ambition to bring about an EU which supports cooperation within its institutions and communicates more effectively with its citizens."
"I also agree with regulating national veto rights in order to make implementation more effective."
"I support Helsinki's policy on human rights, which highlights the need to adopt a united approach to defending human and basic civil liberties."
"I feel it is important to adopt a common approach to preventing illegal immigration, especially the trafficking in human beings and worker exploitation."
"The European Union can only successfully respond to the growing challenges of globalisation by consolidating Europe's democracies and producing a well-structured social policy."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, the next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Palestine."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we all very well know, there have been very dramatic developments in the situation in the Palestinian territories in the last week."
"The capture of an Israeli soldier and the ensuing Israeli operation has been followed keenly by us all."
"We have also been concerned about the continuing firing of Kassam rockets at Israel from Gaza."
"As the situation in the region is still very serious, I would like, in this first speech of mine in the European Parliament, to focus on expressing the views of the European Union on the prevailing crisis."
"Right at the start I want to say that yesterday in Helsinki the Finnish Foreign Affairs Minister, Erkki Tuomioja, discussed the situation in the region with Israeli Foreign Affairs Minister Livni."
"Mr Tuomioja was also in telephone contact with Palestinian President Abbas and the Egyptian Foreign Affairs Minister Aboul Gheit."
"The EU Special Representative, Marc Otte, has also been in the region this week and he has been in contact with various parties."
"It is important that the Palestinians release the captured Israeli soldier immediately."
"The Palestinian administration must also bring to an end the continued onslaught of Kassam rockets on Israel from Gaza."
"Israel, for its part, must cease its military operation."
"The Union’s firm line on this is that any action that goes against international law must be stopped."
"We should also point out that we cannot accept disproportionate action or action that punishes the entire population."
"We in the Union are especially concerned about the suffering of civilians."
"It is important to say that it is the duty of both parties to protect civilians."
"We also know that the humanitarian situation in the region was already problematic earlier on, and that will suffer even more now with the destruction of the infrastructure, such as the power station in Gaza."
"This did not just result in problems of the supply of electric power but also water supply and sewerage."
"Hospitals, too, for example, are suffering the consequences of the bombing of the power station."
"We also condemn Israel’s attacks on the Palestinian administration’s infrastructure."
"In this connection it has to be made clear that the European Union will not automatically act as paymaster when the reconstruction starts."
"Neither can we accept that Israel has detained numerous Palestinian ministers and members of parliament."
"They must be released, or at least guaranteed a fair trial."
"What the Quartet formerly set out as its demands with regard to the Hamas-led Palestinian Government still holds good."
"The Palestinian Government must recognise the following principles: non-violence, the recognition of Israel’s right to exist, and compliance with existing agreements and obligations."
"In this connection I would like to refer to the understanding reached between Hamas and Fatah based on the ‘Prisoners’ Document’."
"In a situation in which bad relations between Fatah and Hamas seemed to be reaching an acute stage, one that threatened peace, reaching an understanding in this way was a step in the right direction, although it does not as yet mean that the EU’s conditions and those of the Quartet are adequately met."
"How are we to come through the present crisis?"
"The European Union emphasises that the crisis can only be resolved through discussions."
"Regarding the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, it was a promising move that Prime Minister Olmert and Palestinian President Abbas met about two weeks ago."
"It was also promising that they decided to meet again soon."
"A speedy return to this path of maintaining contact and negotiations is very important."
"It is only the path of negotiation that can lead to a permanent and lasting peace."
"Although the chances of initiating a peace process once again seem very slight in the prevailing circumstances, the idea of a two-state model must be kept alive."
"Weapons and unilateral action will not bring peace."
"The European Union and Finland, as the country to hold the Presidency, are committed to helping both sides to reach a peace settlement."
"."
"Mr President, we are all extremely concerned by the events unfolding in the Palestinian territories."
"These are very disturbing times: the insecurity, the inter-factional violence, the Qassam rockets, the shellings."
"The attack by militant Palestinian factions in Karem Shalom and the abduction of the Israeli soldier, followed by the Israeli military incursion into Gaza, signal a very worrying escalation."
"In its statement last week, the European Union strongly condemned these acts, and we have just heard what the President-in-Office of the Council has said."
"Last week I called on both sides to take a step back, to exercise restraint. I now repeat that call."
"All sides need to consider their responsibility extremely carefully."
"All parties must abstain from any actions that are in violation of international law and we must insist that the Palestinian leadership do all in its power to end violence and terrorist activities."
"The European Union has called for the immediate and unconditional release of Corporal Gilad Shalit."
"This kind of act can only make things worse for the Palestinian people, as we are seeing."
"But we must also look to the Israelis to act with prudence."
"We understand their outrage, but diplomacy offers the best chance to address the immediate priority, not the destruction of essential infrastructure, the detention of members of the Palestinian Legislative Council or the shelling of the Prime Minister’s office."
"Recent events have considerably worsened the situation of the Palestinian population, and that is, I must say, a source of both sorrow and deep frustration for us."
"The damage to Gaza’s only power station has deprived hundreds of thousands of Palestinians of electricity and could have serious humanitarian consequences."
"Everything must be done to prevent the humanitarian situation from deteriorating further."
"Israel has to understand its responsibilities for the well-being of the Palestinian population and an immediate step has to be the restoration of electricity to the Palestinian territories."
"Both sides need to step back from the brink before this becomes a crisis that neither can control."
"We must do all we can to avoid an unacceptable economic and humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territories."
"Even before the latest events, we were looking at a 30% fall in income, unemployment at 40% and poverty levels of 67%."
"But responsible politicians cannot give in to frustration."
"I visited Israel and the Palestinian territories only two weeks ago."
"The principal aim of my visit then was to bring Israel and President Abbas up to speed with the European Council and the Quartet decisions on a temporary international mechanism."
"The mechanism is designed to provide immediate relief to the Palestinian people and to ensure that basic services are provided."
"Discussions were positive, but there is no doubt that events in Gaza and the West Bank have greatly complicated this effort."
"Now, more than ever, there is a need to press ahead with the mechanism to help meet at least the basic needs of ordinary Palestinians."
"A number of donors have indicated their willingness to make funds available through the mechanism."
"But the needs will be great and funds are limited."
"The Commission has therefore sought the budgetary authority’s approval to transfer funds from the emergency reserve."
"I am very grateful for the support of the European Parliament in this difficult endeavour and I am especially grateful for the many very valuable exchanges of views I was able to have with the committee chairmen and leaders in my discussions with the Committee on Foreign Affairs, at the forefront in setting up this mechanism."
"It is our collective responsibility as Europeans to help the Palestinians and to give peace a chance."
"I look forward to your continued support on that."
"Let us be clear."
"The mechanism cannot be a panacea for all the difficulties faced in the Palestinian territories."
"Donors cannot be a substitute for the responsibilities of the Palestinian Government, which must take real steps to comply with the Quartet’s principles and end the violence that threatens the lives of Israelis and Palestinians alike."
"Nor can donors be a substitute for the responsibilities of Israel under international law, for freeing up movement and access, for releasing Palestinian customs and tax revenues, or for the recent damage caused to key civil infrastructure."
"The events of recent days have undermined a fragile process that has just begun with the meeting of President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert in Amman."
"As my colleague has said, these events come at a time when progress was being made on a national consensus agreement between Hamas and Fatah, based on the prisoners’ initiative."
"It remains to be seen whether this tentative agreement for a government of national unity will produce a leadership better able to meet its responsibilities."
"I have commended President Abbas for taking this initiative, but at the same time I have been clear that it is not an end in itself, but only the start of a process."
"The Palestinian Government must ultimately commit itself to renouncing violence, to recognising Israel and to respecting previous agreements as set out by the Quartet."
"We are faced with a very grave crisis situation in the Middle East."
"We have to work together to de-escalate the tension and to give diplomacy a chance."
"Because in all the chaos and confusion of the current situation, one thing is clear: a negotiated two-state solution is the only way to guarantee the security that ordinary people – Israelis and Palestinians as well as others – desire."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, this is one of the debates that leaves one increasingly dumbstruck."
"We have had to seek new ways."
"The Commission is producing a wealth of ideas as to how to help the Palestinian people despite the fact that the new Palestinian Government fails to recognise Israel’s right to exist and has not renounced violence – in this the Commission has our full support."
"However, the other party must also make a move."
"It goes without saying that there are things, such as the Kassam rockets, that are unacceptable to Israel, but the question is whether it really had to react like that at a time when President Abbas had been on the way to making some progress with Hamas."
"This would at least have been worth putting to the credibility test."
"On the other hand, however, there have been occurrences that further detract from the credibility of President Abbas, and so it is increasingly difficult for us to find points of contact."
"This whole situation is a vicious circle."
"It is hard to say who was originally right or wrong, because the circle keeps turning."
"We must make the position of the EU and of the Quartet crystal clear."
"Our conditions must be Israel’s right to exist as a state, and a viable Palestinian state."
"Both parties in the region must be aware that they are pursuing a policy that is not only causing their peoples serious harm, but increasingly also causing problems for the whole international community and endangering peace in general – as this is not just a localised conflict."
"Decisions are urgently needed in this matter."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council to ensure that the Quartet makes a joint appearance on site and explains the dangers, rather than its members travelling there separately and thus achieving nothing."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a real humanitarian disaster has been taking place in Gaza over the last few hours, involving more than one million civilians."
"UN, UNICEF and WFP reports talk of a desperate situation."
"Gaza has become a prison in which an entire population is being collectively punished."
"The international community had finally come to an agreement to ensure that the Palestinians received the aid they needed to survive via the European Union, but all of that is now pointless since Gaza is practically isolated and nothing is getting through to an exhausted and humiliated population."
"The Palestinian issue cannot, however, become a humanitarian issue, because it remains a major political issue."
"The indiscriminate decapitation of Hamas was, for its part, an act of madness, firstly because the members of parliament and the ministers now legitimately represent the majority of the Palestinian population, but mainly because Prime Minister Haniyeh had given the go-ahead to the so-called ‘prisoners’ document’ and had actually dissociated himself from the most intransigent of the positions adopted by the Hamas representatives in Syria, avoiding the referendum and paving the way for a coalition government in Palestine."
"With these actions, the Israeli authorities are in real danger of once again encouraging the most extreme and violent fringes of Palestinian society."
"Corporal Gilad Shalit must be released, just as an entire population must be released from the grip of an army that is infringing every aspect of the law."
"In the past, the European Parliament has pressed for aid to be allowed to get through to the Palestinian population; today, the same Parliament is calling on the European governments and the Presidency to demand respect for fundamental human rights, so that people can resume their lives in Gaza and so that political prospects can be re-established in place of violence and abuses of power."
"."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I do actually share Mr Brok’s sense of despair."
"Observing the way things have developed in recent weeks is enough to make us, too, become despondent."
"Indeed, if we compare the current situation with the way things were, say, in January of this year, they have only taken a turn for the worse."
"The arms truce, which Hamas observed, has come to an end; the number of prisoners on both sides is on the up; violence perpetrated against citizens has increased; Gaza has become a prison for its residents and the humanitarian situation is tragic."
"Nevertheless, now is not the time to let our hands hang low."
"That is why I should like to start, on behalf of my group, by pledging our full support, both to the Finnish Presidency, you, Mrs Lehtomäki, your Prime Minister, your Minister for Foreign Affairs – whilst also congratulating you on the efforts that have already been made – and also to you, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner."
"If I can venture drawing the political lesson from your words, what strikes me as paramount from what you have said – and you seem to be in agreement – is that negotiations and diplomacy are the only way-out."
"That appears to me as a clear message in the direction of those who at the moment say that they refuse all contact with the other party."
"We support you in this, and needless to say, we remain faithful to the principles of the Quartet, the recognition of Israel’s right of existence, the renunciation of violence by Hamas, as well as respect for previous treaties."
"We also support your call for taking a step back and for restraint."
"You have our full support in this."
"."
"Mr President, I welcome this overdue debate today because, frankly, the declaration of the Presidency issued two days ago falls far short of the response that we should expect of the European Union and risks undermining the EU’s credibility in the region."
"Clearly that declaration is not balanced: it gives great emphasis to the kidnapping of the Israeli soldier, which it condemns, but spends far fewer words on the completely disproportionate response of the Israeli authorities, which it only ‘regrets’."
"I am sorry that the representative of the Council has repeated that language and that lack of balance in her introduction this morning."
"It is not only that, contrary to both international law and humanitarian principle, the Israeli Government has destroyed electricity plants and water distribution networks: it has kidnapped and arrested 64 elected representatives."
"That follows the terrible massacre on the beach in Gaza."
"If that had happened anywhere else in the world we could have expected immediate condemnation by the international community."
"It is quite extraordinary that the Council has only finally spoken out now, and spoken in such muted terms."
"I believe it vital that we, the European Parliament, speak out and that we condemn in the strongest possible terms the arrest of democratically elected Palestinian representatives."
"At the same time we condemn the kidnapping of the captured Israeli soldier and we call for his swift and safe release."
"But let us not forget, either, the 9 600 Palestinian political prisoners, over half of whom are being detained without trial, nearly 400 of whom are under the age of 18."
"Let us have some consistency."
"Secondly, politics is about responding to changing events, and there has been a historic event in recent days that has been tragically overshadowed by the events in Gaza."
"That event was the agreement of Hamas and Fatah over the so-called prisoners’ document."
"In recent weeks the international community has called upon Hamas to change and now, as it gradually begins to do so, we should recognise that fact, give credit for that fact and alter our own political response accordingly."
"In agreeing that national conciliation document, Hamas has demonstrated that it supports the formation of a government of national coalition, that it supports an independent Palestinian state, within the 1967 borders, and that it is taking the first steps towards recognising Israel."
"We should be clear that the EU must immediately reopen dialogue with the legitimately and democratically elected representatives."
"The Council must reaffirm its conviction, as it has done, that the negotiated two-state solution is the only one that will bring peace and security, but that means that the EU itself must live up to its responsibilities."
"Together with the Quartet it must put forward concrete proposals about what it plans to do to help bring about that settled and peaceful resolution."
". – Mr President, we are calling for the release of Corporal Gilad Shalit and we are calling for the release of 9 000 Palestinian prisoners – of whom 128 are women, 300 are adolescents and 900 are being detained without trial."
"The Israeli army’s offensive on Gaza and the unprecedented seizure of a third of the Palestinian Ministers, of the President of Parliament and of many Hamas Members of Parliament, have nothing really to do with the desire to free that soldier."
"These plans had been in place well before his capture."
"The Olmert Government took this opportunity to try to take a decisive step towards a well-established and now well-known strategy."
"Firstly, the idea is to depose the Palestinian Government, even if it means all that remains of the Palestinian Authority of President Abbas being destroyed in the process."
"Then, as always, they will say that there is no Palestinian interlocutor to negotiate with."
"The way will then be open for Israel to impose its borders unilaterally."
"The regrouping of the settlements into three great blocs, which are easier to defend, the dividing up of the Palestinian territories and the annexation of almost half of the West Bank, of the Jordan Valley and of East Jerusalem and the continued construction of the wall: in short, a destroying any hope of a Palestinian State deserving of the term."
"Finally, the chaos thereby generated within Palestinian society will make it possible to justify continuing use of force, in the name of the essential need for security."
"This strategy is not just monstrous for the Palestinian people."
"It may well mean that the Israelis themselves have a nightmarish future in store."
"How can they expect docile Palestinian leaders and a consenting population to emerge, as if by a miracle, from such a collapse?"
"He who sows despair, reaps violence."
"Palestinian society is in danger of concluding that playing the game of democracy has brought them nothing but more misfortune."
"Faced with such a challenge, is the European Union going to let the Palestinian institutions that it has spent 12 years helping to create be destroyed?"
"Is it going to abandon the Palestinian President in the middle of this turmoil, when, together with the head of the government, he has just achieved something that nobody dared hope for, that is the conclusion of an agreement recognising Israel and opening up the way to a government of national unity?"
"Or is it going to have the will and the courage, which I have not noticed on the part of the Council – something I regret – to make its mark by demanding the release of the Hamas leaders, by re-establishing appropriate aid and active cooperation with the Palestinian authority and government, and stating clearly the obligations of all States without exception according to international law and the Geneva Conventions."
"I believe that it is in this area, and from this moment on, that Europe is going to be staking much of the credibility of the Euro-Mediterranean project and its credibility as a global player in general."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are following the situation in the Holy Land with anxiety and anguish."
"It is a situation that is becoming more serious by the day and one that is in danger of turning into an international crisis and, even before that, into a humanitarian crisis."
"I think that it is only right to begin with the words of the Pope, who has launched an appeal for the release of all of the kidnap victims and for negotiations to be held between Israelis and Palestinians, with the decisive contribution of the international community, and especially of Europe, in favour of a restoration of peace."
"At this tragic time, in fact, only dialogue and a cessation of the hostilities by both parties can stop the unacceptable escalation of violence."
"We welcomed the agreement between Fatah and Hamas on the prisoners’ document, which implicitly acknowledges Israel’s existence, but much more progress needs to be made, starting with the release of the Israeli soldier."
"Europe has done well to launch an immediate appeal, with one voice, for moderation and peace, but more courage and more determination are required."
"The international community must genuinely take the lead and assume full responsibility for becoming the guarantor of peace in the Middle East, by putting a stop to the violence and bringing Israelis and Palestinians back to the negotiating table."
"To conclude, I should like once again to cite the Pope, who has reaffirmed Israel's legitimate right to exist, in peace, but who has subsequently appealed for the international community to genuinely support the people of Palestine so that they can overcome the precarious conditions in which they are living and can build a future for themselves, with the ultimate aim of building an actual State."
"We are sure that, if these words could be heard, it would be possible at last to re-embark on the road to dialogue and peace."
"."
"Mr President, yesterday, Israeli’s Defence Minister, Amir Peretz, held the Syrian President, Bashir al-Assad, responsible for the welfare of the captured Israeli corporal Gilad Shalit."
"In doing so, he backed up his argument by reference to the terrorist command of Hamas, which operates under the of Khaled Meshal in Damascus."
"Do the Council and Commission share this view and if so, how do they think this may impact on European relations with Syria?"
"A second question to the Council and Commission concerns the functioning of European monitoring on the border between Egypt and Gaza at Rafah."
"A prominent Israeli analyst has described this EU mission as a complete failure."
"Before Europe’s and Egypt’s very eyes – probably literally in the case of the Egyptians – weapons and terrorists are entering the Gaza strip."
"I would ask the Council and Commission what their reaction to this is."
"Given yesterday’s Palestinian rocket attack in the centre of the Israeli city of Ashkelon, this is an urgent matter."
"– Mr President, the present situation in Israel poses a genuine threat of war."
"It is the gravest situation in the region since 2000, or even since 1967."
"Without wishing to go into a detailed analysis of the most recent events, and without wishing to play the role of a judge passing sentence or of a jury deciding who is at fault, I need to say that the lack of stability in this region is a real threat to peace and order throughout the world, and therefore international intervention is required."
"We cannot sit idly by and watch."
"If the escalation of violence continues, the spiral of conflict will intensify and lead to events whose repercussions will be felt not just by the inhabitants of Israel and Palestine."
"There are extremists on both sides."
"We must do everything to give a chance to the forces of moderation in both countries, to those who choose the difficult path of dialogue, rather than those who choose the easy path of violence."
"Mr President, the Commissioner very rightly mentioned the agreement between President Abbas and the Hamas government on the basis of the proposal by the prisoners, which has been overshadowed by recent developments."
"Each time there is a positive development towards peace, some extremist elements make sure they undermine it by an action such as the ambush in which two soldiers died and one was abducted."
"We condemn any terrorist acts and we demand the release of the Israeli soldier."
"However, it must also be said that the Israeli side always falls into this trap."
"With their excessive and disproportionate use of force they are destroying all the positive developments toward the peace that they themselves are seeking."
"They say that their aim is to spare innocent civilians."
"However, by destroying power stations and preventing normal irrigation – thereby leaving several million people without electricity and water – they are punishing not only innocent civilians but also the European taxpayer whose money has contributed to the building of the infrastructure and who, most probably and quite rightly, will be asked to repair it again."
"Therefore, our call is for both sides to respect the political, democratic process and to abandon violence as a means of imposing their political objectives on each other."
"The fight against terror should not be an excuse for Israel to overturn a democratic political decision taken by the Palestinian people."
"A dark cloud is hanging over the operation under way in Gaza."
"The further that operation progresses, the darker that cloud becomes!"
"The summer rains that are flooding Gaza are not just pointless."
"They are above all entirely illegitimate."
"It is not legitimate to deprive 750 000 people of electricity, it is not legitimate to call upon 20 000 people to leave their homes in order to turn their town into a ghost town."
"It is not legitimate to penetrate Syrian airspace."
"It is not legitimate to kidnap a quarter of a government and a quarter of a parliament."
"A State acting in that way is no better than a terrorist organisation."
"These are not my words, they are those of a Jewish man, Mr Levy, this week on Haaretz.com."
"If the voices of reason are speaking out in Israel to condemn these crimes, why is the Council struck down dumb?"
"Its communiqué of 3 July does not go as far as that of Switzerland or Turkey!"
"The European Union, which spent EUR 3 000 000 on observing the Palestinian elections, has been slow in reacting to the kidnapping of 64 members of the government and of the democratically-elected legislative Council, and is not calling for their immediate release."
"The shelling of Gaza, the destruction of an electrical power station, the cutting off of water, are not causing any outcry."
"Despite the increasing numbers of deaths and the cycle of violence that is re-emerging, we are not hearing anybody say: enough, enough, enough!"
"Stop this carnage, you have gone mad!"
"Yes, I condemn the firing of Kassam rockets, yes, I want to see the release of the soldier Gilad, but I also want to see the release of the 339 Palestinian children held in Israeli prisons."
"If a soldier’s life is sacred, then so are the lives of children."
"Above all, however, I am amazed that the European Union has not yet welcomed – though I would thank the Commissioner for doing so today – the historic step of the agreement on the document of the prisoners."
"Six months after the elections, Hamas and Islamic Jihad committed themselves implicitly to recognising Israel and to stopping the violence outside the territories."
"Not a word was said here though, just a deafening silence!"
"Our humanitarian aid – and I support the Commissioner – is just about going to keep Palestine going."
"Yet is it still our ambition to help the Palestinian State to build its democracy?"
"I put that question to the Council."
"Stop this scandal and ensure that international law is adhered to!"
"Mr President, we have heard about Corporal Shalit and those responsible should release the poor kid now."
"We have heard a lot less about Maria Aman."
"She will never again use her arms or legs; she is just three years old and her spinal cord was destroyed by Israeli shrapnel."
"That is what you get when you drop shells on a busy street in Gaza."
"The Israeli army killed more than 12 Palestinian children last month, but what do they care?"
"The Israeli Prime Minister says that the lives of Israelis are more important than those of Palestinians."
"Israel is diverting attention from the agreement between Fatah and Hamas that recognises the 1967 borders."
"What more does Israel want?"
"It will use any pretext to avoid going back to the roadmap."
"It has no intention of negotiating a two-state solution."
"But where is the challenge from Europe?"
"There is none; our double standards are just rank."
"We ignore Israeli racism and stand by with scarcely a word of protest as Israel imposes collective punishment on the people of Gaza."
"Our words about justice are never matched by our deeds."
"Europe has an opportunity here to move the agenda forward by telling the world that we embrace the prisoners’ document and that we will deal with the Palestinian Government."
"But all the evidence is that the Council and the Commission will not have the courage to do that."
"We make the Palestinians jump through hoops, but we let the Israelis get away with bloody murder."
"Mr President, last week the whole Parliament was treated to a very grand press release from Mr Adamos Adamou, MEP."
"Apparently the whole world should know that he, as Chairman of the Delegation for Relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council, ‘calls upon the international community to provide protection for civilian lives in Gaza’."
"Well how, precisely?"
"What is he going to do – stand in the middle of the street with a tin hat on his head?"
"Fortunately, a Google news search shows that there has been no response to the suggestion at all."
"All I can suggest now – and there have been some very strong speeches made here – is that we take a check on reality."
"The tragic truth is this: if Hamas continues to bomb, to kill, to maim and now to kidnap, then Israel will respond."
"Those who are burying their heads in the sand had better recognise that, or more tragedy will ensue."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe must not copy the Italian Government’s dubious policy of treating Israel and Palestine equally: the Gaza Strip has become an institutionalised launch pad for terrorist attacks."
"Hamas militia have abandoned the institutional option and have turned the situation back into one of full-scale terrorism."
"This is the main point."
"We cannot compare terrorism with Israel’s military decisions, or with the human rights violations that we do nonetheless condemn, but if Hamas' decision-making powers are in the hands of the media-dependent butchers from Syria and Iran, what can the MEPs’ feeble requests to the Hamas government accomplish?"
"Our inspectors have failed to prevent the shameful trafficking of millions of dollars, money that was packed into Hamas suitcases and definitely not intended to meet the needs of the Palestinian population."
"However, it is the European taxpayer that must attend to this problem."
"Mr President, the escalation of tension in the Palestinian territory was provoked by the Hamas-led kidnapping of Corporal Shalit with unrealistic demands for the release of Palestinian prisoners."
"Coming on the back of the cold-blooded murder of a civilian settler and the continuing firing of Qassam rockets from Gaza on to Israeli civilian areas, Prime Minister Olmert had no choice but to launch the limited surgical intervention by the IDF."
"I too now call for Corporal Shalit’s immediate release."
"Personally, I oppose any funding of a Hamas-led Palestinian Authority Government unless it renounces violence, disarms and recognises the right of the State of Israel to exist."
"Regrettably, the joint Hamas declaration with Fatah of 27 June, allegedly implicitly recognising Israel, reportedly remains an ambiguous document and Hamas does not clearly renounce violence."
"In the past, millions of euros of our taxpayers’ money have been donated in aid to the Palestinian Authority with little to show for it in terms of securing a lasting peace as envisaged in Oslo in 1993."
"Instead, there has been widespread corruption."
"I personally, although accepting the democratic victory of Hamas – after all, Hitler was also elected democratically – continue to regard it as a banned terrorist organisation, as does the European Union and the USA, and therefore would never countenance supporting any funds for it until it convincingly changes its charter and terrorist ideology."
"The recent Passover suicide bombing in Tel Aviv was publicly supported by the Hamas PA Government, which is an outrage."
"Nevertheless, the European Union, through the Quartet, must remain committed to lasting peace in the Middle East with a two-state solution whereby a viable, democratic Palestinian State can live in peace and security side by side with Israel within internationally recognised borders."
"I join all parties in this House in urging that Israel – the IDF in particular – Hamas and all the people involved in these ghastly events respect international law and avoid further bloodshed."
"Mr President, no conflict has ever been resolved with raised voices."
"In what way does the present picture of terror and violence differ from the others?"
"The fact that the violence and crimes of the abductors and murderers of an Israeli lad, and the many victims of the attacks have not been condemned by the democratically elected Palestinian Authority."
"In fact, Hamas took the side of those who spread violence and terror."
"It happened just after the new Israeli Government was sworn in, and to each action there is a reaction."
"The Israeli authorities responded to this criminal act by military action."
"Today’s scenarios have not been scripted by the Prime Minister of Israel and the President of the Palestinian Authority, who have attempted to keep the dialogue open, but by the Iranian President and Hamas extremists brought in from Damascus and terrorists of all shapes and sizes."
"I appeal to the Council and Commission to bring greater pressure to bear on both sides in this conflict, but particularly on the Palestinian Authority."
"It must be remembered that to renew the peace process, that government appointed by Hamas must recognise the state of Israel, renounce violence and abide by all agreements signed so far, which it has not yet done."
"Mr President, the situation is serious, as Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has said."
"Yes, the Israeli army is back in Gaza, yes, the Palestinians are in a dramatic humanitarian situation, the victims of the murderous deadlock into which they have been led by Hamas."
"We certainly support the emergency aid announced by the Commissioner."
"Yes, the Israeli reaction which has deprived half of the inhabitants of Gaza of water and electricity is disproportionate."
"Nevertheless, Israel has no intention of reoccupying Gaza."
"This great crisis could end tomorrow if the terrorist movements were to release the young soldier captured and stop firing rockets into Israeli territory, like the one last night on a school in Sderot."
"One constant concern is the possibility of the conflict in the region undergoing a sort of ‘iraqisation’: kidnappings and executions of hostages, such as that of 18-year-old Eliahou Asheri, which hardly anybody has mentioned, who was shot in the head because he was hitch-hiking in Jerusalem."
"Only a return to diplomacy will control this radicalisation and extremism, this policy of making things worse in order to achieve one’s ends."
"France and Egypt are currently in the best position to find a solution which I hope will be imminent for Gilad Shalit and for the Palestinian people."
"I would like to reassure Mr Davies by stressing here that, for each of us in this House, a Palestinian life is worth as much as an Israeli life."
"I believe that it is extremely unfair and inappropriate to put words into our mouths like that."
"Our dearest wish – which is unfortunately little more than a dream – is to see Europe work together on this issue in order to achieve a return to the negotiation table."
"Mr President, I believe that everything has already been said about the conflict and its origins."
"I believe that the situation is much worse today than a year ago, because we no longer know whom to help and how."
"On the one hand we have a physical barrier, and then we have an armed barrier (soldiers, passport control), which led to the destruction of a power station and bridges."
"Another new political barrier has also appeared, in the form of the elected Hamas government, and all that it entails in political terms."
"Then there are also the people, the ordinary citizens, whom we do not know how to help."
"It is a fairly simple rule that hunger and frustration lead to aggression, and aggression is the food on which terrorism, and possibly even a potential war, thrives."
"We should ask ourselves whether, if the two peoples cannot coexist in one country, there is only one viable solution: the creation of two states."
"I have a question to the Commissioner and the members of the Commission and the Council: is the European Union doing enough, are we being sufficiently vigorous and effective as mediators, as helpers and as diplomats?"
"Does the Commissioner have any ideas on this particular situation?"
"Mr President, I am amazed by what I have just heard, and I regret that some people here still confuse Jews with Israelis."
"We would not be facing such a huge humanitarian crisis if we had not started by stopping our aid to the Palestinian people."
"The Council of Ministers’ decision to cut aid and to endanger the Palestinian people was a serious mistake."
"There were other ways to apply pressure."
"Since the suspension of that aid, has the Hamas Government made the slightest progress in terms of recognising the State of Israel?"
"Has it finally decided to condemn the attacks?"
"Not only has this policy of using the humanitarian crisis for the purposes of blackmail had no positive effect whatsoever, but it has actually led to suffering."
"We are once again in a cycle of violence in which wrong is clearly being done by both sides; rockets fired into Israel, disproportionate reprisals by the Israeli army, the seizing of the soldier Shalit, who of course must be released, as everybody here has said."
"Many players have continued to cooperate with Palestine."
"I am thinking in particular of the many European local groups who met in Brussels last week."
"Furthermore, as President Brok said, the Quartet must allow intervention on the ground."
"Finally, allow me to express my great regret at the fact that the European Parliament's resolution voted on last month made no reference to the statement of the Palestinian prisoners, because I believe that that text is the most encouraging sign for the Palestinian authority led by Mahmoud Abbas, which we must support."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can only share the profound concern which Members of Parliament have expressed on the worsening crisis in the Middle East."
"Moreover, as the Minister responsible for development cooperation, I think that the deteriorating humanitarian situation is especially serious, as I said in my opening speech, considering that the situation was not very good even before this latest phase of the crisis."
"This conflict is a huge challenge for the European Union, and the Council is firmly committed to supporting every means to find a solution to it."
"At the same time we have to bear in mind that the parties involved hold the keys to solving the crisis."
"We can and we must work to find a solution as best we can, but it is crucially important that the parties involved have sufficient will and the desire to do so too."
"The Council issued its latest statement on 30 June: it did not waste any time."
"As I see it, the position taken is a very balanced one, unlike what has been suggested in some of the speeches here."
"The Council wishes to stress that, to ease the crisis, both sides must take the necessary adequate action."
"We regard it as vital that the captured Israeli soldier is released, but also just as vital that Israel puts an end to this military operation and that both sides act in compliance with international law."
"It is crucial that the parties involved can return to the negotiating table and thereby find a solution to the crisis."
"."
"Mr President, as I said at the beginning, I really sense and share your deep concern at the escalation of these events in the Gaza Strip."
"It is a vicious circle."
"I also understand the reactions in Israel to the kidnapping of Corporal Shalit."
"He must be released unharmed."
"It is true that the Syrian part of Hamas has a great responsibility here."
"The Qassam rocket attacks from northern Gaza into Israel must stop."
"However, the Israeli military incursion into the Gaza Strip and the destruction of the civilian infrastructure there punishes Palestinians collectively and puts civilian lives at risk."
"That raises questions about respect for international law."
"Is it really in Israel’s long-term interest?"
"Does it not threaten to reinforce this vicious circle of poverty and extremism?"
"Electricity and water supplies must now be restored quickly and with Israeli assistance."
"The arrest of elected law-makers threatens the institutions of the Palestinian Authority that are needed for the creation of an independent, democratic and viable Palestinian State."
"The European Union has expressed particular concerns about the detention of these elected members of the Palestinian Government and legislature and those detained must be accorded full legal rights."
"All sides must exercise restraint."
"Last year I spoke of the need to hope for prospects in the peace process in the wake of Israel’s disengagement from Gaza and the G8 plan to revive the Palestinian economy."
"How different the situation looks today."
"Yet, I think it is possible to step back."
"Therefore we will remain committed to a negotiated two-state solution and we will not recognise any change to the pre-1967 borders other than those agreed by both sides."
"We welcome President Abbas’s efforts to create the widest possible Palestinian consensus in support of the objectives of the roadmap and we want to have continued support."
"We are ready to work with any Palestinian government that renounces violence, recognises Israel and respects previous agreements as set out by the Quartet."
"We have to consider Mr Brok’s suggestion of going there as a Quartet and seeing what we can do."
"We have reiterated our commitment to a negotiated, comprehensive, just and lasting settlement in the Middle East."
"The common goal of the G8 remains the creation of a viable, democratic and sovereign Israel and Palestine living in peace and security."
"We want to achieve that and therefore we want to continue our efforts, even at the most difficult times."
"The debate is closed."
"– How much more must the Palestinian people suffer, how many more children must be killed before the international community finally wakes up and demands that Israel stop the abominable crimes which it is committing every day?"
"The cause of the tragedy is the Israeli occupation."
"We must not let the truth be distorted by putting responsibility for the unacceptable developments on the imprisonment of one Israeli soldier."
"This would be the equivalent of our accepting the occupation and the logic of mass punishment and the declaration that the life of Israelis is more important than the life of Palestinians."
"We condemn the arrest of ministers of the legal and democratically elected Palestinian Government and our fellow parliamentarians."
"We demand their immediate and unconditional release."
"Israel must stop the undeclared war and the blocking of humanitarian aid and must restore the infrastructure it has destroyed."
"We are also calling for the release of the solider, which will remove any pretext for continuing attacks."
"The Quartet must immediately apply the temporary aid mechanism to the Palestinians."
"The international community, the ΕU and the Quartet must insist on returning to the negotiating table and must demand respect for the roadmap by the Israeli Government and respect for all the agreements signed on the promotion and safeguarding of peace by both sides."
"– Faced with the upsurge of Israel’s criminal onslaught against the Palestinian people and its institutions, the EU has once again held Israel and the Palestinians jointly responsible for the situation in a statement by the Council Presidency. This completely overlooks the brutal policy of Israel’s aggression and occupation of Palestine, where Israel systematically violates international law and the Palestinian people’s inalienable right to their own independent state."
"The EU has not issued a single word in condemnation of the current Israeli military aggression, which judging by its extent appears to have been a long time in the pipeline, with Israel simply waiting for an excuse."
"This criminal military action forms part of a long-planned Israeli strategy to destroy the Palestinian Authority, its institutions and its structures, including those that meet the people’s most basic needs."
"Israel’s strategy is to annexe occupied territories – as evidenced by the building of the wall – and to undermine the conditions required for building a sovereign, independent and viable Palestinian state."
"This is why solidarity is needed towards the PLO and the Palestinian people."
"The situation in Palestine is critical."
"All humane individuals want to see the Israeli soldier who has been taken hostage released safe and well."
"However, his abduction should not be used by Israel as an excuse for extreme action in Gaza and the West Bank."
"I urge Israel to keep all its actions in line with international law."
"The humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territories must be addressed urgently."
"Electricity should immediately be restored to all homes, medical supplies provided and food shortages addressed."
"Both parties should be encouraged to take measures to build mutual confidence and reduce tension."
"A clear statement from both sides that a negotiated two-state solution is the only viable future for the region would go a long way to improving the present situation."
"Mr President, on a point of order under Rules 149 to 164, I rise to ask why it is Parliament cannot be organised, via the Presidency or its administration, to have votes at the proper time, on time, when required."
"Votes should take precedence over everything else and should be at a fixed time, so that inconvenience is not caused to everyone by having votes at ridiculous times such as this."
"Thank you, Sir Robert."
"I did check."
"This morning’s debate was slightly prolonged because of the Finnish Prime Minister’s speech, which lasted 45 minutes."
"You will recall that Finnish has too many vowels for any serious language."
"That is what prolonged it."
"I should like to announce to colleagues that Terry Wynn will be retiring from the European Parliament this week."
"I am sure that we would all like to thank him for his distinguished work, especially as Chairman of the Committee on Budgets."
"Mr President, for me as a newcomer from one of the new Member States, it was feasible to jump into the chair of the Committee on Budgets because I had an eminent predecessor."
"Chairing the Committee after Mr Wynn is like flying on autopilot."
"For me he is, and will remain, a great master of European finance."
"All the best to you, Terry."
"The next item is the vote."
"."
"Mr President, inaccuracies in the German translation of our compromise proposal on cabin crew have caused confusion among some of my fellow Members."
"These inaccuracies are found in Amendments 20, 22 and 24(1)."
"The authoritative version is the English ‘where relevant’, which translates into German as ’ and not , which would be ‘if relevant’."
"Mr President, I would confirm that linguistic difficulty."
"I would also like to say that 37 of us tabled Amendments 17 and 18 in plenary."
"Last night at the end of the debate an agreement was reached in relation to these amendments."
"I can tell the Members involved with these amendments that the Council and the Commission have agreed to include cabin crew in the air safety rules, as those Members wished."
"I can therefore say to the Members who have tabled these amendments together with me that, provided that the compromise amendments are adopted, our amendments will no longer be relevant and we will therefore be able to vote against."
"I believe that this has been a fine collective success."
"I hope that my fellow Members have understood what I wanted to say."
"."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group I should like to request a roll-call vote on this one."
"Mr President, unless I am mistaken, according to Rule 153(3) of our Rules of Procedure, the share of the vote just now should have led to rejection."
"That is how it appears to me, though I could be wrong."
"We are applying Rule 153(2) of the Rules of Procedure, which reads: ‘In the event of a tied vote on the agenda as a whole (Rule 132) or the Minutes as a whole (Rule 172), or on a text put to a split vote under Rule 157, the text shall be deemed adopted’."
"Thank you for your remarks."
"Mr President, I regret that the Commission did not take the floor."
"The decision we have just taken on nuclear exports is relevant to the forthcoming G8 Summit."
"Based on this morning’s debate, I expect the Commission to raise the issues of human rights and the environmental situation in the Urals in relation to the Mayak and Chelyabinsk reprocessing plants with President Putin on site."
"The rapporteur could have indicated that he wanted the Commission to reply, but that was not the case."
"Therefore that was in order."
"It gives me great pleasure to welcome Emma Bonino, the Italian Minister for European Policies and International Trade, to the House today."
". The purpose of this proposal is to strengthen the effectiveness of contacts between law-enforcement authorities and to maintain law and order in the different Member States in order to improve the planning of cross-border policing during certain international events."
"The report proposes that, in the last quarter of the year, the Council Presidency draw up a list of the international events planned for the following year, along with the assistance that will be required."
"The report also proposes that the Presidency produce a review of the assistance provided during the previous year, containing a list of the problems and difficulties experienced by the Member States and recommendations as to how such difficulties can be resolved."
"I therefore support the Boepels report and the amendments that she has tabled."
"This is a justified, welcome report."
"The necessary measures must be taken to ensure that security and law and order are maintained during international events attended by large numbers of people from more than one Member State, and that illegal acts may be prevented and combated."
"We are issuing our opinion today on a proposal for a decision on strengthening cross-border police cooperation with regard to meetings attended by large numbers of people from more than one Member State, including large international sporting events (the football World Cup, the Olympics, cycling tours etc.), but also religious events, State visits or international political meetings or summits."
"Experience has clearly shown that cooperation, confidence, proper communication between the police forces involved, the availability of reliable information and good preparation are essential factors in the success of such events, particularly from the point of view of prevention."
"The text takes account of each of these elements and specifically lays down the following stages."
"Before events: annual planning of expected needs."
"During events: cross-border cooperation and assistance amongst national police forces."
"Finally, after events: an evaluation and, if necessary, proposals for adapting the European legislation (particularly the Schengen Agreement)."
"At the moment of the second semi-final of the World Cup, which has so far taken place without any major incident, we must support this text in the hope that that remains the case as often as possible."
". The proposal to draw up a list of international events taking place in the EU, attended by citizens from various Member States, requiring high levels of cooperation between the security services of the different Member States raises major concerns as to the real objective of this initiative and the use of this mechanism."
"The recent attempts to prevent people from taking part in international events and demonstrations taking place for example alongside European summits, in protest at neoliberal and militarist policies or expressing solidarity with people fighting against imperialism, are very fresh in the mind."
"This ultimately demonstrates the potential meaning of the ‘provision of cross-border assistance’ between security services for ‘maintaining law and order’ and ‘combating criminal offences’."
"This initiative forms part of the securitarianism that the EU is drifting towards, and follows the adoption of other measures which, on the pretext of the so-called ‘fight against terrorism’, undermine the citizens’ rights, freedoms and guarantees."
"Our parliamentary group therefore voted against."
". I should like to congratulate Mrs Brepoels on her timely report on the initiative by the Kingdom of the Netherlands with a view to the adoption of a Council Decision on strengthening cross-border police cooperation with regard to meetings attended by large numbers of people from more than one Member State, at which policing is primarily aimed at maintaining law and order and security and preventing and combating criminal offences, which has my full backing."
"I especially welcome the idea of adding an unanticipated event attended by large numbers of people from more than one Member State to the list submitted to the Council Presidency during the previous year."
"A consequence of the free movement of persons is that the EU must think about judicial cooperation in criminal matters, so that an area of freedom, security and justice can be created."
". Good preparation is of vital importance in preventing or containing disasters."
"It is for that reason that I support the report aimed at making cross-border assistance as effective as possible."
"Combating crime and protecting law and order falls essentially within the competence of the Member States."
"This proposal is solely aimed at improving cooperation between the different Member States in this area by establishing a uniform, transparent and effective framework for the exchange of information."
"It is primarily aimed at maintaining law and order and security and preventing and combating criminal offences during international events attended by large numbers of people from more than one Member State."
"Every year, before 31 January, the Council is to produce a review of international assistance provided during the previous calendar year."
"The review will comprise an overview of the international events that have taken place, an overview of the assistance provided and received and an overview of the main difficulties observed by the Member States and recommendations as to how such difficulties could be resolved."
"This will ensure that national police forces work in the most effective way possible."
"There can be no doubt that the only effective way of combating organised crime and crime tourism is by strengthening cross-border police cooperation."
"In this connection, the Schengen Information System, or SIS, in particular, seems to have proved itself in everyday policing. Indeed, owing to its speed, many alerts are now being sent only via the SIS and no longer via Interpol."
"On the other hand, we now have a juxtaposition of multiple forms of police cooperation: Schengen, Europol, Eurodac, CIS, many forms of bilateral cooperation and now the Prüm Convention, too."
"This gives rise to the question as to whether we may now be seeing some unnecessary overlaps here, and also whether we may be starting to lose sight of the overall picture."
"In any case, we must also ensure that sufficient attention is paid to the protection of personal data."
"– New measures to strike at the grassroots struggle at national and European level are proposed in the report on the strengthening of cross-border police cooperation at international EU events."
"It insultingly provides for a 'calendar of international events' to be held every year in order to programme and organise cooperation between the repressive mechanisms of the ΕU used to combat grassroots movements."
"Thus preventive repression is being promoted within the framework of the more general imperialist doctrine of preventive war at home and abroad, in the objective of 'protecting' summits and all kinds of international meetings of imperialist organisations from the enemy the people."
"The people of Europe have first-hand knowledge of the murderous action of the EU's repressive mechanisms in Gothenburg, in Genoa and in other countries."
"Every day they have to deal with restrictions on their most fundamental rights and freedoms."
"The Greek Communist Party voted against the report. It will help to develop a movement of resistance from the working-class and grassroots movement at national and European level to defend grassroots freedoms."
"Defiance, disobedience and the abolition in practice of the decisions of the ΕU and governments abolishing vested democratic rights are the right and obligation of the peoples."
". I will be voting for this report, but the whole fate of inland waterway vessels in the UK is currently under threat."
"The UK has a derogation from the Energy Products Directive which allows the country's recreational boat owners to fill up their vessels with red diesel, taxed at 6.44 pence per litre."
"This derogation is due to expire on 31 December 2006, and in a Communication from the Commission to the Council on 30 June 2006, the Commission indicated it did not believe an extension to this derogation to be justified."
"The benefits of ending this derogation are unclear."
"As leisure boaters' red diesel usage makes up less than 0.05% of the country's diesel consumption, the environmental benefits are essentially negligible."
"There is no evidence to suggest that the UK derogation affects or skews the internal European market."
"Loss of the derogation will put a hobby and an industry at great risk."
"A survey by the Royal Yachting Association reveals that 54% of boaters 'would or may' be forced to give up boating due to the sudden price rise."
"The knock-on effects could seriously damage the 30 000 people employed in the boat industry, the 70 000 people whose jobs are supported by marine tourism and the GBP 700 million spent by boaters every year."
"The UK requires a final five-year extension to address these issues."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to speak about the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the harmonisation of technical requirements and administrative procedures in the field of civil aviation."
"This regulation provides for a range of technical provisions that will have a far-reaching impact on safety, which in general terms is to be welcomed."
"Some regulations on emissions, flight time limitations and administration are inadequate, however, and should be viewed in the broader context."
"Any moves towards further taxation on fuel or services would limit free competition among new airlines and airports."
"It should be remembered that in addition to improving safety and the quality of services, we must also ensure that entrepreneurship is facilitated, that bureaucracy is stripped away and that the cost of air transport is cut."
"Mobility is one of the prerequisites of economic growth and the rising cost of air transport would put us at a competitive disadvantage in the global market."
"The majority in Parliament has rejected the amendments that we tabled, which were aimed at protecting workers’ rights and guaranteeing passenger safety. These amendments were as follows:"
"- No provision in the present regulation can be used or invoked, within the framework of relations between the Member States, to undermine the rights, and the salaries, working conditions, qualifications and training of the various strata of civil aviation personnel;"
"- a reduction in the flight duty period – a maximum of 160 hours in a period of 28 consecutive days, distributed as evenly as possible throughout this period and a maximum of 40 hours in a seven-day period, with two rest days – so that the flight and cabin crew are able to guarantee safety."
"- certification of qualified cabin crew, with an appropriate, valid licence that is accepted by the relevant authority, which certifies that the person concerned has the appropriate qualifications and skills to carry out the duties allocated to them."
"We deeply regret this."
". I vote in favour of compromise Amendment 1."
"As Mr Stockmann has done such a splendid job as rapporteur, I shall be voting in favour of compromise Amendment 1."
"I take this amendment to be, among other things, an indication of the very particular need on the part of all parties for safety in the air."
"The new rules on flying times and rest periods is a milestone in terms of air safety and guarantees a marked enhancement of the safety not only of passengers but also of the crew."
"It is not only the passengers, but also the whole crew, who stand to benefit from the establishment of uniform standards in all European countries, which will make it possible, even though the number of people who travel by air is constantly increasing, for the same safety standards to apply wherever they do so."
". I welcome this report, which has been on the table for six years."
"One of the main points to be considered is to ensure that pilot fatigue does not endanger flight safety."
"Given the increased frequency of flights and the huge number of passengers flying nowadays, harmonisation of safety standards at the highest, scientifically supported safety level is imperative, in order to create a level playing field within the enlarged EU."
"When dealing with this type of legislation, we have to be mindful of its impact upon pilot fatigue."
"On that basis, I support a medical and scientific evaluation of the impact of such a law two years after this legislation comes into force."
"I believe that this report clearly stipulates that this regulation can in no way constitute a legal basis to watering down existing safety protection in Member States."
"It is important, in view of safety, that the Commission carries out an assessment of the impact of the regulation on rosters and operating models and, in the event that they are adversely affected, the Commission should carry out an assessment and propose an adjustment of the provisions regarding flight and duty time limitations."
"Even though the nuclear industry has spent five decades looking for solutions to radioactive waste, we are, in this respect, still at square one."
"Nuclear waste is transported the length and breadth of Europe in convoys that cost the taxpayer millions, entail a high risk of accidents, and are an ideal target for terrorist attacks."
"Risk-free storage over a period of millennia is an impossibility and the idea of it takes the argument about clean and cheap electricity from nuclear power to absurd lengths."
"All we would be doing would be to burden future generations with the potential dangers from these ticking time-bombs. Our scientists have not, as yet, even succeeded in agreeing among themselves as to what geological conditions are best suited to disposal, and so, for example, we see the desperate attempts at preventing radionuclides from escaping from the former Asse II salt mine in Germany, which are costing over EUR 120 million."
"Over the coming years, the taxpayer will be required to invest some EUR 500 billion in the decommissioning of currently operational reactors in Europe; even if the atomic energy industry were to be obliged to bear the costs of storage itself instead of being able to shuffle them off onto the public purse, electricity generated by nuclear power would still be at least 20% more expensive and hence unprofitable."
"It really is high time that the billions in subsidy that keep this nuclear extravaganza afloat were cut off."
". Firstly, I wish to express my support for the efforts of the Community to strengthen the supervision and control of shipments of radioactive waste within the EU."
"Without a doubt, should it be our priority to ensure that our people are protected against the dangerous affects of nuclear waste."
"However, I decided to abstain from the vote because the proposed Council directive does not take into account the dangerous effects of shipments and reprocessing of radioactive waste on nuclear-free Member States like Ireland."
"The proposed directive focuses only on Member States who are active participants in the production of nuclear energy."
"The interests of passive bystanders like Ireland, a country which chose to remain nuclear-free and is not a transit state, are not covered by the proposal."
"As a nuclear-free country, Ireland is affected by the waste coming from continental Europe to be reprocessed at Britain’s Sellafield plant."
"The waste is shipped through the Irish Sea, thus making it the most radioactive body of water in the world."
"Ireland’s unique position is not included in the proposal for a directive on the supervision and control of shipments of radioactive waste."
". I welcome the fact that Parliament has voted to adopt two proposals in the report, the first aimed at promoting a socially inclusive, knowledge-based society by supporting free, open-source software, and the second highlighting the fact that improved research and innovation policies must contribute to new employment opportunities through sustainable development."
"I wish to point out that these were proposals that were put forward by our group and to which we put our name during the debate in the relevant committee."
"We also welcome the focus on lifelong learning and the role of universities in creating and disseminating knowledge, and the attention paid to SMEs."
"There are some less welcome points, however, such as intellectual property issues, the report's promotion of entrepreneurship from the early stages of education and the fact that the whole position is broadly based on competitiveness."
"Hence our abstention."
". The March 2000 Lisbon European Council set the objective of the EU becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy by 2010."
"In 2006, it is a long way from achieving this objective."
"I agree with the rapporteur’s proposal for Europe to enhance its performance via the creation, sharing and financing of knowledge."
"I should like to highlight the current lack of investment in R[amp]D, the lack of promotion of entrepreneurship with the emphasis on innovation and the lack of political and financial support for lifelong learning and ICT training."
"Secondly, Europe is not sharing its knowledge."
"Major obstacles continue to prevent agents in the sector from working together both within and outside national borders."
"Lastly, Europe is not financing knowledge."
"In this context, Community policy should strengthen programmes such as the CIP (Competitiveness and Innovation Programme) and JEREMIE (Joint European Resources for Micro- to Medium-sized Enterprises) financial instruments."
". The Lisbon Agenda 2000 resolved to make Europe the world’s most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy within ten years."
"However, the EU still continues to lag behind the US and Japan."
"I welcome this report, which attempts to improve the EU’s performance in three main areas."
"Firstly, through financing and encouraging the creation of new knowledge: this will be facilitated through promoting the spirit of entrepreneurship, providing lifelong learning and ICT training and improving the image of scientific research as a rewarding career path."
"Secondly, Europe is failing to share its knowledge."
"Human resources must be used in an efficient way and improving partnerships must remain at the forefront of European R[amp]D policy-making."
"Resources must now be focused upon ensuring that the brightest minds are provided with adequate cross-border capital and human resources."
"Furthermore, organisations who continue to treat women as inferior workers should be named and shamed."
"Thirdly, Europe is failing to finance knowledge."
"It is essential that a large proportion of EU budget resources for financial instruments are aimed at enhancing SME finance and tackling market failures."
"Europe must now recognise its faults so that it can fulfil the aims of the Lisbon Agenda."
". Although this is an own-initiative report without legislative impact, the points and concerns that it raises are worthy of my support."
"The idea that research and innovation should play a central role in the new economic model currently lacking in Europe strikes me as crucial."
"One must admit, however, that there is a huge gap between the Lisbon goals and reality."
"Europe has failed to respond adequately to the evidence that technology and investment in material and human resources in the area of research and innovation are vital components in development and growth, particularly given the current state of affairs in the world economy."
"This point, which is expressed in the resolution before us, along with a number of other proposals – for example on redefining research and innovation strategies – justifies my vote in favour."
"Words must now be transformed into action."
"There will not be a Europe of results without a Europe of investment."
". I voted in favour because I feel that the innovation and research sectors are vital components in creating more and better jobs in the EU."
"The SMEs play a key role in this context in that they act as a conduit between the universities and the business sector."
"The main factors standing in the way of meeting the goals set by the Lisbon Strategy are well known: poor performance by the Member States, fragmentation of the labour markets, inefficient, inadequate use of human resources and reduced mobility of Europe’s workforce."
"Accordingly, I regret the fact that the Member States are not lending the necessary political and financial support to the creation of a flexible workforce capable of adapting to the new realities of the labour markets, and that they do not accord their researchers the prestige they deserve."
"I am therefore in favour of putting an end to administrative and legal barriers in the way of greater mobility for researchers, and of creating better working conditions, that is to say, an attractive, prestigious ‘single market’ for researchers in order to stem the European brain drain."
"I am also in favour of promoting entrepreneurship from the early stages of education, strengthening lifelong learning and actively encouraging the training of workers and the unemployed in new technologies."
". This report contains a number of contradictions."
"On the one hand, it gives prominence to negative aspects, including the emphasis on issues of competitiveness and competition, and on measures aimed at industrial restructuring and modernisation, in the face of ‘fierce international competition’, the impact of which we know is terrible."
"It also, on the other hand, contains proposals that we tabled in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, including the proposal to call on the Commission to refuse Community aid to companies which, after receiving such support in a Member State, transfer their manufacturing operations to another country without completely fulfilling the agreements entered into with the Member State concerned."
"I should also like to highlight the inclusion of the proposal to accord the same weight to the working environment and the health and safety of workers as to ensuring the creation of more and better jobs, and the call for the rights of workers to be protected when manufacturing companies are restructured and hence for the availability of information to be fully guaranteed, for workers’ representative bodies."
"Hence our decision to abstain."
". I voted in favour of this report because I agree that a dynamic and highly competitive industrial sector is a vital prerequisite to improving social standards."
"The Commission’s communication gives a detailed overview of the 27 manufacturing sectors and, with sensitivity, combines a range of sectoral actions with cross-sectoral policy initiatives."
"Like the rapporteur, I am in favour of developing a coherent, European-level industrial policy that will enable us to meet the challenges of globalisation head on."
"Although the EU is an economy essentially based on the services sector, it remains an industrial power on the world stage."
"It therefore makes perfect sense to develop European-level industrial competitiveness strategies, and to promote European entrepreneurship and corporate social responsibility."
"I am convinced that the future of European manufacturing lies in increasing the added value and the quality of products, and in a qualified, flexible workforce."
"I also welcome this report as it highlights the importance of increasing the regional concentration of manufacturing."
"I support close collaboration between regional and national authorities and the economic and social players to draw up local strategy plans targeted at making the best possible use of the primary wealth producing sector and any comparative benefits offered by each region."
"Mr President, this is not a point of order, I just wanted to thank our colleagues who signed Written Declaration No 21."
"My thanks also go to my colleague Mr Braghetto for his solidarity."
"We tabled the declaration together."
"The European Parliament has today once again proved its sensitivity to cultural matters, because the cultural and religious heritage of Cyprus is not strictly speaking a Cypriot matter – it is a European matter."
"The European Union embraces all the cultures of all the Member States of the Union."
"The next item is the interim report (A6-0213/2006) by Mr Fava, on behalf of the Temporary Committee, on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners [2006/2027(INI)]."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament constantly has to tackle a high-minded and difficult task: making its personal contribution to combating terror."
"As you know, on Saturday, alongside our British friends, we will be commemorating the fifty people who died in last year’s bomb attacks in London."
"We have another equally difficult task: investigating the truth, including the truth about the abuses committed over the past few years in the name of the fight against terrorism."
"This is the raison d’être of our committee: the truth about the rights denied those accused of being our enemies, but who, as human beings who stand accused, are entitled to representation by a lawyer, to a trial, a judge and dignified and humane treatment."
"Mr President, where there are no rights there are no laws – merely the exercise of force and arbitrary acts."
"When we talk of extraordinary rendition, which is the theme on which our committee has focused, we are talking about an arbitrary act that certain countries want and others accept in the name of the fight against terrorism."
"Extraordinary rendition refers to the extraordinary transport of terrorist suspects captured by the CIA and sent to complaisant countries that are willing to interrogate them using any methods at their disposal and to hold them without trial."
"In recent years, Mr President, rendition has been a fact and not an opinion or a conjecture."
"It is a fact that has even been admitted by the US State Department, a practice that has been used and abused, even to the detriment of European citizens."
"We are reserving the work conclusions reached in the past few months, and those that we hope to reach over the next few months, for the concluding report; but it is now our duty to inform you of a vast and general range of offences, involving various European countries and different levels of responsibility: some have been complicit, some have covered up the illegal operations and some have simply looked the other way."
"A few hours ago, news arrived from Italy that the Milan investigating judge has signed a protective custody warrant against the deputy director of the Sismi, the Italian military security service, for acting as an accomplice in the abduction of Abu Omar, the Milan imam who was kidnapped, in whose case another twenty-two preventative custody warrants have been issued against CIA agents."
"And here I must impress upon you the seriousness of the fact that the director of the Sismi, General Pollari, appeared before our committee to assert that his agency had never received any information regarding this abduction."
"Let us note the fact that the deputy director was arrested because he was considered to be responsible for this abduction."
"Mr President, we are not a court of justice; because of this event, however, we have an additional responsibility at the political and institutional levels, as do governments and Member States, to which we appeal because the burden of proof – precisely because we are not a court of justice – is a burden that must be shared with the governments, whose full collaboration and commitment to absolute truth we will need in the months to come."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we would like to make every effort to discover the plain truth on the facts and responsibilities, to ensure above all that these events and abuses are never repeated on European territory or to the detriment of European citizens, and I believe that this is the ultimate aim of our committee."
"Thanks to the work of our assistants – the committee staff, whom I would like to thank – we have reconstructed in detail a complex system of aircraft and fictitious companies used by the CIA for its assignments in recent years; we have minutely reconstructed the routes of over one thousand flights, which we have made available to our fellow Members of Parliament."
"We know that many of these flights were routine flights used to transport equipment or officials, but not all of them were: Abu Omar, Maher Arar, Khaled el-Masri, Mohamed Algiza and many others were roughly loaded onto and transported in these aircraft to their prisons."
"These flights have landed in our airports, used our skies and taken advantage of our silence with impunity and in only one case out of 1 084 flights has a police officer claimed to be able to identify crews and passengers."
"Mr President, we have provided the victims of scandalous errors of justice with a voice and the right to speak, as we have those who have enabled this committee to do its work."
"We now have a difficult task before us, for which we ask Parliament to authorise us to continue our work until the end of our mandate, in the knowledge that the truth that we will have obtained and consolidated by the end of it will constitute a body of work to be placed at the disposal of all European countries and, of course, of this Parliament."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the Council has been asked for an opinion on this matter, I am happy to take part in this debate on its behalf."
"Right at the start, I would like to say that the subject of this interim report is an extremely important one, and I consider that the initiative taken regarding this issue by the European Parliament and the Council of Europe and its Parliamentary Assembly is very important and significant."
"The issue is the implementation of fundamental rights in Europe and action against terrorism."
"These must not be allowed to come into conflict with one another."
"All action taken against terrorism must be in compliance with obligations under international law, and no compromises on these, where it concerns human rights, refugee or humanitarian issues, can be accepted in the name of action against terrorism."
"With reference to the interim report under discussion, I would nevertheless like to emphasise that the Treaties do not bestow competence on the European Union in such matters as these, and national intelligence is not within the scope of application of the Treaty, because the Member States have unanimously decided to reserve the task of monitoring the work of national intelligence services for themselves."
"This obviously does not mean that the Council has adopted a passive stance regarding the matters raised in the report."
"Since last November it has been suspected publicly that the US Central Intelligence Agency was using flights to transport prisoners and illegal detention facilities in Europe."
"On 21 November the European Union Foreign Affairs Ministers discussed this information at a session of the General Affairs and External Affairs Council."
"As a result of this discussion, on 29 November 2005, the Foreign Affairs Minister for the country to hold the Presidency at the time, Jack Straw, wrote to US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on the European Union’s behalf, trying to discover the US Government’s views regarding these allegations."
"On 5 December the US Secretary of State made a detailed statement on the matter, prior to her European visit, according to which the United States considered that international agreements were binding on its own actions and that the United States respected other countries’ sovereignty and that it did not transport detained persons to countries where they would be tortured, under interrogation or otherwise."
"The European Union Foreign Affairs Ministers and Secretary of State Rice discussed the matter again later on during the latter’s visit to Brussels."
"Since early this year there has been intensive dialogue with the United States at various levels and in different assemblies regarding these matters."
"Human rights have been discussed on many an occasion with the United States."
"There have also been discussions on the need for compliance with international law in the fight against terrorism."
"This was most recently on the agenda at the US-EU Summit in Vienna on 21 June."
"The European Union has repeatedly asked the US Government to allow United Nations human rights reporters full access to Guantanamo Bay."
"EU Foreign Affairs Ministers have stated that the European Union is still seriously concerned about Guantanamo Bay, and the topic has been discussed with the United States on more than one occasion."
"It is the opinion of the EU that the US Government should take steps to close Guantanamo down as soon as possible."
"Accordingly, the Union welcomed the remark made by President Bush at the Vienna Summit that he was willing to close down the Guantanamo Bay detention centre."
"As the country to hold the Presidency of the Council, Finland will naturally continue to keep alive the debate on human rights in dialogue with the United States."
"That will be very important during our Presidency."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the eve of the anniversary of the terrorist attacks in London, the fight against terror must certainly remain the main objective of European security strategy and this is a good opportunity to remember it, together with the declaration, which should be loud and clear, that respect for the fundamental human rights of every human being is the other factor that should be included in European security strategy."
"It is obvious that, when we erode guarantees of freedom and people’s fundamental rights, we involuntarily risk providing a propaganda target for the very terrorists that we are combating."
"The search for truth is therefore necessary, and, I have to say, it involves a historical truth, a legal truth and a search for liability, and naturally the Commission has made and will continue to make a heartfelt contribution to it."
"From the very beginning, the European Commission has made its contribution with conviction, a fact that I believe the committee chairman, Mr Coelho, can corroborate."
"It assisted and vigorously supported the request from the temporary committee to obtain the Eurocontrol data, which, as emerges from the report, have provided some of the most important evidence for identifying certain facts."
"I also strongly supported requests from the temporary Parliamentary committee for access to European Agency satellite photos."
"Together with colleagues from the Council, we worked to ensure that the request was dealt with rapidly and I think that this was a useful contribution to the first phase of the temporary committee’s work."
"Furthermore, I have tried three times to impress on the Ministers of Home Affairs in the Member States the importance of collaborating with the European Parliament temporary committee and with the Council of Europe, in other words of ensuring that enquiries and national checks make progress in countries where this has not yet happened."
"I can tell you in advance that at the next Council of Ministers on 24 July, the first to be held under the Finnish Presidency, I will repeat my invitation to the Ministers of Home Affairs in the 25 Member States to continue to collaborate with the temporary Parliamentary committee."
"I acknowledge and agree that the European Parliament temporary committee does not claim to be a sort of ‘European super-court’ and this is a very important factor in identifying institutional responsibilities."
"However, I maintain that the items indicated in the report are useful tools that must be assessed in detail."
"Some elements have already been assessed because they were already available to the many national judicial authorities involved in enquiries, some of them highly detailed, that started a long time ago."
"I think that now, in the light of the data contained in this report, national authorities can and must proceed to such checks with greater conviction, including in cases in which they have not yet been carried out; that they must do so with full guarantees of due process, which are in fact the guarantees of the rule of law, full rights for victims, to whom you too have listened to some extent, and for those accused, and to provide proof of the events, until a judgment determines when and if there is liability for specific events."
"This is the result that, I am sure, we all hope for: to find out at last the full and satisfactory truth on these charges."
"I think that it is important that we await the decisions to be taken by judges in the Member States with confidence."
"I would like to express a final thought on future prospects, which seem to me to be just as interesting."
"I want to reflect on the reform of the so-called secret services, a reform that comes under national competences, but which I think could benefit from broader debate."
"We could, for example, reflect on whether the rules of transparency, in terms of relations with Parliament’s bodies, can be improved at national level; whether the coordination of the activity of the services in each Member State should, as I believe it should, provide for more direct responsibility on the part of the heads of government of the respective countries; whether there should be some sort of national parliamentary control over the financial resources of the secret services – since everyone knows that where there is control of financial resources, one can have a significant effect on operating activity."
"Finally I quote the reference in the report to the need to define new rules on non-commercial aviation, including by civil aircraft, with a definition of ‘State aircraft’ or ‘used for State business’."
"I can tell you now that, in this respect, the Commission is ready to discuss this with the temporary committee in the next work period, since finding a European definition, for example for ‘State aircraft’, could be a step forward in this area, which, as you know, is currently insufficiently covered by national legislation."
"I therefore confirm my commitment to collaborating with the chairman and the members of the temporary committee."
"Thank you."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I had hoped that Mr Fava would not mention today’s news from Italy, but, seeing that he has, in my capacity as an Italian Member of this Parliament, and not as the coordinator of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to say that today Osama Bin Laden must be laughing his head off because, in my country, instead of arresting terrorists, they concentrate on arresting their captors."
"As regards the report, I believe, Mr President, that it is not sufficient for the rapporteur to say that he can accept some of our amendments."
"It is a highly tendentious report, which takes into consideration only those points of view critical of the United States."
"Two examples: until now they have refused to insert two statements by Mr Solana and Mr de Vries because they both said things that were not to the liking of the committee and that were not satisfactory to the Left; they declared that they had no knowledge of any breach of the law by European Member States in their cooperation with the CIA."
"Now, as a great concession, it appears that they are ready to accept it."
"However, they refuse to accept another statement because it goes against the so-called truth that the committee is trying to impose on us; that is the statement made by an expert from Human Rights Watch which as we know, is definitely not an organisation that is in favour of the Bush Administration to our committee: ‘we have our suspicions, but no proof.’"
"We all know that the Americans have made mistakes, for which they must be criticised or even condemned, but they have made mistakes because they are doing something."
"I would have been pleased to see in this report recognition of the fact that, if today we are meeting to discuss the CIA problem, it is thanks to the US press, the US Congress and the US people and not thanks to the report writers."
"There is no trace of this in the report."
"For all these reasons, we remain extremely critical, not to mention disappointed, in this report."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with the warmest congratulations to our rapporteur Mr Fava on his excellent interim report, and the reason why I call it that is that we are less than halfway through our work."
"Let me emphasise and clarify at this point that nobody in our group is against the idea that we should join together in fighting international terrorism."
"Quite the contrary: but we do take the view that we can no longer do this using the same weapons as the terrorists, but only by lawful means and in accordance with the ethical and moral principles on which our community of values, the European Union, is founded, on which we insist wherever we go in the world and in which we can also take pride."
"It is surely not acceptable that people should be abducted from EU territory or from states that are desirous of joining our Community, flown halfway round the globe and tortured in prisons in such places as Kabul, which has been shown to be what happened to Khaled El-Masri, himself a German citizen."
"The fact is that this is where the end does not justify the means, and that is what must come between us and the approach adopted by the Bush administration and the CIA."
"When we express criticism of such goings-on, that has nothing – nothing whatever – to do with anti-Americanism; on the contrary, it is our duty to do so."
"We also find ourselves facing the question that the governments in the EU must answer, namely that as to precisely what a secret service – which is what the CIA is, albeit one from a friendly state – is permitted to do on our soil, and in what manner it may act."
"After all, this is not something to which the country of origin principle can apply."
"The Member States of the EU, and also the countries that seek to become such must also make it clear that action may be taken against a person suspected of terrorism only by way of proceedings in accordance with the rule of law."
"How else, then, do the EU Member States think they can cooperate with such institutions as the European Parliament and the Council of Europe?"
"This is a question that the government of FYROM in Skopje has to face up to as well, for we really do not take kindly to being lied to."
"I am glad, though, that the German foreign minister Mr Steinmeier has not hesitated to confirm that he will be coming to meet our committee;"
"I have to say that we also expect other prominent figures to do likewise."
"It is not our function to carry out investigations with the exact attention to detail of a state prosecutor and eventually produce a statement of facts and a charge sheet; what we must do is to make it clear to the citizens of the European Union, once our work is done, what, to our knowledge, has taken place and what political conclusions should be drawn from it in order that we may continue to hold fast to our values and principles, and to demonstrate the European Union’s readiness to defend and guarantee freedom, security and democracy."
"It appears, though, that there are some in the House who have not yet even begun to grasp what that might mean."
". Mr President, I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Fava, for his excellent work and his cooperation with us."
"I would also like to thank Mr Coelho for his assiduous and steady chairmanship."
"The area of justice and human rights in the EU is not working effectively."
"On the one hand, some Member States have not implemented EU anti-terrorism laws passed five years ago, so we are not equipped throughout the EU to investigate and prosecute terrorist offences."
"In some Member States there is not even a definition of terrorism, so terrorists can escape conviction and imprisonment."
"Mr Fava recalled the London bombings, which we will sadly remember on Friday; we also remember the Madrid bombings."
"If the same thing happened in some of our national capitals, there would be no prospect of terrorists being convicted."
"I hope Mr Gawronski and his friends are knocking on the doors of those national capitals which have not implemented the framework decision on terrorism."
"At the same time it is apparent on the basis of credible indications that gross human rights abuses have taken place in the name of fighting terrorism – the so-called war on terror."
"The EU has allowed a situation to develop where we cannot prosecute terrorists, but we can persecute terrorist suspects and deprive them of their rights."
"What credibility does this give the EU at home or abroad, either for effectively combating terrorism or for upholding human rights?"
"Let us be clear: what we are saying in this report is that we have heard testimony and seen corroborating facts, such as flight logs, which attest to extraordinary renditions having taken place in Europe, and it is highly implausible that governments or their agencies had no idea what was going on."
"We have not implied we are a court or we have the powers of an investigating police officer or prosecutor, but we have done enough in cooperation and in complementarity with Dick Marty in the Council of Europe, with national MPs and judicial inquiries, to shift the burden of proof."
"Once allegations are no longer speculative but are shown to be credible, as is the case, then under European and international human rights instruments Member States have a positive obligation to investigate and to punish anyone responsible for human rights abuses."
"I hope that in private the Presidency is saying something different to its 24 EU government colleagues than it is saying here."
"I hope it is saying this conspiracy of silence must stop."
"To say, as the Minister did, that the Treaties do not give the EU any powers is untrue."
"If that is the case, then why did governments unanimously insert the human rights clause into the EU Treaty and a clause, Article 7, which provides for sanctions for breach?"
"It is true that we lack the monitoring mechanisms to connect the obligation to the powers and that needs to be filled in."
"It is pathetic that Javier Solana and Gijs de Vries are obliged to come to us and say, ‘we do not believe there have been any violations, but we do not have the competence to ask Member States the relevant questions’."
"I am quite happy to accept Mr Gawronski’s amendment in this connection, since it shows up the ludicrous nature of the gap in competence."
"I am not reproaching them, but I am accusing the Council and Member States of being guilty of creating a lot of hot air and rhetoric about the EU as a beacon of human rights without delivering the results."
"If you want our citizens to relate to the EU, I give you a cause worth championing."
". – Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin with warm thanks for the outstanding work done by our rapporteur Mr Fava and also for that done by Mr Coelho, the Chairman of our Committee, although I would also, while I am on the subject, like to include in that expression of thanks Senator Dick Marty and Mr Terry Davis for the excellent cooperation with the Council of Europe and its Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights."
"I believe that this cooperation between the Council of Europe and the European Parliament points the way for future cooperation in the defence of human rights."
"Let me begin with a general observation."
"There are legal ways of handing prisoners over to foreign authorities."
"The transfers that this committee has had to consider amount to something more than the transport of a suspect from one location to another, for the practice that we have had to consider, far from being provided for in relevant legislation, actually circumvents the principles we sum up under the heading of the rule of law, namely the right to appropriate legal representation and to proper legal proceedings in court, and it is no more consistent with the stipulation that nobody may be extradited or taken to a state in which he would be exposed to the risk of being tortured or subjected to any other inhumane treatment."
"Most of the victims of these transfers were illegally arrested from the very outset, some of them having been abducted, and all of them were taken from one country to another in an unlawful manner."
"Many of them have since disappeared."
"Those victims who testified to our committee spoke of torture and other inhumane treatment."
"In the final analysis, it can be said that this practice was intended to ‘outsource’ torture and make it more difficult to establish where the responsibility for the violation of human rights lay."
"There are many who say that it cannot be determined with any precision how many people in total were arrested, abducted and taken to other countries, and they may be right, but, by the very same token, it is also true that we can regard enough instances in which human rights were violated as proven, and about these the report has things to say in very blunt terms."
"The Chicago Convention allows private flights throughout European airspace without the need for further permission; the CIA exploited this by deliberately declaring its flights to be private, while many states – among them Member States of the European Union – acted on the basis of the Chicago Convention in letting the CIA do whatever they wanted."
"In so doing, these states disregarded other provisions of this Convention that gave them the right to search aircraft where there were reasonable grounds for suspicion that the plane was being used for illegal purposes."
"The Member States of the European Union are bound by various international treaties, in particular – as made quite plain in Article 6 – by the European Convention on Human Rights."
"The European Court of Human Rights has repeatedly emphasised that every state is under a positive obligation to intervene, investigate, and take legal action against the persons responsible, whenever people need to be protected from torture and other forms of inhumane treatment."
"It is perfectly clear that there were many Member States of the European Union in which this was not done."
"Italy has recently done what the law requires of it, and for that it deserves gratitude and respect, but I also – and I believe that I am speaking for the majority in this House when I say this – expect other countries to follow its example."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank my colleagues, Mr Fava and Mr Coelho, for the work carried out in this committee and for the fact that this work has shown us that extraordinary rendition is part of a mistaken strategy employed in the name of the fight against terrorism."
"It is a mistaken strategy because it is based on the theory of pre-emptive war and on the erosion of the rule of law."
"Rather than weakening terrorism, this strategy has fed and radicalised it, thereby contributing to the achievement of the very objectives set by the terrorists."
"Just a few days ago, following its Guantánamo judgment, the Supreme Court of the United States told us that, between 2001 and 2003, more than half of the prisoners in Guantánamo were taken there from Afghanistan, which means that Europe was the place of transit for over two hundred prisoners, European airports were used for stopovers, and US and NATO bases in Europe were used as outposts."
"Our committee has also ascertained that there is no doubt that there have been abductions, including the obvious case of Abu Omar."
"We have investigated the facts in great detail and have ascertained that, as John Bellinger and Condoleezza Rice have said, US intelligence activity has been carried out with the involvement of national governments."
"John Bellinger and Condoleezza Rice have explicitly stated that there has been no breach of national sovereignty."
"This should also be mentioned, Mr Gawronski, not just extracts from Mr Sifton’s speeches."
"I think it has emerged beyond a shadow of a doubt that European governments have aided and abetted the actions of US Intelligence on European territory."
"An Italian policeman has confessed and today the deputy head of the Sismi, the Italian intelligence service, has been arrested."
"I think that we need further clarification."
"The head of the Italian intelligence service, Dr Pollari, either lied to our committee or did not know about the activities of his deputy; each possibility is equally serious."
"The same applies to Commissioner Frattini, who should clarify this point."
"At the time of the events, Commissioner Frattini was Minister for Foreign Affairs, so either he did not know, as he told the committee, or he was unaware of the agreements ..."
"."
"Mr President, I urge greater moderation in the tone of this report."
"It makes too much use of the language of certainty and fact in places where suspicion and doubt would be more appropriate."
"According to the previous report of the Council of Europe, we are dealing with a dozen such cases of rendition, affecting some 17 people."
"Not all of these cases are blatantly breaches of international law."
"Mr Arar, for example, was handed over by order of an immigration court, so he hardly qualifies for inclusion in the group of extraordinary renditions."
"Until we know the exact extent of the phenomenon, we have no authority to make the assertion contained in paragraph 6 of the report, which states that serious and inadmissible violations of fundamental rights have taken place on several occasions."
"The US Government interprets the Convention against Torture differently, which is its right."
"The committee on this convention has not questioned this interpretation, which is backed by many years of practice, a Senate decision and Supreme Court judgments."
"I would like to see the report give space to a broader description of the context of the matter in order to avoid caricaturisation along the lines of ‘European Union good, America bad’."
"We should underline the key role of the fight against terrorism in world security, and the positive results of collaboration between European and US security services."
"In confronting terrorism, Europe and America are sometimes forced to step into a legal void."
"Europe wants to treat terrorists like criminals who should be given defence lawyers and all the rights of due process."
"The American practice is closer to the traditions of military rule, which in my view is more suited to these circumstances, but which leads to legal acrobatics."
"If we want to avoid such disputes and conflicts between Europe and the US, we have to add new regulations to international law."
"Without the amendments proposed by Mr Gawronski and myself, the report is not worthy of support in tomorrow’s vote."
"."
"Mr President, the Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners appointed for four months by the European Parliament has failed to fulfil its brief."
"In all its work to date it has not succeeded in acquiring a single item, and I stress, a single item, of previously unknown information."
"As a result the committee’s report presented here today is nothing but another piece of uncorroborated media information."
"There is nothing to indicate that extending the committee’s mandate will bring any concrete facts to light."
"It does not have the tools for activities of this type."
"Why should we carry on wasting taxpayers’ money to prolong its existence?"
"Why support a committee that is toothless?"
"There are no rational grounds for doing so."
"Any extension of the committee’s mandate would be for political and propaganda purposes."
"Its activities are in any case already being used by the socialists and liberals for their own ends."
"They will use any pretext to attack the United States and its European allies."
"In this way they seriously undermine the only common front that has been created in the fight against the exceptionally grave threat of terrorism."
"This should not really come as any surprise to us."
"Historically, ever since the turn of the last century, the socialists themselves resorted to acts that today would be regarded as terrorist acts."
"Sympathy for such political methods persists, even in this House."
"It is no coincidence that the lines of division on this report are based not on its merits, or even on nationality, but on ideology."
"It is fundamentally a division between socialists and conservatives."
"In deciding to terminate the work of the Temporary Committee we will be doing a great service to the societies of our countries, and that is what I appeal for."
"Mr President, our interim committee has failed to pin anything on the CIA in terms of its involvement in torture or associated illegal activities here in Europe."
"Suspicions, indications or even insinuations are all we had to go on."
"Some Left-wing Members of this House wanted to take advantage of the activities of the interim committee to indulge in cheap anti-Americanism, of which this biased report is a manifestation."
"Moreover, the way in which the committee has worked to date has raised a few questions."
"Witnesses were sometimes accompanied by lawyers who ensured that difficult questions remained unanswered."
"On more than one occasion, the vagueness of those involved meant that we were unable to gain a clear picture of the facts with which they were charged, or of their political background for that matter."
"Other people who appeared before the committee, including High Representative Javier Solana, were so predictably noncommittal that their input was a waste of time for everyone."
"If the inquiry is to continue, it would be preferable if it were to be conducted by the national bodies that competent in this area."
"– Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Frattini for his excellent work with our committee, and I hope the Council will follow his example in the second period of our work."
"I should first like to echo the words of Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, and say that this is an interim report."
"This document could not be accused of not containing the kind of conclusions found in a final report."
"I should also like to thank all the members of the committee that I chair and in particular the rapporteur Mr Fava for his high-quality, dedicated work in committee. I also wish to thank all of those who helped us."
"Thirdly, I wish to point out that in the hearings, there were 70 testimonies made, 50 hours of statements given, two foreign missions undertaken – one to the United States and one to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia – and thousands of documents analysed."
"As things stand, I feel that quite apart from the fact that the committee has justified its existence, illegal acts have taken place in Europe that need to be assessed in terms of their scale and the extent to which the Member States were involved. Furthermore, control of air space and airport facilities needs to be stepped up, the democratic control of the activities of the secret services should be strengthened, as Mr Frattini said, and the activities of foreign secret services on European soil needs to be more closely monitored."
"In adopting this report, we are asking the Board to put in place the conditions to discover the truth about what happened, and with the key amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats we are contributing towards a balanced, accurate and fair report. After all, we do not want this thorough, dedicated work to be mistaken for some kind of political propaganda."
"Mr President, 11 September this year will mark the fifth anniversary of the terrorist attack against America."
"A legitimate fight against terrorism goes hand-in-hand with reflection on the means used to conduct this fight, on the state of democracy, the rule of law and on civil liberties in situations where special services are given special authority and where general surveillance is carried out."
"A new kind of community is arising on both sides of the Atlantic – a community of lawyers, journalists and politicians from different sides of the political scene, activists from humanitarian organisations and citizens who are against the recent infringements of human rights and political and civic freedoms by some European governments and the US Government."
"Last week the Supreme Court in the USA pronounced the special military tribunals appointed by President Bush in November 2001 by way of a decree, bypassing Congress, as illegal and contrary to the Geneva Conventions and the American system of military courts."
"The ruling of the Supreme Court is proof that we are not condemned to a tragic choice between security and freedom."
"The Temporary Committee appointed by Parliament on 18 January this year has completed the first stage of its work."
"The interim report concludes that illegal practices affecting citizens and residents of Europe were carried out in Europe."
"I would like to underline that the committee’s report is by no means anti-American or ideological, and it is not aimed against any country or government."
"The report was based primarily on around 50 hours of hearings involving lawyers, journalists, representatives of non-governmental organisations, alleged victims of special rendition proceedings, representatives of the governments of the Member States and representatives of the European institutions."
"I would also like to stress that in its interim report the committee does not once mention the name ‘Poland’, unlike Dick Marty’s report before the Council of Europe in June this year."
"However, our report does assert the need to ascertain whether there is proof that secret prisons are operating in some European countries, as some journalists and bona-fide non-governmental organisations claimed in the course of the investigations."
"What is particularly worrying is, as Senator Marty’s report points out, Warsaw’s unwillingness to cooperate seriously with the European institutions."
"The Temporary Committee should now proceed with the rest of its 12-month mandate, during which it should make official visits to various countries, including Poland."
"Mr President, I would like first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Claudio Fava, and the team from the secretariat that has supported him in his wonderful work."
"Despite what may be gleaned from the brief speech by the representative of the Council, we do not look to Washington. We look to the European capitals."
"We look to the Council, in Brussels, waiting for it to commit itself to the truth which has not yet come, to explain to us the why and the how of what we now know."
"Because, just like archaeologists who gradually go on digging up small items through small excavations and then put all of that information together to produce a map of a city that had been hidden and the precise whereabouts of which nobody knew, the Commission, with the invaluable support of other people, of NGOs, in cooperation with the Council of Europe etc., has managed to draw up that map, to uncover and bring to light that hidden city, which is a plan designed for the systematic violation of the fundamental rights of the citizens on the theoretical premise of protecting our fundamental rights; we should protect our rights and our security by violating the rights of others."
"That is the approach our work has been taking."
"That is something that could not have happened without the active support or deliberate passivity of the Member States of the European Union."
"That is our conclusion."
"That is our moral conviction, and no one will be able to take it away from us, with or without votes."
"We are dealing with a great jigsaw puzzle in which it is not sufficient for any State to say that no crime has taken place on their territory, if it turns out, for example, that the role played by that State in this overall plan was to give logistical support to the aircraft so that the people taking part in this great drama could rest beforehand or afterwards."
"We are therefore still awaiting coherent explanations from the Council and the Member States so that we may know the truth and guarantee respect for the European Union's fundamental values, for which we are all supposed to be fighting."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate and praise the rapporteur, Mr Fava, and I would like once again to express our full support for his report's fundamental approach."
"In the hearings that we have held over recent months it has become clear that we cannot carry on talking about alleged practices, but rather we must discuss and analyse specific facts and call the relevant people to account, as other Members have also pointed out."
"As the report stresses, it seems extraordinary to us that the governments should not have known what was happening, and I would like once again to express my surprise at certain governments’ – including mine – repeated denials of facts that CIA officials themselves have demonstrated and acknowledged."
"The detention today in Italy is simply the tip of the iceberg, and we hope that everything else will come to light soon."
"I would insist that it is not a question of knowing whether these practices have occurred, but of who in Europe knew about them, and often collaborated in them, and also who, since they must have known about them, evaded their responsibilities."
"The report’s conclusion is clear: the work we are doing is necessary and must continue."
"It is true that we are neither investigators nor prosecutors; we have neither the power nor the means to carry out this action or these investigations, but we can ask the relevant question and raise important issues."
"In order to be able to do this work, the investigation must continue and I would therefore say once again that we must support this report."
"Mr President, the CIA – in the name of freedom and democracy – has abducted people, transported them, made them to disappear, and has not only caused them to be tortured but has also done the deed itself."
"If there was even one Member of this House who was not already speechless with fury, the hearing of Khaled El-Masri must have had that effect."
"What, though, did our governments do?"
"They did nothing."
"The El-Masri case was the subject of canteen gossip in Skopje;"
"German officials knew about it, but the German Government, no doubt for reasons of state, left Mr El-Masri to his fate."
"Let me put it bluntly: every government has the duty of protecting its citizens from the violation of their human rights by others; failure to do anything is a gross violation of human rights."
"Over and over again, evidence is demanded, yet, instead of obliging the government to produce it, such evidence is demanded from the victims."
"This is the line taken by right-wingers, not least those in the ranks of the conservatives in this House, but who is to be required to produce the evidence?"
"Mr Marty of the Council of Europe is quite right to say that it is a fundamental duty incumbent on governments to actively investigate all human rights violations that are committed on their territory or against their citizens."
"They have to demonstrate that their conduct has always been correct and that they have acted in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights and the fundamental values shared throughout the EU."
"That is why our committee cannot yet declare the case closed."
"We must not allow governments to bury their heads in the sand, and that is true whether we are talking about the government of my own country or the government of Macedonia, a candidate country that has tried to put one over on us."
"Mr President, I think everybody in this Parliament supports the fight against terrorism."
"Terrorists do not respect human life, they do not respect democracy and they do not respect human rights."
"We are all behind that fight, but it is the way we go about it that has to be debated and decided upon."
"The American Government has to realise that it must comply with the rule of law and well-established international conventions and practices in its effort to defeat international terrorism."
"Unfortunately, the USA has acted arbitrarily when it has sought to build political alliances on this matter through the structures of the United Nations."
"The strategies pursued by America in Iraq and in the broader Middle East in recent years have arguably generated a greater level of sympathy for terrorists."
"I am an Irish Member of this Parliament and we in Ireland know how terrorism builds and grows and how, by making the wrong decisions, governments can strengthen terrorist organisations."
"As an example, the IRA was almost defeated on a number of occasions, but wrong decisions were made and it won public sympathy and grew again."
"The way terrorism is defeated has to be looked at very carefully."
"The interim report before us today points to the undeniable fact that rendition flights have taken place in Europe."
"The American Government must bring this practice to an end if it is going to build EU-US transatlantic relations."
"If we are going to fight terrorism, we must all work together within the law."
"The committee still has much work to do and it is seeking support from Parliament to continue its work for a further six months."
"I hope that Parliament will give this committee the extra time it needs to bring its work to a conclusion."
"However, the American Government must implement new strategies if it is going to win the war against international terrorism."
"There are so many examples of how not to do it, but it is only through enlightened policies and through those of us who believe in democracy and human rights working together that terrorism can be fought and permanently eradicated."
"Mr President, since the outrages of 11 September 2001, the world has changed."
"On that day Islamic terrorists started a global war against Western civilisation, bringing us fear and death."
"In this Parliament, we cannot consider today’s fight against terrorism in isolation from those events."
"The fight against terrorism is a consequence of them, and human rights for terrorists should not compromise the effective protection of our families and societies."
"We should remember that the terrorists do not recognise any rights, treaties or conventions."
"I was concerned to see what went on behind the scenes when the so-called ‘CIA Committee’ was established."
"Unfortunately its appointment was purely political, with the aim of slurring countries who have actually been involved in fighting terrorism."
"As a member of the committee I can see that its activities are a ‘European witch-hunt’, where the witches being hunted are US allies in Europe, which is a reflection of the complexes and anti-Americanism of a number of Member States of the ‘old EU’."
"The call to battle was based on unconfirmed information from Amnesty International and press reports."
"By naming countries that allegedly infringe human rights, we are exposing them to the danger of reprisals and revenge attacks by terrorists."
"The committee’s report has neither divulged anything new, nor has it proved anything."
"In civilised countries verdicts are not issued without evidence, but the committee has taken upon itself to do so."
"Our report is based on hearsay and circumstantial evidence, but it makes judgments and even passes sentence with the burden on the accused of proving his innocence."
"In a normal system of law, it is guilt, and not innocence, that needs to be proved."
"The application to extend the work of the committee for another six months is a waste of taxpayers’ money."
"Let us forget about European anti-American bias, and let us join the real fight against terrorism."
"Mr President, we have had 50 hours of hearings and nothing to show for it."
"I sent a copy of Mr Fava’s report to a former staffer of mine, Sally McNamara, who is now the international relations director for a major Washington public policy institute, the American Legislative Exchange Council."
"I should like to quote her comments to you."
"She uses a vernacular word to describe the report and then says: ‘If I came up with this sort of report for my boss – devoid of fact and with a hefty dose of moral posturing – I reckon I would get fired’."
"I hope that our rapporteur will take note of these comments."
"His report is entirely speculative and circumstantial."
"It seeks to present unsubstantiated allegations as fact."
"Evidence of flights that have been linked to the CIA is not evidence of rendition, still less evidence of mistreatment."
"The committee started from an a priori belief that the USA and the CIA are guilty, and merely sought with little success to substantiate its prejudices."
"It has not established evidence, it has merely provided a platform for anti-American bias."
"Whether we like it or not, the war against terror is real and it is now. The US has taken a lead in this war."
"It has spent a huge amount of blood and treasure in the defence of Western values."
"We in this House should show a little more gratitude and a little less criticism."
"I agree with Mr Piotrowski."
"There is no point in extending the remit of this committee."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the defence of human rights, the maintenance of the fundamental freedoms that protect citizens and respect for our European legal systems are among the principles underpinning the European Union; accordingly, it was and is the function of the CIA Committee to examine whether the Member States had misapplied Community law."
"It is unfortunate that its interim report, which we now have before us, is as yet neither even-handed nor complete."
"I can live with the fact that the groups in this House attach different values to the statements made to the committee, but it is a fundamental requirement of any balanced report that it should include all statements, including those that do not tally with the committee's preconceived ideas."
"Completeness demands, then, that the statements by Mr Solana and Mr de Fries at their respective hearings to the effect that they were not aware of any breach of the law on the part of any Member State, be included in the report along with the fact that no evidence has been provided, to this day, of the existence of so-called secret prisons in the European Union."
"This report must also include the statement made by John Bellinger on behalf of the American administration; after all, the members of the committee had travelled specially to Washington to ask him the questions he answered."
"None of the things I have mentioned have as yet been included in the report, for the reason that the majority on the committee found them disagreeable;"
"I dare say that that is hardly commensurate with their task of seeking out facts and establishing the truth."
"The justified interest in the investigation of the accusations that have been made must not result in a one-sided approach to the assessment and evaluation of the facts."
"If this committee and this House are to have any credibility, then this interim report must reflect objectively all the information available to us; then – and only then – can we adopt this report by a large majority."
"Mr President, Mrs Lehtomäki, Mr Frattini, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to thank Mr Fava for all his work on the interim report and others for the excellent work they too have done."
"When Parliament and we in the Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners began our work, I for one did not have very high expectations of what we could achieve, as a lot of the alleged practices had taken place quite a few years ago."
"I have been pleasantly surprised, however."
"Our work has produced results aimed at making Europe safer and human rights more secure."
"For me as a Social Democrat MEP from Sweden and a proud witch, as someone chose to call us, I am particularly pleased that, on the issues of extraordinary rendition and diplomatic guarantees, we have now reached an agreement and that we are making clear the dividing lines between the fight against terrorism, a humane policy on refugees and respect for human rights, which are also in crisis following the terrorist acts of 11 September 2001 in New York."
"In this area, the expulsion from Sweden of the Egyptians Mohammed Al Zery and Ahmed Agiza following a decision by the Swedish Government have pointed to solutions of the kind we do not want to see any more of."
"The CIA’s solutions are unsustainable, both in the short and the long term and for both the EU and the rest of the world."
"The committee needs more time."
"We have learned from the mistakes that have been made and we shall propose measures and safety nets so that we do not end up in similar situations in the future."
"Europeans expect a better job to be made of sorting out future crises through cooperation between the Council of Europe, all the countries of Europe and ourselves in the European Parliament."
"Mr Frattini has some interesting thoughts on the security service, necessary future controls on aviation and getting the balance right in combating terrorism."
"Mr President, that side of the House still seems to be very sceptical about the evidence."
"To me, this is like a jigsaw puzzle that is nearing completion."
"Although there are still a few pieces missing, we get the general picture."
"As it is the Member States who must supply the missing pieces, it is a complete mystery to me why they should be so reluctant to provide the additional evidence."
"After all, it is Europe's moral leadership that is at stake here."
"Security and human rights are surely the European Union’s very ."
"If we allow these things to happen on European soil, we betray those who set out to achieve European integration."
"Moreover, the American method proves ineffective because terrorism appears to be a seven-headed monster."
"Each time a head is chopped off, another one appears soon after."
"The security policy we adopt here in Europe should therefore apply our own standards, our own methods and our own conditions."
"Finally, I think it is essential that we, as a matter of urgency, start a parliamentary dialogue with the Americans to discuss security and human rights and the way in which we can, together, on the basis of shared values, fight the monster of terrorism."
"Mr President, one of the issues we are supposed to be looking at is whether the European Union and our own Member States are the good guys in this."
"This is a question that we need to ask."
"In terms of facts and the political consequences that we should be drawing from this, it is almost irrelevant whether there have been two or three renditions as we were told in the US by the US Administration, or whether the facts unearthed so far reveal two or three renditions, or whether we have found more."
"We have discovered that Member States, even if they want to know what is going on, do not necessarily have the right or the mechanisms to find out, let alone the political will."
"We have been told by two of our own senior people that they do not have the right to pursue such issues."
"We have been told that the law is inadequate in this new era of greater threat."
"However, we also need to question whether we are using the law we have effectively and fairly in accordance with international human rights obligations."
"The issue is not just about the method – whether it is abduction or immigration problems – but also the outcome."
"There is an absolute prohibition on torture under international human rights instruments."
"Therefore, what do we make of the memoranda of understanding which are increasingly coming into play and have implications for other areas of EU policy?"
"These are some of the areas we should be looking at politically."
"This is another reason why we need the committee to continue."
"– Mr President, like Mr Dick Marty in the Council of Europe, Mr Fava has the courage to coordinate an investigation with a very clear objective: to establish the truth."
"Independently of the position of any particular State or Government, the truth must be established."
"At this point in the investigation it is clear that nobody can accept the idea that European governments knew nothing about this great overall plan of the US intelligence services."
"During this stage of the investigation, I would urge the governments of the European Union – all of them – to intensify their cooperation with the investigation being coordinated by Mr Fava."
"In this regard, I do not understand why the intelligence services of my country – Spain – have not yet been heard by this committee."
"I believe that, during the second phase of the investigation, it is essential that the director of the Spanish intelligence services appear in order to give all of the information he has, as he has done in the Spanish Congress of Deputies."
"I believe that we must support and encourage this investigation so that it can carry on to its conclusion, until the truth is fully established."
"Mr President, the report we are dealing with today is built on assumptions and allegations the truth of which the temporary committee has no authority and no tools to verify."
"Irrespective of the fact that Mr Javier Solana clearly stated to the committee that there was no evidence of the colourful stories we were being told, the report accuses EU governments both of violating human rights and of lying."
"What we are really dealing with are two different concepts of the war against terror: the European Parliament model, which believes in fighting terrorism with resolutions and dialogue and, on the other side, the model of the responsible governments, which want to monitor suspected persons, control transfers of illegal funds and, where necessary, arrest terrorists before they can act."
"There is one clear message to the terrorists in this report: have no fear of the European Parliament."
"We are your safe haven and we will never catch you."
"Mr President, it was entirely predictable that whatever the findings of this report, it would call for increased powers to be taken by the European Union and, indeed, we were not disappointed."
"It states that the rules of cooperation between national security services should be established at EU level, that effective parliamentary scrutiny of national intelligence services should be at European level and that the Commission should immediately legislate to harmonise laws on the surveillance of non-commercial civil aviation."
"There never seems to be an ill wind that cannot blow the European Union some good."
"The report and the minority opinion expressed agree that some illegal detentions and transportations may have taken place."
"However, it is unlikely that the real truth will ever be known."
"I have no time whatsoever for illegal detentions and transportations of citizens or of non-EU citizens."
"The existing legal means are draconian enough."
"In this morning’s , the leader of the UK’s Liberal Democrats, Sir Menzies Campbell, said that Britain’s extradition arrangements with the USA were a constitutional disgrace."
"Surprisingly for a lawyer, he does not seem to know that very similar arrangements exist with the European Union."
"Britain’s extradition arrangements under the European Arrest Warrant and under the similar and non-reciprocal arrangement with the USA amount to little better than the judicial kidnap of British citizens."
"Mr President, Mr Fava’s report is like a dried lemon – no matter how hard you squeeze it, hardly any juice comes out; even so, it is a better, more responsible and more restrained report than the one presented by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe."
"While their report is blatantly ideological, ours is more political;"
"Senator Marty’s report was based not on facts but on circumstantial evidence, but it still went much too far in accusations."
"We are right to say that fighting terrorism is a priority for the international community."
"We are also right in saying that the end does not justify the means, that you cannot violate human rights just in order to defeat terrorism, but the main thing is that we respect hard facts."
"We cannot build up an indictment against whole countries based simply on conjecture, suspicion, circumstantial evidence or hunches."
"This report is an element in the broader debate about relations between the EU and the USA, about boundaries for the legitimate fight against terrorism and about transatlantic cooperation."
"The report cannot be separated from the political context."
"We cannot pretend that in protecting human rights, we never use them as an ideological tool of anti-Americanism."
"I call upon the committee to complete its mandate within the original 12 months."
"If there is the will to do so, this autumn the committee will visit Poland and will be welcomed there, because Poland and the Polish people have nothing to hide."
"Mr President, this is an astonishing report."
"In it there is a yawning gap between the evidence collected and the opinions formulated by the committee."
"In the report, the committee makes extremely grave accusations, for example, that in Europe ‘inadmissible violations of fundamental human rights have taken place on several occasions’."
"On the other hand, it can only confirm exactly four cases of the procedure described as the illegal transfer of persons suspected of terrorism."
"Furthermore, the tone used by the committee varies: on the one hand, it speaks guardedly about some facts, such as in paragraph 12, for example: ‘all the work of the temporary committee so far seems to indicate that European airspace and airports have been used by CIA front companies’."
"On the other hand, it is categorical in making value judgments such as the one in the above-quoted paragraph 6, where it speaks of violations of fundamental human rights on several occasions, although the evidence gathered does not authorise it to make such statements."
"No evidence is provided anywhere of use of torture against the suspects, nor is any proof provided of the existence of detention centres in any country where suspects might be held – I mean within the European Union – and, in view of this, we should ask ourselves whether the four cases of rendition of terrorist suspects and several hundred flights by CIA aircraft – and they are something we knew about before the committee started its work – allow the committee to come to such radical conclusions."
"I get the impression that the committee is building its own virtual view of reality, and instead of taking the occasion to give EU citizens a view of reality is for some reason, undoubtedly political, putting forward its own virtual view as though it were real, and thereby misleading the citizens."
"This is poor practice, since it serves to undermine the authority of the European Parliament."
"If the committee carries on like this in the next phase of its work, the prestige of the European Parliament may end up like that of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe."
"Mr President, this debate would be amusing if it were not so serious."
"We can never justify the means we use to beat terrorism by claiming that the ends are noble."
"We cannot defend our values by abandoning them and I suspect that some of the people involved in today’s debate would much rather we abandoned our values just to prove themselves right."
"It is regrettable that, for party political reasons, some Members are not willing to recognise what everybody else sees, not just in this House but outside it."
"Illegal renditions by US agents have taken place."
"Some EU Member States’ services have colluded in those renditions, either passively or actively."
"The cross-referencing of witness statements and Eurocontrol records has established that some EU states have serious questions to answer and have so far refused to come clean."
"This inquiry must therefore continue."
"Parliamentary investigations are necessary, particularly in countries like my own, Ireland, where it has been established that 50 CIA flights have landed at Irish airports and that the aircraft used to transfer Abu Omar illegally from Italy to Egypt, via Germany, also landed at an Irish airport."
"We have good reason to believe that Abu Omar was in fact tortured in Egypt."
"So it is quite ridiculous for Members in this House to argue that this inquiry should not proceed."
"The Irish human rights body, a government-sponsored body, has called on the Irish Government to establish a legally enforceable regime of aircraft inspections, which at the moment does not exist."
"It has also called for a legally enforceable regime whereby diplomatic assurances from third countries can be challenged in law."
"The Irish Government has so far refused to do this."
"These are issues that need to be addressed and the Irish Government and its agencies need to be cross-examined by this committee, as, indeed, do many other Member States."
"Mr President, that this is an emotional debate, and is also being conducted in an emotional way, is something I can understand, but I have to say, in all honesty, that I am horrified by the lack of rationality in it."
"Accusing all these Members of being motivated by pure anti-Americanism, accusing others of having an ideological barrier in their heads, is to act like children in a sandpit squabbling over their buckets and spades."
"We need to get beyond that stage if we want to be able to produce a balanced and rational report."
"I can understand why some, for political reasons, might not share the view put across by the committee, and I can also understand why others might find the failure to share that view something worthy of scorn."
"On this occasion, of course, we have done no more than assemble circumstantial evidence rather than watertight proof, quite simply because no head of a secret service is going to come out and say, ‘Yes, of course, that’s how we did it."
"We abducted people illegally.’"
"There are people in this House who would probably not notice that they had been illegally abducted if they had been confined to an aircraft, been blindfolded and taken away, but that is irrelevant."
"There are many legal systems in which circumstantial evidence can be used as the basis of a trial, and there is circumstantial evidence that is so weighty that it virtually constitutes proof."
"This is a situation we have found ourselves in in a number of cases."
"Not everything will turn out to be the way some people, with their conspiracy theories, imagine it to be, but nor is the world as pink and pretty as those imagine who maintain that these things never happened at all, and so this committee has done valuable work in bringing to light at least the tip of an iceberg, for if we want to win the war on terrorism, we can do so only if we are credible, and we can be credible only if we keep to the rules that we lay down to others."
"What I would like to see, then, is for this committee to carry on doing what it is doing and come to an objective conclusion."
"I would, by the way, like to say something to the members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats: your counterparts in the Council of Europe voted to endorse Mr Marty's report, which, as we have just heard, goes even further than the report before this House, and so I find myself wondering how you will be able to justify it if you decide not to vote in favour of this one."
"– Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Fava and the Council of Europe rapporteur, Mr Dick Marty."
"The investigation to uncover this international parastate must proceed and be extended, despite the reactions of all those who wish to play down and cover up this scandal."
"I am truly sorry that some fellow Members in this House refuse to see the facts and the data and prefer the path of ideological fanaticism and prejudice, in contrast to their counterparts on the same wing in the Council of Europe."
"We have an obligation to seek the truth and we owe it to European citizens and the long tradition of democracy and humanitarianism on our continent."
"Moreover, experience over recent years has shown that infringements of human rights and shrinking democracy ultimately strengthen rather than combat terrorism."
"It is clear from the information that the heads of the secret services knew about the activities of US agents and possibly certain people in positions of responsibility in the governments knew and turned a blind eye."
"It is not possible for 32 aeroplanes to have made over one thousand flights over five years which no one knew anything about."
"Mr President, I would like to say at the outset that I am fully against flights of rendition."
"Such a practice is in breach of established international conventions such as the European Convention on Human Rights."
"From an Irish perspective, I am pleased that this report does not come up with any findings against the Irish Government, and this is in line with assurances given by the US authorities."
"I totally refute what my colleague Mr De Rossa said here today."
"It is unfounded to make allegations like that."
"Shannon Airport has been unreasonably treated in this regard and has been the loser, because it has now been decided by the American authorities not to use the airport for refuelling purposes, at a cost of EUR 10 million to the revenue of that airport."
"That is a result of the unfounded allegations that are being made by Mr De Rossa and others."
"They should establish the facts before they speak in such a manner."
"Mr President, torture is always wrong and counterproductive."
"The US-instigated torture rendition programme is particularly wrong because it makes acceptable a new model in that in the past torture was mainly committed by dictatorial regimes."
"Now it is being promoted by democratic states."
"If the malpractice of torture is not challenged and reversed, then international laws designed to protect all humanity will be permanently degraded."
"Closing Guantánamo is not the answer because many prisoners transferred will be tortured elsewhere."
"Many of the prisoners transferred in November 2005 from the European black site prisons are now in unknown black hole prisons elsewhere."
"The EU has a responsibility to ensure that these prisoners do not suffer further torture."
"The UN and the Red Cross should have compulsory access to all prisoners everywhere and the UN should have a daily-updated register of all prisoners in all UN member states."
"The EU and EU Member States should also provide more finance for the care of survivors of torture."
"Mr President, the false prophets protecting human and civil rights have multiplied recently."
"Many of them – and this is particularly unpalatable – come from the political formations which once were not put out in any way by communism, and which were accommodating and tolerant to the regimes that occupied half our continent for a great many years."
"Today these people are trying to create the impression that democracy’s greatest problem, the greatest problem facing human and civil rights, are not dramatic events that affect millions of people in places such as China, for example, but a few unregistered flights by US aircraft over Europe."
"This is something that should not be tolerated, and cannot go on."
"For that reason I firmly support the idea that this committee, which is regarded by some of its members as a mixture of anti-Americanism and the wish for political influence, be terminated, and that these people get to work in places where human and civil rights really are being violated – and unfortunately there are still too many of those countries in the world."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the committee’s great claim was that it was in the business of establishing fact, and it has made a credible job of it, with 26 hearings, a visit to the USA, and close cooperation with the Council of Europe and the Commission, not least here in this House, but has anything new emerged from all this?"
"One cannot avoid the conclusion that what it has come up with is quite negligible, and rightly too, for that only goes to show either that no offences were committed, or that those that were were isolated occurrences."
"I was, then, all the more astonished when I eventually came to read the report, which was one-sided, tendentious, and did not reflect that which was brought to light during the committee’s deliberations."
"I would like to ask those on the other side of the House why they refused, when it came to the vote in committee, to incorporate what Mr de Vries and Mr Solana actually found out, that being that there was no proof."
"Why, I ask you, did you refuse to incorporate a statement to the effect that no evidence could be found that secret prisons actually existed?"
"Why did you refuse to include what was said by Mr Bellinger in the USA?"
"Why did you refuse to include a reference to the fact that it had been established in the USA that that country had not made any use of torture?"
"Tomorrow will see the European People’s Party making another attempt to introduce balance into the report and to include in it the conclusions to which the committee actually came."
"The real test for you will be whether you will vote in favour of the facts and of what was actually said in the committee, whether you want to have broad majority support for this report, or whether you want to leave it as it is – one-sided, tendentious, and failing to set out the facts that actually emerged from the committee’s hearings."
"Mr President, this debate forms part of a wider discussion about the best way of fighting international terrorism."
"One thing that is paramount in this has also been clearly encapsulated in Mr Fava’s report, namely where he states that we can never win the battle against international terrorism if we sacrifice the very principles we seek to uphold in the fight against it."
"It is this, then, on which we have focussed."
"What are the indications that the CIA, or other security services, quite possibly without our governments’ knowledge, have taken action that contravenes the fundamental rights and freedoms?"
"To what extent has national and international law been violated in the process?"
"These are very serious questions that fully justify the investigation."
"We cannot cover up the questions that have been raised, because that would seriously harm public confidence at a time when we need all the confidence we can get in order to be able fight terrorism effectively, yet fairly, of course."
"The interim results of the investigation show the need to resume the investigation after the summer."
"There is no doubt that extraordinary renditions via European airports have taken place."
"It is highly likely that various European governments were aware of this practice and it is likely that European and international human rights agreements were violated in the process."
"Moreover, the investigation clearly showed up the serious loopholes in our legislation and in our monitoring practices."
"These activities took place in the twilight zone which we left open."
"Following on from the investigation, we will, then, need to concentrate on two things."
"Firstly, to what extent were Member States and candidate countries involved in this, and, secondly, what needs to be done in order to plug the loopholes in law and legislation in order to avoid this happening again?"
"Mr President, the evidence of a sinister spider’s web of CIA torture flights crisscrossing Europe is overwhelming."
"I have every confidence in stating that the CIA is directly responsible for the illegal seizure, removal, abduction and detention of people on the territory of Member States."
"It is through criminal intention, implicit approval and gross negligence that such large-scale human rights abuse has been permitted to take place."
"Either way, it is clear that security forces in some Member States are working outside the reach of proper and effective governmental control and scrutiny."
"Soon we will remember the victims of the London bombings."
"The UK response has been the adoption of shoot-to-kill policies on the basis of guidance from the security forces in the war on terror, which has seen an innocent man killed in my own country and another lucky to be alive."
"They, along with so many others, are also victims."
"Their only crime was to be visibly different from the majority."
"Governments have underlined the importance of leaving no stone unturned when justifying the intolerable suspension of civil liberties in the name of national security, rendering certain sections of our population subject to unrelenting, imbalanced scrutiny."
"This is where this House must step in for the good of all our citizens."
"Now it is time to focus due scrutiny on the actions of our security forces, reining them back to the fold of governmental control so that we can guarantee Community security for the whole of the European Union, preserving the rule of law and our democratic institutions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the practice used by the CIA that is the subject of today’s discussion is part of an established tradition in US administrations, from the War of Secession onwards, through the genocide of the American Indians, to connivance with the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia."
"The Fava report, substantiated by little evidence because of the obstacles put in the way of the committee by many EU governments, is not in itself sufficient to prove the political dependence of Europe."
"Nobody wants to protect terrorists and nobody wants to show out-and-out anti-Americanism, but we cannot help but acknowledge that there have been breaches of human rights and repeated violations of the sovereignty of Member States throughout the EU."
"Not to do so would play into the hands of anti-European interests."
"Mr President, the subject under discussion is of vital importance."
"After all, the way suspects are treated is, in effect, at the very heart of the values in which we in the EU share."
"It should, therefore, become clear, in the interest of the public and the European Union itself, what has, and has not, happened."
"I would, then, congratulate all those who have shown great commitment to the investigation, and who will take it further."
"I should nevertheless like to point out that there has been more hypothesis than proof to date."
"That is understandable to some degree, for we find ourselves in a tricky situation."
"If this proves anything, it is that Europe is not complete."
"Commissioners must be given more powers in the area of investigations and should be able to approach the Member States with a view to unearthing the truth."
"This House, which is quite powerless in comparison to the investigation methods of national parliaments, should also be given more powers where investigations are concerned."
"We should now make do, though, with the means that are at our disposal."
"We found the vote in committee unsatisfactory on the grounds that a number of sound amendments we had tabled were not adopted."
"What is at stake at the moment is finding out the truth and regaining confidence."
"I call on everyone to throw their full weight behind those amendments that narrow the gap between what has already been proven and what is being claimed."
"In particular, I would like to see a more realistic reflection of the number of cases in respect of which evidence has been gathered, of the remarks of the terrorism coordinator Mr De Vries, Mr Solana and Mr Bellinger and also the clear statement that no proof has as yet been found for the existence of secret prisons in Member States."
"I think that that would enhance the credibility of the Commission’s work and, with it, support in the plenary."
"It is up to our committee to continue the work, and that can go two ways."
"Either more proof will as yet be submitted and sound conclusions can be drawn, or no more proof will be submitted, in which case the conclusions should be toned down for the sake of integrity."
"The latter is not necessarily a bad conclusion."
"Mr President, those who have been defending this committee and are now also defending its report are often accused of anti-Americanism, but is the United States Supreme Court anti-American simply on the grounds that it insists on due process of law where Guantanamo Bay is concerned?"
"Are, indeed, all those in America who look to see whether the war on terror is being waged in accordance with legal principles to be described as anti-American?"
"No, I really do not believe that they can be!"
"Secondly, we are then told that we are undermining the war on terror."
"We are all in favour of the war on terror, but what it calls for is broad support, popular support, in Europe, so if we want to wage this war, we need support from the people, who have no less interest in the rule of law being upheld than we do."
"We must explicitly uphold the rule of law as an essential element in the European Union, and this is a point that Commissioner Frattini constantly, and rightly, makes."
"Thirdly, whom do you want to punish?"
"This should not be about punishing just anyone; let us be frank: in the aftermath of 11 September and that dreadful deed and the terrorist activities in America, we did perhaps take too relaxed an approach."
"It was believed in various European states that rapid action was called for and that we had to support the Americans, and that I can understand."
"Now, though, we have to get back to the rule of law, which is absolutely necessary if war is to be waged on terrorism with any success, and one of this committee’s essential objectives is to ensure that the war on terror can, in future, be waged effectively and in accordance with sound legal principles."
"Mr President, action against terrorism has eroded human rights and is eroding the protection of ordinary citizens’ privacy in Europe and outside it."
"A recent report on human rights produced by the International Helsinki Federation states that in the last three years the human rights situation has deteriorated globally."
"The EU must work on the basis that terrorism is to be opposed through legitimate means and in a way that respects both international and national law."
"Finally, I would like to quote my favourite American writer, Thomas L. Friedman, from his book ‘The World is Flat’:"
"The world is flat."
"America’s role in the world has been as the country that looks forwards, not back."
"One of the most dangerous things that has happened to America since 9/11 under the Bush administration is that the United States has gone from exporting hope to exporting fear."
"If that is true it is very dangerous."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the important purpose of the report that we are discussing is to establish the responsibility of individuals or organisations for possible offences committed in breach of human rights."
"This report, however, cannot and must not become an instrumental act of accusation against the United States and other countries involved in the front line in the fight against terrorism."
"The political purpose must never distort the truth out of contempt for the principles of law."
"As for the events in Italy, I would like to highlight a few points."
"In the first place, the Italian Government and the security services organisation have always stated, at all parliamentary sittings, that they had no connection whatsoever with the events leading to the capture of Abu Omar and so far nobody has been able to prove the contrary."
"I would also like to express my solidarity with Mr Frattini, who has been attacked by Mr Catania: any possible personal liability cannot involve the Institutions."
"Secondly, last Monday Abu Omar was again arrested in Cairo because he was considered a threat to the security of the Egyptian State."
"Third, the Milanese mosque in Viale Jenner, well-known even outside Italy because it has been involved in investigations into terrorism, today expressed satisfaction at the arrest of the two representatives of the military secret service."
"I am also astonished at the rapporteur’s one-sided defence of civil rights in this matter, where, in contradiction to European legal culture, arrest is conflated with conviction, a confusion that the rapporteur did not make, however, in the case of Abu Omar."
"Fourth, the magistrate who arrested the two directors of the Sismi at the same time ordered a search to be carried out at the headquarters of a daily newspaper and at the houses of two journalists who had dealt with the Abu Omar case."
"This was a flagrant breach of the freedom of the press, in particular because the procedure was directed against a newspaper that is highly critical of the government and involved in combating terrorism."
"Finally, it would be a good idea to remember that, in five years of centre-right government in Italy, there were no terrorist attacks, but rather many attempts were foiled."
"Many lives have been saved through the sacrifice of the police, the armed forces and the security services."
"Mr President, the setting up of our temporary committee has allowed us to ascertain beyond doubt that the CIA has indeed seized people on Union territory with a view to transporting them to countries where they could be interrogated."
"Laws exist to protect our citizens, but these practices are not acceptable in our democratic societies."
"We must send a clear message to the US administration: we are prepared to cooperate in the fight against terrorism but provided that the rule of law is adhered to."
"It is unacceptable for Member States of the European Union to turn a blind eye to intolerable violations of fundamental rights."
"That is why we urge national parliaments to take up this issue, in order to shed every possible light on what has really taken place on their territory."
"Finally, I am pleased with the work that our temporary committee has done and I congratulate our rapporteur most warmly on his high-quality and tireless work."
"Mr President, a great deal has already been said about the importance of values based on human rights."
"Respecting these values is the duty of all the institutions, countries and citizens of the European Union."
"One of these values, which arises from the European legal tradition, is the old principle of innocence until proved guilty."
"If we want this principle to be used with respect to persons accused of terrorism, we cannot give a negative example ourselves."
"In my view Mr Fava’s report was biased, and based primarily on doubt, conjecture and circumstantial evidence."
"The report confirms only two previously known facts, the Italian and the Swedish cases, which are already being dealt with by the relevant domestic authorities of these countries."
"In this situation, should our committee not concentrate on looking for legal solutions which would prevent any such misdeeds in the future?"
"Should we not work harder on proper legislation and the use of European air space, try and get the Member States to adopt legislation about common counter-terrorism measures, and monitor the Member States whose legislation does not include terrorism as a crime?"
"Only such action would provide legal protection for all those we suspect or may suspect of terrorism."
"We should ensure that the laws and procedures in the fight against terrorism, even in the area that is by nature kept secret, still provide sanctions and punish breaches of human rights and dignity."
"Secrecy should not mean illegality."
"However, Member States should themselves deal with punishing the guilty."
"Our committee does not have the competence or the authority to do so."
"How the governments of the Member States deal with the accusations levelled at them by public opinion, and how they collaborate with the committee, is another matter."
"For the Member States this is a test, a check how well their agencies comply with international treaties; if we do not implement this we will always be surrounded by the demons of suspicion and by accusations that are in many cases unfounded."
"Mr President, I am speaking in order to express my support for Mr Fava’s report, and I hope that he will receive the backing tomorrow to continue his investigation."
"The kidnappings of people and the so-called ‘CIA flights’ are horrendous and are something that Europe and this Parliament cannot tolerate."
"Thanks to the determination and rigour of the US press we know that at least 480 people are in the sinister prison at Guantánamo, with no legal guarantees."
"This is morally and legally monstrous."
"Some of those prisoners have passed through Europe under illegal detention; other kidnapped people have been released and have spoken to us here."
"There is no question that abhorrent activities are habitually taking place."
"This generation cannot and must not tolerate this situation, as some of our predecessors did by not facing up to the existence of death camps."
"Crimes against human rights cannot go unpunished, and must never be forgotten, as happened in the case of other flights by former dictatorships in Argentina and Chile."
"Certain governments, the Spanish and German Governments, for example, have offered to cooperate with the committee chaired by Mr Coelho, and that is something we should be grateful for."
"– The interim report before us today is the fruit of the work of a committee that unfortunately opted to make up for a lack of investigatory powers by pulling out all the stops to issue political judgment on the activities of the USA’s allies in Europe."
"Six months of work in the committee has revealed nothing that had not already appeared in the media."
"It irks me that the majority of the committee has drawn subjective, distorted conclusions from a few facts and from a huge number of unsubstantiated rumours."
"I fear that the committee’s irresponsible approach may lead not only to Parliament’s credibility being eroded, but also to trust between the European and US allies being damaged."
"This trust is key to winning the fight against terrorism, to ensuring the security of the transatlantic area and to guaranteeing the stability of international relations as a whole."
"I want to emphasise that the fight against terrorism must be pursued in compliance with international law and with respect for human rights."
"At the same time, however, it is wrong to present a series of mistakes that may have occurred in the context of complex global anti–terror operations as a systemic problem."
"If there are suspicions that human rights have been violated in EU countries, they should be investigated by the judicial systems of the Member States."
"Rather than unsubstantiated denunciations of the US secret services, the EU’s political authorities should be focusing on how to prevent terrorism effectively and how to meet their responsibilities as regards world security, in close cooperation with the allies and in compliance with the fundamental principles of international law."
"I firmly believe, Mr President, that Parliament should take the opportunity to amend the report to ensure that our work is credible."
"Otherwise, I will have no option but to reject this temporary committee report, along with the entire Czech contingent from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which has agreed on this course of action."
"– The Martin and Fava reports confirm that a gang that does not care how it achieves its aims and disrespects the essential values of justice and human rights has infiltrated the Administration of our US ally and has managed to forge the active and passive complicity of our governments and state services in the practice of rape, kidnapping, torture, and other crimes against people suspected of acts of terror, but who have yet to have charges brought against them, let alone face trial."
"The US Supreme Court has recently said that in the prisons of Guantánamo and Kabul, where so-called unlawful combatants are festering, Washington is not only holding them unlawfully, it is keeping them in prison in breach of both US and international law."
"It is in breach of laws that have been used, and continue to be used to try and pass sentence on the most odious criminals, including the Nazis."
"When it accused the Bush Administration, the Supreme Court also accused European politicians and agents of appalling complicity."
"This committee of inquiry, led with professionalism by Mr Coelho and Mr Fava, can and should demand the parliamentary oversight of the Member States’ security services and detailed inspections of airport authorities in order to stop extraordinary rendition."
"This committee of inquiry will help to clarify how far and to what level of political authority Europe's complicity went."
"The courts can and must do justice, by compensating the innocent people who suffered and by punishing those who twisted rather than promoted the rule of law, and who, worse still, by violating the law and human rights were failing to serve Europe’s security and defence; instead, they were sinking to the terrorists’ level."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I very much welcomed the European Parliament's decision to set up a temporary committee to look into alleged abductions of prisoners and violations of their human rights."
"I joined the inquiry with great interest and enthusiasm."
"I have participated in the vast majority of hearings held by the committee to date, and I have listened with interest to everything the relevant invited guests had to say."
"While it was our objective to establish whether the CIA had been using unlawful means in fighting terrorism, unlike a court of law we were not able to interview witnesses under oath."
"The key was to ascertain whether the persons detained had been subjected to torture during interrogations and moved to third countries against their will."
"I must point out, however, that the testimony given by the witnesses was fairly unconvincing."
"Sometimes they would even testify indirectly, and sometimes it would be a lawyer speaking."
"On yet another occasion a British diplomat testified, barely concealing his resentment against the UK Government for dismissing him from the diplomatic service."
"Nor did Senator Marty persuade me, as his replies were no better than news reports and unable to prove anything apart from suspicions."
"I believe that he went too far in attacking the Polish Government despite the fact the Polish authorities have repeatedly indicated that they were unable to prove the existence of detention facilities in their country."
"As an MEP from one of the new Member States, I am primarily interested in the human rights and justice dimension; hence, I wanted to know whether my country has hosted any such illegal facility."
"I was therefore pleased to learn from the relevant authorities, including the government, justice minister and director of the intelligence service that they could not confirm that any such facilities had been set up in Slovakia or that there had been any secret CIA flights to or over Slovakia."
"In the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats we take a critical view of the approach adopted by the rapporteur, who likes to interpret suspicions as hard evidence."
"One cannot avoid forming the impression (and I am about to wind up my speech) that in the course of committee deliberations the left-wing MEPs have abandoned fact-finding in favour of maligning the United States, the country that has taken the lead in fighting terrorism."
"Unless the left accepts realistic amendments that contribute significantly towards establishing the truth, I will have to consider whether I can support the report in its current form."
"– Mr President, we usually say, if you want to find the crime, follow the money."
"In this particular instance, you have to follow the aeroplanes."
"Over recent months a series of apparently innocent flights between Europe and the USA has highlighted the huge issues which arise when you try to combat terrorism while ignoring fundamental rights."
"In the first instance, of abductions by the CIA, over 1 000 secret service flights landed at and took off from European airports, but were not subject to the slightest check by the competent European authorities which, even if they did not cooperate directly with them, opted for the 'see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing' approach."
"In the second instance, in a rare case of hasty cooperation between governments at European level, an agreement riddled with holes was signed with the USA, known as the transfer of Passenger Name Records or PNR, not only without adequate proof of the need for the measures, but also with barely any fundamental safeguarding of binding American obligations for the secure and legal use of our data."
"The European governments are today directly obliged, both individually and in cooperation with each other, to take all the necessary measures which will ensure that illegal CIA flights are not repeated."
"This requires explicit instructions to their civil aviation authorities so that at least the aeroplanes which we know were CIA aeroplanes and at least the front companies that we know were CIA companies are controlled from now on together, of course, with more efficient and democratic controls of their secret services."
"I thank you and, on behalf of all of us, I especially thank the rapporteur, Mr Fava, on his excellent work."
"Mr President, time and again this Chamber has condemned terrorists and therefore it is needless to extend the rhetoric on this horrible phenomenon."
"I shall just say that we cannot forget the tragedy of September 11; we cannot forget the London bloodshed; we cannot forget the Madrid massacre."
"We cannot, of course, ignore the fact that the USA is the central target of terrorism and we cannot underestimate the fact that the main task of combating terrorism falls on its shoulders."
"However, at the same time, we cannot forget that human rights are a cornerstone of modern European political philosophy."
"Therefore, despite our understanding of the USA’s role in combating terrorism, we cannot shut our eyes to certain activities that are contrary to European principles, values and rules."
"It is a fact that the CIA abused the understanding of certain countries."
"We condemn the practices of the CIA."
"We strongly condemn the CIA for the acts referred to by previous speakers and in Mr Fava’s report: extraordinary renditions, suspicious flights."
"We do the Americans no service if we leave the right of criticism of the CIA for acts committed in violation of human rights to those who are passionately anti-American."
"I agree with Mr Coelho, Chairman of the Temporary Committee, that in general Mr Fava’s report is good."
"However, it could be made more balanced if amendments stressing the other side of the coin were accepted."
"I appeal therefore to the rapporteur and to the other political groups to accept certain basic amendments proposed by Mr Gawronski, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, so that this House votes unanimously on two main points: firstly on the condemnation of terrorists and secondly on the protection of human rights."
"Mr President, as the final speaker from the Socialist Group, I would like to commend not only my previous colleagues and the rapporteur, but also the balanced approach we heard from Mr Coelho and the interesting comments by the Commissioner on greater transparency and reform of the intelligence services."
"It is for all those reasons that we must extend this report."
"People opposite have talked about circumstantial evidence."
"They must understand that we called on the testimony of 70 people and spent over 50 hours in this committee, not because we are anti-American — and I commend our rapporteur for never, ever, falling into that trap — but because we wanted to get to the truth."
"The previous speaker spoke about 7/7 and London."
"There are one or two Members in this Chamber who represent the area affected by that bombing."
"The people who have written to us are not anti-American; they want anti-terrorism to be strengthened because human rights are being strengthened."
"That is the approach of my Socialist colleagues and of many Members across this House."
"Why should we continue?"
"We should continue because of the testimony of people like Maher Arar, whom I listened to and believed."
"Do I know that he is telling the final truth?"
"No, I do not, because we are waiting for the Member States and for those who have not spoken to finally speak."
"That is why we need to extend this report and to extend the time we have."
"Why else do we need to extend the time?"
"We are telling European citizens that we will talk about the minute legislative detail, but are we also telling them that, when they are concerned about transparency and human rights and allegations they know very little about, we as a Parliament cannot deal with that?"
"We have to tell them we can deal with the issue credibly."
"We see it happening in the Council of Europe, and they should also see it happening in their Parliament."
"On our side of the House, we want to see the report extended, because we believe we have the right approach."
"Mr President, unlike Mr Moraes I was opposed from the very start to the Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners, and it should stop right now in its tracks."
"It is an expensive exercise, duplicating Senator Marty’s efforts in the Council of Europe, and one driven by a political desire by the left and liberals to bash America, and the CIA in particular, in their efforts to fight global terrorism."
"I believe that the Fava report is heavy on allegations and accusations, but light on proof."
"In a hazardous project as widespread in the west as fighting terrorism, inevitably some mistakes and excesses may have occurred, but in my opinion there was no systematic US policy for extraordinary renditions to torture abductees in third countries."
"Furthermore, there is no proof whatsoever of the existence of CIA detention camps in Romania or Poland."
"Simple renditions of illegal combatant terrorist suspects through EU territory are a proven fact, but not necessarily illegal under international law where torture is not involved."
"In any case, I agree with Alan Dershowitz, Harvard Professor of Law, when he argues that there exists a vast black hole in international law as regards combating terrorism, with categorisation of detainees anachronistic and the rules governing how such detainees are treated currently dangerously blurred."
"I believe that he is correct in arguing that many of us tend to stick with comfortable old ways, rather than addressing the difficult adjustments to the law that we may need to make vis-à-vis the balance we have to strike between human rights and the security of our public."
"Furthermore, a recent visit to Guantánamo by MEP colleagues from this House vindicated my long-held view that immediate, as opposed to long-term, closure of Guantánamo is not desirable, as many of those held there are extremely dangerous threats to our EU Member States’ national security and it is not possible to deport these individuals, as many might face execution or torture if returned to their home countries like Saudi Arabia or Egypt, where they are well known and wanted as known terrorists."
"Mr President, the so-called ‘CIA flights’ really have got Europe’s political class seriously rattled."
"The elucidation of the circumstances under which, in various European states, suspects were alleged to have been seized and their rendition organised, is still patchy, and that may well be because there is in fact less to bring to light than some particularly zealous persons who are critical of America or hostile to it had hoped."
"Let me say something fundamental about what has been going on over the past few weeks: Europe in general and we in this House too should not, in a difficult time like this one, be dissipating our energies with enterprises the ultimate motivation behind which is the need of certain persons to distance themselves from the United States."
"We still have no certainty of eventually getting the Constitution in place."
"There are complicated issues concerning the enlargement of the Union, our common identity and the limits of the European project that we have to address."
"As regards all these issues, there are far fewer proposals for solutions on the table than the development of Europe could do with."
"With things as they are, it strikes me as reflecting a rather idiosyncratic scheme of priorities for all the European institutions to devote their attention to CIA flights up to the point where the main thing we know is that we know nothing."
"Europe has more serious problems to deal with than the question of whether someone or other was flown somewhere or other from one Member State of the EU or another – or was not, as the case may be."
"If we want ourselves to be taken seriously, then we should dissolve this superfluous committee at once and, in short order, move on to thinking more about ourselves than about the possible misdeeds of a state that is our strongest ally and will – I hope – remain so in future."
"It is with all these considerations in mind that I will be voting against the anti-American resolution with which we have been presented."
"Mr President, six months ago we set up a temporary committee to investigate allegations of extraordinary rendition flights by the CIA and the involvement of EU countries."
"There have been many hours of hearings and debates in the committee since then and now we have our first interim report."
"An honest assessment of the committee’s work to date would give a mixed picture, I believe."
"On the one hand there has been a certain level of frustration that new evidence and facts have not been forthcoming in most of our hearings."
"However, that said, I believe that the committee’s work has been useful in outlining and exposing all of the facts that are available to date, and certain facts are available."
"Even if we are reconsidering evidence already exposed by the Council of Europe, we need to be realistic."
"Our committee is not a court of law; we are politicians attempting to draw conclusions based on the balance of probability, given the evidence available."
"Investigating the activities of the CIA or any secret services was never going to be a straightforward exercise."
"I believe that the report should have given more recognition to the fact that more evidence is needed to draw definitive conclusions in regard to certain issues, such as the possible existence of ‘black sites’ in EU Member States."
"It is unfortunate that the debate on whether or not to support this report has been reduced by some to a polarising of positions, a pro- and anti-US stance, or even a left versus right divide."
"I am sorry that view has developed as it undermines the work of a well-intentioned committee and misses the point as regards what we are trying to achieve."
"It is not anti-American to criticise extraordinary rendition or to push to establish facts, particularly if there are accusations against EU Member States in this regard."
"I would consider myself a hypocrite as a human rights spokesperson if I did not speak out against extraordinary rendition, even if it means criticising and asking awkward questions of governments that I consider to be our friends and allies. I include the US in that."
"No approach to the necessary and difficult war on terrorism should be supported if it involves acting outside the rule of international law and the various standards that we, in Europe, stand up for."
"The interim report is not a perfect one, but the acceptance of PPE-DE amendments will add balance to a text worth supporting."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Members who have spoken; their speeches have given me many useful ideas."
"I can confirm that the European Commission is ready to continue working with this Parliament’s temporary committee on the many fundamental issues that have been addressed."
"Mrs Ludford has touched on the theme of the implementation of anti-terrorism legislation by Member States, a central issue on which we certainly need to work."
"As you will know, unfortunately five EU Member States have not yet even transposed the European framework decision on combating terrorism; you also know that only seven out of the 25 States have ratified the Europe-United States agreement on extradition, an agreement which, if it were to come into force, would certainly clarify the legal framework precisely regarding the transfer of prisoners."
"Some speakers, such as Mr Swoboda and Mrs in't Veld, have mentioned the possibility and the need to work together for improved security and greater freedom."
"I totally agree and I welcome the proposal made for structured, political dialogue with the United States of America on the theme of the fight against terrorism, simultaneously with the theme of safeguarding freedom."
"I can tell you that I had already thought about this and as early as last February I suggested that this dialogue should begin at expert level, and it has now begun."
"I believe that this dialogue can proceed and I already know that the Finnish Presidency intends to move forward in this area."
"I think that it will be possible to exchange assessments with Parliament on the Europe-USA umbrella framework, on the fight against terrorism and on the guarantees of freedom."
"Furthermore, I believe that the Guantánamo judgment handed down by the US Supreme Court proves that the system for legally supervising guarantees and rights under the US democratic system does indeed function and provides a reassuring basis for our joint work."
"I am also ready for a dialogue with Parliament on the lines for restructuring the intelligence system, including democratic and parliamentary control of intelligence services; even though, as you know, national legislation alone is competent in this case, I think that a political debate on this subject would be useful."
"It will also be useful to discuss the use of airspace by non-civil aviation and I can confirm that there is an ongoing debate on the notion of state aircraft and flights for institutional and State assignments;"
"I have gathered very interesting opinions on the role of national courts, which will have their say in providing a response as to individual responsibility when the right conditions exist."
"What I have said confirms my willingness, and that of all the European Commission services, to work with the temporary committee."
"In conclusion, Mr President, I have the moral and institutional obligation, above all to myself, to respond to a personal attack on me made by Mr Catania, the only one of the 54 speakers who has asked me, for the fourth time, to clarify my role as Minister of Foreign Affairs at the time of the Abu Omar case."
"I think that this question, which I have answered several times before the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, may well gain Mr Catania a mention in some headline in the Italian newspapers, but I would have thought that the obligation to tell the truth to this Parliament would have imposed on him the same duty as it does on me: to remember that the government at that time formally denied any knowledge of the Abu Omar case and did so without there being any proof to the contrary."
"Under Italian law, however, and here it is not a matter of opinion, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the post that I held at that time, not only cannot but must not know about the operating activities of the Italian secret services."
"That is a piece of information on Italian laws of which Mr Catania is aware, but of which many of you are not."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday 6 July 2006, at 12 noon."
"– The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the interception of bank transfer data from the SWIFT system by the US secret services."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this matter is in many of its aspects important, but, regrettably, the Council cannot confirm the information recently put out by the media regarding transfers of data between the SWIFT system and the United States, nor comment on them."
"As all of us in this House know, the Council does not have the means to investigate actions which are contrary to applicable law in this case."
"The national authorities are responsible for this sort of enquiry."
"If, on the other hand, it concerns actions that go against Community legislation, the responsibility lies with the national authorities and the Commission under the supervision of national and Community courts of justice."
"The Council assumes that current cooperation between private companies like SWIFT and the US authorities will be in accordance with applicable law and in compliance with fundamental rights."
"The Council, like Parliament, is a legislating body and, as such, it would like to draw Parliament’s attention to a proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on information on the payer accompanying transfers of funds."
"This regulation is being discussed by both Parliament and the Council."
"When this regulation has been passed, it will apply to transfers of funds in any currency sent or received by anyone offering payment services based within the Community."
"Article 14 of the proposed regulation states that anyone providing payment services must respond immediately and thoroughly to requests made by the authorities responsible for the prevention of money laundering or the financing of terrorism in the Member State in which they are located and which concern data to be disclosed on the payer accompanying transfers of funds and storing this information."
"The Council believes that this Community act, in line as it is with fundamental rights, will strengthen the legislative framework needed to prevent flows of dirty money which come about through transfers of funds and which can harm the stability and reputation of the financial sector."
"At the same time, the regulation will prevent all types of illegal action targeted at the Community financing system."
"Given how widespread the activity is and the impact it has, the Member States cannot implement the aims of this regulation adequately: it will be effected better at Community level."
"It is therefore urgent to pass this regulation."
"The regulation is to be adopted by means of the codecision procedure."
"On 6 December 2005 the Council agreed on the general conception of the proposal."
"In the wake of some unofficial meetings between representatives of Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the Presidency hopes that a compromise solution for the regulation as a whole can be shortly agreed."
"We will be closely monitoring the legislative work to prevent, , illegal and unjustified activity against the financing system."
"The Commission is also debating the Commission’s Proposal for a Council Framework Decision on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters."
"The Commission put forward the proposal on 4 October 2005."
"The framework decision aims to ensure that personal data on European citizens has a high level of protection."
"That requires common regulations, so that we can determine the legality and quality of data being processed by the competent authorities in the Member States."
"Although the proposal will not apply to the financing system directly, it will provide for the protection of personal data and may also be important for a case that is being dealt with."
"The proposal is being discussed by the competent bodies within the Council."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that our common will is to protect European citizens not only from terrorism but also all kinds of illegal activity targeted at the European financing system, with reference too to Community measures and legislation."
"."
"Mr President, on this very sensitive issue, at the moment the Commission has only partial information, which we have already requested to be supplemented as soon as possible, regarding the exact facts as to how the American authorities obtained access to data on financial transactions held by SWIFT."
"At present, it seems that there was a transfer of financial information between private companies from the EU to the United States."
"I understand that several authorities in Europe, including the European Central Bank, were informed."
"I quote from a statement from the American Treasury issued on 23 June: ‘SWIFT is overseen by a committee drawn from major central banks, including the United States Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and the lead overseer, the National Bank of Belgium."
"The overseers have been informed about SWIFT’s participation with the Treasury and the safeguards and assurances put in place’."
"I repeat that I was quoting there from a statement of the American Treasury."
"I can assure you that this information, of which I am now aware, was not passed on to the Commission previously, because the transfer of such financial information falls within the scope of the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC."
"National authorities are primarily responsible for the proper application of the data protection rules."
"I trust that European Member States will take all the necessary action to ensure that their national data protection legislation is properly applied and strictly enforced."
"I observe that the Belgian Prime Minister has already asked the Justice Ministry to investigate and that the Belgian Data Protection Supervisory Commission is being equally active in assessing the circumstances under which this particular transfer has taken place."
"In any case, the Commission will follow the developments very closely and, if necessary, we will make full use of our powers under the Treaty."
"I stress that, at this stage, I do not know whether this would be appropriate, as we have first to learn from the Belgian authorities what exactly happened, how and why."
"As my colleague, Mr McCreevy, stated on Monday before this Parliament, the regulation on information on the payer accompanying transfers of funds, on which you will vote tomorrow, contains the appropriate safeguards on data protection and access by competent authorities to such data."
"I recalled that the European Data Protection Supervisor provided a positive assessment and did not detect any data protection concerns."
"I think, therefore, that the SWIFT affair should not delay the regulation on information on the payer accompanying the transfer of funds, the adoption of which is essential to detecting terrorist financing."
"Let me finish by stressing once again my commitment to the fight against terrorism and to the identification of methods used to finance it, acting, of course, within the full rule of law and in accordance with our fundamental rights."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Lehtomäki, SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide International Financial Telecommunication, has stated that it, acting upon a request from the American Department of Finance, passed on to the American authorities a limited amount of information concerning international money transfers."
"This information can be found on the company’s website."
"According to the statement by the Belgian data company, moreover, cooperation with the authorities is intended to prevent misuse of the international financial system."
"The Belgian Government – according to press reports, at any rate – is already investigating whether the US administration’s research activities were in breach of national law, and this is something to which Commissioner Frattini has just referred."
"The Belgian minister for justice has also set in motion investigations into this matter, and her department is, in the initial stages at any rate, the right one to be investigating this sort of thing, for, according to current law, it is the Belgian legal system that must take action and make inquiries."
"Considering carefully what the Commissioner has just again said, and thinking about how much we know about this at the present time, I have to come to the conclusion that we know nothing for certain, and have not yet reached the stage at which we would be obliged to investigate."
"We know that there are EU-wide rules on the protection of civilian data, and the planned European legislation on the handling of private data in connection with the prosecution of crime and the war on terror – at least as far as I am aware – is, as things stand, going to contain only rules on how state authorities should handle sensitive data, and so I think we should, as a matter of urgency, aim to use European legislation, once it has been adopted, to intervene and take action at an early opportunity."
"– Mr President, we have learned from investigative journalists that, for the purposes of combating the funding of terrorism, the American authorities have apparently put in place a programme for intercepting the financial transactions handled by the SWIFT bank."
"This has been confirmed by President Bush and by SWIFT itself."
"Data protection is not an obstacle to the work of the police authorities."
"Rather, it is there to guarantee respect for fundamental rights."
"Clearly, European countries were not informed of these activities, but – as you said, Mr Frattini – the European Central Bank would have known about them."
"The European Central Bank is a European institution."
"It has to comply with data protection legislation, and that is why we want the European Data Protection Supervisor to check without delay that the European Central Bank has respected the laws."
"Finally, we must make sure that there is no gap in the legislation on the protection of personal data."
"Even if we still do not have a European document regulating data protection within the framework of police activities, existing legislation requires respect for national legislation in the case of any exchange of data provided for in the context of public security."
"Such exchanges must, moreover, be authorised by the Member States."
"I would also draw the attention of the Council, Mrs Lehtomäki and the Commission to Amendments 26 and 58 of my report on data protection under the third pillar."
"These are designed to regulate the way in which data is handled when it is collected by private parties in the public interest, and it is in that activity that the problem lies, I believe."
"Mr President, firstly I should like to welcome Mrs Lehtomäki."
"I simply want to say to her that I have listened to what she has said and I think it necessary to point out the following: our government takes the form of the Council of Ministers or European Council."
"Although it may not have the legal or political tools to take a decision regarding this scandal – by which I mean the SWIFT affair – which has followed on from that involving clandestine flights, there is nothing to stop it affirming its moral virtue and saying publicly what it thinks about it - something that, as far as I know, it has still not done."
"The second thing I wish to say is that I have taken careful note of what the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Frattini, said about neither he nor his department knowing anything about this case."
"I share the opinion of my two fellow Members, Mrs Klamt and Mrs Roure, who have just spoken on this matter."
"In Europe, and more specifically in the EU, we have progressively constructed a state governed by the rule of law in which any transfer of personal data to third countries must, of absolute necessity, obey national or European rules."
"The first of these rules states that any transfer must be authorised by a judicial authority, and no one else."
"Neither a State nor a bank is the owner of the information of which it makes use."
"If the data concerned relates to companies, it is the property of those companies. If it relates to individuals, it is the property of those individuals."
"There is no authorisation for others to use it in transactions, to appropriate it, to pass it on to others or to dispose of it in heaven knows what other ways."
"I would point out that the legal instrument exists, and I would recall what Mrs Roure said just now to the effect that it would be a really very important step if we were to succeed in sorting out this matter under the Finnish Presidency."
"I should also like to say one last thing."
"There is a French proverb that reads, ‘Do not trust my friends; as for my enemies, they are for me to take care of’."
"The enemy is terrorism, and our friends are the Americans."
"After the clandestine flights, the abduction of European citizens rightly or wrongly under suspicion and the illegal transfers of prisoners using aircraft landing on European soil, we now learn that, friend of ours though it may be, a power in alliance with ourselves has been rooting around in our bank accounts."
"When will the blood samples start to be taken?"
"When shall we start having to submit details of births and so forth?"
"Emphatically, enough is enough."
"Parliament really does need to put a stop to this type of thing."
"I shall conclude by saying that, if I have properly understood the matter, terrorism is the enemy of our freedoms and, in return, liberty is the enemy of terrorism."
"It is certainly not the enemy of ordinary people."
"In this area, too, the United States now needs to decide which side it is on."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we would be making a mistake if we regarded the SWIFT matter as an isolated event."
"It is a matter that should be seen in a wider context, referring to PNR, to the control of communications and to data retention, and this subject is not unconnected with the topic of rendition that we were addressing just a few minutes ago."
"In fact I would say that the SWIFT affair is the other side of the rendition coin; it may be a less violent operation, but it has exactly the same purpose: to extract information."
"The systematic surveillance of the lives of European citizens has now become commonplace and we are facing what George Orwell called ‘Big Brother’, in the name of the fight against terrorism."
"I think we should conduct an inquiry into the responsibility of the European Central Bank and national banks, since I believe that this situation is unacceptable."
"One week ago, , the Belgian daily newspaper with the highest circulation, ran a headline: ‘the CIA lays down the law in Europe’."
"I think that this must be prevented from happening in the name of the credibility and the very future of Europe."
"– Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I was concerned at the allegations published in the New York Times about a secret programme whereby the database of the SWIFT organisation – through which most of the world’s financial transactions pass – was intercepted by the CIA."
"This programme was confirmed by both SWIFT and the US Treasury Secretary."
"We must restate our determination, on both sides of the Atlantic, to combat terrorism resolutely and effectively, but this must not be at the expense of full respect for fundamental rights and the rule of law."
"Regardless of my personal opinions on the matter, what appears to have happened is that data has been transferred to the United States with the aim of preventing and combating terrorism and other crimes. In other words, these are operations relating to public security and the activities of the Member State in its area of criminal law."
"If this is the case, it is clearly outside Community law."
"This was what I took to be Mr Frattini’s first reaction, through his spokesman, when he mentioned the extra-Community nature of this issue."
"I do not know if this was lost in translation, or if Mr Frattini actually told us today, that in his view Directive 95/46 applies in this case."
"This is an issue that needs to be resolved; either Directive 95/46 will be applied or the situation is outside the first pillar and outside Community law, and therefore the call for this framework decision on data protection under the third pillar to be adopted is justified."
"In any event, the Member States must protect these data."
"I therefore welcome the decision by the Belgian Government to launch an inquiry to discover what actually happened and the legality in respect of national law. I await the results of this inquiry with interest."
"Mr President, it is important that we use today’s debate to respond to the SWIFT case."
"The present resolution contains a number of pertinent questions that have to be asked, because anxiety levels among the public shoot up when they read stories of that kind in the newspapers."
"As in the debates held earlier today, this is yet another case of weighing up security interests against the interests of the civil liberties involved in public and corporate privacy."
"Once again, this is about activities in the framework of the fight against international terrorism, which may well be carried out behind the backs of the monitoring bodies and may well be in contravention of international agreements guaranteeing fundamental rights and freedoms."
"Although I do not want to draw direct comparisons between this case and the issue of CIA flights, the SWIFT case is not an isolated one, but an example of the way in which the Americans, in particular, hope to fight terrorism."
"Today’s debate is yet again an example of the need for discussing the nature of the war we are waging."
"In this case too, we should ask ourselves whether all the rules have been complied with."
"There is the suspicion, which has also been confirmed, that the European institutions were informed."
"We want to know exactly what their responsibility in this case is and to what extent they have already been involved in monitoring the implementation of existing rules."
"Above all, however, we want to prevent a situation in which we all operate in some kind of grey area, with the creation of a legal vacuum in which even the citizens no longer know where they stand."
"The draft resolution contains a number of pertinent comments in that respect."
"We also want – and this is something that the Commissioner has already mentioned – clarification about the role of the European institutions."
"In addition, we want any legal loopholes plugged, thus making sure that if a similar exchange of data were to prove necessary in future, it would only be done with solid underpinning and in full compliance with certain guarantees and minimum standards."
"We would also like to see the Member States being called to account about the implementation of the agreed rules."
"Once again, we must really prevent people from getting the feeling that they are in a legal vacuum."
"All loopholes in legislation must be plugged."
"Mr President, whether or not it is legal, I want to say that European citizens have never been told about the details of their bank accounts being monitored, and I regard it as a precondition that they should be."
"I wonder how we would react if it were not the United States, but another country, that was checking our bank accounts, and whether we would be equally tolerant of that."
"Turning to the question of effectiveness, the Council stated a moment ago that this is what is needed in the fight against terrorism."
"I would draw your attention to the fact that Stuart Levey, the US Under-Secretary to the Treasury, pointed out two weeks ago that they are very successful in tracing financial transactions."
"This did, though, drive the transactions of terrorists underground and therefore out of our reach and field of vision."
"In the European Union, we must, as a matter or urgency, adopt cohesive, efficient and common policy that is based on democratic decision-making and guarantees the sound protection of personal data."
"This really is becoming a matter of urgency."
"Finally, I also endorse the view of those who claim that this is not an isolated incident."
"Rendition flights, and also the handling of passenger details, are making it evident that the United States does not hold to agreements."
"We in the European Union must speak with one voice and ensure that, together with our ally, we fight terrorism on a legal basis."
"The press have been writing about the US Government’s data mining of private financial records held by SWIFT, but they have not informed us whether this concerns SWIFT in the USA or whether it also applies to Europe."
"If this is about SWIFT in the USA, then that is none of our business."
"Access to SWIFT data in Europe is a matter administered primarily by Belgian authorities, who should grant all applications for access."
"At present, the only thing we know is that SWIFT is supposed to share with the USA certain information related to the financing of terrorism."
"There are two problems here."
"Firstly, the European Parliament cannot engage in a serious debate about this issue merely on the basis of press coverage and vague statements."
"Secondly, it has to abide by its treaties and be aware of its areas of jurisdiction."
"We know that the Belgian authorities have launched an investigation into this, but do not yet have any results."
"One thing we need to clarify is that access to the SWIFT system does not mean that ordinary transactions, such as the depositing and withdrawal of cash, cheques, electronic means of payment etc., are subject to data mining."
"The Socialists and a number of other political groups think otherwise."
"They have submitted a joint proposal for a resolution in which they state that US authorities have access to the records held by SWIFT and that this was an instance of the USA violating fundamental provisions on personal data protection."
"These words are not, as Mr Wiersma says, assumptions, because they bandy them around as if they were facts."
"Similarly, they have disregarded the fact that the Belgian Government is in charge of investigating the case and that the European Parliament has no role to play at this stage."
"So, in order to preserve the dignity of the European Parliament and out of respect for EU’s , we, members of the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats, have adopted our own resolution in which we call everyone’s attention to the rules of the game and in which we say that we should only have recourse to such resolutions when we can operate with incontrovertible facts."
"This is the only way for the European Parliament to preserve its reputation in the public eye and ensure it does not turn into a glorified debating society."
"I support the views of Commissioner Frattini and call on Members of the Parliament to support our resolution as it complies fully with the and the ethics and standards of conduct of the European Parliament."
"– Mr President, the SWIFT scandal, in conjunction with the problematic recital of the recent decision by the European Court of the otherwise correct rejection of the transfer of Passenger Name Records agreement, highlight an exceptionally dangerous grey zone which is starting to arise around the use of sensitive personal data to combat terrorism."
"To be specific, any third country, not just the USA, now appears to be able, merely by citing even fictitious reasons of national security, to define:"
"- firstly, the decision-making level in the European Union; in other words, if decisions will be taken at Community or national level;"
"- secondly, which European legislation will apply and"
"- thirdly, the level, therefore, for permitted access, use and protection of the data of millions of innocent citizens, which are collated and kept – listen to this – by private companies, not even by the police authorities, and for private reasons."
"This legal black hole must be closed at once and one very important way is for the bridge or so-called passerelle to function at long last; in other words, for Parliament to have a decisive say."
"The pillars cannot apply here. PNR, SWIFT, data retention: in all these private individuals are collating data and the police are using them on the pretext of terrorism."
"There are no pillars."
"It is one thing."
"Mr President, Mr Frattini, Minister Lehtomäki, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we should be very worried about the red tape that binds together many of the arguments and debates that we have in this Chamber."
"We could make the same comment on the subject that we are analysing now, as we did a short time ago in the debate on the CIA flights, that is that the Union is an area that is bound by the rules and principles of the rule of law and that, therefore, personal data, all personal data, including our current account data, must not be given to third countries, except in the cases provided for under national laws and now under European directives; there are no exceptions, not even in the name of the fight against terrorism."
"Anything that goes beyond this constitutes an arbitrary act and an abuse of the system."
"I and other Members would like to know what role the Council and the European Central Bank played and how aware they were of the secret agreements made by SWIFT and the United States administration, since the duty of transparency should not apply solely to our dialogue and debates in Parliament, it also has to exist outside this House."
"Mr President, I concur with my colleagues in asking the Council to examine and adopt a framework decision on data protection as quickly as possible, because when there is a legal vacuum abuses and arbitrary acts can gain a foothold."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened very carefully to this debate, and I can see that there is a firm consensus among us that citizens’ freedoms and issues of data security have to be taken sufficiently into account even in the fight against terrorism."
"The Presidency takes a very serious view of this, and, as has been said, it is the responsibility of the National Bank of Belgium to oversee SWIFT and we also now await with interest what the Belgian authorities uncover."
"If these investigations uncover facts which require legislation at Union level or harmonisation of legislation, this will be considered in the debate on the legislative plans that are being prepared."
"This is such an important matter that we need to hold a debate on it in the Justice and Home Affairs Council, and that is just what we will do."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the ideas that you have given me during the debate."
"I think it can be said that the SWIFT affair has a special feature, which suggests to me that the 1995 ‘first pillar directive’ on data protection is probably the one that is applicable, since the data was transferred through SWIFT Belgium and SWIFT United States, that is between two private branches of a private organisation."
"That is why my interpretation, obviously subject to what the Belgian authorities will tell us, is that there would have been a communication to the Data Protection Authority and the national responsibilities of the competent bodies in this case would indeed exist."
"Unlike the PNR affair, which, as we were correctly reminded by Mr Lambrinidis, involved a transfer from a private airline directly to a US public body, here the transfer was between two private parties."
"It happens that on US territory, in accordance with US legislation, data transmitted for commercial reasons is used for security purposes."
"That is the structural difference."
"The result, as illustrated by Mr Lambrinidis, is that there is a grey area that really needs to be regulated."
"In my opinion, there are two immediate possibilities: the first, to be implemented with the help of the Council and the Presidency, consists of rapidly approving the proposal that the Commission has put forward for a framework decision under the third pillar, in order to protect the confidentiality of personal data."
"To this extent, it is evident that we will at least have covered one area, the one in which data are transmitted for reasons of security, investigation and to combat terrorism."
"That would leave the first pillar part, that is the transfer between two private parties for commercial reasons."
"A third aspect would still be missing: transfer between a Member State and a third country, that is not data transmitted from the European Union to a third country, but by an individual Member State directly to a third country."
"This is the third aspect that I think should be examined."
"If we look at these three points together, which, quite honestly, do not make for a controversy with the United States of America, but they do concern all third countries, we will be able to get a precise handle on that grey area."
"– I have received five motions for resolutions1 in accordance with Rule 103 (2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday 6 July 2006, at 12 noon."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0312/2006)."
"The following questions have been submitted to the Council."
"During their meeting in Vienna on 27-28 May, EU Foreign Ministers apparently failed to reach an agreement on a Commission proposal to use the bridging or 'passerelle' clause of the Nice Treaty to move more competences in Justice and Home Affairs from the third to the first (Community) 'pillar'."
"What plans does the Finnish Presidency nonetheless have to advance the search for more effective, democratic and transparent decision-making in this area?"
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Prime Minister Vanhanen said here today, the Finnish Presidency believes that it is a very important objective to make the European Union an area of freedom, security and justice."
"With this in mind, when the Hague Programme is being re-examined, the Presidency also intends to look at how we might improve the decision-making procedure on cooperation in policing and crime."
"On 28 June 2006 the Commission produced the so-called ‘Hague Scoreboard Plus’, which evaluates the implementation of the Hague Programme and whether EU legislation has been implemented in the Member States properly and according to the agreed timetable."
"In addition to this, the Commission has issued a communication which contains proposals regarding both the content of the policies on justice and home affairs and an improved decision-making procedure."
"As the President of the Commission has said, the Commission is ready to make proposals with the purpose of making use of the options in the Treaties to adjust the decision-making procedure."
"Finland intends to discuss these proposals in depth and in this way respond to the request made to Finland by the European Council at its meeting on 15 and 16 June. This was to work closely with the Commission to examine the possibilities of improving decision-making and action in the domain of freedom, security and justice on the basis of the current Treaties."
"The Justice and Home Affairs Ministers are holding a preliminary discussion on these matters at their informal meeting in Tampere on 21 and 22 September 2006."
"The talks are to be continued in Council sessions in October and December and at the European Council in December."
"I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for that reply."
"In the six weeks since I tabled the question, things have moved on a lot."
"I will not claim We had the whole package of proposals last week from the Commission."
"I am delighted that the Finnish Presidency is going to give them great emphasis, but will the Presidency give as much emphasis to the Commission proposal on evaluation and monitoring as to the one on transforming the ineffective and undemocratic decision-making?"
"Will it impress on those Member States that have not implemented the framework decision on terrorism that it is scandalous that, five years after 11 September 2001, two years after 11 March 2004 and, on Friday, one year after 7 July 2005, some EU countries still have no provision in their laws to define and criminalise terrorist offences?"
"."
"Mr President, we will now aim to put our energies into this, because the time for close cooperation in policing and legal matters is clearly close at hand."
"As I said in my original reply, this evaluation of the implementation of the Hague Programme is at present being undertaken and we are aiming for more effective Union-wide cooperation in this sector."
"Following the successful outcome of the COP 11/MOP 1 in Montreal at the end of 2005, it is now essential to push ahead with the new processes launched: the negotiations on the post-2012 commitments and the dialogue on long-term joint actions under the Framework Convention on Climate Change."
"Can the President-in-Office of the Council state what progress was made in this regard at the 24th Session of the Subsidiary Bodies of the Framework Convention on Climate Change held in Bonn from 15 to 26 May 2006?"
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must warn you right away that this is quite a complicated issue and my answer is even more complicated."
"As the person who asked the question says, the eleventh conference of the parties to the United Nations Framework Agreement on Climate Change and the first meeting of the Parties serving as the Conference of Parties to the Kyoto Protocol resulted in two new processes for the future."
"These were the setting up of an working group to discuss additional obligations of the parties to the Kyoto Protocol mentioned in Annex 1 to the Convention, and a dialogue on long-term cooperative action to address climate change by enhancing implementation of the Convention."
"The dialogue in itself is not an opening for negotiations on new commitments."
"The first workshop held for the Convention dialogue gave all parties the opportunity to present their ideas on advancing development goals in a sustainable way by addressing action on adjustment and realising the full potential of technology and market-based opportunities."
"This was the first of four workshops and, at the same time, the start of a longer process, which it is intended to bring to a conclusion at the end of next year."
"New ideas were proposed on future action, to be discussed in greater detail."
"The workshop leaders, Howard Bamsey of Australia and Sandia de Wet of South Africa, reported to COP12 on the workshop and have promised that the report will be available by August 2006."
"The workshop initiated an examination of additional obligations of the parties to the Kyoto Protocol mentioned in Annex 1 and drafted a provisional work plan for the next few years."
"Whilst recognising that the discussions by the working group entailed an examination of the additional obligations of the parties mentioned in Annex 1, which were confirmed as changes to Annex B of the Kyoto Protocol, the working group’s deliberations also stressed the importance of bearing in mind the work that was already under way and the results achieved in this area by other bodies and processes under the Convention and the Protocol."
"The second session of the working group will be during the second session of the Parties serving as the Conference of Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, with further development of the working group’s action plan as the aim."
"Meanwhile, the parties mentioned in Annex 1 will be asked to supply data by the beginning of September on the issues which they might wish to raise at the second session, for example, trends in emissions, the potential for policy and technology to alleviate climate change, and the costs and benefits of a reduction in emissions."
"The annex to the working group’s plan is a list, albeit not an exhaustive one, and the initiative and sole responsibility of the Chairman, who drew it up, of themes that may be important for the future tasks of the working group."
"These themes are a scientific basis for determining additional obligations, the scenarios and risks attached to these obligations, the costs and impact of adjustment, emission trends and socio-economic factors, the potential for policies, measures and technologies for alleviating climate change, the costs and benefits of alleviation, sectoral analysis and the effect on competitiveness, experience gained, the lessons learned from implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, how long the obligations should remain in force, the sectoral approach, an outline for future commitments, and the additional costs of developing, adopting and transferring technologies."
"In summary, I might say that a firm basis for both processes was established in the 24th session of the auxiliary bodies."
"The situation is to be reassessed after the 12th Conference of Parties in Nairobi, where both these new action processes will be discussed and the first review pursuant to Article 9, paragraph 2, of the Kyoto Protocol will be carried out."
"– Thank you, Minister, for giving me such a very precise answer."
"The interpretation into German was very comprehensible too."
"As an Austrian, I would like to wish you all the best for your presidency."
"There is something else I would like to ask. Could you tell me something more about the cost/benefit ratio and the cost/benefit calculations in which these working parties are currently engaged?"
"How do you propose to ensure not only that this House is kept constantly up to date about the negotiations, but is also actively involved in them?"
"."
"Mr President, it is as yet impossible to go into the cost-benefit calculation in detail, but a review is obviously essential to ensure that there is the right balance of measures and benefits gained from them."
"I hope that we can be in active contact with the European Parliament during the process, because Parliament has shown a very keen interest in these issues of climate, which is welcome considering how important this is for our future."
"President-in-Office of the Council, I appreciate your well-informed reply to the previous question enormously."
"I would like to continue with the subject because the Council is now represented by a Presidency which has a lot of practical experience of its own of the negative aspects of emissions trading, a key instrument selected by the EU to prepare for the Kyoto Protocol."
"These negative experiences include distortion of competition, disruptions in the internal market, and the fact that any party that has dealt well with the problem and taken environmental action early can end up paying for it."
"That is why, whereas the Commission still plugs emissions trading as a success story, Finland should have the opportunity to put this concept into a more realistic framework."
"Does Finland mean to do that, and what sort of improvements would you be prepared to propose to correct the problems of emissions trading?"
"."
"Mr President, we presume that the Commission’s report on the emissions trading scheme will be available sometime during the term of the Finnish Presidency, and, naturally, in the debate on it, Finland will have the opportunity also to raise the issue of its own experiences in the national context."
"May I say again and echo the words of Prime Minister Vanhanen here today that questions of climate change will be high on the agenda, not only in transatlantic cooperation but in that with Asian countries too, during the Finnish Presidency and, hopefully, afterwards."
"How does the Council Presidency assess the current state of the negotiations on the status of Kosovo?"
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union fully supports the negotiations on the future status of Kosovo, talks which are now being conducted under the leadership of UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari."
"The European Union urges all parties to participate constructively in the process for determining Kosovo’s status and would remind them that progress in the implementation of standards in Kosovo will be crucially important for taking this process forward."
"There is still a very wide range of opinions on the subject, but the technical discussions on status have also been necessary and useful."
"The Presidency, in particular, wishes the process every success."
"– Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Finland is providing the Kosovo negotiations with a highly-qualified mediator in the person of ex-President Ahtisaari, and that gives us cause for confidence, even though there are major problems ahead, and there can, in the long run, be only one solution, namely independence: of that I am convinced."
"What I would like to know is whether you think it conceivable that, as Kosovo moves towards that, UNMIK – which is a transitional administrative arrangement – will be replaced by a European administration in the shape of EUMIK, in other words: do you think that the EU will play a more active part in the administration of Kosovo?"
"."
"Mr President, the whole time during this process we will stress the importance of close and successful cooperation with the United Nations."
"We must remember that Mr Ahtisaari is actually a special envoy of the UN in this area."
"It goes without saying that the European Union, for its part, is obviously ready to support the final outcome of this process, however it turns out."
"– Madam President-in-Office of the Council, as you know, the Western Balkans was one of the big issues for the Austrian Presidency of the Council."
"Will the Finnish Presidency pursue this issue with the same energy as did Austria?"
"What, too, is your view on the EU’s absorption capacity?"
"Will Finland be coming up with tangible measures to deal with this, and will it be endorsing the Commission’s report?"
"."
"Mr President, during the Finnish Presidency the Western Balkans will be a very important issue in many different ways."
"The Western Balkans are affected by the EU enlargement process, a detailed debate on which is to take place at the European Council in December."
"Finland welcomes the notion that the EU’s absorption capacity has not become a new enlargement criterion but an issue that demands serious attention within the European Union itself."
"I can nevertheless assure you that the important role played by the Western Balkans in the European debate will also be continued during our Presidency."
"– As you will no doubt be aware, Minister, the maintenance of internal security and law and order in Kosovo presents no small problem in terms of its stabilisation and its being accorded a new status."
"What aid will you, under your Presidency, be giving the Western Balkans, and Kosovo in particular, in order that, in the spheres of internal security and the administration of justice, standards may be established of such a nature as to adequately guarantee the stability of the region as a whole?"
"."
"Mr President, it is just this protection of human rights and the rights of minorities mentioned here that is one of the main purposes of the talks on Kosovo’s status."
"Obviously, a long-term interim solution can only be based on the ability to guarantee the rights and security of all groups."
"Kosovo’s closer rapport with the European Union’s Stabilisation and Association Process is also bound to lend support to the implementation of standards in many different ways."
"In recent years Iraq has suffered from a distressingly high number of hostage-takings."
"Most reported instances are high profile because they involve foreign aid workers, journalists and reconstruction engineers."
"Yet the number of kidnappings involving foreigners in Iraq is actually very small when compared to the thousands of Iraqis taken hostage."
"Experts agree that the hostage-taking in Iraq is perpetrated by a large number of criminal and terrorist groups for a multitude of reasons – but more often than not the motivation is financial."
"Particularly worrying therefore are the recent indications that a number of EU Member States have paid enormous ransoms to criminal and terrorist groups in return for the freedom of kidnapped nationals."
"The paying of ransoms is a particularly unwelcome and short-sighted step, as far from discouraging hostage-taking, it encourages its proliferation, putting foreigners and Iraqis alike at greater risk."
"In this context, what steps can the Council take to establish common guidelines and codes of conduct for EU Member States when they are faced with this threat in Iraq and beyond?"
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, citizens of the European Union are becoming more and more the targets of hostage taking and sometimes these kidnappings are also connected with acts of terror."
"The European Union and the United Nations have repeatedly condemned the taking of hostages."
"We must basically take a dim view of ransom demands for hostages."
"Ransoms paid to hostage takers are an incentive for more kidnappings and can therefore lead to an increase in terrorism."
"International cooperation, and in particular cooperation within the EU, is a very useful tool in dealing with such cases."
"The efforts of the EU Member States in hostage crises led to the UN International Convention against the Taking of Hostages."
"That came into force on 3 June 1983, and all the Member States of the EU have ratified it."
"Hostage taking has been discussed by the Council of the EU in the same way that it has directly between Member States."
"The relevant practical forms of action include united political support and action on the part of the EU in kidnapping situations, preparing for hostage taking situations in joint pilot projects and crisis exercises, the reinforcement of national crisis groups using experts from other countries, and a Member States’ check list of options for joint action."
"In a few special cases there has already been practical cooperation, but it would be useful to clarify the basis for cooperation further."
"For this sort of cooperation to be as effective as possible, it should be informal, voluntary and very practical in its nature."
"All information, furthermore, would need to be treated strictly confidentially."
"We would also need to respect the concerned country’s right to self-determination."
"I would like to say what a pleasure it is to have the opportunity to put a question to the Council in the new Presidency and offer my warmest congratulations and support – I am sure along with all our colleagues – to the Finnish Presidency, which we know will be a very happy and successful one for the European Union."
"I thank the President-in-Office for that comprehensive and very helpful reply."
"I am particularly grateful for the comment that cooperation has been somewhat sporadic and informal in the past and that perhaps there might be a way of strengthening cooperation in connection with this ever-growing crime."
"I wonder if I might draw the President-in-Office’s attention, however, to the recent April 2006 report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, UNODC, on trafficking in persons and global patterns in trafficking in persons."
"Since hostage-taking and kidnappings are not confined to the failing states or states in complex emergencies, such as Iran, they are the key link in the chain to organised crime trafficking and particularly therefore to international terrorism."
"With this in mind, I draw the President-in-Office’s attention to the fact that of the top 11 incidents of reporting of origin countries of human trafficking ..."
"."
"I do not think that is actually a question to the Council."
"However, I would just mention to the honourable Member that the fight against trafficking is definitely one of the priorities of this Presidency and we will pay attention to the issues raised."
"– This morning, we had a debate with the Commission on Palestine and the hostage-takings there."
"What further action is the Presidency of the Council contemplating taking with regard to the situation in the Middle East, in Palestine and in Israel?"
"."
"Mr President, as I stated in my statement on behalf of the Council in the debate this morning, the Council regards it as very important that both sides should immediately commit to action to ease this crisis situation."
"The European Union will help in a variety of ways to find a solution to this crisis, but, obviously, the parties themselves hold the keys to that."
"We will work hard and we hope that a solution will be found."
"– It often becomes apparent to us that our governments are very poorly informed about the background to kidnappings; first we are told that they are carried out by terrorists, only for it often to turn out that the motivation for them is merely criminal – quite different, in other words."
"I would like to ask you whether you might perhaps want to push for better-integrated intelligence services or for better exchange of information between them, so that the rationale behind the taking of hostages might be better known, and so that the right response to them might be more speedily forthcoming."
"."
"Mr President, as was mentioned slightly earlier on in the debate on the CIA and the rendition of prisoners, the work of the intelligence services and the information which they provide fall, as such, within the competence of the Member States, although it is obviously useful if there can be very smooth and thorough cooperation to find solutions in kidnapping situations just like this and to examine the background to these situations, as the honourable Member said."
"In the light of the recent agreement on the EU's external border controls in the maritime areas near the Canary Islands, and given the requirements of the European area of freedom, security and justice, does the Council not believe that the time has come to establish an integrated immigration policy for the Union as a whole, which can both ensure stable labour markets within EU territory and channel the considerable migratory pressures being exercised on our external borders?"
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union applies and means to continue to apply a comprehensive strategy and to migration both in the Union’s internal policy and in relations with third countries and in dialogue with them."
"This strategy and cover various aspects and dimensions of migration, for example, legal immigration, the prevention and control of illegal immigration, human trafficking and people smuggling."
"The European Union naturally operates, as always, within the limits of its competence as laid down in the Treaty."
"As regards the action that the Union has taken in response to recent events in the Canary Islands, I would like to suggest that the honourable Member take a closer look at the answers that were given to oral questions H-0440, H-0455, H-0460, H-0473 and H-0478/2006."
"This number of questions and answers shows that this is an important issue and the debate on it and measures relating to it must be continued."
"Thank you very much for your reply, Madam President-in-Office of the Council."
"The specific problem we face in the field of immigration policy is a lack of economic resources."
"For this year we apparently only have EUR 5 000 000 and there is no chance of any more resources until the approval of the new financial perspective next year."
"How can we link the immigration policy to the recently approved financial perspective for 2007-2013?"
"."
"Mr President, we need very sustained cooperation with the countries of departure and transit countries so that we can improve conditions in these countries and thus ease the pressures associated, in particular, with illegal immigration in the long term."
"Obviously, this area of external relations also needs the resources and tools necessary to be able to have a proper impact."
"In answer to the question about a stable labour market in the European Union, you said that the Council is considering all aspects of immigration policy."
"We have recently have heard and read about terrible things happening not just in the Canary Islands but also in Spain and about what is happening in the labour market in fruit and tomato farms in Southern Europe."
"Has the Council discussed this form of modern slavery and is this an issue that will be raised at the social summit later this year?"
"."
"Mr President, the European labour markets and the viability of this labour market system are, of course, together one key issue that has a direct effect on immigration policy, and, consequently, various elements of these need to be discussed and solutions found for them."
"The legalisation of illegal migrants is obviously a complex matter in itself, of huge significance for the individual and his or her protection under the law."
"There is also, however, a good and a bad side to lengthy legalisation procedures, and we should remember that the effects may well be felt throughout the European Union."
"Ultimately, legalisation of this nature is a matter which falls within the competence of the Member States of the European Union, although it is obviously useful to exchange information and, furthermore, engage in political debate on the subject."
"– Madam President-in-Office of the Council, further to what you said about your intention of drawing up common rules on asylum policy, an area in which – as you will be aware – some powers are in the hands of the Member States and some in the hands of the EU, will you be holding to the line that it will continue in future to be a matter for the Member States to lay down how many, and which, working migrants will be permitted entry, in order to make integration into the labour market possible and prevent that market from being distorted?"
"."
"Mr President, mobility of the workforce and the availability of foreign labour in the Member States of the European Union is not just an immigration and labour market question but also very much a question that relates to European competitiveness."
"The honourable Member asked if this would be an issue for the Member States to decide on in the future."
"It is obviously difficult to see far into the future and know what direction these policy decisions will take, but it is important to have political debate on issues that fall within national competence because, as I said just now, decisions that are taken in individual Member States also have a wider importance and influence in the Union as a whole."
"What measures will the Council take to ensure that European citizens take an active part in decision-making to change illegal into legal immigration and accept the need to integrate immigrants?"
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the integration of nationals from third countries legally resident in Member States is a constant challenge for European societies and crucial for strengthening their social and political cohesion."
"The Hague Programme relating to the domain of freedom, security and justice confirms the importance of integration policy in promoting the stability and cohesion of our societies."
"The Hague Programme also mentions that there is a need for better coordination of national policies."
"In November 2004, representatives of the Council and the Member States reached some conclusions on the drafting of common basic principles for integration policy for immigrants."
"The common basic principles state that integration is a dynamic, two-way process of mutual understanding and accommodation by all immigrants and residents of Member States."
"Accordingly, Member States are urged to take account of integration policy and include both immigrants and nationals of Member States in it."
"Frequent interaction between immigrants and Member State citizens is a fundamental mechanism for integration."
"The common basic principles state, in particular, that shared forums for intercultural dialogue, information on immigrants and their cultures and the development of living conditions in urban environments enhance the interactions between immigrants and Member State citizens."
"The common basic principles are based on the conclusions of the Council set forth in December 2005, which took account of the Commission Communication entitled ‘A Common Agenda for Integration: Framework for the Integration of Third-Country Nationals in the European Union’."
"The Communication was adopted in September 2005."
"The importance of integration in connection with access to Community and Member State territory and the need to improve action in this field have been cited in several initiatives, such as the Commission Communication relating to the Policy Plan for Legal Immigration."
"In these contexts the emphasis is on the need for members of the host society to become involved in creating opportunities for the participation of immigrants in European societies in various ways."
"This will be of mutual benefit to both European and third-country citizens."
"Other Community actors and institutions, such as Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, can also do much to promote the participation of EU citizens in the integration of third-country nationals resident in the Union."
"– Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to ask if provision will be made for structures through which European citizens will be able to express an opinion on the integration of immigrants from third countries, so that there is subsequently mutual acceptance and mutual respect, with the objective of the better integration of immigrants into society."
"Does the Finnish Presidency intend to propose such structures of direct participation of citizens in such decisions?"
"."
"Mr President, it is in the Council’s interests in general also to support the more proactive involvement of civil society in the integration of immigrants, because there is a desire to promote the transparency of EU administration in relation to the public."
"It is obviously for the Member States to decide on this and how to create structures for citizens’ platforms at local level, but cooperation at European Union level too will be very important."
"During the Finnish Presidency, the work of the Council will be made significantly open, as the debate on legislative matters in the codecision procedure will be open."
"In addition, the debate on other legislative plans will be made open."
"It will hopefully be one channel via which the people can be encouraged to find out about the criteria for decision-making and have an influence between elections as well."
"Mrs Lehtomäki, I have visited Libyan camps where tens of thousands of refugees from sub-Saharan Africa come in order to be nearer to Europe and to cross the Mediterranean."
"We have FRONTEX, our external frontier protection agency, which is headed, incidentally, by a Finn."
"To what extent do you intend to use this agency to halt the flood of illegal immigrants to Europe?"
"."
"Mr President, the link between a border control agency and integration is a trifle distant in my opinion, but during the Finnish Presidency we shall also seek concrete suggestions and proposals for the work of such an agency."
"On 17 May 2006, a representative of the Austrian Government, Alfred Finz, answered a number of questions from MEPs on corporate taxation in different EU countries."
"In response to a question by Eoin Ryan MEP, Mr Finz indicated that certain Member States had recently introduced new taxation systems under which some businesses were subject to much lower rates of taxation than in the old Member States."
"Mr Finz views lower corporate tax as a form of unfair competition which must be eliminated."
"Does the Presidency—in-Office of the Council agree that the new Member States had the right to introduce their own taxation systems?"
"Would the Council take the view that attempts to harmonise taxation are evidence of a desire on the part of the old Member States to solve their economic problems at the expense of the new Member States?"
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Member States have the right to adopt their own taxation systems within the limits of Community law."
"The Council will consider proposals for harmonisation if and when the Commission makes them."
"We have to remember that on 1 December 1997 the Council adopted a resolution on a code of conduct to apply to business taxation in order to tackle any harmful taxation measures that would or could impact significantly on the location of economic activity in the Community."
"The working group set up to consider the practical aspects of the code makes an assessment on the basis of the criteria set out in the code of conduct whether taxation measures adopted by one Member State constitutes harmful competition or not."
"The relevant Member State voids the taxation measures declared harmful by the working group, on a voluntary basis."
"The Member States are also obliged to refrain from adopting new, harmful measures."
"In addition to this, there are intensive technical preparations under way right now in the Commission relating to the proposal for a common, consolidated, corporation tax base."
"According to the Commission, such a tax base would be used to promote the Lisbon Strategy to a significant extent, because it will help to make the internal market more effective, which would lead to an improved EU competitive position in global markets."
"The proposal does not, however, deal with a rate for income tax."
"– Thank you Minister for your answer, but several times you quoted the Commission and its initiatives."
"I would really like to know what Finland, which is holding the EU Presidency, thinks about tax convergence."
"It is understandable that things, which lead to unfair competition, are bad, but I would like to ask if any attempt to converge taxes is the right thing to do as we are now witnessing such initiatives in the European Union."
"How does Finland view these initiatives?"
"Do you not think that competition between Member States on matters of tax and in tax systems should remain as the opposite would mean that we are really heading towards too much harmonisation?"
"We, the new countries, joined the European Union without knowing that there would be such a tendency today – the movement towards tax harmonisation."
"."
"Mr President, the purpose of this common, consolidated, corporate tax base initiative is to create a corporate tax base that would be simple."
"The initiative does not go into the issue of tax rates, but a tax base."
"Now the technical work is being done."
"It is not the Finnish Presidency’s intention to discuss this in the Council: the purpose is to hear how the technical wok is progressing."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, in the Basque Country we have our own tax system, which is historically separate and different from the Spanish system."
"In other words, there are two tax systems in the Spanish State. The Commission appears not to understand this and wants to change our system."
"Would the Council be in favour of the idea of imposing a uniform tax system for the Member States without their consent or agreement?"
"."
"Mr President, obviously harmful tax competition is a bad thing, but there is still some way to go before we would switch to one harmonised system of taxes for the Member States."
"– Minister, if the consequence of such varying tax rates is to be that more businesses move elsewhere, is thought perhaps being given to the possibility of speeding these deliberations up?"
"Too many jobs are being lost as a result of what is termed subsidy tourism, and we are currently, with regard to regional policy, giving thought to how we can do away with this."
"."
"Mr President, this was perhaps more a comment on the Council than a question."
"Taxation is, as I stated in my original answer, an important matter both for the functioning of the internal market and competition."
"It is also important, therefore, to examine taxation at Union level."
"By deliberately arranging for the dollar to fall in relation to the euro, the United States is waging a merciless economic war on the European Union."
"The deliberate and continuing fall of the dollar is destroying thousands of jobs a month in the European Union area."
"For example, Airbus is obliged to invoice its subcontractors in dollars and not in euros; this puts US firms at an advantage and means that the European plane is in fact a more than 40% American plane."
"What political, diplomatic and economic retaliatory measures is the Council planning to force the United States to support its currency so as finally to ensure free and undistorted competition between the European Union and the United States?"
"."
"Mr President, the exchange rate has changed recently, but the Council is not planning any measures which would compel the United States to prop up the value of its currency."
"In a statement which the President of the ECOFIN Council gave at the spring meeting of the IMF’s International Monetary and Financial Committee, he reiterated the Council’s position on global imbalances, saying that in the medium term the enormous current account imbalances cannot be sustained and it is the combined responsibility of all the major players involved to address the problem."
"Within the context of international cooperation, a macroeconomic and structural policy that aims to maintain growth should be practised to facilitate due rectification of current account deficits and surpluses."
"This way increases in protectionist pressures could be avoided as could sudden fluctuations in exchange rates and risks to the finance industry."
"There are also possible macroeconomic risks that stem from protectionist measures and unilateral action."
"An open, multilateral system of trade is an essential prerequisite for greater continued growth."
"Increased national saving in the United States and domestic growth in Asian countries, in particular, are crucial in any attempt to correct global imbalance."
"The communiqué in April 2006 of the International Monetary and Financial Committee echoed this view, which partners at global level generally accepted."
"Mr President, Mrs Lehtomäki, I note that, notwithstanding talk of the medium term, we are now in the short term."
"The EU employees who, over the next few months, will lose their jobs partly because of our inertia will not be impressed."
"Why, therefore, do we not arrange for the European Central Bank to play an entirely different role under the supervision of the European Parliament?"
"."
"Mr President, as we know, the European Central Bank is an independent body whose main objective is keeping prices stable."
"The Council of Ministers cannot influence decisions on interest rates, and, moreover, the independence of the Central Bank needs to be protected, so that it can continue to do its job."
"– Madam President-in-Office of the Council, if there is parity of exchange with the dollar, it also, of course, has to be borne in mind that Europe pays in dollars when buying oil and gas, and that there is a natural advantage for the European consumer in this."
"Do you believe that oil prices in this area are subject to speculation, or that this is attributable to the currency?"
"."
"Mr President, perhaps it is not my strongest area, and nor does it fall within the competence of the Council, to speculate on future oil prices, but of course the present situation with regard to supply and demand and the direction in which it seems to be headed do not support the hypothesis that prices will quickly drop to a very low level here."
"Will the Council review its procedures for answering parliamentary questions put to it?"
"."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the honourable Member for his interest in the procedures which the Council follows when it answers questions put by Members of Parliament."
"As the European Affairs Minister, I will have the personal honour of answering your questions here in Council Question Time during the next six months."
"With regard to reviewing the procedures, I would like to state that Finland, during its Presidency, wants to return to the practice where questions are answered in the order in which they have come to the attention of the Council, and the Presidency does not, therefore, intend to answer them by subject matter."
"This change notwithstanding, I would like to point out that the general principles on how questions asked the Council are dealt with will remain unchanged."
"Answers during Question Time will still be given in the name of the country to hold the Presidency."
"It will also be the task of the Presidency to submit to the European Parliament written replies to questions which are not dealt with during Question Time owing to a lack of time."
"There are a lot of these this week."
"As for the procedure for written questions, I might say that the Council is at present looking at ways to deal with the ever-growing number of questions."
"President-in-Office, thank you for your reply, which I welcome."
"However, we have a problem: under the Rules of this House every Member is allowed to ask only one priority written question per month."
"Under the same Rules, we can expect an answer within three weeks."
"The Commission managed that, but very often the Council answers take three months."
"The reason very often given to us is that it takes time to get the answer agreed by all the members of the Council."
"In real terms, you are able to give answers off-the-cuff to supplementary oral questions."
"My plea to you is that we find a way of speeding up the process."
"Perhaps there could be a deadline for getting the answers from the other Council members so that you can then give us the answers within the timescale in our Rules."
"If we can help you do that, it will be a great partnership and a great feather in the cap of the Finnish Presidency."
"."
"I agree that speeding up the procedure for answering is highly important."
"Although the Presidency speaks on its own behalf, it has to be and wants to be in line with other Council members."
"That is why it is important to get comments from other Member States."
"However, I am sure that we are capable of improving the current situation."
"I look forward to cooperating with the European Parliament in an efficient way on this issue."
"The Presidency of the Council may or may not be aware that our Rules of Procedure say in its annex on Question Time that, with the agreement of the Council, we may divide Question Time with the Council into questions to the Presidency, questions to the High Representative or questions to the President of the Eurogroup."
"Would the Council Presidency agree – if Parliament were to make a request – to have, maybe once every three months, a specific Question Time with the High Representative focused specifically on foreign policy issues?"
"."
"If the European Parliament makes such a request, we are certainly ready to consider it."
"If it relates to the High Representative, I think that he also has to agree with the procedure."
"But the Council has not received any such proposals, at least not as far as I know."
"You have now had one hour’s experience of answering questions from the European Parliament."
"At the end of the Presidency you will have been here several times and obtained more experience – you have done very well during your first Question Time – would you be willing to give your practical recommendations to the Council concerning Question Time?"
"For instance, in December could you analyse what we could do better during Question Time?"
"Somehow we have to make these occasions rather more open to our citizens."
"Some people will even watch this on the Internet or on Euronews."
"Somehow it must be improved."
"I would like to hear your practical recommendations at the end of the Presidency."
"Would you be willing to do that for us in Question Time?"
"."
"I am sure that during the coming six months we will get to know each other very well, so these kinds of recommendations could also be prepared in close cooperation."
"I – and we, as the Presidency – are more than willing to make best use of all the experience and practical arrangements and recommendations that might come up during the Presidency."
"I would also just mention that, personally, I find it a challenging experience to answer these questions."
"Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"The next item is the joint debate on"
"- the oral question by Doris Pack on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, Gisela Kallenbach on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, Hannes Swoboda on behalf of the PSE Group, Erik Meijer, Ignasi Guardans Cambó, Jelko Kacin and Henrik Lax to the Council, on visa policy towards the countries of the Western Balkans (O-0063/2006 B6-0315/2006),"
"- the oral question by Sarah Ludford, Jelko Kacin, Henrik Lax and Ignasi Guardans Cambó, on behalf of the ALDE Group, to the Council on visa facilitation for the countries of the Western Balkans, (O-0077/2006 B6-0320/2006), and"
"- the oral question by Sarah Ludford, Jelko Kacin, Henrik Lax and Ignasi Guardans Cambó, on behalf of the ALDE Group, to the Council, on visa facilitation for the countries of the Western Balkans (O-0078/2006 B6-0321/2006)."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the countries of South-Eastern Europe, as they move towards the European Union, must reform themselves; they must adopt standards and work together on a regional basis, which means, in practical terms, that they must be reconciled with one another."
"They know that, and they are doing it, some of them faster than others, yet, despite all their efforts, they are denied unhindered access to the European Community, something that the Yugoslavs, at any rate, always enjoyed."
"The ministers of internal affairs, and the national politicians too, ought, for a moment, to visualise themselves or their families having only some EUR 200 to live on and having to fork out practically all of that to get a visa, a Schengen visa, and a transit visa, and, in order to hand over the money, having to queue, sometimes for days or even weeks."
"Even our counterparts in the national parliaments of South-Eastern Europe have to apply for a visa every time they want to attend meetings of the Council of Europe."
"Over 70% of the young people in Serbia, Bosnia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Kosovo or Albania have never ventured outside their own region or their own country."
"We, in the European Union, are currently opening up our educational programmes; how are they supposed to work if the visa rules are so onerous?"
"How are businesses supposed to move in if local workers cannot travel to the company headquarters – in France or England, say – except subject to very difficult conditions?"
"In Bosnia and Herzegovina, for example, the crime rate is less than the average across the European Union, so why, despite that, do we not make it easier for the people who live there to come to us?"
"Where the conditions for the issuing of visas are concerned, Russia gets better treatment than these countries do, and one wonders why."
"These countries are in the midst of the EU, and we ourselves have a real interest in their well-being and in their growth and development."
"This is a matter of our own self-interest."
"It was with the help of our European Union that Bosnia and Herzegovina managed to secure its borders, and the neighbouring countries are doing the same, so let us take off our blinkers and help to do away with these unnecessary and humiliating barriers."
"– Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, even though the Members of this House who are speaking in today’s debate are from different countries and different political groupings, what we all agree on is that more must be done to bring this region, which runs the risk of becoming a black hole in terms of European unification, closer to the European Union."
"We are well acquainted with its problems."
"We know about the nationalism and the narrow-mindedness, but we also know of the earnest desire, particularly among young people, to enter into this Europe and adopt European standards."
"It is not only in the interests of these people, but also in our own, that these connections may be made."
"We do indeed, then, hope that the Finnish Presidency will continue what the Austrian Presidency – although it did not initiate it – certainly stepped up, and we also put our hopes in Commissioner Frattini, who has shown himself to be very knowledgeable and very willing."
"We know from our travels in these countries just what a favourable reception is given to much of what he has said and to the headway he has made where this visa issue is concerned."
"Yes, I know, it is the ministers of the interior, above all, who are standing in the way, but Mrs Pack was right to say just now that those who have wrongdoing on their minds will get into the European Union anyway."
"Let us be honest about the fact that they will obtain a visa by devious means or find other ways of getting into the European Union without one, but those whose intentions are innocent, those who want to study or gain further training, those who want to invest and establish economic links, those who are politically active, must endure the ignominy of spending days, weeks, or even months in their quest for a visa."
"I am well aware that there are certain conditions that have to be met."
"The countries concerned must also ensure that the obligations to take people back are met and other criteria complied with, but I really do urge both of you to use your influence to ensure that these countries, and their young people in particular, are given the chance to get to know Europe, to become familiar with our standards, and then the process of becoming part of the European Union will be made all the easier for them."
"I hope that you will both be very pro-active in bringing this about, not only so that these countries may be helped, but also so that we may be helped to build up, with the young people of the Balkans and of South-Eastern Europe, a Europe in which we can all share."
"Citizens of the countries of the Western Balkans experience significant problems in travelling around Europe."
"The most extreme example of all is Kosovo where they have passports which are not recognised by many European countries."
"Commissioner, Kosovo Albanians are exchanging their UNMIK passports for other passports and we, Member States of the European Union, are literally forcing them into crime and into a search for other, parallel passports."
"This serves, in effect, to illustrate the sheer misery of our current visa regime."
"Surely, Commissioner, as Members of the European Union, we can do more to place greater value on UNMIK passports."
"In order to speed up the process of Europeanisation in the Western Balkans, we need a vastly more flexible approach, except in the case of criminals, of course – they are very resourceful and will find their way everywhere."
"I am talking of ordinary people who would like to experience Europe and European values in practice, and preferably while they are still growing up, receiving an education and building a set of values."
"For this reason, Commissioner, it seems to me that we have to do more to find a solution for people in the various countries of the Western Balkans so they do not have to wait for hours on end for a visa only to be told eventually by an embassy clerk that they cannot get a visa and that they must go back."
"Visas are issued in capital cities."
"These are the least developed parts of Europe and these people have to invest a huge amount of time and a lot of money, not to mention pride, when applying for visas."
"It is, therefore, only fair that we should amend the current visa regime."
"– Mr President, over recent years, I have been a very frequent visitor to the countries of the Western Balkans, and whenever I have been there, the main thing that people wanted to talk about was the restrictive visa policy of the EU Member States."
"This is a region in which generations are growing up with their only experience of Western Europe being derived from time spent there as refugees or from the television, neither of which are really suitable ways of familiarising oneself with good examples of how democratic societies based on the rule of law work in practice."
"Experience of such things is out of the reach of most people in South-Eastern Europe or involves considerable obstacles, and that is where there must be changes; on that point I am in full agreement with my fellow Members."
"We know, too, Commissioner Frattini, that you and your fellow Commissioner Mr Rehn are strongly supportive of this process, but it is proving tough going and several Member States are standing in the way."
"It is in the best interests of the EU of 25 that we should act once and for all, for any further delay in giving people the freedom to travel is ammunition to the nationalist, anti-European and, indeed, anti-democratic groupings in these countries."
"Any and every delay isolates those people who have pinned their hopes on European integration, and, as my fellow Members have already said, it hinders the economic development that is so urgently needed."
"Although Austria had put the Western Balkans at the top of its list of priorities, no new decisions were taken about them; it is for that reason that we request the Finnish Presidency of the Council, as a matter of urgency, to take up this cause, to appeal to its colleagues in office to be more open in dealing with this matter, and not to be taken in by the spurious argument according to which a restrictive visa policy prevents crime, be it organised or of any other kind, for the opposite is more likely to be the case."
"I have a final request to make of you, that you tell the Member States to treat applicants for visas in their external delegations with the same dignity and respect as they themselves would expect when they are overseas."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we well know, at present all citizens of countries in the Western Balkans, except for Croatia, need a visa when travelling to the European Union."
"Visa requirements, as has been mentioned in this discussion, obviously complicate travel arrangements and raise costs."
"We must remember, however, that this issue is crucial to the control of the Union’s external borders."
"I quite understand that the European Union’s policy on visas is seen as awkward in the Western Balkans, and even as a factor that is hampering rapprochement with the Union."
"In the area of the former Yugoslavia they still remember a time when visas were not needed."
"It is obvious that, for example, the mobility of youth and students needs to be facilitated."
"This is a way of lending support to the notions of access to information, open democracy and social development."
"One important goal of future flexibility on visa requirements will be to promote and facilitate contact between young people in the Western Balkans and the rest of Europe."
"The EU has nominated the countries of the Western Balkans as possible candidate countries."
"They have a clear EU perspective, which also ultimately means relaxing visa requirements."
"There is nevertheless some way to go before we can start negotiating the waiving of visa requirements."
"That will require the Western Balkan countries to introduce significant administrative reforms in, for example, greater security of documentation and the fight against organised crime and corruption."
"At the Thessaloniki Summit in summer 2003, the European Council stated that the issue of visas was important for the countries of the Western Balkans."
"Since then, the Commission has discussed with each Western Balkan country the necessary administrative preparations to make the visa regime easier and, in the long term, waive visa requirements altogether."
"In January 2006 the Commission issued a communication on the Western Balkans in which it set out a large number of proposals also to make the visa regime easier in accordance with the Hague Programme."
"The Council is committed to the implementation of the proposals on the Thessaloniki agenda, and has also stated that it supports the Commission’s proposals."
"One important step forward in the area of increased mobility is the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on local border traffic, due to enter into force soon."
"This will make it easier for border residents to cross the external borders of the EU."
"This will be of special importance in the case of the Western Balkans when Bulgaria and Romania join the EU."
"On the request of the Council, the Commission is also to put forward proposals on the start of talks on visa flexibility agreements with all the countries in the Western Balkans."
"Special action would be taken, for example, to promote researcher and student exchanges and facilitate the movement of other separately identifiable groups."
"The visa flexibility agreements will be separately negotiable Community agreements within the framework of the Schengen rules."
"They will be closely linked to the readmission agreements which the Hague Programme sets forth as a condition of easing visa requirements."
"This way the Union will also benefit from the arrangement because the countries in the Western Balkans will at the same time undertake to readmit citizens of third countries who have passed through them illegally on their way to the EU."
"At present only Albania has a readmission agreement with the Union."
"The countries of the Western Balkans have bilateral readmission agreements with many Member States of the Union, so we assume that negotiations at Community level will also go smoothly."
"The Commission has already put forward proposals for talks both on visa flexibility agreements and readmission agreements with Macedonia, in the former Republic of Yugoslavia."
"These mandates for negotiation are now being discussed by the Council at working group level."
"When the Council has adopted them, the Commission can begin talks."
"Proposals for mandates for other countries in the Western Balkans are expected to come from the Commission in July."
"The working groups will try to deal with the proposals as quickly as possible for a decision to be taken by the Council."
"The General Affairs and External Relations Council, in its conclusions of June this year, hoped that the mandates for visa flexibility and readmission agreements would be adopted this year, so that talks on visa flexibility could be brought to a conclusion with all the countries in the Western Balkans by the end of next year."
"We hope that the first agreements will be in place as early as this year."
"The Finnish Presidency will aim to support this timetable of objectives, which would also ensure that the increases in visa fees that take effect next year would not apply to the Western Balkan countries."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the opinions of the Members of this Parliament all point in the right direction, which is the same one that the European Commission intends to take, and I find the words of the President-in-Office of the Council very reassuring."
"The Commission endorses the European vocation of the countries of the Western Balkans, because it considers the region to be strategic for Europe."
"We have worked intensively over the past six months with the Austrian Presidency and we hope that some emergency measures can be implemented."
"These emergency measures will be part of an overall package that will be the subject of a political agreement with all the countries of the Western Balkans concerned."
"In the first place, these measures are intended to facilitate the visa regime, and I refer to certain categories, above all students, researchers and the business community, whom we hope to encourage to move around more freely in order to attract investment and to invest."
"It will be a simplified regime as regards procedure and also as regards the availability of visas, which – and here I agree with the speakers – is currently too restrictive."
"Within the same political agreement package, we are planning agreements for the readmission of illegal immigrants."
"We have already done so in a few cases; for example the agreement with Albania has been signed and is already in force."
"This is a Europe-Albania agreement for the repatriation of illegal immigrants who come from Albania."
"As the President—in-Office of the Council has just mentioned, we intend to sign the same type of agreement with the other States as rapidly as possible."
"It is also obvious that the concerns of the Member States will have to be taken into consideration."
"They are especially concerned about the level of security in terms of preventing corruption, preventing and combating organised crime, and the different types of trafficking, including, unfortunately, the trafficking of human beings in the region."
"We will ask these countries to collaborate more closely with Europe in order to improve the conditions for combating organised crime and corruption."
"In this context, one measure that we feel is useful for exerting pressure on some Member States, which have raised objections over the past months, is the request that these countries equip themselves as quickly as possible with passports that conform to European standards, that is which comply with the rules of security as regards combating the falsification of passports and identity documents."
"This will help to prevent people travelling under false identities."
"I think that countries in this region have the political will to do this."
"I have personally met all the Ministers of Home Affairs and the Prime Ministers of the countries in this region and I can tell you now that, before 15 July, I will apply to the Commission for mandates to negotiate visa facilitation agreements for all the countries of the Western Balkans."
"I will do so for Albania, Bosnia Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro; it has already been done in the case of Macedonia because the Commission approved my proposal a few weeks ago."
"By 15 July, all the countries in the Western Balkans will have seen our formal proposal to the Council."
"I have reason to believe that the proposal will be announced on 15 July to the Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers, the first Council under the Finnish Presidency."
"I intend to provide initial information on the details of the proposals, if the Presidency, as I hope, accepts them, on 24 July to the Council of Ministers of Home Affairs, whom I will of course provide with a copy of the documents that the Commission has approved."
"I strongly hope, or rather, after talking with the Ministers representing the Presidency, I am quite sure that, by the end of this year, there will be a concrete possibility of the largest possible number of mandates to negotiate visa facilitation agreements being approved."
"This will have two immediate results, the first being that we will be able to implement the visa facilitation agreements and, simultaneously, the readmission agreements, by 2007, therefore over a very short period of time."
"I hope that the negotiations will be over quickly if, as I believe, the political will exists."
"This will mean not only that, as from 2007, the countries of the Western Balkans will benefit from a facilitated visa regime, but also that these countries will not have to bear the increased cost of a visa, which is rising to EUR 60, which has already been decided by the Council."
"I am sure that all the countries of the Western Balkans will fall into this category and will thus be equipped with an administrative and bureaucratic, even preferential, visa regime and will not have to bear the increase in cost."
"This is the precise agenda that I propose to follow; there is an understanding within the European Commission with Commissioner Olli Rehn, who is responsible for enlargement, and therefore the negotiating proposal will be on the Council table within a few days."
"– Mr President, I too should like to take my turn in thanking the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Frattini for their reports."
"However, I should like to express the particular concern that, three years after the decisions by the Thessaloniki European Council, there has been no progress in changes to the visa system."
"I believe that what the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Frattini have told us today is, of course, positive but, Commissioner, we cannot wait until the end of 2007 to complete the procedure for changing the visa system."
"I fear that the end of 2007 will be far too late."
"The problem is not procedural, it is deeply political."
"It is a problem of the strategic credibility of the European Union."
"It is a problem of contributing to peace, to stability, to cooperation, to the strengthening of the European integration of the countries of the Western Balkans."
"In fact, no one can understand why negotiations have started with Russia, China and Ukraine but not with the countries of the Western Balkans, why the system is much simplified for entry visas to the European Union from Pakistan and Iran, for young people from Pakistan and Iran, but not for young people from the Western Balkans."
"Why, Commissioner, have visa fees been increased to EUR 60?"
"I understand what you said now, that they will not apply if agreements are signed."
"However, I fear that 2007 is far too late."
"I believe that the increase should not apply for these countries as of now."
"I believe ultimately that the European Union must send a strong message, say no to the ghettoisation ..."
"Mr President, Mrs Lehtomäki, Mr Frattini, the fact that the western Balkan countries are being walled in by visa requirements is a tragedy for those countries, whose people have been able to travel freely in Western Europe for 20 years."
"For those of us still able to do so, it is almost impossible to understand what it means suddenly to be placed behind a border that cannot be crossed without a visa."
"It does not stop only people from getting about."
"In the same way, thoughts are prevented from crossing borders."
"In today’s knowledge-based economy, mobility is just as important a requirement as access to modern information technology."
"In today’s globalised world, visa policy cannot, therefore, take the same form as it did in the 1950s or even the 1980s."
"That must be our starting point when the EU formulates its visa policy."
"As Mrs Lehtomäki also said, the EU needs a clear plan for simplifying the visa procedure and for finally getting rid of the visa requirement."
"It must be made clear to the countries that are our neighbours what conditions they have to fulfil in order, firstly, to see visa procedures genuinely simplified and, secondly, to see the compulsory visa requirement one day done away with."
"We must be able to promise them that the visa requirement will be abolished when fewer than 2% of visa applications are rejected."
"I welcome Mr Frattini’s objectives, which are very constructive."
"One of the obvious goals of the EU’s bilateral visa agreement must, however, be to facilitate mobility for all, and not only for certain categories of people."
"We give out the wrong signal if we place people in different categories, such as students and cultural figures as distinct from farmers and parents of small children."
"The fact is that everyone must have the right to inhale the European atmosphere."
"It is a problem that, for example, the agreement with Russia is of such limited scope."
"It applies to only a small number of people – fewer than a tenth of people travelling – and does not in practice simplify the visa procedures."
"Not even the fee is to be reduced."
"On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I should like to see a more ambitious visa policy, genuinely simplified procedures for the Balkan countries and, indeed, for everyone, and the clear objective of abolishing the compulsory visa requirement."
"It must be made quicker, cheaper and simpler to obtain a visa, and the European Parliament must be allowed to comment on the authority to negotiate that is now in the process of being produced."
"."
"Mr President, it is obvious from this debate that Parliament would like the Council and the Commission to take this matter to heart, and that is what has happened."
"This is a very important issue for us."
"Although Mr Lax raised the point that people should not be categorised, perhaps, however, it is particularly important to facilitate the movement of young Europeans in this continent as quickly as possible."
"Our aim is for the first agreements to be signed during the course of this year."
"Visa flexibility is a very real issue that affects ordinary people and which can strengthen rapprochement with the European Union in the countries of the Western Balkans."
"It is also a way of lending support to the stability and development of this region, and it is therefore important that progress be made in this area."
"We nevertheless have to bear in mind that this is also about controlling the Union’s external borders and not just an expression of political will."
"We will, however, push energetically forward with this issue."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the joint debate on"
"- the report (A6-0237/2006) by Richard Corbett, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the conclusion of an interinstitutional agreement taking the form of a joint statement concerning the draft for a Council Decision amending Decision 1999/468/EC laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (new regulatory procedure with scrutiny) [10126/1/2006 – C6-0208/2006 – 2006/2152(ACI)], and"
"- the report (A6-0236/2006) by Richard Corbett, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the draft Council Decision amending Decision 1999/468/EC laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [10126/1/2006 – C6-0190/2006 – 2002/0298(CNS)]."
"."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the European Parliament’s rapporteurs, Mr Daul and Mr Corbett, for their unrelenting efforts in reaching a compromise."
"I would like to highlight the very good cooperation that has prevailed between our two institutions, especially in the last ten months."
"In these difficult and complex negotiations, the Commission, as you know, has been a forceful advocate of the European Parliament’s reinforced control rights over comitology."
"Tribute also has to be paid in this context to the energy deployed by the UK and Austrian Presidencies."
"As a result, the European Parliament and the Commission have succeeded in convincing even the most reluctant Member States to make a major breakthrough in terms of parliamentary control."
"If the compromise package is endorsed by Parliament tomorrow, Parliament will have a right of veto on the substance of most implementing measures."
"This applies of course to implementing measures concerning acts adopted under codecision."
"We can safely say that a decisive battle has been won in favour of more democratic control."
"To respond to Parliament’s concerns, the Commission has made several additional commitments."
"We will further improve transparency and access to comitology documents."
"We will make sure that the period for consultation only starts when Parliament has received all language versions."
"We will screen all existing acts adopted under codecision, and, where appropriate, make proposals for adaptation before the end of next year."
"Finally, as stated in the trilateral declaration, we have agreed to adapt 25 codecision instruments as a matter of urgency."
"The Commission will make the corresponding proposals before the end of the year."
"The two reports by Mr Corbett were adopted by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs by an extremely large majority, but I wish to say a few words about the sole amendment tabled, in view of your vote tomorrow."
"This amendment refers to a resolution, a crucial point of which was the systematic adoption of sunset clauses."
"I believe that this amendment goes in the wrong direction."
"It undermines the mutual trust that has guided the three institutions during the negotiations."
"It contradicts the content of the joint declaration, whereby the legislator agrees that the implementing powers should be conferred without time limits."
"I hope that you will take the Commission’s view into consideration when you vote tomorrow."
"I will limit my introductory remarks to these points."
"I am keen of course to listen to the honourable Members’ comments on this major reform."
"."
"Mr President, I suspect that there was a plot in this House in scheduling this debate right now, because it was expected that this would be the time at which England would have been playing against France."
"Mr Daul and I, having been involved in these negotiations, felt we were the victims of this plot."
"But, as we know, England did not qualify, so perhaps it matters somewhat less – at least for me."
"We have before us technically two reports for procedural reasons, but they concern a single package: the proposed revision of the 1999 Council decision on comitology and the joint declarations which, because they constitute a sort of interinstitutional agreement, are subject to a separate report."
"They are globally a package and together they represent a huge step forward for Parliament – a major transformation of the comitology system."
"My constituents back home in Yorkshire would be asking me what comitology is."
"It is not exactly the subject they are talking about day in, day out in the pubs and clubs of Yorkshire."
"Every legislature has a system of delegating powers to the executive."
"In national parliaments that is typically legislation that confers on the government powers to adopt further measures: the statutory instrument in the UK, the in Belgium, decrees in various other countries."
"The systems change slightly, but it is quite normal to confer powers on the executive, not least to deal with technical details and complex matters once the main legislation has laid down the general principles."
"What is unusual in our system in the European Union is that, when we confer such powers on the Commission, we oblige it to act in conjunction with a committee of national civil servants."
"In many cases those committees have the power to block the Commission and refer the matter back to the Council."
"We have always found that objectionable: firstly because only committees of national civil servants and not Parliament have the right to scrutinise the Commission and refer questions back, and secondly because matters are referred back only to one branch of the legislative authority – the Council – even when the basic act has been adopted under codecision."
"We also found the system to be thoroughly untransparent and complex with the numerous committees that give rise to the name of comitology."
"Only an expert could study it and understand it."
"Over the years we have obtained small concessions."
"We now receive every document that is sent to a comitology committee."
"Since 1999 we have had some power to object within a certain time limit if we think that a measure goes beyond the powers that have been delegated."
"However, up to now, our fundamental objections have been unanswered."
"With this agreement there is a transformation of the situation: henceforth Parliament will be able to say no to any implementing measure of a quasi-legislative nature adopted through the comitology system, and if we say no the measure cannot be enacted."
"The Commission will either have to put forward a new proposal or table new legislation under the codecision procedure."
"That is a huge step forward for Parliament – and not just for Parliament – in terms of the accountability and transparency of the whole Union system."
"That is why this agreement is so important."
"Nonetheless, there have been some issues with which we have been ill at ease and where we had to negotiate to ensure that our position was fully safeguarded."
"For instance, we have in this agreement a reference to the Lamfalussy ."
"Indeed, by mentioning it, as regards the Commission, we are actually upgrading that from a mere statement in Parliament by the Commission President and a letter from the relevant Commissioner to the relevant committee chairman, to a declaration by the whole institution."
"So we have upgraded the relevant parts of the Lamfalussy ."
"That is also important."
"We have gained satisfaction on time limits: it is an important step forward that three months can be extended to four, especially – as Commissioner Wallström pointed out – as the clock starts running once we get the text in all the languages."
"That will give us adequate time to consider these matters."
"There has also been this issue of sunset clauses."
"I think that with this agreement Parliament will not normally need to use sunset clauses."
"We used them before, because when we delegated powers to the Commission we lost those powers for ever."
"With very loose control over how they were exercised, it was quite normal that we wanted to use sunset clauses as a way of reasserting control if need be."
"However, with this agreement we can say no to any implementing measures we dislike, even every single one of them, if we are dealing with quasi-legislative measures."
"We therefore do not need to use sunset clauses."
"The agreement reflects that – in that we acknowledge that the principles of good legislation mean that powers should be delegated without a sunset clause, without a time limit."
"But the principle that the legislature should, if necessary, be able to set a sunset clause – that is a power we have under the Treaty – is recognised to the extent that the agreement says very clearly ‘without prejudice to the rights of the legislative authority’."
"As is said, we do have the right, but I believe that we will not need to use it except perhaps in exceptional circumstances that we cannot foresee at present."
"We recognised that as part of the negotiations, because the other institutions felt very strongly about it, but also, in my opinion, because as a parliament we realised that we will not need to do so."
"With this agreement we should be more relaxed about delegating matters to the Commission because we will have that control afterwards."
"We have the ludicrous situation in our Union where we sometimes have two or three readings on subjects such as the width of tyres for tractors, which in any national context would have been delegated to the government to deal with – this is because we have been reluctant to delegate."
"With the assurance that we can control what we delegate, there is no reason for us not to delegate much more and more frequently."
"That is another reason for welcoming this agreement."
"That is why my group and our committee, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, rejected the amendments to which the Commissioner referred."
"It is only a recital – Parliament is not reaffirming the resolution to which it refers – but I do not see the need for a reference."
"My group – and I think other groups too – may be voting against this amendment if it is indeed confirmed by the group that tabled it."
"I will be listening to other speakers with interest in a minute."
"There is a remaining issue: the adaptation of existing legislation."
"Commissioner Wallström referred to the package of 25 measures that will be adapted urgently, with a proposal by the end of this year."
"Beyond that the Commission has undertaken to carry out a survey of all existing legislation to see what needs to be adapted and will make a proposal."
"But we have no undertaking from the Council to act within any given timetable, so we as a Parliament will have to watch that very carefully."
"We have a ceasefire."
"I do not want to break the ceasefire, but we will have to watch very carefully that the Council looks at this seriously within the necessary timetable."
"So this may not be completely the end of the story, but nonetheless I think it is a huge breakthrough, a huge advance for Parliament."
"I would like to finish in the way that Commissioner Wallström began, which is to thank all those involved."
"Certainly my thanks are due to the Commission."
"Its position is completely different to the Commission’s position of a few years ago and I think Commissioner Wallström can take much of the credit for that."
"The Commission has moved to a position where it was very supportive of our position."
"I think our positions were virtually identical for most of these negotiations."
"I would like to thank the British and the Austrian Presidencies: the British Presidency that initiated the resumption of the Council’s consideration of this matter, the Austrian Presidency that took it forward so ably."
"Of course I would like to thank my fellow negotiator, Mr Daul, the Chairman of the Conference of Committee Chairmen."
"We went through many meetings together over a six-month period."
"I am very glad that tonight I can report to this packed House – at least those Members who are not watching the football! – that we have a very important result which I think is not just good for this Parliament, but is actually good for our Union."
"Mr Corbett, I have finally understood what comitology means and when I am in Yorkshire I will go into all the pubs to explain it."
"."
"Mr President, first of all, let me, as a German, congratulate Commissioner Frattini on yesterday’s football result and then, rather quickly, move on to the matter in hand."
"There is nothing at all personal about what I shall say about it; all I want to do is counteract some misconceptions that are becoming current."
"We are not debating this issue today because the Commission wanted us to, nor, indeed, out of any desire for it on the part of the Council, which, lamentably, left the Chamber before the debate began."
"We are discussing this issue because the committees that have to work with these agreements – and on this there are major differences in this House – decided that we would."
"Reference has been made to the British Presidency’s putting this subject on the agenda, and that it indeed did, and because – and this is where comitology comes into it – certain Committees of this House, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs being one of them, were no longer willing to write out a blank cheque and to delegate something without having the right to check up on what was done with it, and that is what we are talking about today; not about giving this House a present, but about something that is the least that it is entitled to in a democratic process."
"I am, then, all the more astonished by what has been going on recently."
"At the outset, Commissioner, you said that you were in favour of democracy, and you ended up saying that the sunset clause was less than appropriate."
"Any parliament is perfectly entitled to place time limits on legislation, and I think it intolerable that the Commission or the Council should make statements of that sort or try to deny this House that right."
"I would just like to remind the Council that, with reference to the draft Constitution and in the debates on it, it went so far as to agree to the delegation having the right of call-back, yet today, it wants nothing to do with it."
"Progress has been made – yes, there is no disputing that – and now we have to build on that progress."
"The agreement must prove its worth in practice."
"For example, the committees – and here I am talking about my own – received the first consultative draft from the Commission as late as just before the summer break; after the summer break, the eight-week deadline had expired, and we were then told that our decision was expected in three months’ time."
"It is practice that will demonstrate that the agreement works and that we do not have to abandon our rights."
"What I would like from the Commission, and even more so from the Council, would be to see those who, in the developing world, plead the cause of democracy and the right of codetermination – and that is mainly done by the foreign ministries – at least applying that same standard in their dealings with the European Parliament; that really would be a great step forward."
"Mr President, my colleague, Mr Corbett, spoke of a good result."
"Having just seen a television screen displaying a score of one nil, I consider, in a thoroughly European spirit, that, yes, it is a good result."
"Mr Corbett spoke of the situation of the people of Yorkshire."
"Far be it from me to discourage him, but I should nonetheless like to convince him that he still has a little bit of work to do in bringing each of the Members of this House around to the idea of the crucial importance either of comitology or of the results obtained within the framework of the negotiations that have just been completed."
"On this point, I place my faith in his powers of persuasion."
"I should very much like to thank not only our negotiators, Mr Corbett and Mr Daul, for the result at which we have arrived, but also Mr Radwan and all the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, without whom these negotiations would not have been begun."
"Basically, I wish to put the Commission on its guard."
"From this point on, you have an important duty in respect of Parliament, that of getting the implementing measures under way in a framework that has now been clearly redefined."
"We are regularly questioned about the need to monitor the way in which the Member States apply or implement the legislation on which we deliberate in this House."
"In the same spirit, then, we shall have to check that the Commission, for its part, is doing what it has to do to ensure that the implementing measures are ready within reasonable periods of time."
"We shall also have to review the European Parliament’s Rules of Procedure so as to adapt our procedures to these new rights that we have to be able to exercise in full."
"Everyone will be delighted this evening with the outcome of the negotiations."
"That being said, I should like now to return to three issues that, in my view, remain unresolved."
"The first is that of the status of European Parliament observers within the Commission’s expert committees."
"The fact is that if we want to exercise in full this oversight and right of call-back where comitology is concerned, we need to be able, under the same conditions as the representatives of the Council, to follow on a day-to-day basis the work of the competent committees where implementation is concerned."
"My second question concerns sunset clauses. In the case of these, the minimum we obtained in the declaration constitutes the guarantee we needed in order to accept the agreement."
"My third and final question is by way of a warning to the Commission."
"In a case where, in the quasi-legislative sphere, the European Parliament refuses an implementing measure as proposed by the Commission, the latter will have not only the opportunity to propose a new wording, but also a duty to do so. Otherwise, it will not be possible to implement level 1."
"."
"Mr President, my group is pleased to offer its strong support for this important reform, which is a further signal that Parliament is making great progress with its constitutional development."
"I would like to add thanks to all the main contributors to the complex negotiations."
"The Regulatory Committee has proved to be the most troublesome aspect of comitology and way beyond the effective scrutiny of Parliament."
"The present package has three consequences for Parliament."
"First, it puts it on an equal footing with the Council."
"Second, it should encourage Parliament to trust the Commission more to exercise and make prudent use of the executive authority that properly belongs to it."
"Parliament can surrender some of its preoccupations with minutiae, opening up opportunities for it to focus on politics rather than the technical aspects."
"Finally, the change will force Parliament to sharpen up and upgrade the way the committees sift and scrutinise the product of comitology."
"We need to be fully prepared to shoulder our greater responsibilities with skill and care."
"."
"Mr President, as the rapporteur Mr Corbett said, this is a breakthrough."
"It is welcome and I am glad about it."
"Parliament’s supervisory powers hitherto in the comitology procedure have been virtually a farce."
"The Commission has many a time even neglected its obligation to inform Parliament of its decisions."
"Parliament recently took legal action against the Commission for exceeding its powers in comitology."
"The case began on an initiative by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, when the Commission, exceeding its powers, had granted an exemption regarding the banned fire retardant Deca-BDE."
"Now this case is being rectified in two ways."
"Parliament will have the right to block future comitology decisions by a majority of Members."
"This Deca-BDE case was rectified at the end of June, when the Commission actually reversed its decision, which means that this hazardous substance will be removed from electronic equipment."
"I am glad about that."
"– I too am suffering at the moment because of the game between Portugal and France, not, incidentally, France and England, as Mr Corbett predicted."
"This debate on the democratic control of regulatory acts signals a new era for European democracy."
"Europe is no longer intergovernmental and merely a negotiating area."
"It is an entity in itself and an area of integration."
"It wants to be a democracy with its own legitimacy, which is much more than the sum of the legitimacies of its Member States put together."
"This path towards a new era involves decision-making and implementation procedures."
"Ultimately, these procedures will be at the sharp end of the legitimacy challenge facing all political ranks."
"I refer to the challenge of transparency, the challenge of responsibility, the challenge of effectiveness, and the challenge of ensuring acceptance and trust among those at whom this is aimed."
"Parliamentary control of regulatory acts already provided for in a Constitution in waiting is more than putting the democratic power to legislate on a par with the democratic power to control."
"The European institutions are assuming that Europe must have the profile of a genuine European democracy and that a genuine European democracy is incompatible with implementing acts that are bureaucratically removed from the European citizens and their representative bodies."
"This is just a small step towards the sound construction of a strong, democratic European centre with decision-making chains that are permanently open to scrutiny as regards their legitimacy."
"It would be a good idea to involve the national parliaments in appointing national experts to the committees."
"In a European democracy, which is our project and our desire, comitology would set out the reality of networking that strengthens and does not detract from the legitimacy of the political union."
"Mr President, it is good that we in this House can now get stuck into the Commission’s comitology procedure; that is progress and a great achievement by those who have been conducting the negotiations, and one for which we are grateful to them."
"The only thing is that it does have a few blemishes. The whole thing has to do with the codecision procedure rather than the consultation procedure."
"It is the consultation procedure that still applies to our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and, now that it is considering the organic farming regulation, we can once more see how the Commission is attempting to encroach on the Committee’s powers, but we are unable to tackle these attempts head-on, and that must change."
"That is a defect in what has been agreed here."
"When we get the proposed constitution, the codecision procedure will apply in agriculture too, but we do not have it yet."
"I hope this will not be another occasion for beating about the bush when it comes to implementation, so that we end up stuck with the consultation procedure and have to live with it and with a situation in which the Commission continues to enjoy rights that are incompatible with any democratic standard."
"."
"Mr President, the comments by Members here demonstrate how much thought and enthusiasm has gone into this important reform, and quite rightly so."
"We have injected more transparency and more democracy into the procedures."
"From now on the European Parliament should be in a position to delegate implementing powers in all conscience to the Commission without giving up its legitimate rights of scrutiny."
"According to the new procedure, if Parliament were to object to the substance of an implementing measure, the Commission would be prevented from adopting it in that form."
"With these substantially improved control rights we see no need for the legislator to set a time limit for the delegation of implementing powers to the Commission."
"On the contrary, I believe that this package should provide a stable solution for the future."
"This was, of course, the purpose of the negotiations."
"Let me come finally to some practical issues, because if you endorse the deal tomorrow we will have to continue our good cooperation."
"This will be done in several ways: firstly, thanks to the Commission’s forthcoming alignment proposals; secondly, via the promised upgrade of the comitology register; and thirdly, through the revision of our 2000 bilateral agreement on the procedures for implementing the comitology decisions."
"I look forward to continuing to work with you on these issues and I thank you for your contributions to the debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the joint debate on"
"- the report (A6-0186/2006) by Patrick Gaubert, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the establishment of a mutual information procedure concerning Member States’ measures in the areas of asylum and immigration [COM(2005)0480 C6-0335/2005 2005/0204(CNS)],"
"- the report (A6-0190/2006) by Stavros Lambrinidis, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on strategies and means for the integration of immigrants in the European Union [2006/2056(INI)],"
"- the oral question by Martin Schulz and Martine Roure, on behalf of the PSE Group, to the Commission, on European Union immigration policy (O-0061/2006 B6-0311/2006),"
"- the oral question by Ewa Klamt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, to the Commission, on European Union immigration policy (O-0064/2006 B6-0313/2006),"

"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thousands of immigrants are losing their lives trying to reach our European continent."
"Ceuta, Melilla, the Canaries, Lampedusa and Malta have become tragic symbols in the task of managing migratory flows, particularly from the South of the world."
"Since Monday, nearly 1 000 men have attempted to land and have landed in the Canaries."
"The European Union must not push the problem back outside its borders."
"The countries of Africa cannot resolve the problem of migratory pressure on their own."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I recently led a delegation of MEPs in the Canaries."
"It is true that the European Union is proposing aid and protection at the borders, but there are still men and women thronging the beaches."
"The meeting on migration, which will be held next week in Rabat, is a first, very encouraging step."
"Finally, representatives from the countries of Africa and Europe are going to get together around a table in order to find some solutions."
"The codevelopment policy that Europe is due to put in place tomorrow must become more effective, more intelligent and more secure, so as to assure us that the funds allocated will benefit the people, and them alone."
"If we are effective in our efforts to help the people of Africa to remain in their own countries by enabling them to live decent lives, then we will not have to count the dead bodies on the beaches of Italy, Malta or Spain."
"In an area without internal borders, such as our Schengen area, coordination and information-sharing among the various national immigration policies of the 25 Member States are crucial."
"The first important stage in achieving that aim is to improve the exchange of information among the Member States."
"My report concerns the establishment of a mutual information procedure in the areas of asylum and immigration."
"Each Member State must communicate to the other Member States and to the Commission the national measures that it plans to take."
"The main points developed are as follows: all of the Member States will have to supply information concerning their present national legislative state of play."
"This information will therefore constitute an initial database that will help us to become acquainted with the various policies currently in force and to understand what changes subsequently need to be made."
"My second point relates to the political dimension."
"The new procedure will act as a permanent link between national administrations."
"It is important to make progress and to add a political dimension to this administrative level."
"This will be the aim of this new tool."
"The final point that I want to mention relates to public accessibility."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has tabled some amendments aimed at opening up the network to the public."
"I have always been in favour of more transparency in decision-making procedures, but not in this particular case."
"I shall explain what I mean by this: all of the legislative texts that have already been adopted at national level are naturally made public."
"Nevertheless, political discussions on the future measures and draft laws under way must remain confidential."
"Otherwise, governments will refuse to submit their current projects to us and to discuss them with us, and we will never have this information."
"In concluding the first part of our joint debate, I should like to thank all of the shadow rapporteurs with whom I have worked effectively over the last few months."
"I hope that, together, we will demonstrate our will, during tomorrow’s vote, to strive towards greater cooperation among the Member States at EU level."
"As regards the integration of immigrants, I should like to congratulate our fellow Member, Mr Lambrinidis, on his work and his will - and I stress, his will - to find compromises between all of the political groups."
"Integration policy represents a mutual commitment on the part of host countries and of legally resident nationals of third countries."
"This commitment comprises rights and obligations for both parties."
"Immigration cannot be promoted if we cannot give the immigrants a humane reception in relation to work, accommodation and children’s schooling."
"A successful integration policy therefore hinges on a person’s finding a job. This, in turn, hinges on his or her ability to speak the language of the host country."
"Immigrants also need to have access to civic education classes and to programmes on equality between men and women in order to become better acquainted with the values of the host country."
"The reports presented this evening deal with the immigration and integration policies within the European Union."
"The idea of this comprehensive debate is particularly interesting, because it is difficult to dissociate the two issues."
"Immigration and the integration of immigrants are subjects that rarely leave people indifferent."
"These very sensitive issues are at the centre of countless questions and debates that mobilise governments, citizens and elected representatives."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the management of migratory flows will take place at European level, because, together, we must build a safer, more prosperous and fair Europe."
", – Mr President, I am convinced that the smooth integration of immigrants into Europe is a challenge tantamount to the successful enlargement of Europe."
"The over 40 million immigrants in the Union today are, in terms of population, a twenty-sixth Member State."
"However, in contrast to policies for the smooth integration of candidate countries, the European Union has committed precious few officials or resources over recent years to the major challenge of immigrant integration."
"The EU Council, to its credit, firmly stated its commitment to immigrant integration at Tampere in 1999 and reinforced its position at the summit in Thessaloniki under the Greek Presidency in 2003."
"Congratulations are also owing to the Commission and Franco Frattini in person, for the exceptional working paper on immigrant integration published a few months ago, with emphasis on the common basic principles of Groningen."
"However, reality still by no means reflects the expectations created."
"Unfortunately, the Union has long been paralysed by the widely held view that integration is a local matter and that, consequently, Europe as a whole cannot help."
"Integration initiatives are indeed implanted locally."
"Schools, businesses, places of worship and the other institutions of a local community do the hard work of bringing newcomers and natives together on a daily basis."
"Nonetheless, integration is pan-European in its implications, especially when it fails."
"Thus, while local, regional, and national authorities should determine the precise integration measures implemented in each case, the Member States as a whole must pursue effective integration strategies whose outcomes advance the Union’s common interests."
"It is in monitoring and objectively evaluating these outcomes that EU institutions can and must become far more active and particularly effective."
"My report stresses that immigrant integration implies both obligations and rights for immigrants and for the citizens of the Member States."
"Prime place among the report's proposals is held by the need for us to start consultations to end the political and social marginalisation of immigrants and encourage their social – and more importantly – their psychological integration, so that they do not feel condemned to marginalisation in advance."
"The language of the host country and its ethics and customs and the workings of state institutions must be taught to all immigrants and, at the same time, the state must give them the possibility of free expression of their cultural identity and equal access to education, jobs, housing and so forth."
"The report points out, among many other things, the importance of adopting positive action to integrate immigrants into the education and employment structures of the Member States and into the structures of the political parties in the Member States."
"It calls on the Member States to apply directly, fairly and without prohibitive restrictions existing directives on racism and xenophobia, on family reunification, on equal treatment in employment and on the status of long-term residents."
"It stresses the importance of making provision for naturalisation rights for all long-term resident immigrants, especially for the children of immigrants born and raised among us."
"It proposes that the Member States appoint a minister with overall coordinating responsibility for integration and an immigration ombudsman."
"Should the countries of the ΕU accept more immigrants and, if so, how and how many?"
"We all know that this question is at the epicentre of a very broad public debate in numerous Member States."
"By contrast, the reply to the question of whether we should pursue the smooth integration of immigrants already living and working among us is self-evident."
"They must become full members of our societies."
"Anything less would imply that we accept and prefer a society with first- and second-class citizens."
"Such a policy would undermine the social and economic fabric of our societies."
"In other words, it would be wrong and would benefit no one."
"To close, I want to warmly thank all the political groups, shadow rapporteurs and coordinators, especially you Patrick, , because I know how difficult it was for all of us to promote this report."
"I thank all of you for your important amendments in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs which made this report stronger and richer, especially you Jannine."
"I know that it was not always easy for us all to find the final combinations, but we tried and succeeded on numerous counts."
"Thank you once again."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, being one of the world’s safest regions, and with one of the strongest economies, the European Union is under pressure from the large number of people who want to migrate to it, and managing this flow will be one of the tasks for the Europe of the future."
"Our European migration policy must aim to manage legal migration while also preventing the illegal variety, for space for legal migrants is made available only if the illegal ones are kept at bay."
"In an EU whose internal borders are largely open, migration can – and may – be regulated only with reference to the other Member States and on the basis of joint responsibility, something that Mr Gaubert made quite clear in his report."
"Mr Lambrinidis’ report shows how support for efforts at integrating immigrants is another important component of a rational and coherent migration policy, but it appears from the Commission’s document – which I have to say is excellent – that all the European Union can do is lay down the framework conditions for this."
"What is beyond doubt is that failure to integrate not only frustrates the immigrants, but also makes it considerably less likely that the host society will accept immigration."
"While a well thought-out immigration policy is certainly worth working towards, Europe’s border regions need help; they need it now, and they need it at once."
"We should all care about the things we see happening in Malta, the Canary Islands, Lampedusa, Ceuta and Melilla; all the Member States, the Commission and this House, should help the countries concerned right now, without delay and without bureaucracy."
"Medium-term solutions can be found only through joint effort across various policy areas, such as internal and external policy and development cooperation."
"Cooperation with, and support for, transit countries and countries of origin, are part of the solution."
"We, whose concern is with the framing of internal policy, are prepared to play our part in bringing them about."
"Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to put the question presented on its behalf by Mr Schulz and Mrs Roure."
"This question is supplementary to the reports by Mr Gaubert and Mr Lambrinidis on immigration issues."
"I would like to say that these two reports make an important contribution to resolving the problem of immigration."
"The main concern is that there should be a comprehensive immigration policy."
"So far we have just had bits and pieces of policies. Let us hope that on the basis of the resolutions of the last Brussels Summit we can create that comprehensive policy."
"A comprehensive immigration policy must begin with the countries of origin, however."
"In other words, what are we in the European Union doing to prevent immigration from being the only source of income for the inhabitants of many of these countries?"
"That is the first thing we have to consider."
"Secondly, given that it is not going to be possible to resolve the problems of the developing countries in the short term, what measures are we taking to protect our external borders, including a legal immigration policy of course – which has been laid down in the Hague programme since December 2005 – so that those citizens who want to come to work in our Union, if the jobs are available, can do so in a legal fashion?"
"Thirdly, as has just been said in relation to the previous reports, we must bear in mind that, at the moment, while no European Union immigration policy is in place, each country must bear the costs and the work of that policy."
"There are currently a series of border countries, and not just in the South of Europe, but also in the centre of Europe, which are having to endure an excessive burden in terms of caring for these illegal immigrants on a humanitarian level."
"To date we have had minimal resources."
"For this year we apparently have just EUR 5 700 000."
"Let us hope that, when the financial perspective is approved, from 1 January 2007 we will have more resources."
"Furthermore, we must remember that these immigrants are not extra-terrestrials, they are not robots or machines, but they are human beings who have to live in society, who have family and emotional needs which must be met."
"Above all, what Europe cannot tolerate is having two classes of citizens here: those who – to use the terms of a sector of the French far right – are , that is, of European origin, and those who are not, because, as we have seen recently, that is the source of a series of social problems that are very difficult to resolve."
"We must integrate immigrants into our societies."
"They cannot be left outside of the central current of our society."
"An immigrant, or the children and grandchildren of immigrants, have the right to live as people, under the same conditions as all other citizens of the Union."
"We must also consider that the flow of immigration does not necessarily have to be completely irreversible."
"In the heart of every immigrant is the desire to return to their country of origin."
"What are we doing to ensure that immigrants have the opportunity to maintain their ties with their countries of origin, so that they can return to their countries of origin without having to endure all of those horrendous illegal immigration procedures, so that their stay outside of the countries of origin is seen as nothing more than a transitional stage, so that, when they return, they can enrich the society of the countries of origin?"
"In certain countries of the European Union, such as Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece, this is what happened during an era when time spent abroad was seen simply as a step towards returning to the country of origin and strengthening its economy."
"I hope that Commissioner Frattini will help us in this regard – we have a great task ahead of us – and that the Union's institutions, the Commission, the Council and Parliament, can implement the immigration policy which is so essential at the moment."
"Mr President, all the Council’s fine words, as enshrined in the Tampere programme and confirmed in the Hague programme, have borne very little fruit to date."
"Every now and then, the Council takes very small steps, albeit reluctantly and on the basis of lowest common denominators."
"The Council is, to my great regret, conspicuous by its absence even now during this mini-debate."
"Although clearly, national agendas are seriously undermining the European agenda in this respect, it is to those agendas that the Member States are very much committed."
"The fact that a Commission proposal is needed to get the Member States to cooperate more effectively in the area of data exchange typifies the Member States’ passivity where the establishment of a common asylum and immigration policy is concerned."
"As Mr Gaubert said a moment ago, this data exchange is of major importance and quite simply a matter of necessity."
"The immigration issue is one of the biggest challenges in 2006 and will remain so for the foreseeable future, but reinforcing external borders alone will not be enough and should not, in fact, be our intention."
"Commissioner Frattini has already indicated this and presented a comprehensive package of measures in this respect."
"Both the Council and Commission will therefore need to make haste in realising all ambitious intentions to the letter."
"Common asylum policy, the uniform asylum procedure and the uniform asylum status, thanks to which those who are entitled to protection will also receive it, must be completed by no later than 2010."
"Accordingly, we must draft common European return policy as a matter of urgency – in respect of which I should like to remark that everyone, legal or illegal, is entitled to respectful and dignified treatment – which should include awareness and information campaigns in the countries of origin and transit, concluding association and cooperation agreements with those countries, creating a clear link between immigration policy and adopting development policy and, vitally, the swift introduction of a European green card."
"As my questions are set out in black and white, and as my time is limited, I will not repeat them here, but I do expect a clear answer, certainly in connection with the passerelle provision."
"After all, political courage means that you have to have the correct instruments at your disposal if you want to give visible form to your convictions."
"Mr President, I should like to speak briefly on the issue of integration."
"We know from a number of pieces of research and projects done under the Equal Programme – not least the strand on asylum-seekers – that the message coming through very clearly is that integration starts on day one for new arrivals and it starts the day before for host communities."
"We have a whole range of good practice there that we should be drawing on, so that this becomes a process that gives us as many wins as possible."
"That also means realising that for some parts of the world, migration is part and parcel of development policy."
"I think we all agree that people who want to migrate should do so as a matter of free choice."
"We know, however, that large numbers of illegal people are actually people who have overstayed their visas; they have not entered illegally."
"We also know that there are large numbers of people who are semi-compliant, because rules are not clear or are difficult to access."
"Until we start looking at the development aspect of this issue, it will be like squeezing a balloon: if you apply pressure somewhere, you just get a different shape somewhere else."
"Therefore, we need to look at this very seriously, and Member States need to stop complaining and start cooperating on a common migration system."
"We also need to beware of the commodification of people."
"When I look at the policies of some Member States that are now considering drawing unskilled workers from new Member States and not using third-country nationals, I am not sure what message that sends out."
"Indeed we know that for people from some of the poorest countries, access to work in the European Union is crucially important to their country’s development, and the remittances that go back can be up to eight times the amount of aid that we are putting in."
"We know that people are pulled towards rich countries when inequality is most acute."
"I am interested in how the Commission is going to approach the development aspect and trade policies, to ensure that our policies move in a coherent way instead of pulling against each other all the time."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reports produced and the questions asked have given me many ideas and I would like to thank the two rapporteurs and all the authors of the other documents debated today."
"In my speech I will try to define the guidelines for the action that the Commission is preparing, also because, as all Members know, only six or seven months ago there were many doubts within the European Councils about the truly European, rather than national, dimension of the great challenge of global management of migratory flows."
"The most important item of political information, which has been mentioned many times but is sometimes forgotten, is that, between November and December of last year, the European Council finally expressed itself with one voice; inspired by the spirit of Salonika 2003, it recognised that immigration requires a global approach, which can only be a European one."
"This is a political step forwards of definite importance and today we have been asked to implement the action plan."
"This action plan comprises a series of concrete initiatives of which you are already aware."
"These are the proposals that the Commission has presented in recent months and that are in part the subject of the reports and the questions that you have brought up."
"For example, one of the main keys to European action is the principle of solidarity between Member States of the Union."
"This principle implies many things: first, it means that the Member States undertake to provide each other with mutual support should one of them be subject to particular pressure from migration."
"The second aspect of the principle of solidarity is precisely that to which Mr Gaubert’s report, which I very much liked, is devoted."
"It is a report based on a proposal that I put forward in 2005, when I became aware of the need to provide a firmer basis for exchange of preventative information by each Member State that legitimately wished to adopt immigration initiatives, where these initiatives had an impact on the other Member States."
"Establishing a consultation mechanism is another way of applying the principle of solidarity."
"We must not forget that whatever happens within the borders of each State has repercussions in other States, hence the mechanism for mutual consultation and communication."
"I accept with great pleasure all the proposals made in Mr Gaubert’s report, including the additional proposals, such as that for permanent political dialogue at ministerial level. There is also a proposal for an annual report, which the Commission would be very happy to present to this Parliament each year, on the operating of this mechanism."
"Someone who spoke before me said that there must be mutual trust between Member States for this mechanism to function."
"If there is no mutual trust, we can write the rules, but they will remain on paper alone."
"We will, therefore, need to put political pressure on Member States, explaining to them that if they do not communicate or exchange information with the other States in a true spirit of European sharing, things may go well one time round, but then go badly, as we say in Italian."
"It suits everyone, therefore, to be totally transparent at all times and this is the spirit of the report by Mr Gaubert, with whom I concur."
"What are the shared guidelines for European immigration policy?"
"First, a challenge that is both global and European."
"Second, and this is the most innovative aspect, a role for the European Union as a single player on the international scene, for example and in particular in neighbouring geographic areas;"
"I refer specifically to Africa, to the Mediterranean area and to our close neighbours in the East."
"These are the three main geographic areas where Europe has to conduct political action in practice as a single player with a single voice."
"What things have to be done within this political challenge?"
"Above all, we have to confront the fundamental causes of immigration at a European level."
"Mrs Lambert has just stated perfectly correctly that we must transform immigration that is the fruit of despair into immigration that is the result of the choices made by people who freely decide to go and live and work in the European Union, but who are not forced to flee because of poverty or lack of drinking water in their country or because their environment has been destroyed."
"So what should we do?"
"Point European development aid policies in the direction of strategies to deal with the lack of local development."
"For example, we can organise intervention that focuses on migrants’ countries of origin in order to encourage investment and the restructuring of the agricultural system or the environmental fabric, which is very often devastated and blighted."
"We are currently considering projects for funding in conjunction with the World Bank, in order to use the remittances sent back by regularised immigrants and invest them in their countries, naturally only if this is what they want."
"So what is the obstacle?"
"Very often immigrants have no access to bank credit and thus we would like to encourage credit services that are more prepared to invest, for example in a small or medium-sized company in a country of origin."
"We are developing so-called micro credit projects precisely to encourage the setting-up of such investment outlets in the countries of origin."
"This work will be developed at a global political level, represented by contribution of Europe, which, I hope, will really speak with one voice, at the United Nations sitting in September, commonly known as the ."
"This session will take place on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly; here they will pinpoint the relationship between immigration and the development of the countries of origin."
"Europe will present a strategic document, based on a proposal that I will submit to the Commission in a few days prior to the summer break; this will be the European Commission’s contribution to this debate, which, I think, is the most important theme that we need to address."
"The second theme is combating the trafficking of human beings, as mentioned by Mrs Klamt."
"You will know that the trafficking of human beings is now one of the major sources of income for totally unscrupulous organised crime."
"We now have very clear information on traffic flows, on the origin of the traffickers and even on the price charged to each desperate individual transported with no guarantee of reaching their destination alive."
"On average, traffickers ask these desperate people for enormous sums, between USD 1 500 and 2 500 each, without even providing a guarantee of safe arrival on the other side of the Mediterranean."
"It is clear that combating the trafficking of human beings must go hand in hand with the protection of the victims of trafficking and, therefore, with the theme of vulnerable victims, immigrant women and children who are victims of the traffic in illegal immigrants."
"In this respect I think we will also have to consider, because we need to do so, a policy of repatriation as European action against those who cannot stay on European soil because they do not have the right papers."
"I think we should organise repatriation moves, setting standards, in conjunction with the United Nations agencies, for the respect of individuals, not only for their rights, but also for the dignity of those to be repatriated; they must be repatriated in total compliance with the standards defined by international conventions."
"In this context, we are working on readmission agreements."
"At the moment we are addressing very ambitious challenges, such as signing as soon as possible, first with Morocco and then with Algeria, readmission agreements that are once again European, and no longer bilateral between one State and another, to increase Europe’s political dimension."
"The third theme is legal immigration, which I see as an opportunity and certainly not a danger."
"It is obvious that, as far as legal immigration is concerned, we have to comply with national regulations."
"For example, you merely have to remember that even in the constitutional treaty that we signed in Rome, we had specified that the number of immigrants who could enter each country would be determined at national level; that said, however, I think joint rules are needed on the admission of legal immigrants and I fully share the opinion of the person who said that we should not ask for or hire only highly qualified immigrant workers because that would cause a brain drain that would very likely impoverish the countries of origin."
"Instead, our intention is to encourage people to move around, since it is clear, as someone has said, that many immigrants would like to go back to their country of origin, their motherland, and we have to help them to do so."
"In Europe, however, there is a need for seasonal workers and agricultural workers, workers in so many sectors, who are not highly specialised, but who are of use; if, therefore, we confined ourselves just to engineers, doctors or researchers, it would lead to the impoverishment of the countries of origin."
"The fourth theme is integration."
"Mr Lambrinidis knows how much I appreciate his work, and in particular this report because, until now, integration was not considered to be what it effectively is: a factor that cannot be separated from migration policy."
"Allow me to say that it would be irresponsible to welcome immigrants without integrating them because we would thereby increase their frustration and their sense of isolation."
"It is precisely on this subject that our proposals provide for focusing on key sectors, on civil rights, on accommodation, education, and on work, which must obviously be legal rather than illegal."
"We have proposed, and we are implementing, a permanent European Integration Forum, and local government will have a prominent say."
"For how long now have we forgotten mayors, regional governments and civil society organisations?"
"And in talking about integration, we cannot confine ourselves to the capitals of Member States."
"The European Integration Forum will deal precisely with this aspect and I hope that this Parliament will support it by approving the European Integration Fund."
"This fund does not replace national policies, but helps them to be more efficient."
"The fifth theme is illegal immigration."
"I am about to promote an initiative, which the Commission should approve on 19 July, on certain guidelines for illegal immigration."
"First, I believe that we should promote a proper education and communication strategy in the countries of origin."
"When they arrive in Europe, aspiring immigrants do not know the rules, do not speak the language, do not know about work opportunities, and do not know the laws of the European countries, which, however, they must respect; so why not consider one of my proposals on vocational training courses and language courses in the countries of origin, which Europe could encourage and even cofinance to prepare for legal and necessary immigration?"
"It is obvious that, if we wish to beat illegal immigration, we need to stop undeclared work, because undeclared work means exploitation and is also a factor that attracts further illegal immigration."
"The sixth theme is urgent measures to protect and provide concrete support for the Member States with the greatest problems."
"The Canary Island mission has been decided; thirteen Member States have agreed to participate and will provide naval vessels and aircraft to patrol the Atlantic coast opposite the Canary Islands."
"A second European mission will then go to the aid of Malta and patrol the Mediterranean."
"I would like to emphasise that these are the first actions to be coordinated by the Frontex Agency, that is by Europe."
"They are not actions implemented by individual Member States working together, but are coordinated by a European agency."
"These constitute urgent patrolling measures, but they are not just that; they are also measures to save human lives at sea, because the humanitarian aspect of this terrible tragedy is that, every week in the Mediterranean, in the sea around my country, we see people drowning; often we do not even manage to recover the bodies."
"These actions, too, are absolutely vital."
"Lastly, the seventh theme is aid to the immigrants’ countries of origin and of transit."
"We have to provide concrete assistance, work with them and, if I may say so, in a spirit that replaces the usual tone of international relations, in a real partnership."
"I am about to go to the Rabat conference, which will take place on Monday and Tuesday next week, in Morocco itself."
"For the first time, at this conference the African countries and Europe will meet to develop a common action plan."
"I think that we will then have to create an instrument to provide constant monitoring of the initiatives that we will be adopting in a few days’ time; then we will need a second meeting, this time under the aegis of the African Union."
"I think that the future will see the African Union and the European Union implementing a strategic programme and I think that this can really make a difference."
"– We have all recently witnessed the failure of numerous European societies to integrate immigrants."
"We have lived through the explosive consequences of the breakdown of the social fabric."
"We therefore need to take measures both at national and regional and at European level which will bridge the gap between immigrants and host societies."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs decided to call on the Member States to introduce secure legal status and a secure package of rights to support this development:"
"- by signing and ratifying the UN Convention 1990 recognising the rights of all immigrants, irrespective of their legal status;"
"- by reversing social deprivation and adopting a package of clear legal rules for all migrant workers;"
"- by taking measures to promote the education and information of immigrants on their social and employment rights;"
"- by guaranteeing individual resident's and work permits and strengthening the information and participation of host societies in the integration process."
"I am delighted that the report by my honourable friend Mr Lambrinidis adopts many of the ideas of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
". – Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Gaubert and Mr Lambrinidis, for taking action to lay the basis for a common, modern EU immigration policy."
"Such joint actions should not only help to resolve problems relating to the latest waves of immigration, but also with the integration of the European-born children of immigrants."
"The transition from words to deeds requires not only a good legal basis and mutual exchange of information, but above all funding."
"For this reason it is a good thing that, in addition to funds for refugees and funds to secure our external borders, a fund for the repatriation and the integration of immigrants has also been set up."
"As the rapporteur on these funds I would like to stress that we succeeded in dispelling all doubts as to the legal basis of the integration fund, and so we have a decision establishing such a fund that would help it to be unanimously established."
"This can be regarded as an achievement for this House."
"There is only minor opposition from a handful of countries, which, it should be said, have considerable problems with the integration of immigrants, and whose position is therefore all the more puzzling."
"For this reason it is a good thing that Mr Lambrinidis has drawn up a resolution on the integration of immigrants."
"But even this motion for a resolution has aroused some controversy, mainly as regards the political rights of immigrants."
"Conferring political rights, and therefore the right to vote in local elections, is a decision which, according to the principle of subsidiarity, lies within the competence of Member States, in most of which such a right is conditional on having nationality of that country."
"As a Parliament we may have the right to make political recommendations, but we should remember that we cannot force Member States to incorporate such provisions into their national legislations."
"A further important point is that we cannot allow the legal status of citizens of the new Member States as regards access to labour markets, services, education and housing in the lands of the ‘old 15’ to be worse than the situation of legal immigrants from third countries."
"Let us please remember those who already integrated with the European Union in May 2004."
"."
"Mr President, our country is out of the World Cup, so we can stay here for as long as we wish!"
"I congratulate the Commissioner for taking the time to attempt to act on the Commission communication of September 2005 and to give us real policies with which we can progress."
"Of course the Council has to be a willing partner too and we are hoping that the Finnish Presidency might repeat the discussions at the Tampere Council, which were extremely progressive."
"I hope we see evidence of that."
"The Lambrinidis report is a progressive and positive addition to the new debate on integration in this House."
"It is positive for a series of reasons."
"The rapporteur does not just look at all the fashionable ideas on integration in the different parties; he tries to look at what works."
"This is too serious a subject now for us not to look at the models that actually work."
"He says we should share best practice, which we are not currently doing."
"He talks about implementation of the directives that will make integration work, such as the race equality directives."
"He talks about money, about the very little we spend on integration, given the disproportionate results, the disproportionate economic and social benefits we would get from spending on the kinds of projects the Commissioner talked about, whether language or other integration projects."
"All these things are important, but ultimately we should stop thinking that integration is not for the European Union."
"Integration for the European Union; not just the sharing of best practice, looking at the best models of integration, but the political will of this House to provide local support for those people who believe that integration will benefit society, benefit the economy and ultimately create harmony in the EU."
"Mr Lambrinidis has produced a report that takes us one step forward."
"Let us hope that further initiatives come from this House, that the Commission remains strong and that the Council will join us in this struggle."
". Firstly, I would of course like to congratulate the draftsmen of the reports for their excellent work."
"I am delighted that there are many ideas in these reports which were approved by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs when it voted on the opinion I prepared regarding migration and development matters."
"The Community is letting in more and more emigrants from almost all the developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, and so far, there is little expectation that the scale of this phenomenon will decline."
"As we do not have a labour market development strategy covering the whole Community, including migration from developing countries, this report will partially fill the gap."
"If the Community does not have a common policy for regulating migration flows and if legal regulation in individual nations is unsuitable, conditions arise for illegal migration, human exploitation, human trafficking and other crimes."
"There have also been cases like this in Lithuania."
"People are running from Lithuania, while employers are seeking immigrants from third countries."
"The report states that immigration from developing countries will help solve labour market problems in the Community."
"It also says that migrants will help develop their own countries by sending money home."
"This is partly true, but I think it is a rather narrow view and the labour problem will remain for as long as we restrict the free movement of workers within the Community itself and until we solve the problem as a whole, not fragmentally."
"As the Vice-President said, if we want to help poor countries develop, funds set aside by the Community must not be directed towards food products or financing the budget, but, first and foremost, the creation of small business and jobs."
"Then people will have work and they themselves will take care of the development of their countries."
". Mr President, EU-Africa Ministerial Conference on Migration and Development, a conference initiated by Morocco, France and Spain, following the tragic events of Ceuta and Melilla."
"There is one tragedy after another."
"According to some reports, 3 000 people are thought to have died over the last few months trying to reach the Canary Islands."
"Yet, the debates are focused not on the duty to protect people, but, once again, on the control, the closing, and even the militarisation, of borders."
"Yet, as all the reports attest, the majority of population movements are headed for the countries of the South, and not for those of the North, and the number of asylum claims in Europe has halved over the last 15 years."
"The Union and its Member States have an increasing influence on development aid."
"Only last week, a Senegalese newspaper ran the headline: ‘Europe is closing our borders’."
"That strategy puts the lives of twice as many people at risk – those whose only chance of survival is to leave their country, and those who are forced to take ever greater risks in order to enter Europe."
"Yet, freedom of movement, and more specifically the freedom to leave one’s country, is enshrined in the international standards."
"The absurdity of this policy is plain to see when we know that the income that migrant workers send back to their countries of origin is twice the amount of official development aid."
"Rather than guaranteeing respect for the fundamental rights of migrants and asylum seekers, namely the right of access to asylum procedures, the principle of non-refoulement or the right to a private and family life, Europe is multiplying the strategies aimed at shifting this responsibility onto third countries."
"Worse still, the Member States do not hesitate in violating their own obligations, for example by referring to the readmission agreements and sending people back to countries in which their safety is not guaranteed."
"The project to create so-called ‘regional protection’ areas in countries such as Belarus is also in keeping with this idea."
"Finally, the Member States are playing an active part in making the policy of imprisoning migrants and asylum seekers an everyday occurrence, and are going as far as to fund secure detention centres in third countries such as Libya and Mauritania."
"The European Union must urgently review its policy and listen to the sub-Saharan, North African and European civil societies."
"A large number of members of these civil societies were gathered together in Rabat last week, and they adopted recommendations that deserve to be taken into account."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think that Europe’s problem stems from migratory flows; the real problem is not people arriving on our territory, but the large number of people who do not get to Europe, those who die in the Mediterranean Sea or in the Atlantic Ocean."
"I have heard Commissioner Frattini confirm the need to patrol our coastlines."
"I believe that they should be patrolled solely to avoid people dying at sea, because the number of arrivals is ridiculously low: in the first half of 2006, 9 000 immigrants arrived in the Canary Islands, as compared with the 8 million tourists who go to the islands every year."
"I do not think that migratory flows have a very high demographic impact and we should, therefore, avoid talking about an invasion of immigrants and should try to develop a common policy for the entry of immigrants."
"Europe, however, has adopted a repressive joint policy, setting up administrative detention centres, implementing a joint policy of mass expulsion often determined at G5 summits and applying the principle of externalising frontiers, which, it seems, will be the main topic for discussion at the forthcoming summit in Rabat."
"I am of the view that we should radically change our strategy, with a view to true integration, based on the need to institute a mixed-race identity for Europe, and that we should also consider citizenship through residence, a residence permit to enable people to find work, harmonisation of the right to asylum and the right of immigrants to vote."
"I think that this new method of looking at immigration can help Europe in its constituent process."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I realise that the problem of illegal immigration in the Mediterranean, seen from here, Strasbourg or Brussels, in the heart of the European continent, may appear to many to be a marginal issue to be addressed with the cold, formal language of bureaucracy and with the complicity of Community policy, which, at times, can be cynical and hypocritical."
"Those, like me, however, who live day and night in Sicily, the furthest point of Europe in the Mediterranean, have no difficulty in declaring, within the plush walls of this Chamber, that a true human drama is unrolling before our eyes."
"Only last year, Commissioner, more than 20 000 illegal immigrants arrived on our Sicilian shores, double the number of those who landed in all the European countries bordering the Mediterranean in the past two years."
"Each day, hundreds of arrivals undergo the same ordeal, the same stations of the Cross: shipwrecks offshore and then bodies washed up onto the Sicilian beaches by the sea currents."
"It is a tragedy involving young players and victims, women and children fleeing from their countries, searching for a dream that for none of them will ever come true; first they have to go through the human smuggling racket and then a life of hardship, suffering, privation and exploitation awaits those who manage to avoid the police controls."
"This tragedy is taking place on European soil and what is Europe’s response?"
"It responds late and ineffectually."
"Only last December, the European Council in Brussels proposed a series of generic actions to be taken in 2006 and invited the Commission to coordinate their implementation."
"But it is said that resources are limited and additional funds will not be available until 2007."
"Too little, Commissioner: we need decisive action and your statements this evening have given us the right to hope."
"You are known to be a person who is in favour of decisive, practical action and we invite you to give us yet another further demonstration of it."
"."
"Mr President, in the debate on immigration, emotion and reason are sometimes at odds with each other, as was evident on Dutch television recently, when the journalist Sorious Samura accompanied illegal immigrants from Morocco to Ceuta, thereafter to mainland Spain, and from there to France and London."
"The image that was portrayed to the viewing public was shocking."
"However difficult the living conditions, border crossings were very often easy."
"The help of people-traffickers – which had to be paid for – appeared to make nearly everything possible, and once the immigrants had left the reception centres, they were able to leave the country in which they had arrived, although they then had only a life on the wrong side of the law to look forward to, which is far from desirable."
"That is why people-traffickers must be tackled."
"Their activities must be punishable and they must be prosecuted."
"I have two questions for Commissioner Frattini."
"Whilst we have been inundated with information on immigrants who arrive on Spanish islands, there is little information on how the smugglers and the captains of the boats involved will be challenged."
"This contrasts with the way in which the trafficking of human beings over land, in respect of which sentences have already been passed, is being addressed."
"What options can you see in the short term to be able to make a start on tackling human trafficking by sea to the European Union?"
"Also, is it possible, on the basis of Frontex’s expertise, to actively challenge the organisations that transport people to, for example, the Canary Islands and Spain?"
"– Mr President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time in this Chamber that I have advocated a European policy on legal immigration – for humanitarian and economic reasons – and measures to step up the fight against illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings."
"The two proposals before us are important and useful."
"I should like first to speak about the Lambrinidis report and to say to Mr Frattini that the Commission’s proposal is most welcome and well balanced, although I fear that the rapporteur has gone too far on some points, such as political rights."
"Immigrants must be integrated, but we must not forget that this works both ways: host countries must strive to integrate them, but they must also do their bit in the drive towards integration."
"I agree with Mr Lambrinidis that it is appalling that there is still a consultation process and the requirement of unanimity throughout the area of legal immigration and I agree that the clause provided for in the Treaty should be invoked in order to give Parliament codecision powers."
"I wish to highlight the importance of the Gaubert report aimed at establishing a web-based information system on this issue."
"Although the implementation of integration initiatives will be done at local level, it has broader implications."
"The difficulties experienced by one Member State in defining and implementing their integration policies has an impact in other Member States at social and economic level."
"It is thus in the Union’s interest that the Member States implement effective integration strategies the results of which serve the common interest."
"It could and should be the Union’s responsibility to monitor and assess the results of the efforts of integration. This will contribute towards the rapid adoption of the best techniques."
"Mr President, immigrant populations have increasingly become part and parcel of European societies."
"This is a great benefit to Europe."
"Immigrants contribute towards the economic, social and cultural wealth of the European Union."
"I say this before this House during the football World Cup, minutes after the semi-final between France and Portugal."
"Let us look at the teams of the EU countries, which are multi-ethnic teams illustrating the diversity, strength and pride of today’s European Union."
"The European Union’s success in integrating immigrants will largely determine Europe’s position on the global market and the success of the European project."
"One issue I would like to draw attention to is that at the level of political integration, true integration of the immigrant population in Europe can be achieved on the basis of a new legal and political identity, on the basis of a European constitution, which would guarantee a European identity to all social groups in Europe, over and in addition to their national identities."
"In addition, the legal status of integration and special European funds will guarantee proper integration of all social groups within the European Union."
"This requires courage and vision on the part of European leaders and the citizens of the European Union."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Lambrinidis on his excellent report."
"The Verts/ALE Group fully supports its main ideas."
"The proposal to call on Member States to encourage political participation by immigrants is particularly important."
"We believe that long-term resident immigrants should have the right to vote in local and municipal elections."
"It is regrettable that not all political groups fully support such measures, without which, in our opinion, immigrants will remain politically and socially isolated."
"The Commission should therefore undertake a legal review of Member States’ current practices in this area."
"We shall all have the opportunity to see how the local elections are conducted in our host city, Brussels."
"All non-EU citizens who have lived there without interruption for five years will have the right to participate."
"I hope that event will be an example of good practice, to be adopted by all Member States in their election laws."
"– Mr President, immigration is not a scourge and multiculturalism is a fact which we need not to tolerate but to welcome, and not with words but with deeds."
"By not trying hard enough to overcome the obstacles faced by our fellow citizens who are immigrants and by raising obstacles to immigrants seeking to enter the territory of the Union legally, we are putting a brake on progress itself."
"It is of course important, when talking about integration, for us to be clear about what we mean."
"What should we be working towards?"
"Fundamental integration should not be interpreted as the integration and full assimilation of immigrants, nor as an offer of privileges which uphold and maintain a discriminatory system which may strengthen racist and xenophobic behaviour."
"The objective of integration presupposes a two-way relationship of offer and dialogue, exchange and interaction, understanding and mutual respect of the citizens of Europe as a whole."
"It is impossible, without the safeguarding of equal access to employment, to state education and to the national health system, in an environment which is not characterised by divisions between immigrants and non-immigrants, for the citizens of Europe, irrespective of origin, to benefit as a whole from the prosperity of an advanced social and economic area."
"At the same time, it is our duty to ensure that immigrants, as citizens of Europe, are able to participate at all levels and in all activities of the state, including the democratic right to vote and stand for election."
"To close, I want to remind everyone that integration is not only an objective for immigrants, but the duty of each and every one of their fellow European citizens."
"Mr President, any society needs an influx of fresh blood, but there is the question of the impact of newcomers on society."
"Before the growth of the public services and infrastructure that we now demand, large numbers of immigrants were easily absorbed, but now they place an enormous strain on public services."
"In well-developed countries, massive immigration from undeveloped regions intensifies the problem."
"Some unskilled workers find it difficult to get a job and become a burden on the welfare state."
"But we should not try to attract skilled people from undeveloped countries, because they are badly needed there to improve their own economies."
"Once we saw Vietnamese boat people fleeing oppressive regimes."
"Now we see West Africans taking to boats and hazarding the Atlantic to seek a better life."
"That is due, at least in part, to the EU, as powerful fishing fleets armed with licenses granted by the votes of this House plunder their waters, reducing people already badly off to abject poverty."
"Migration is mainly economic and the pressure to migrate decreases as the prosperity of undeveloped countries improves."
"We must help those economies, both as a duty and to reduce migration."
"Third World countries do not need a handout."
"They need expert help to build their infrastructures and sources of employment."
"Above all, they need to trade."
"If communities can sell their produce outside their own backyard, they make progress."
"Unfortunately, for all its fine words, the EU stands in the way, consumed with protecting European producers."
"The EU’s high tariff barriers cruelly shut out the Third World from trade highways."
"Since the next speaker is Polish, I should report that this morning I heard that the United Kingdom has 500 000 Polish workers now."
"They are doing a marvellous job."
"Mr President, for a long time Europe has needed a common immigration policy based, as in the United States, on control rather than on assistance for integration."
"I believe that the countries of the EU have to date been too patient and provided too much assistance for integration, particularly for Muslim emigration, but without any significant results."
"On the other hand, immigrants from places such as Asia have made use of this opportunity and integrated more successfully."
"The time has come to demand more from immigrants."
"They must want to and strive to integrate, which will make integration more effective, and not just abuse our welfare systems, frequently undermining the sense of security in our countries."
"A new criterion for legal immigration should also be the needs of the host country, as France recently proposed."
"Mr President, Mr Frattini, I congratulate you, but only you."
"Let us look at some of the aspects identified."
"The European Union detects the problem and expresses alarm at every visible critical situation: Lampedusa, Ceuta, Melilla, Malta or the Canary Islands."
"Nevertheless, it does not establish the common policies necessary to prevent or properly manage migratory flows, either legal ones or, less still, illegal ones."
"The countries of the South add drama to the pressure on, and the violation of, the Union's borders."
"So many people are dying that it is not possible to give an accurate figure."
"I have said a thousand times that there are five essential inter-related aspects to this great issue: legal immigration, illegal immigration, asylum, integration and subsidiary protection."
"We must include the remote causes and the causes close to home here: origin and transit, structural poverty and irresponsible encouragements to come here, which translate into the languages of all poor countries as the dangerous phrase ‘sooner or later there will be papers for everybody’."
"Meanwhile, what part do we play in this display of incompetence and incapacity?"
"I will give you two examples;"
"I will tell you what is going to happen this weekend."
"Tomorrow and the next day in Brussels the Council will say at technical level that it has begun to discuss the distribution by country of the three new integration funds: border control, repatriation of illegal immigrants and integration."
"What happens, however?"
"In the mean time, Spain, Greece and the Netherlands squabble about distribution criteria: migratory pressure, kilometres of borders or the number of entries by air."
"Pointless discussions: we are not talking about proper funds, we are talking about mini-funds."
"This morning Mr Millán Mon said that, in the financial perspective, of every one hundred euros just fifty cents are allocated to immigration issues."
"That is the real shame."
"That is the real truth."
"Another negative example, Mr President, is that, also the day after tomorrow, the Council – of which I am highly critical – will respond by means of a global approach to immigration."
"That is all the Council will propose: a global approach."
"Finally, Mr Frattini, it is very important to commit ourselves to the countries of origin and countries of transit. It is very important that Mr Solana go to those countries of origin and countries of transit."
"FRONTEX is not the solution."
"FRONTEX is a new-born baby."
"FRONTEX will achieve nothing without the Carabinieri or the Civil Guard."
"We must not therefore be complacent in any way and we must make every possible joint effort to tackle this extremely serious problem."
"Two weeks ago in Malta we had an influx of around four hundred illegal migrants in the space of three days."
"This is equivalent to the arrival of around eighty thousand migrants in Germany within three days."
"In the same week we had some violent incidents between the police and around four hundred migrants who escaped from the centres in which they were staying."
"It would be superfluous for us to carry on singing a monotonous song of arguments to explain the crisis that this human tragedy is bringing to the affected countries as well as its effect on the dignity of migrants."
"These two events in themselves should be more than enough to show the explosive situation that we are currently in."
"This is a European problem, no country is capable of dealing with this tragedy, let alone a miniscule country like Malta, which is carrying a much greater burden than it can bear."
"With the exception of certain initiatives recently taken by Commissioner Frattini, the Union has not really treated this issue with the urgency and commitment that it deserves, and neither with the necessary funds or logistic help."
"We also await the revision of the Dublin II Regulation."
"The Union has done too little too late, and when one sees that the Union has not made much progress in dealing with illegal immigration, one begins to doubt the extent of the concrete action it will take in this regard."
"We appreciate that the Finnish Presidency has made immigration a priority."
"We augur that we will see words translated into action, so that as President Barroso said this very morning, we will change our gear in order to perhaps finally make the step from reflection to action."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, we agree that problems associated with migratory flows cannot be resolved at national level."
"Europe has not been there for the immigrants who need it."
"The Union deals with capital and the movement of commodities, but does not pay attention to those who see Europe as a dream of a decent life."
"I therefore support greater transparency and the broad thrust of the proposals put forward by Mr Lambrinidis."
"Immigration is a social reality, pure and simple."
"It says everything about us."
"Let us not, however, be under any illusions – the South will always look to the North, yet, more to the point, the North does not open its arms to the South."
"Immigration is not a police matter."
"The only fair criterion on which to base our decision is respect for human dignity."
"Europe cannot speak about human rights if it does not practise what it preaches in its own house."
"With one hand we close off the Mediterranean at the cost of death in the sea, and with the other we leave millions of people without papers at the cost of a society bisected by an invisible wall separating the citizens from the non-citizens."
"This is what must be changed, and footballers should not be exempt."
"Mr President, the current discussion on the integration of immigrants in the European Union is a consequence of the immigration policy to date."
"Opening the doors to a mass influx of populations originating from different civilisations – populations which in the overriding majority of cases assume that they will not integrate with their host populations and states – is madness."
"It may lead to the destabilisation of society on the continent for many years to come, and even, in certain circumstances, to tragedy."
"Multiracialism and multiculturalism within society also means multiplicity of conflicts."
"Anybody who arrives in an existing state must realise that they are its guests."
"If they want to settle permanently, they must accept the traditions and cultures of the countries they have chosen, although they may obviously treasure their own culture and customs."
"An error in the old policy is the fact that for many years it restricted immigration from the countries of Eastern Europe, whose populations are culturally close to the rest of Europe."
"We in Poland despair at the large number of young people who are now leaving the country, but after World War II Western Europe abandoned that part of Europe to communist rule."
"For decades we were deprived of the opportunity for normal economic development."
"Mr President, sustained immigration is a fact for many Member States, and when managed, it has aided economic output, although it would be foolish to deny that, on occasions, problems of a social or other nature ensue."
"I should like to take the opportunity of this debate to condemn unreservedly a series of racist attacks that have occurred in my constituency of Northern Ireland."
"Decent people do not want any part of that, and I deplore what has happened in regard to some recent incidents."
"I have three points to make in this debate."
"First, the control of immigration policy is, I believe, properly a national issue and should not become an EU competence; otherwise, national governments cannot exercise the controls necessary to their situation."
"Second, it is imperative that immigrants integrate and do not become a debilitating state within a state."
"Hence, in the United Kingdom I support Chancellor Gordon Brown’s calls for a willingness and for procedures to embrace Britishness."
"My third and final point is that with three million illegal immigrants in the EU, this issue has to be robustly tackled, not least because of its association with the odious practice of human trafficking."
"It is not acceptable for some countries to engage in so-called regularisation of their illegal immigrants and thereby qualify them for free movement to other Member States."
"Commissioner, you are aware that last week the influx of irregular immigrants alarmingly exacerbated the situation in Malta."
"Two hundred and sixty-six people arrived in a single boat."
"Up to now, one thousand people have already arrived this year, and we are still at the beginning of summer."
"If things continue like this, the number of people who arrived last year, which was a record year, could be doubled."
"Commissioner, you are aware that proportionately speaking, one thousand people in Malta are equivalent to two hundred thousand in Germany, two hundred already at the beginning of the summer."
"This is the seriousness of the situation."
"Commissioner, you also know that the immigrants do not wish to reach Malta but continental Europe."
"So much so, that in order for this boat of two hundred and sixty-six people to enter Malta, the Maltese Armed Forces had to spend several hours trying to convince them to enter Malta."
"This is to say that they arrived in Malta because they were saved by the Maltese Armed Forces in a life-saving mission, as it should be; this is the meaning of solidarity, as you yourself, Commissioner, were right to state; this is what solidarity means in Malta, but what solidarity is actually being shown to Malta?"
"Last week there was a riot, as my colleagues mentioned, with four hundred immigrants escaping from a detention centre and making a protest march towards the office of the Prime Minister, asking to be sent to another European country."
"Facing this situation, the Maltese people are asking: what is the European Union doing?"
"What is it waiting for before making a move?"
"I regret to say that although I know that you are personally very sensitive to the situation in Malta, up to now the Commission has given more words than action."
"Many plans and few results, and the results we are urgently waiting for are two: the immediate restriction of the influx of immigrants, and the fairer sharing of the burden among all parties."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not Maltese and, therefore, while acknowledging that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs is doing a magnificent job, I regret that the Finnish Presidency, which today began its term of office, is not present; this may be because of the match, or the time or perhaps a lack of attention (seeing that one of the Finnish Presidency’s themes is immigration), but it is not here."
"I have no choice, therefore, but to turn to Commissioner Frattini, who is certainly the most important representative of the European Union to be taking an interest in this issue."
"I have had the pleasure and the honour of leading several visits to various countries."
"This evening I would like to give Commissioner Frattini a message to deliver, and I also hope that some Council official takes note of it and mentions it to the Finnish Presidency."
"I would not want to deliver a keynote speech or a political kind of speech: ‘I understand everything and I am aware of everything’."
"Malta, Commissioner Frattini, is not what people imagine it to be, precisely because here Maltese colleagues make comparisons with Germany, Italy and Spain, etc., while in Malta people are unjustly detained."
"Here in this Chamber we have talked about so many things; this great European Union values the rights of all, even those who launch attacks, except those of thousands of people held in Malta."
"I have so many letters and SMS texts about these people that I could write a novel."
"Commissioner Frattini, if this European Council, this European Union really does want to avoid being hypocritical about Malta, it must remove these people, who have been held there for months or even years."
"Malta is not in any position to solve the problem."
"The European Union, the large countries, should take it upon themselves to bring out those 2-3 000 individuals, who are betraying Malta and turning it into a xenophobic country, which, amongst other things, regrets entering the European Union."
"Let us avoid this problem. Let us have these prisoners transferred out of Malta to other far larger EU countries."
"Almost three months have passed since this Parliament approved a very important resolution."
"The resolution listed the problems which Malta is facing as a result of illegal immigration."
"A resolution which offered plausible solutions, but which has unfortunately been ignored by both the Commission and the Council of Ministers."
"The problem we have before us today is much more critical and acute than it was at that time; unfortunately, the Commission's efforts up to now have been at a minimum and almost without any effect, and we cannot say that we have seen any positive steps taken since that time."
"We are facing the disembarkation of illegal immigrants on a day-to-day basis."
"The solution is not to build more detention centres, because we would be reducing little Malta to an enormous jail."
"We want Europe to face its responsibilities, we want the Commission to treat each country according to its merits, and I have no doubt that due to our small size, Malta's problem is the most serious one of all, and requires the greatest immediate attention."
"We were promised concrete action, but I would like to say that next to nothing has happened; for example, in April you promised us maritime supervision in the region, today I was happy to hear you say that this issue has been solved, but Commissioner, when are these patrols around our Mediterranean coasts going to begin?"
"The consequence is that, as my colleagues Louis Grech and Simon Busuttil have said, over four thousand illegal immigrants have entered Malta in the past two weeks."
"This is the equivalent of sixty thousand in Italy, or eighty thousand in Germany."
"And this summer is just beginning, just think, Commissioner, what a situation we will be in when the year finishes."
"Today I heard you talk of plans approved for Spain, which is excellent, but you are saying that Malta will be the second phase; when is this second phase going to begin: when it is too late, Commissioner?"
"Yes, the Maltese people are right to see these as empty words, because they are saying: where is the solidarity we talk about so much?"
"How can we expect Malta to carry this enormous burden on its own, and when are we truly going to go from the many nice words to concrete action?"
"The Maltese people are frustrated, and are right to be so, because the situation is alarming."
"This is the moment of truth."
"This is the moment for the Commission and the Council to prove to small countries like Malta that they are not being discriminated against by the European Union."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Members from Malta are right in that we have had to face a series of similar situations; but they are aware that recently a Commission technical mission went to Malta and made contact with the government there."
"As I have already said, we are gauging the willingness of Member States to send a mission to patrol the Maltese coast; there are now eight Member States who have signified their readiness to participate in this second mission, following the one organised for the Canary Islands."
"Although eight Member States constitutes a significant number, perhaps it is not enough; but a few days ago I informed Minister Tonio Borg, the Maltese Deputy Prime Minister, that I will be able to provide the Council meeting this month with precise details of the actual date of departure of this mission."
"You are obviously right; if I had the tools and the flexibility that the bureaucratic systems do not confer on me, this mission would have left a long time ago."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12:00."
"I want to take this opportunity to bring to the attention of the European Parliament the plight of both the Maltese and the irregular immigrants in Malta."
"All feel abandoned by the European Union."
"Almost daily, boatloads of irregular immigrants land on our shores."
"They are the lucky ones; many drown striving to make it."
"Malta has been left on its own to deal with this enormous problem."
"Everyone in the EU – Commissioners, Parliamentarians – knows we do not have the resources."
"But we have been left to our fate."
"Obviously Malta is being bypassed for larger countries with more influence."
"Of course we have received an abundance of condemnation and sympathy but nothing else."
"Before joining the Union we used to hear European representatives praising the principles on which the Union was built, foremost solidarity."
"We are steadily reaching the conclusion that this may have been only empty rhetoric."
"I wonder whether Malta will receive the same treatment when, not if, we start to enjoy the wealth beneath our seas."
"I am sure that then, like a jack in-the-box, the principle of solidarity will re-emerge."
"In every EU country today, there is the same admission of failure regarding the integration of what has become a universal form of ‘population-swelling immigration’."
"The solution is not, as the report proposes, to create yet another European fund, which is dedicated, this time, to the integration of third country nationals, or to create additional programmes emphasising the promotion of immigration and diversity within the EU, or to encourage immigrants to take part in politics, particularly by granting them the right to vote in local and municipal elections."
"Nor is it to ask the Council to use the ‘bridging clause’ in accordance with Article 67(2) of the Treaty, in order to confer on Parliament codecision powers relating to integration and legal immigration."
"The Member States must refuse to lose yet more of their powers in relation to protecting their identities and to securing their borders."
"Brussels’ ultra-liberal and pro-immigration philosophy is leading to a catastrophe, as can be seen everywhere."
"The European strategy must be confined to the drafting of partnership agreements with countries of origin in favour of a return policy, and, lastly, it must be focused on strengthening its controls at its external borders."
"We welcome the Commission's proposal because the aim of introducing a mutual information system in the area of asylum and migration is to avoid tensions between Member States and reinforce cooperation."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on submitting a report that is progressive and develops the proposal further."
"Handling coordination at a political level may create a forum for governments to reach agreement before making decisions, and therefore, bring laws in Member States closer together."
"I also welcome that the Commission is preparing a summary of the legislation passed by Member States, which will provide a comprehensive picture of existing legislation within the European Union, allowing us to assess the Member States' activity from an EU perspective."
"We also agree that the document drafted by the Commission should be presented to Parliament's committee responsible for these matters, as well as to the Council, which will open up a more wide-ranging discussion, while also strengthening the role of Parliament."
"As regards transparency, we find it acceptable that at a political level, while trying to reach agreement beforehand among Member States, information which has been placed on the network is treated in confidence so that a real agreement can be reached."
"At the same time, with the aim of informing citizens and being able to compare the different legislations, the laws already passed, judgments and translations of all these must be made available to everyone."
"As regards languages, however, we must accept that there are extremely important official languages in the European Union, as well as less widely used official languages."
"Therefore, the laws, their assessment and analysis should be translated into each of the Member States' own official languages, as well as into the three most widely used languages, as any more than that would be unnecessary."
"According to the texts proposed to us, Europe is supposed to be ‘inhospitable towards immigrants’."
"One can hardly believe it when one sees that, on account of its initiator, the Interior Minister, Mr Sarkozy, France is the champion of selective immigration and of positive discrimination in favour of visible minorities, as opposed, I imagine, to the 'invisible' European indigenous majority, and when one knows that foreigners living illegally in France are housed in reception centres or in hotels, are fed and have their children schooled and that they benefit from free state medical assistance, which is not the case for ethnic French people who, for their part, very often have to fend for themselves when it comes to finding somewhere to live, putting food on the table and working."
"In Italy, Spain and France, tens and hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants are regularly granted residence and work permits and can thus move throughout Europe with impunity."
"‘Godfathers’ and ‘godmothers' of young foreigners whose parents are living in the country illegally are cropping up in all of the middle-class cities of France and opposing the deportation of these youngsters."
"Is Europe inhospitable?"
"Quite the contrary: it is high time we put a stop to all of this pro-immigration and pro-integration madness of our French and European leaders."
"Stavros Lambrinidis’ report is necessary and timely."
"The problems experienced by immigrants are the same throughout Europe."
"On both sides of the Iron Curtain, the post-war reconstruction work in the Member States of the European Union took place with foreign labour."
"The democratic countries mainly relied on spontaneous immigration, though Germany also conducted a certain amount of officially sanctioned recruitment in Turkey."
"At the same time, the Soviet Union combined reconstruction work in the Baltic States with an active Russification policy."
"Estonia’s heavy industry and mines were predominantly started up with unskilled labour imported from Russia."
"As a consequence of the Soviet authorities’ activities, the immigrants soon made up nearly one third of the population."
"After the restoration of Estonian independence, we were faced with a very difficult integration task."
"The greatest difficulty was the opinion consciously instilled in the newcomers that a small nation like the Estonians was unviable without the support of its large neighbour and that the immigrants from the east were representatives of a higher culture."
"Fifteen years later, our integration problem has lost most of its acuteness."
"Estonia’s experience shows that the establishment of clear rules of the game and the association of integration with definite and tangible benefits can help overcome greater difficulties."
"Many of the measures suggested in the report are necessary."
"The only question concerns the proportions of research, brainstorming and specific activities."
"We should definitely involve representatives of immigrant groups as broadly as possible."
"We should not, however, allow this discussion to remain merely a talking-shop."
"All participants in the process, both representatives of receiving countries and the opinion leaders of the immigrants, must be given definite tasks to perform."
"And action must be taken immediately, without waiting for a grand all-encompassing plan and the completion of a system of measurement."
"The next item is the Commission statement on AIDS – Time to deliver."
". () Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad to be addressing you today at this final plenary before the summer break."
"This will also be our last meeting before the International AIDS Conference which will take place in August in Toronto."
"As you know, Toronto will offer the Commission a first rate platform to express its vision for dealing with the scourge of HIV/AIDS."
"The European Commission obviously remains very concerned about the problem of HIV/AIDS."
"Despite our efforts, this scourge continues to spread throughout the world."
"It now affects tens of millions of people, infecting more and more girls and young women."
"The countries most affected are still the poorest countries of sub-Saharan Africa, where the rate of infection is not falling and where the disease continues to undermine any prospect of human, social and economic development worthy of the name."
"Faced with this tragedy, the European Commission is more determined than ever to vigorously support its partners in Africa and elsewhere."
"Our goal is to give them the tools to fight this pandemic by combining prevention, treatment and care in an effective manner. However, in addition to these measures we remain convinced that HIV/AIDS cannot be treated in isolation."
"First of all, the fight against HIV/AIDS cannot be dissociated from the fight against other diseases that are also linked to poverty, notably malaria and tuberculosis."
"Furthermore, HIV/AIDS brutally exposes all the biggest challenges for development: limited access to social services, exaggerated inequalities – whether social or between men and women – bad government and corruption, as well as the persistently extremely low level of economic and technological development."
"In a word, the blatant inadequacy of the state with respect to essential governmental functions."
"The only way that HIV/AIDS can be combated successfully is if the leaders of developing countries address all these problems at the same time."
"This integrated approach to HIV/AIDS is the principal driving force for the Community’s action, and it also forms the basis of our approach in concert with the Member States, and also with our other partners at the heart of the international community."
"The main financial instrument to which the Commission has recourse is the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, which devotes around 57% of its resources to the fight against HIV/AIDS."
"We favour the use of this Global Fund because at the moment it is the most rapid and effective means to provide aid that can be allocated by the beneficiary countries in an integrated way."
"As you are aware, the Commission plays a key role in administering this Fund; it has, effectively, a sort of Vice-Presidency."
"Since the creation of the Global Fund at the end of 2001, the Commission has contributed up to EUR 522 million, or 11% of the total contributions."
"If we include the contributions of the Member States of the European Union, then we are obviously, by far, the principal backer of this Fund, providing around 60% of the total Fund."
"I should also say that a few months ago I participated in the replenishment of this Fund in London, and I will not conceal the fact that we were fairly disappointed that participants were somewhat lukewarm, even reserved, about replenishing the Fund."
"We are a long way from the objective that we set ourselves, and therefore great efforts must be made to mobilise donors."
"Thus we are implementing a series of financial support measures, projects and programmes. Among these measures we are giving precedence to general budgetary support."
"This approach is in accordance with our priority, which is to let our partners take control of their own policy and thus their own destiny."
"In line with this stance, the Commission has committed EUR 2.4 billion since 2002 to the general budget for Africa alone, where the impact of HIV/AIDS is by far the most serious."
"We are of course involved in an ongoing political dialogue with our partners regarding the use of these funds."
"This dialogue also aims at encouraging them to implement an integrated approach – I mean, in particular, by including questions regarding human rights and good governance."
"I also mean gender equality, as well as discrimination and acts of violence against women, and access to education for girls."
"In addition to these efforts through the Global Fund and through bilateral action, the Commission is actively participating in international forums for dealing with poverty-related illnesses – I am thinking in particular here of the World Trade Organisation, of the United Nations General Assembly special session on HIV/AIDS, of the G8, and of conferences like the one in Toronto as well."
"The Commission has played a decisive role in making sure that on these occasions the European Union speaks with a united voice on this question."
"Moreover, the Commission has also been engaged for several years in a dialogue with the pharmaceutical industry in order to speak in favour of making medication available to developing countries at lower prices."
"This dialogue has borne fruit: the introduction of a graded price scale has enabled the price of certain medicines to be reduced by 95%."
"This system allows developing countries to pay prices in accordance with their means, while at the same time protecting the businesses that produce these medicines from the risk of seeing their products imported back into the very lucrative markets of the developed countries."
"In 1999, a complete antiviral HIV treatment cost USD 10 000. Today it costs USD 200."
"We are engaged in research ourselves, in cooperation with industry and with the research centres of Member States, and our efforts are in particular directed towards finding microbicides and vaccines."
"We have also launched a partnership to coordinate the research programmes of Member States in order to accelerate clinical testing and thereby to ensure that medications may be put onto the market more rapidly."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must go further in our fight against HIV/AIDS, in order to be able to provide preventative measures and treatment to all those who need them by 2010."
"In this respect, we are following – with great interest – the implementation of innovative funding mechanisms by certain Member States, in particular the tax on aeroplane tickets."
"We are also glad to see increasing contributions from private foundations, such as the Bill Gates Foundation, to the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria."
"The creativity of these solutions, as well as the increasing involvement of the private sector, give me cause to hope."
"This reflects a realisation – that is increasingly being transformed into action – of the threat represented by HIV/AIDS and of the need to respond to it in a proactive way in order to preserve our common future."
"We must not relax our vigilance, and we must continue our work without respite."
"We can attain our ultimate goal, which is to provide care to all those who need it and to see future generations grow up without the fear of AIDS."
"I am delighted to be able to continue to collaborate with the European Parliament in order to turn this objective into reality."
"Thank you for your attention."
"."
"Mr President, the Commissioner is right to highlight the progress that is being made, but I think he will be the first to acknowledge that the challenge of AIDS is widening."
"We all know those figures that we quote in every debate, the 40 million people living with AIDS, the 20 million who have died from AIDS, the 12 million AIDS orphans, the 2.5 million children living with AIDS, but there are new aspects."
"There is the fact that around half of the people who now have AIDS and are dying of the disease are women."
"There is the problem of where AIDS is on the increase."
"India is now the country with the most cases of AIDS."
"It has overtaken South Africa, it has two thirds of the cases in Asia, and yet in India only 7% of the people who need the anti-retrovirals are receiving them."
"We see children missing out on the HIV drugs they should be receiving."
"Only one in twenty HIV-positive children are receiving the treatment they need, and the Global Movement for Children recently reported that four million children are desperately in need of Cotrimoxazole, the antibiotic costing just three cents per child per day that could prevent life-threatening infections in children with HIV and those born to HIV-positive mothers."
"Closer to home, on our doorstep, we see the figures in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, where the numbers infected have increased almost 20-fold in less than a decade, and between 2003 and 2005 the number killed by AIDS has almost doubled."
"So, Commissioner, we join you in your resolution to do more."
"We want to see much more done in terms of prevention."
"We have seen in Senegal and Uganda how investment in prevention can really work and make a difference."
"We need to see that rolled out, particularly in Africa and in Asia."
"Lastly, we need to see investment in research."
"With research into new drugs and vaccines and the delivery of drugs, the children I have referred to who are now living with and dying of AIDS can have hope for the future."
". Thank you Mr President and Commissioner for your willingness to join the few who are involved in this debate in attending this somewhat ‘hallucinatory’ night-time session."
"I hope you still managed to enjoy a very interesting match between France and Portugal."
"I am also indebted to the Commissioner for his statement."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament was relieved when the High-Level UN meeting on HIV/AIDS in New York recently stated that there needs to be a great deal of catching-up if the objective of universal access to the prevention of HIV, its treatment and attendant care for all people is to be achieved."
"Whilst it is indeed true that progress has been made, the UN AIDS report, from which Mr Bowis quoted a few examples a moment ago, clearly shows that our actions should gather momentum."
"My group was therefore disappointed that the political statement that has been made contained so little in the way of specific commitments."
"Hence the importance of this debate and of the meeting in Toronto, where the international community must prove that it takes its commitments really seriously, and that platform must be used not only to enter into political, but also financial, commitments."
"In Toronto, the countries involved must also be able to make it clear that they are serious about global and cohesive policy on HIV/AIDS."
"That is why the European Union must also do its bit and pull up its socks."
"There are four specific things that I would like to hear from you, commitments that the PSE Group would like to see featured on the Toronto agenda."
"The 6% for human and social development within the new development cooperation instrument is, to our mind, just a little too low."
"We would very much like to see this percentage increased."
"Secondly, we think it should be possible to spend no less than 50% of official development cooperation on Millennium Development Objectives, among which HIV/AIDS should occupy centre stage."
"Thirdly, it is only right and proper, to our mind, that the European Union should commit to sustaining and, ideally, increasing, its contribution to the World Fund."
"Fourthly, we would very much welcome it if the Commission were to provide active support to those developing countries that commit themselves to prioritising basic health care and the fight against HIV/AIDS."
"As the UN report on AIDS states, we know what needs to be done in order to stop AIDS in its tracks."
"What we now need is the political will and the funds to do it."
"."
"Mr President, I am in direct contact with a Vietnamese NGO fighting the spread of HIV/AIDS."
"It has stressed to me the importance of full access to anti-retroviral drugs, not least because many more people come forward for voluntary testing when there is effective treatment available for those who test positive."
"However, I am also told that there are real practical problems with European Commission funding."
"It is only very local, community-level projects that can manage to overcome stigma and discrimination and get people to talk about sex openly and that offer individual counselling and care."
"Yet these local NGOs, which deliver significant success in terms of changed attitudes towards AIDS, find that their applications for European funding are often turned down."
"Would the Commission be prepared to offer more support in the funding process and better feedback to NGO applicants?"
"Mr President, ‘Time to Deliver’ – that is to say, time to keep one’s word – is the motto of the XVI International Conference on AIDS, which is due to begin in Toronto on 13 August this year, and you, too, Commissioner, expressed disappointment at the lack of political will on the part of the international actors and the Member States when it comes to making available the necessary financial resources."
"The UN’s 2006 report on AIDS shows successes being achieved in all countries where enormous efforts are made at prevention, but it also shows that there are massive deficiencies in the prevention and combating of HIV/AIDS."
"It is not a matter of doubt that one of the most disturbing things in this report is the fact that programmes for preventing HIV are not only deficient, but also, where they are in place at all, fail to reach those groups that are most at risk."
"Efforts at informing young people are still inadequate, and that really is very disturbing indeed when one considers that there are more young people alive now than ever before, and that young people are more vulnerable to infection than other age groups."
"It was five years ago that 189 states adopted the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS, unanimously – a rare enough thing in itself – committing themselves to meeting the enormous challenge that HIV/AIDS constitutes to the development of humanity."
"We know – as has already been said – what has to be done to deal with rising rates of infection, to prevent the disease spreading further and treat those who have become ill as a result of it, but there is an obvious lack of the necessary political will, and it is for that reason that we, in our resolution, are critical – as are many representatives of global civil society – of the feeble and rather vague results from the high-level meeting in New York at the end of May and the beginning of June."
"We call on the international community to make use of the international conference in Toronto as a means of formulating clear and concrete demands and goals."
". () Mr President, it is always slightly embarrassing to make do with saying that what one has just heard corresponds to one’s own convictions, but it is obvious that, like you, I agree with the majority of the points that have just been made."
"Even so, and in order to be entirely objective, I will make a number of comments."
"It has been pointed out that we could find the means to resolve this crucial problem if only we wanted to. This, for me, is a major concern."
"Mrs Scheele put it well: it is a question of political will."
"For my part, I can only fight this fight by using arguments and speeches."
"I cannot – obviously - force Member States and international donors to be more generous."
"I was very shocked and surprised by the low level of commitment in London."
"If I recall correctly, the objective was set at USD 7 billion, and we barely reached the figure of USD 3.7 billion, which is indeed well below the initial objective."
"It will therefore be necessary to continue our efforts."
"My second observation is that I agree, of course, with Mr Bowis who argues in favour of strengthening research in this area."
"It is clear that research will ultimately enable us to gain a great deal of time in our efforts to eradicate this terrible evil once and for all."
"As for the fixing of a percentage, Mrs van Lancker, even if I agree in general what you say, I would like to emphasise that we do not determine such a percentage ourselves: it is determined by the partner countries."
"The principle of appropriation exists and we often have to plead with our partners in order for them to agree to dedicate part of the development aid that we donate to a sector like the one under discussion this evening."
"This is something I consider important to remember."
"In other words, I am personally right behind you when you say 6%, but this does not depend entirely on us."
"As regards the developmental aid dedicated to the Millennium Development Goals, I very sincerely have the impression that in the framework of the new programme – which we are working on and for which we will need your contributions, creativity and ideas – more than 50% will be devoted to the Millennium Goals."
"In fact, my conviction is, and this has become an obsession with me – by the way it is, curiously enough, very difficult to find people who share it – that, in many developing countries, problems are linked to the inadequacy of the state, to the deficit in the state’s capacity to deliver social or democratic services, like access to education for girls, access to health care, access to justice, access to administration."
"All this is often very incomplete, and sometimes it does not even exist at all."
"Therefore, when we give the states in question the means to reinforce their service capacities in a general sense, then it is quite understandable that this money will also help to meet the Millennium Goals."
"As for your remark about maintaining our contribution to the Global Fund, we do indeed intend to maintain this contribution."
"I should also say that a number of Member States of the European Union set a good example in London and have made real efforts concerning the sums."
"It is our non-European partners who have been rather timid on this subject."
"I agree with you that we must provide more significant support to benefit those countries which especially make particular efforts, even if AIDS does not, unfortunately, recognise borders."
"We must therefore make aid payments dependent on the performance of these countries, and that is what we are doing."
"Moreover, as you know, the 10th European Development Fund provides a special instalment which is, precisely, intended to supply additional means in a significant quantity relative to the initially planned sum, depending on governance, on performance and also depending on, for example, investment dedicated by partner countries to the fight against AIDS."
"Now, Mrs Hall, as regards local NGOs who feel that they have not been treated properly by the Commission, if you have specific NGOs with specific projects in mind, then I would like to hear about them."
"Be that as it may, I recognise that the Commission’s policy has been to avoid spreading credits too thinly between all sorts of projects which, taken individually and on a micro-local level, are doubtless important."
"In any case, it seemed to us that it was even more important for the international community to have a truly coherent communal strategy, based on a methodology that would be consistent across the board in order to deal with the problem as a whole."
"The Commission’s policy has been to try to make payments into the Global Fund in order that there might be a 'thinking head' capable of generating a global strategy."
"In any case, if an individual project is good, why not fund it, indeed."
"However, I remain convinced that if we dispersed ourselves between all sorts of projects then we would not be so efficient."
"That is the choice that the Commission has made, although it does not prevent me from being open to discussion – I am not narrow-minded."
"However, if certain people think that we should multiply little projects, even if they are good ones, then I remain sceptical as to the long term effectiveness of this strategy."
"When it comes to dealing with large scale problems like the one we are talking about this evening, I personally am in favour of adopting a much more systematic procedure."
"Now, if you spread out your resources among a multitude of small projects, then you lose sight of the systematic global approach and you become less effective."
"That would be my cause for concern."
"However, if you know the NGOs who have submitted these applications, please do give them and show them to me, because I do not want to give the impression of being arbitrary."
"Besides, I am not the one who decides – the administration submits its conclusions to me, and it is, unfortunately, not possible for me to study each application individually."
"Thus, if certain people believe that their applications have been treated unfairly, then I am willing to look into this question."
"One final point: you know that, within a broad European consensus, I advocate a common programme in which the contributions of European donors, Member States and the Commission are merged together."
"If we could truly succeed with this common programming initiative, in other words collectively agree on common objectives and decide on how to share out the work between us, then I think we would be much more effective, particularly in fighting the terrible disease of AIDS."
"This approach would be more coherent and perhaps then we would have a real European strategy at our disposal, something that is not the case today, as we must admit."
"Today, we are donors, we are investing money in the Global Fund, we finance this Fund, but we do not have our own strategy for fighting AIDS except, as I said earlier, for our plan to attack it on several fronts: gender inequality, the education of girls, care, access to health care, all those problems that the state is called upon to solve."
"Apart from that, we do not have a truly specific strategy for fighting AIDS."
"We have to admit that what we are doing is financing external operations."
"Therefore, if we had a common programme, we could then perhaps implement a more refined strategy that would engage in a more direct way with the specific aspects - and even local aspects - of this problem."
"I have received six motions for resolution(1) to wind up the debate tabled under Rule 103(2)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00."
"The next item is the report (A6-0210/2006) by Mrs Carlotti, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on development and migration (2005/2244(INI))."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are 175 million migrants in the world and that figure has almost tripled over the last 40 years."
"This is not a new phenomenon, but it has become particularly widespread within the context of globalisation and above all it is bringing us face to face with human dramas."
"Each day poverty and despair bring dozens and dozens of Africans to the northern shores of the Mediterranean or to the Canary Islands, and the European States’ only response is to increase the controls and patrols that force the people trying to come here to take even more risks."
"This migration policy on the part of the Union is based on an illusion, however!"
"The illusion that we can make our borders impregnable, which stems from an essentially defensive and securitarian approach and which means that all the responsibility is placed on the States of the South."
"Even the Euro-African conference in Rabat, which will take place on 10 July, will also deal with the issue from the point of view of enforcement and border control, and we will still not hear Africa's voice."
"This unilateral and self-centred approach is reflected today in the arguments put forward and in the policies of ‘selective immigration’ which are all the rage in Europe."
"‘Selective’ immigration for the North, but rather ‘suffered’ by the South, and from now on, therefore, a different approach must prevail in Europe."
"It is entirely in that spirit that I have drawn up my report."
"It is along those lines that I wish to propose a new approach, new instruments and to turn migration into a lever for development."
"First of all we must make better use of the existing tools, but above all we must maintain our commitments in the field of development aid, and, as we know, the initial phase of development will involve an intensification of migration rather than a slow-down."
"Of course, increasing aid is not a solution in itself. It is a necessary condition, but in itself it is not enough."
"I would like us next to turn attention properly to the AENEAS programme with a view to reorienting it purely towards the development aspect, and also the programme that will succeed it in 2007, but that is far away!"
"At the moment, that programme is above all used for actions aimed at protecting the borders of the North."
"In 2005, for example, just seven of the thirty-nine projects funded related to countries of the South."
"Furthermore, if we are to establish one new financial instrument, I believe that we should create a fund to guarantee the continuity of microprojects in the poor countries."
"The European Union must also act in the places where migrants are located, in the places where migration begins."
"It is easy to target the main regions of immigration – they are often the poorest regions – and to fund the establishment of infrastructures there through targeted budgetary support: drinking water, electricity, roads, health centres and schools, in order to dissuade resourceless populations from leaving."
"It is also easy to identify the migration poles."
"We know them: they are the States or large cities with modern means of transport and communication and which are both points of reception and points of departure towards the great migration routes, from the Sahel towards the North for example."
"Once they are identified, we will be able to implement more actions there than we do today aimed at supporting the populations – particularly the most vulnerable, who are women and children – and help them to achieve autonomy, by means other than by mobility."
"An information programme on these areas aimed at migrants could also be established."
"I believe that Europe must also look to the potential of migrant communities in the rich countries, in terms of what they can do for the development of their countries of origin."
"I believe that this is a promising route which has the potential to turn migrants into agents of development, in the name of solidarity and mutual aid."
"This is what is known as co-development."
"Within this context, we must promote the transfer of funds towards countries of origin, make them more transparent, less expensive, and consider a new financial product that could take the form of a ‘development savings plan’."
"The Union, but in particular its Member States, must adopt innovative polices such as assuming responsibility for salary differentials for certain migrants who wish to return to their countries of origin, or systems of dual bases for researchers or doctors, within the framework of institutional partnerships amongst research institutes, universities and hospitals."
"We must also encourage circular migration to allow migrants to come and go, in cooperation with countries of origin, of course, and ensuring the transfer of social provision."
"I believe that this kind of measure will make it possible to replace the current brain drain with a circulation of brains."
"We are very well aware that, for many Southern countries, migration means the departure of the most skilled and enterprising citizens."
"This has dramatic effects for the poor countries, since this phenomenon often has an impact on essential sectors such as health and education."
"From this point of view, I am delighted that the Commission is putting forward proposals aimed at dealing with these challenges."
"What I want to see more generally, however, is for Europe to entirely change its thinking and for that thinking to be defended."
"We have an opportunity, since in September the UN will deal with the issue of migration and development for the first time."
"I would like to thank the honourable Members who have supported me in the drawing up of this report."
"."
"Mr President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the Committee on Development, and in particular Mrs Carlotti, on its work."
"I can assure you that the Commission attaches great importance to this very topical issue of the links between immigration and development, and I can also assure you that the Commission will take your suggestions very seriously."
"This is a highly detailed report that deals with a very wide range of subjects."
"Given the time restraints, I shall therefore focus on two very important series of issues."
"The first series of issues relates to the coherence of the Community’s actions."
"I would like to remind you that, for the first time, the Commission has established a very clear link between migration and development."
"It wanted to send a very clear message about the added value that can be obtained by improving the interaction between migratory phenomena and development."
"As your report quite rightly points out, there are two dimensions to this interaction."
"On the one hand, development policy can play an important role in terms of migratory flows."
"Last year, the European Union firmly reiterated its commitment to an ambitious development policy, which is aimed at promoting economic and social development and good governance."
"This policy can thereby contribute to tackling the underlying causes of migration."
"This is clearly a long-term project and we cannot expect to see results in the short term."
"I have seen that your report contains some interesting suggestions in this field and we shall look carefully at a number of them."
"The integration of migration issues into country strategy papers, for example, is something that the Commission has already implemented."
"On the other hand, certain phenomena linked to migration may make an effective contribution to the development of countries of origin."
"That is what the Commission pointed out last year in its communication on immigration and development."
"That document proposes guidelines which may be used in our relations with the countries of origin in question and which may be eligible for Community financial support."
"I particularly welcome your recommendation in the field of co-development, an area which the Commission is also examining."
"I quote, ‘the priority objective must be to promote the “circulation” of brains in order to compensate for the negative effects of the brain drain."
"One of the most promising means for doing this are “dual base” systems, which would allow researchers, teachers and medical staff from the South to spend half of their time working in an establishment in their own country’."
"This seems to me to be an extremely interesting recommendation."
"I consider this particular recommendation in the report, which relates to how to involve migrant populations in the development of countries of origin, to be a very important suggestion."
"In this field, Mrs Carlotti’s report offers real added value."
"The report’s position is clear: it relies very much on experience of co-development."
"The Commission has very little experience in this field and I am entirely prepared to base the Commission’s considerations on the experiences and examples of best practices developed by certain Member States."
"The report proposes the creation of two funds – I am talking about recommendation 15 – the first intended to fund co-development, the second dedicated to a mechanism for guaranteeing the continuity of microprojects."
"If I have understood correctly, your idea is to create these funds under the new thematic strategies on migration."
"I personally would be in favour of creating two items of this type within the thematic programme."
"Nevertheless, I have yet to discuss this with my colleagues Mr Frattini and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner."
"I must also thank you, on behalf of the Commission, for your report’s backing for most of the guidelines contained in the Commission’s communication on migration and development, including the transfer of migrants, the role of migrant populations as factors in the development of countries of origin and the promotion of circular migration and other forms of ‘circulation’ of brains."
"I must however stipulate that the Commission can only consider actions in this field in strict accordance with the principle of voluntary agreement on the part of migrants and of the independent nature of that agreement."
"In a similar vein, the money transferred by migrants clearly cannot be seen as a replacement for public development aid, which is more necessary than ever, and to the increase in which the European Union is firmly committed."
"I would like finally to confirm that the Commission attaches great importance to policies aimed at alleviating the effects of the brain drain."
"In this regard, I would like to remind you that last December the Commission adopted a communication on the human resources crisis in the health sectors of developing countries."
"That communication also contains extremely precise and specific guidelines."
"The Commission has established a very ambitious working programme which it intends to implement in close coordination with the Member States, some of which have also launched their own initiatives."
"All of these initiatives are being carried out, or will be carried out, in partnership with the countries of origin."
"The second series of issues that I would like briefly to discuss with you – and this will be no surprise to you – is the very special place that Africa has in this reflection."
"This point is made very clear in your report."
"Problems such as the brain drain, the high cost of transfers of money and the weakness of the financial infrastructure on the ground are of very particular significance in Sub-Saharan Africa."
"It is perhaps in this field that the involvement of migrant populations, if certain conditions are in place, would be most likely to make a difference."
"In its conclusions of last December, the European Council pointed out clearly that the two complementary dimensions of improving the links between migration and development that I have just mentioned must be given a special place in the partnership that we are in the process of building with Africa in the migratory field, at all levels of discussion."
"The links between migration and development will therefore be central to the agenda of the Rabat conference that will bring together representatives from Europe, the Maghreb and countries of Central and West Africa next week to discuss the issue of migration."
"The links between migration and development are also one of the key elements of the dialogue that the Commission is developing with a number of Sub-Saharan African countries on the basis of Article 13 of the Cotonou Agreement."
"The Commission believes that these discussions offer an opportunity to hold a dialogue on the specific support that the Community can give to its African partners to help them better to manage migratory flows and in particular to make better use of the links between migration and development."
"Finally, these links are also central to our dialogue with the African Union."
"This should lead to a ministerial conference that will bring together representatives from the European Union and the whole of Africa."
"It is therefore by creating more channels of communication that the Commission is endeavouring to develop what we intend to be an exemplary partnership with Africa in the field of migration."
"There is no question that in this way the European Union can make an important contribution to the high-level dialogue on migration and development that the United Nations is holding in New York in September."
"In a few days’ time, the Commission will adopt a communication which will constitute its written contribution to that event."
"."
"Mr President, I would like first of all to thank Mrs Carlotti."
"I congratulate her for her report and I thank her for taking up the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on behalf of which I am speaking today, in particular noting that the link between immigration and development is an integral part of the foreign policy agenda of the European Union."
"It has been so from the time that the Barcelona Process was instituted, but it has continued in all other issues of our relations with the countries of origin and transit."
"It is very important to tackle the issue of immigration, to manage migratory flows when we achieve the understanding and the cooperation of the countries of origin and transit."
"As has been said by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, remittances around the world to developing countries amount to USD 232 billion per year, which is double the size of foreign aid to developing countries by everybody else."
"Therefore, this is the significance of facilitating remittances, facilitating the issue of circular migration, thus gaining the confidence of the countries we want to cooperate with."
"We are not aiming at the brain-drain that they are so afraid of; we do not talk only about illegal immigration, but we know how to take best advantage of immigration in view of our ageing population and the need that lies ahead."
"I would like to conclude by saying that by putting order in the financial institutions, as regards both the sending and receiving side, we can also deal with the issue of terrorist financing that has been thought to come via charity organisations and so on in Europe."
". – I would like to congratulate Mrs Carlotti on preparing this report and I would like to thank colleagues from my committee for preparing our opinion."
"I also spoke on this matter yesterday evening, but I did not touch on one important thing – the question of qualified migrants or the brain-drain, which can have a negative impact on the development of a country."
"However, I do not believe that we need to stop this process, but strive for reciprocal benefits."
"Thus, I would like to stress that, in my opinion, it is very important to introduce a clear and as simple as possible procedure for recognising qualifications."
"We also need to introduce an equivalent of the USA's Green Card, which would stimulate circular migration."
"We need to recognise that, without appropriate conditions for integration, migration is harmful to both sides."
"Colleagues, yesterday, the French won – I congratulate them, and in particular the fact that the honour of France was largely defended by players who are themselves or whose parents were migrants."
"Now they are French."
"This is a perfect example of integration."
"Congratulations."
". Mr President, I would like to express my deepest thanks to Mrs Carlotti for her fine report which has my full support."
"The phenomenon that is migration is as old as mankind itself."
"Since time immemorial, we have been searching for a place to call home, along with security and peace."
"Certain individuals leave their homeland voluntarily but most men, women and children flee from violence, hunger, poverty and persecution."
"Poverty is an overwhelming driving force."
"We can build walls around Europe but these will not stop people who are seeking a better life far from home."
"According to the United Nations, there are approximately 191 million migrants worldwide."
"Half of these are women."
"Female migrants and refugees live with the enormous risk of becoming the victims of sexual exploitation and violence."
"The correlations between migration and the slave trade in this regard must, above all, be examined from a gender perspective."
"When calling for a guarantee fund for microprojects involving migrants, gender-specific projects must receive special attention."
"I ask myself how we can be proud of a European Union where women who have fled their homelands on account of poverty and violence become the victims of discrimination and exploitation."
"Migrants make an enormous contribution to the development of their homelands."
"Every year, EUR 150 billion are transferred via banks."
"This is three times the development aid offered worldwide."
"On top of this, a further EUR 300 billion is received through other channels."
"In this regard, I am particularly calling for more transparency and aid as regards financial transfers to the countries of origin."
"In September, for the first time, the UN would like to deal with the theme of migration and development in the context of a high level dialogue."
"Through its delegation, the European Parliament should demonstrate that this silent human rights crisis, as Mr Kofi Annan termed it, puts us to shame and that we want to stand up for a more just situation for migrants and refugees."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Carlotti for the excellent cooperation between us when negotiating the amendments that are going to allow the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to back this report."
"Nevertheless, we have been talking about this issue for a long time – the Commissioner has reminded us of the many times we have dealt with it – but very little has been achieved so far."
"This is a clear example of the paralysis we are suffering from and illustrates the current situation of European politics in relation to one of our most serious problems."
"The Council has not been able to reach a common position, and it does not appear that it is going to do so, while each Member State adopts unilateral measures, which are often contradictory, and then asks the Council for help, as if the Council had nothing to do with them."
"The Commission says – as the Commissioner who is here today said a fortnight ago in Vienna – that it does what it can but that this is a competence of the Member States, and it is absolutely right."
"Furthermore, it currently lacks an operational and sufficient budget; we are working with the extension of a budget that expired almost a year ago now."
"Meanwhile, thousands of illegal immigrants are crossing our borders and in certain countries this happens on a daily basis."
"There is no doubt that we can do many things, as Mrs Carlotti’s report indicates."
"Money sent by immigrants triple — not double, as has been said — the total volume of official development aid throughout the world, but these investments do not represent an economically productive income in the countries of origin."
"There is little, and sometimes no, application of the Cotonou Agreement in the majority of cases."
"Article 42 of the European Union Treaty would allow for the adoption of measures to combat people trafficking; after three years, the Commission also told us a fortnight ago in Vienna that it is assessing the issue and will make proposals in the future."
"I could carry on giving examples, but those will suffice."
"I believe that the time has come to act and leave statements of intent for later and for less serious issues."
". – Mr President, migration is an international phenomenon."
"Europe concerns itself with visas, with coastal surveillance, with customs policy, with combating people-trafficking, with labour market policy, and with integration: that, putting it in broad terms, is what Commissioner Frattini is doing with AENEAS."
"We believe that the security arrangements, which are often anti-immigrant or intended to curtail immigration, must be paid for from their own independent budget, rather than by stealing from development funds."
"Our concern today, then, is in fact with the other side of the coin – the development aspects of migration: migration from one part of the South to another, migration as a cause of under-development and instability."
"The issues here are education, health care, and Mrs Carlotti’s practical and good proposals; the migrants who are driven from one country to another, those who are refugees within their own country, ECHO, the coordination of UNCHR, NGOs, regional organisations, preventing ethnic groups from being persecuted or isolated, whether this be in Asia, Latin America or Africa; uprooted populations, vulnerable groups, among them primarily women and children."
"The Commissioner was right to say that these issues fit outstandingly well into development policy, being the typical things that official development aid is spent on, but all those things that have to do with migration policy, on the basis of Europe’s perfectly legitimate interest in it being well-managed and safe, certainly go further than official development aid and are not primarily aimed at dealing with poverty."
"We must look after our own interests, but must not arrange our own affairs or pay for this at the cost of poor countries in unstable regions, for that affects the fundamental causes of poverty."
"The intention of the Carlotti report is that the new geographical and thematic development instrument should address precisely these underlying causes."
"From India to Bangladesh, from Bolivia to Ecuador, the new instrument can be the means whereby Europe can make a good contribution."
"That is why it is relevant that, of the 17 billions that we will be spending over the next six years, we are setting aside at least 50% for those celebrated Millennium Development Goals, while redoubling our efforts in favour of basic education and health care by bringing the amount allocated to them up to 20%. As Bono would say: ‘Put your money where your mouth is; make poverty history’."
"I think the Commissioner has no intention of doing anything else."
". – Migration, especially economic migration, has a history of more than three centuries."
"But today, the countries of the developed world are encouraging the migration of labour forces from developing countries."
"We are trying to solve the problem of an ageing population and a shortage of labour in our own countries at the expense of third countries."
"We hope to satisfy the anticipated demand for labour in the future not by fostering innovations more actively – one of the most important means of increasing work productivity, but through migration."
"On the one hand, the European Union is supporting the growth of qualified labour forces in developing countries by implementing development policy and providing developing countries with over 55 per cent of world aid."
"On the other hand however, it is striving to entice the best workers in order to solve its economic problems."
"Very often, these workers acquired their qualifications in Europe or with European Union funds."
"Thus, part of the EU funds set aside for development aid are used to finance the labour market of the EU itself."
"Migrants support their families with money earned in the EU, but their contribution to the development of their countries of origin would be far greater if they worked and created wealth not abroad, but in their own countries."
"Migration policy is not just an EU matter."
"Agreements with third countries and the establishment of migration policy, above all in third countries, is one of the prerequisites of the economic growth of developing countries."
"As well as migration policy, the priorities for developing countries themselves should be strategies for the establishment and expansion of their economy and the creation of jobs for their labour forces."
"Meanwhile, the European Union must help implement those strategies, or else developing countries will forever be poor."
"."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank Mrs Carlotti for this report, which proposes many interesting initiatives, though, as the Commissioner has pointed out, there appears to be a lack of coherence amongst the different policies of the European Union."
"During this part-session we have dealt with a number of reports on issues such as asylum, immigration and development which in some cases take us in contradictory directions."
"We must acknowledge that today, in our countries, the prevailing tendency is towards securitarianism."
"There is an excessive tendency to link immigration and security, and the policies adopted are essentially aimed at sending immigrants back to their countries of origin, particularly illegal immigrants."
"The impression is that people only show any real interest in immigrants when they want to go home: this effectively means not recognising the freedom of those people who wish to settle and live in a country other than the one from which they originate."
"As you know, subsidiarity is also very important in this field, and the Member States implement policies which are their own and which vary from country to country."
"In France, the government's current policy is aimed at expulsion and at sending illegal immigrants home; just today, in front of the European Parliament, there is a demonstration in support of school children threatened with expulsion."
"This kind of policy has not been adopted in Spain or other places, and in some countries, how to react to illegal immigration is being considered."
"Subsidiarity is therefore much too important in this field."
"While co-development seems an interesting idea, I do not believe that it can replace the necessary European Union public policies, which are extremely strong, in the field of promoting the rule of law and democracy."
"Going beyond any difficulties we may face, that is the aim of the Union’s actions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which places the emphasis on public policies in the fields of health, education and the environment, but this has regrettably been jeopardised over recent years by other policies on the part of the Union and the Member States, particularly in the economic and commercial fields."
"We therefore need coherence and a global approach, so that we can link immigration to sustainable development issues and not treat it as simply a security issue."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, two points of view are always wrestled with as regards the topic of migration."
"On the one hand, the libertarian perspective, which focuses on human rights and the Millennium Development Goals; on the other, the point of view adopted by Interior Ministers, who instead view an external threat, predominates."
"In view of the growing and current dramas associated with migration, the EU debate is dominated, unfortunately, by Commissioner Frattini and the Ministers for the Interior."
"Border protection facilities and intervention teams form part of this picture."
"Yet your very fine report, Mrs Carlotti, analyses the causes and status of migration in the 21st century in much greater depth and also proposes a whole raft of very sensible measures which I am unable to reflect on here in the two minutes I have available, however."
"Your call for controlled migration should not mean though that in future, for instance, the EU turns Lampedusa into Ellis Island or perhaps something even more terrible, namely that there are combined EU refugee and recruitment camps in the Libyan desert and which also therefore operate outside EU legal standards."
"Naturally, I also regret the lack of proposals for resolving the situation of migrants who live outside official legal status in the EU."
"The crux of the entire migration policy remains the growing economic and social disparity between the European Union and those regions of Africa that are becoming impoverished, and the EU is itself contributing to this impoverishment with its aim of competing for leadership in the global economy."
"Please take the fair trade report to be debated here later in Parliament seriously if you wish to reduce migration out of economic necessity."
"Combat the contribution Europe is making to the migration of war refugees through its arms exports and reduce the emissions output of Europe and its trading partners if your desire is to reduce migration which is primarily the result of climate change and the spread of deserts."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party."
"I am grateful to the Commission and to the rapporteur for having addressed this issue."
"The strategies proposed, which are primarily designed to facilitate financial transactions and the transfer of pension rights, constitute two measures that are feasible in practice and that would have a significant impact on the precarious resources of many immigrants."
"However, the proposal to channel the income generated into measures designed to promote development in the country of origin also seems extremely important and reasonable to me."
"If it is true, as the report claims, that better management of migration promotes development, then it is in fact also true that we should ensure that the most competent human resources do at any rate find attractive opportunities in their countries of origin and are encouraged to take the resources they have accumulated, together with their wealth of experience, back to those countries, for the benefit of their communities."
"I am referring in particular to doctors, professionals, teachers and researchers."
"It is in fact rather idealistic in this day and age to believe that, after years of studying and working in Europe, a citizen of a third country might spontaneously decide to return to a country lacking in adequate social structures and systems."
"With this in mind, we therefore need to pay extremely close attention to the management of any funds that may be generated, so that the efforts of individuals and of the international community are not wasted."
"Mr President, as well as thanking Mrs Carlotti for her thorough work, I would like to draw your attention to three points."
"Globalisation also involves people breaking down barriers in their search for normal living conditions."
"However, differences in levels of economic development and political models impede the free movement of people."
"If, within the framework of the WTO, we cannot agree to the free movement of goods, it seems that agreeing to the free movement of people is an even more difficult task, although these two issues are worlds apart."
"Although we lack such an agreement, people do migrate, in particular to richer countries."
"The European Union, as a destination for migrants, will be increasingly obliged to draw up solutions to this issue."
"Currently, we face the problem of Malta."
"Another problematic issue is the phenomenon of selective immigration, which mainly benefits rich countries."
"We are talking about the brain drain, which is immoral with respect to poor countries."
"We need a good policy to prevent the situation deteriorating in places such as Africa due to the exodus of educated people, and we need instead to help these countries to develop."
"Examples of such a policy are reintegration projects, which I had the pleasure of discussing with Commissioner Luis Michel."
"As we already have immigrants in the European Union, in countries such as Scotland, which are already an attractive destination for Poles and Slovaks and are likely to become all the more attractive for citizens of countries such as Togo or Jamaica, we have to create an educational, social and legal programme to integrate immigrants as rapidly as possible into their host countries."
"The immigrants have indeed adapted."
"The period of integration is both a psychological factor and an economic one."
"The shorter and more sensible this period is, the better the outcome will be for both sides: for the immigrants and for the hosts."
"As a result of these actions, we will be able to avoid the phenomenon of ‘brain waste’, namely a loss of skills."
"Finally, I would just like to add that the problem of mainly economic immigration does not only affect France, Sweden or Malta."
"It is a common, serious problem facing the 25 Member States of the European Union."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating my friend and colleague Mrs Carlotti for the work she has done, above all because I believe that it brings development policy to the fore within the Union's foreign policy when we are dealing with the phenomenon of migration too."
"There is no question that in the future we will not so much have to slow down migration, but rather regulate it, so that today’s movements of people benefit countries of origin, transit and destination, as they have always done."
"The States know that their objective and interests can be better served if there is cooperation and if their actions are coordinated."
"The Euro-African Summit on migration will take place next week in Rabat."
"Development cooperation is a priority on its agenda."
"We would ask that this opportunity be taken to establish concrete measures aimed at the development of African countries and we call upon the Union to make a decisive commitment to democracy, peace and security in the countries of origin of migration, leaving behind the all-too-frequent approach"
"Perhaps what we should do is promote education, which always brings freedom and development."
"We must improve and increase the Union’s presence at political and institutional levels."
"The right to development is multi-faceted however and it means economic exchange, cultural exchange, conflict management, combating terrorism, environmental protection and policies to promote gender equality."
"There is no doubt that migration brings benefits, but the benefits of international migration, not just for migrants but also for the societies receiving them, will only be possible if we maintain respect for the rights of workers, which are the universal guarantee against exploitation."
"The rights of all workers must be protected, whether they be legal or not."
"The measures we provide for must fully respect the rights of people coming to our borders, including the right to asylum."
"In this regard, the European Union must ensure that asylum seekers are not denied the international protection they require."
"As we all know, Mr President, migration and movements of people cannot be stopped."
"Let us guarantee respect for the rights of migrants."
"Mr President, the fact that the European Parliament is discussing development in relation to the question of migration shows that we are open to the problems of developing countries."
"We want migration to become a part of the development process."
"Unfortunately, at the moment, this is merely a pious desire."
"If this desire is to become a reality, certain conditions must be fulfilled."
"I will mention two of them."
"Firstly, migration needs to become cyclical in order to avoid the ‘brain drain’ phenomenon as much as possible."
"Secondly, the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers needs to be ratified by all Member States."
"Finally, the issue of migration and development significantly affects relations between the European Union and the ACP countries."
"That is why the EU-ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly, of which I am a member, must seriously investigate this matter."
"To end my speech, I would like to extend my warm thanks and congratulations to my colleague Mrs Carlotti."
"– The Carlotti report is a step in the right direction."
"Development aid is necessary, but is not in itself sufficient. New instruments and measures have been proposed that will enhance the lives of immigrants and their relationship with their countries of origin."
"This is a fair, intelligent approach, which replaces the current policy focused on border controls with a two-way migratory flow strategy."
"Fortress Europe has been condemned, with its inevitable cost of death in the Mediterranean."
"All that is lacking now is commitment, and a clear position on detention centres, which are unacceptable."
"The rapporteur also recognises that on one side of an invisible border are the citizens and on the other people with no papers who are forced into resorting to illegal methods."
"What is the upshot of this? Immigrants without papers?"
"No."
"Temporary authorisations for seeking work?"
"Yes."
"This is where the principle of citizenship takes us."
"Ladies and gentlemen, even while this report was being considered in the Committee on Development Cooperation, I realised what the main thing was about it that I found disappointing."
"I find the same thing here in this debate in this Chamber."
"Nowhere, it appears, is anyone stopping to consider the inevitable social consequences of migration for the countries of the EU, which are already wrestling with the problems presented by the formation of ghettos, criminality, rootlessness and Islamism."
"After what happened in the French suburbs last autumn, I would have expected some reflection on this from a French rapporteur in particular."
"We must not, in this debate, point an accusing finger at the people who flee their countries of origin in search of a better life."
"They are doing only what anyone would do, but Michel Rocard, incidentally the former chairman of this House’s Committee on Development Cooperation, and a member of the same party as the rapporteur, got the measure of the situation when he, as the Socialist Prime Minister of France, said that ‘France cannot take upon herself all the miseries of the world’ – and nor, for that matter, can Europe do so."
"It is, moreover, primarily the weakest people in the countries of origin in Africa, the ones who do not have the means or the clout to get themselves out, who are the victims of the immigration flows, the victims of open borders, for they are left behind, poorer than ever."
"Such ideas as the mobility of brainpower and circular migration may be appealing, but they are unrealistic and do nothing to change the situation."
"More immigration into our own countries, then, means more misery in the developing world, contrary to what the report suggests."
"What Europe needs is for immigration to be stopped outright; what the developing countries need is effective aid on the ground."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, in these works by plenary, we have in particular debated issues relating to migration."
"We have referred to numerous dimensions and aspects which relate mainly to the management of migration flows at our borders and within the Member States."
"The report by Mrs Carlotti gives us a new and very important dimension and I thank her for that."
"It is the dimension, it is the relationship between migration and development, the relationship between the European Union and the developing world countries which are mainly countries of origin of immigrants and political refugees."
"Our external action at Community and national level gives us many opportunities to create conditions of sustainable development in countries and communities which suffer from absolute poverty, to create jobs, democratic institutions and structures and protection for human and social rights."
"These conditions will give hope to the local populace and prospects for a better life at home."
"The regional funds, European cooperation, stability agreements, our development action within the framework of the United Nations, the good neighbourhood policy and everything else already referred to are exceptional tools, but they are tools we must make better use of, with better coordination and serious and proper evaluation of our policies and our objectives, both by our central services and our representations, which have enhanced, decentralised responsibilities and better knowledge of local needs."
"We also need to achieve better cooperation with local factors at all levels."
"In addition, Commissioner, at the level of transparency and terms of good governance, our control mechanisms must put before their responsibilities both national and local administrators in beneficiary countries."
"On behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I should like to stress the importance of adding the gender dimension to all our policies, because women are the most serious victims of all forms of discrimination in developing countries and the first victims of illegal immigration when they arrive in our communities."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Carlotti on her excellent work."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I was very pleased to see that the majority of our proposals have been incorporated into the final text, in particular the protection of migrant women against discrimination and violence, and improving their access to health services, to education and to employment, as well as the need to pay special attention to the children of these female migrants, and the situation of women displaced as a result of conflicts."
"My only regret is that one of my proposals aimed at allowing migrant women in illegal situations access to health care and to legal and psychological support has not been included."
"These women in illegal situations represent a particularly vulnerable category whose fundamental rights must be protected, just like those of people with legal status."
"I hope that this point can be dealt with within the context of the report by Mrs Kratsa, which is specifically dedicated to the situation of migrant women."
"Mr President, Mrs Carlotti, Commissioner."
"Migration, especially illegal migration, has until now been a problem of colonial or mother countries, leading to the introduction of strict visa requirements and making necessary laws on migration and international discussion of the topic."
"The complexity of the problem is vividly demonstrated by the present situation, in which 60 000 people are waiting on the northern coast of Africa for the opportunity to come to Spain."
"In connection with globalisation, the issue of migration will likely also reach the new Member States."
"Mr President, Europe has a moral obligation to help at least a few migrants reach the countries of the developed world so that they may break out of their current conditions and find a decent life, enabling them to acquire an education and profession and later return to their country of origin, thereby bringing about circular migration."
"In order to implement the above-mentioned suggestions, it will be necessary to update and reform the immigration policy of the Member States of the European Union."
"The channelling of legal immigration will require long-term cooperation between countries of origin and target countries, but the latter proposal will demand increased funding."
"Thus, Mr President, it is not impossible that we will soon have to speak of the European Union’s common migration policy, so as not to find ourselves in the same complicated position we face today in connection with the European Union’s common energy policy."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work on this report and for the clear conclusions drawn in it. These include the admission that the European Union has still not found a common, cohesive solution to the issue of immigration."
"It is a worthy challenge on a large scale: 3% of the world’s population, namely 175 million people, are migrants, and 40% of these people live in developing countries."
"The European Union is sometimes criticised for earmarking too few resources for the integration of immigrants and refugees."
"Over the last seven years, EUR 15 million has been spent."
"This amounts to half a euro per immigrant."
"However, it also seems that using these resources efficiently is no less of a problem."
"We have seen many worrying signs of this and we hear reports of wastefulness and corruption in the distribution of funds."
"Aid for immigrants has a moral and also a political dimension, as we need to work out a new, transparent European Union policy in this field."
"The fact is that, over the last 10 years, the European Union’s migration policy has been rather more restrictive than it was before."
"Let us also not fool ourselves into thinking that this policy will become less restrictive in the coming years."
"The opposite is more likely to be the case."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, around the world there are currently almost 10 million refugees and 25 million people displaced within their countries, mainly in the countries of the South."
"Given that I was once a refugee myself and passed through the refugee system – a refugee camp – I should like to devote this speech to the situation of migrants in refugee and transit areas."
"There is no doubt in my mind that the living conditions of migrants in host and transit countries, especially in the Sahel countries, must be improved."
"The time has come to build a variety of information centres, foreign aid centres and legal aid centres."
"Programmes aimed at preventing and treating various diseases including sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS should be put forward."
"The most vulnerable sections of society, including women and children, should be the main focus of assistance."
"I would therefore urge the Commission to develop an integrated strategy aimed at supporting host and transit countries."
"The capacity of these southern countries needs to be bolstered and the right of such countries to pursue their own independent migration policy should be respected."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to highlight the incompleteness of the report, which talks about immigrants’ rights without, however, referring to their obligations."
"It also says nothing whatsoever about the danger that certain forms of extreme religious beliefs bring to our Europe."
"I cannot overlook the fact that people have been murdered – the last of whom being Theo Van Gogh – and that, due to certain attitudes of immigrants, our freedom has been significantly restricted, so much so that it has become downright dangerous or impossible to wear a satirical t-shirt like the one that I have with me here."
"No reference is made to this issue in the report."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by warmly thanking Mrs Carlotti for her excellent work, the approach of which I support fully."
"In the South, migration too often means the departure of the best-trained citizens, a real haemorrhage of skills, depriving those countries of revenue and jeopardising the provision and quality of essential services, which are crucial to their true development."
"Let us make no mistake: this brain drain is encouraged by the policies of selective admission of migrants implemented in the North, under the name ‘selective migration’ or ‘selective immigration’."
"Selective immigration in the North always means immigration suffered in the South, a policy which effectively deprives the South of any right to development."
"In opposition to this approach which has such harmful results, the general philosophy and the concrete measures proposed in this report, such as circular immigration as an alternative to the brain drain, the ‘circulation’ of brains, seem to me to be interesting."
"We have here the notion of shared immigration, of each party enriching the other."
"We are talking about promoting co-development, of enshrining it in European texts, without forgetting the funding it requires, of thereby recognising and supporting the role of migrants in the development of their countries of origin."
"The true intention would be to turn immigration into a lever for development and for mutual aid amongst peoples."
"I hope that this essential solidarity will dominate the discussions at the forthcoming Euro-African Conference in Rabat."
"We are all aware of the history of walls being erected in the illusion that they will protect people from each other."
"They are always destined to be breached and ultimately destroyed."
"– Mr President, I too should like to take my turn in congratulating Mrs Carlotti on her report, because it really has come at the right time, in view of the fact that the UN General Assembly is due to meet in September and will examine the relationship between migration and development."
"I believe that the time has now come from us to move from words and wishes to deeds."
"We all talk about achieving the Millennium Development Goals, but nowhere is there any express reference to the problem of migration."
"I believe that the UN assembly in September will be a good opportunity to explicitly link development objectives to migration and, more importantly, for the response to this global problem to be a quantifiable objective within the framework of a specific timetable."
"The European Union must speed up the incorporation of migration into all external actions and foreign policy and, more importantly, we must examine ways of incorporating it into the new strategy for development cooperation, the new European neighbourhood strategy."
"I believe that the Euro-African summit will be an opportunity to discuss all these problems, but what we need above all is an integrated and cohesive European Union strategy."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and to draw attention to one aspect of development and migration that increases the wealth and intellectual potential of already prosperous states and bleeds developing countries dry."
"I am talking about the brain drain."
"Development policies will not yield results unless this process at least slows down."
"At the moment the EU offers help to developing countries with one hand, which is visible, and takes it away with the other, which is invisible."
"First, I suggest we tidy things up at home in the European Union, where we are seeing a similar brain drain from the new to the old countries."
"The process is even more painful, since internal borders and barriers are diminishing and disappearing."
"The EU must create a special fund to regulate the brain drain and soften its impact."
"After sorting out the situation at home, we could use that as a basis for cooperation with the developing countries and with the USA, which profits greatly from the brain drain."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I naturally agree with the thrust of what has been said."
"In the short time available to me, I should like to mention a few points that will help me to set out my position clearly on a number of issues and proposals."
"I should first like to reassure Mr van den Burg regarding his extremely important question on the need to make a clear distinction between security-related and development-related spending."
"It is obviously not a matter of using development resources to finance security measures."
"The development budget should not be funding these measures."
"From this point of view, you can be reassured by the Commission."
"The second point that I consider important is the old chestnut of the ‘brain drain’."
"As Commissioner for development, I should like there to be no doubt as to my commitment on this issue."
"I am opposed to the policies of some Member States, which actually call for, and tempt people with, selective immigration."
"In my view, selective immigration is a cynical concept of development and I do not accept it."
"In this regard, I am suspicious of suggestions and ideas revolving around the notion of the ‘green card’."
"I feel it is very dangerous to play with ideas that clearly tie in with ‘selective immigration’."
"I do not like this approach and I feel it is right to make this point clearly."
"I must say, Mrs Aubert, that I warmly welcome your call for investment in public policies."
"You speak of the EU’s public policies, but one should really focus principally on the public policies of the partner states and of developing countries."
"This is one of my obsessions because it forms the very foundations of reconstruction and development."
"It is extremely difficult to encourage citizens from developing countries who live without prospects, who feel that they have no prospects, who live without access to the basic services that any normal society should provide, to stay at home and contribute to their countries."
"In other words, everything that revolves around the states’ ability to guarantee basic services – namely access to education, health, administration, justice, culture, basic goods – should form a central part of our development strategies. There is no doubt in my mind that therein lie the ultimate answers to the phenomenon of immigration."
"The essential functions of the State, so dear to those like me who believe in the primacy of the secular nature of States, must be developed."
"This is something I consider important."
"I should like to commend all of the speakers without mentioning all of them by name."
"I agree entirely with Mr Kulakowski, who placed the accent on extremely close ties between migration and development."
"The proper response to migration is development, purely and simply."
"The answer is not to close the borders, to send people back or ‘selective immigration’."
"The proper response lies in development projects aimed at strengthening, improving or rebuilding the countries concerned."
"In a number of developing countries, one can say that there is no longer a State and I would urge the EU, our institutions and the ACP countries particularly affected to come together around the negotiating table."
"Lastly, I should like to say to Mr Dillen that he has quoted Mr Rocard totally out of context."
"Of course Europe cannot absorb all of the world’s misery."
"I should like to tell him, however, that the wealthy world could do so comfortably, so there is no excuse."
"That, Mr Dillen, is simply a matter of political will."
"I know that in this area you have none."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today."
"The next item is the report (A6-0207/2006) by Mr Frithjof Schmidt, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on fair trade and development (2005/2245(INI))."
". – Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, by means of the report on fair trade and development, we, as Parliament, are reacting to the remarkable economic and political success story which is fair trade."
"In recent years, growth rates in fair trade within Europe have risen, on average, by 20%, with the trend upwards."
"In individual countries, we have market shares of up to 20%, as is the case with coffee in Great Britain."
"This all serves to demonstrate the success of a civil society initiative under market conditions which, hitherto, has got by without significant state support and funding."
"At the same time, this is also directly successful in combating poverty since fair prices guarantee a fair income. It is also fairly crucial as regards social development in the southern states that producers in these countries receive a fair income."
"At the same time, the entire matter demonstrates the high level of awareness on the part of European consumers and their interest in social responsibility in relation to trade internationally speaking as well as high product quality."
"This topic also therefore concerns the protection of consumer interests."
"Fair prices, fair working and production conditions, adherence to ecological standards; all of these things are of equal benefit to the quality of life of producers in the south and consumers in the north."
"There was also broad agreement in the Committee on Development, something I am very pleased about."
"At this point therefore, I would like to extend my express thanks to all my colleagues in the Committee on Development, the shadow rapporteurs, and the coordinators, for their constructive advice."
"The report was adopted unanimously in committee."
"This was preceded by intensive exchanges between the Fair Trade Movement and numerous associations on the problems of fair trade."
"In committee, we jointly drew up and put forward criteria which have to be met by products designated ‘fair trade’ so as not to deceive consumers."
"This report therefore calls on the Commission to present a recommendation relating to fair trade."
"This involves the promotion of a political and economic concept and not, for instance, the promotion of a trade name, nor does it involve a legally binding, detailed regulation or a Fair Trade Act for the whole of Europe."
"It is not, nor should it be, our intention to over regulate and, hence, possibly impede this successful, burgeoning market."
"However, it does involve defining criteria which make up the substance of the concept of ‘fair trade’."
"Key criteria that have been put forward to this end in the report include, , producer prices which guarantee their existence, informing consumers about the prices maintained by producers, that is, transparency, observance of the core conventions of the International Labour Organisation regarding health and safety at work and child labour in relation to production, the observance of environmental standards, supporting production and market access by producer organisations and monitoring compliance with these criteria."
"It would be important for these points to be included in the Commission’s recommendation."
"At this point, I would also expressly like to thank the Commission."
"Especially in the Directorate General for Development and the Directorate General for Trade, openness to and, I might add, also a liking for this report, was clear to see."
"We had highly constructive exchanges."
"One more personal observation: Commissioner Mandelson, I know that you love chocolate and I have often seen how you prefer fair trade chocolate from Oxfam."
"These are two predilections we both share."
"I am therefore already aware through your consumer habits that you take an open view of this topic."
"I would again like to make a particular appeal to you."
"In the ‘aid for trade’ programme, which is now being discussed at the WTO, create an ‘aid for fair trade sector.’"
"If we were only able to use 10% of the funds in this area for the fair trade sector, that would provide enormous impetus for this fine concept."
"Help us by giving preferential treatment to fair trade products in public invitations to tender, and breathe fresh life into Article 23 of the Cotonou Agreement, whereby fair trade in collaboration with ACP (Africa, Caribbean and Pacific) States is to be accorded important status and supported."
"The European Union needs a well-coordinated fair trade policy."
"Parliament will today, I hope, take an important step in this direction and it is then up to the Commission to take a further important step."
"We need this recommendation, Commissioner Mandelson."
"."
"Madam President, I would like straightaway to thank Mr Schmidt for this report and for drawing attention to my increasingly conspicuous consumption habits, which, I am afraid, are becoming only too obvious as I grow into this job as Europe’s Trade Commissioner."
"Sincerely and warmly I would like to thank him for this report, which I think is very valuable and will be well received."
"Fair Trade is one of the key tools, in my view, to enhance sustainable development and to equip us better to fight poverty in the world, and as a concept it is developing fast."
"It is undoubtedly a very popular trade practice."
"It is gaining in currency and appeal with public opinion, and helps to raise public awareness about all the issues that are involved in sustainability."
"You are not just undertaking an act of consumption that is good in terms of the content of what you consume."
"It is also a stimulus to the brain."
"It makes you think and therefore it is even more valuable."
"Consumers do take into account considerations about the conditions of production."
"People care, they do not just eat, and Fair Trade has pioneered this in a most attractive way."
"The Commission actively supports Fair Trade."
"We took on commitments to Fair Trade in the Cotonou Agreement with the ACP countries, as well as in our communication on policy coherence for development."
"Many trade and development assistance projects support Fair Trade: development projects to the tune of over EUR 4 million in 2003, and growing."
"These consist mainly of support for NGO activities, but also of direct aid to the harmonisation of standards at work."
"We also participate in Fair Trade events."
"One could argue that whilst Fair Trade helps salve the conscience of those who buy such products, others continue, nonetheless, to exploit the needy."
"I am not happy about that argument: Fair Trade is not a panacea for all the problems of poor producers, nor does it necessarily mean that because you are not buying and consuming Fair Trade products you are exploiting the poor."
"What is required to tackle poverty and to enhance development is a general and coherent policy framework."
"It is this that we need to develop, to conceptualise, and this report will help us to do so."
"Fair Trade is private and limited to the participating producers, while the UN Millennium Development Goals are for all."
"So Fair Trade is particular and specific, the Millennium Development Goals are general and wide-ranging; but there is a clear interconnection between the two."
"The objective is different for an individual and for EU policy-making."
"An individual makes a personal choice."
"He or she is entitled to exercise that choice."
"You cannot automatically translate that into a more wide-ranging policy."
"The individual consumer looks at one packet of coffee, rightly."
"Policy-makers, on the other hand, have to take into account the sector as a whole and our obligations to that sector as a whole."
"We need a complete and public solution – one that should not be confined, therefore, to Fair Trade only."
"As the report rightly points out, there are other non-Fair Trade operators that can achieve similar results to those obtained by Fair Traders, that have the same growth potential and that can influence consumer choice and the international trading schemes."
"We should fully use the potential of all credible initiatives to support sustainability."
"That should be our test."
"Does it help, does it aid, does it take forward sustainability?"
"If it does, that should govern our response and attitude to it."
"Building on commitments taken previously, we want to explore with our partners the use of economic partnership agreements with the ACP countries, as well as other trade agreements, for including specific incentives targeted at improving market access for fair trade products."
"That is where I believe we can leverage our interest and leverage our commitment most beneficially."
"It is very useful, therefore, that the report points to the danger of inappropriate national legislation in the field of Fair Trade."
"I am aware of some initiatives being taken that might harm the status that Fair Trade has already achieved."
"We need to be vigilant about these and to see, therefore, whether it is not better to take a more coherent and collective approach in order to leverage the greatest benefits for Fair Trade."
"Conversely, too firm an adhesion to the particular approach embodied in Fair Trade would be at risk of being discriminatory against other systems, some of them acknowledged in your report, which have similar claims and that we can and should support."
"You are right about the need to protect consumers, the question is how."
"I believe the role of policy is to ensure that messages given to consumers are accurate and transparent, and I am glad that this is also stressed in the report."
"We already have protection against misleading claims, but we might consider going further and help engage the consumer actively in the ethics of production."
"I believe that there is scope for better information about claims schemes in general, and work is in progress on this."
"I will ask my services to look at how sustainability is enhanced by different certification and assurance schemes, including Fair Trade."
"We will look at all the suggestions made in this report and of course keep Parliament informed of further developments."
"We need a dialogue with Parliament on a continuing basis."
"I am glad, therefore, that this report provides the framework, both for this dialogue and for the way in which we can, should and will take our commitment in this area further forward."
"In conclusion I would like to thank the rapporteur again for the quality of this report."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Frithjof Schmidt, who dealt with the problem in a very objective-oriented manner and successfully put it to the vote."
"Although the topic has been dealt with by the Commission and Parliament on numerous occasions, there is always the need for further action so that fair trade can continue to develop efficiently and successfully."
"What is important here is that central standards and criteria are introduced on which basis the market should develop."
"However, as far as this fledgling sector is concerned, consideration must constantly be given to the fact that precipitous directives always involve the risk of schematic harmonisation and over regulation."
"With a figure of 60-70% of total sales, Europe is the largest sales market for fair trade products and offers, based on my assessment, further opportunities for growth."
"In this regard, it is a matter of particular concern for me that municipalities, towns and cities, and other regional administrative bodies are reminded time and again and asked to consider fair trade products in their invitations to tender as well as use them at various events and suchlike."
"Given the meagre production diversity in fair trade products, the customer is often unsure whether the product designated as such is actually a fair trade product in the first place."
"The bigger this market, the greater the uncertainty."
"Therefore, we may have to consider a European fair trade logo in future."
"For the producers of fair trade products, I am calling for price structuring which ensures their existence, fair production conditions and adherence to environmental standards in the context of sustainable development."
"Fair trade must be inseparably linked to key labour standards."
"Now that we have succeeded in creating positive framework conditions for developing and promoting fair trade, as Europeans, we are able to assume a very important role as a pacesetter in this sphere."
"."
"Madam President, I would like to congratulate and thank Mr Schmidt for this report and for his interesting speech about Fair Trade."
"Fair Trade can make a positive contribution to the development of poor countries by ensuring better conditions for producers and their families, as well as ensuring better access to world markets and promoting sustainable development."
"I would like to draw your attention to a number of points in the text which are problematic due to the substance of the report."
"First of all, in my opinion, the report sometimes confuses the idea of Fair Trade (written in capitals) with fair trade in the general sense."
"The text will be the first in the history of European lawmaking to deal with the Fair Trade sector, or in other words with Fair Trade written in capitals, in the form of a report on goods labelled with the Fair Trade logo and marketed as such."
"The subject of the report should have been the labelling of products so that the guiding principles of Fair Trade would not be distorted at the cost of consumers who want to buy Fair Trade products."
"The report concerns the Fair Trade sector."
"However, and I would like to emphasise this, the report being debated here is not a report on fair trade in sense of making international trade fairer."
"It is clear that fair trade (written using lower case letters) is something different."
"It is an attempt to make all trade fairer and this subject has been touched upon in many other European Parliament resolutions and reports."
"That is why, in my opinion, referring to the Cotonou Agreement in this context is inappropriate, as this Agreement deals with fair trade written in lower case letters and not capital letters."
"I also think that the issue of stabilising prices is a dubious subject and comments related to it will not help us to assess the report as a whole."
"."
"Madam President, last night I was driven home by a Ghanaian taxi driver."
"I believe he was one of the few working, because of the World Cup excitement."
"I asked him whether he liked living in France."
"He said it was OK, but he missed Ghana."
"Here in France, three of his children were able to go to university, something that was impossible to imagine in Ghana."
"I was in Ghana last year."
"What the taxi driver said confirmed what I had seen there."
"I went to northern Ghana to meet tomato and rice farmers."
"They were unable to make a living wage and therefore unable to send their children to school or to have any access to medical care."
"At the same time, on the markets in northern Ghana, there was US-subsidised rice and EU-processed tomato products, cheaper than the local produce."
"On the same trip, we visited Fair Trade cocoa farmers in central Ghana."
"They were certainly not rich people but they had a sustainable price, they had a long-term contract for their product."
"Therefore they were able to access medical care, there was a school for their children, and the Fair Trade premium meant that there was investment in water in their local villages."
"I saw the same differences between Fair Trade farmers and non-Fair Trade farmers in the Windward Islands, on the banana farms."
"We want fair prices for farmers in all developing countries."
"We hope that the WTO will deliver a more just system, but in the meantime we need Fair Trade, with a capital ‘F’ and a capital ‘T’. I am pleased to hear that the Commission will support that."
"On the issue of other labels, yes, other ethical labels are being developed."
"Some of them are very good, but we have to be careful here."
"We cannot have Fair Trade on the cheap."
"As the market gets bigger, there is a temptation for more and more players to want an ethical label, but they do not want to pay the real price."
"So we have to watch who we support and make sure the labels really are ethical."
"Fair Trade is about price and sustainability."
"It is about the Millennium Development Goal of tackling poverty."
"."
"Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Schmidt, on raising the standard and with it our ambitions."
"I am sure we shall all benefit greatly from following his recommendations."
"I also welcome the views as expressed by the Commission."
"I am sure that our partnership approach will deliver much good."
"It is of particular importance, because today much of our food and drink comes from the developing world, where farmers and workers are finding it increasingly difficult to make a decent living."
"In our global marketplace, the use of internationally recognised labels or marks, which conscientious consumers can have confidence in, is a logical and significant contribution to economic and social improvements across the globe."
"Through the use of clear labelling, individuals are beginning to realise that they are able to play their part in tackling the problem of international poverty."
"The simple decision to buy products with a Fair Trade mark can have a huge impact, guaranteeing that growers and workers benefit from fairer wages and better working conditions, and can make a crucial different to their ability to provide for the basic needs of their families."
"In the last five years, the United Kingdom has proved to have the most dynamic Fair Trade structures of all the EU Member States and is the fastest growing Fair Trade market in the world."
"A staggering 87% of the UK population would rather buy from companies that do something positive for the community."
"When asked which products fall into this category, 27% specifically noted Fair Trade products."
"This figure could and should be much higher and it is the duty of all responsible Members of this House to raise awareness of this necessary project."
"In my own north-west constituency, we are determined to promote equality and sustainable development wherever possible."
"Garstang in Lancashire was the first town to achieve Fair Trade status in 2001."
"Thirteen north-west towns, including industrial powerhouses such as Manchester, Lancaster and Liverpool, have all followed."
"Kendal was the first Fair Trade borough and now Lancashire Council has pledged to become the first Fair Trade county."
"As well as in the European Parliament, Fair Trade products are available in many Council buildings, tea and coffee served at meetings is Fair Trade and awareness days have been held to inform staff about the benefits of Fair Trade."
". – At a time when the World Trade Organisation negotiations have hit yet another deadlock, it is good to see this Chamber debating a report on fair trade."
"We know that this is still a drop in the ocean in terms of the global economy and that one million rural workers benefit from it today."
"This may sound like a large number, but it is actually not very many at all. The EU must therefore make a commitment to fair trade, if only to appease the conscience of a common agricultural policy that spreads hunger and poverty in the countries of the South."
"Fair trade could be a feather in your cap, Commissioner."
"Other people, farmers, trade networks and demanding consumers could breathe new life into it."
"Mr Schmidt has put forward some good proposals, especially reducing VAT and the end of import duties, but the positive aspect of the report lies elsewhere; it shows the way forward and a principle of hope."
"With fair trade, the world could be a better place."
"."
"Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report, one that is long overdue."
"Fair Trade is about paying poor producers a fair price and helping them gain the necessary skills and knowledge to develop their business and work their way out of poverty."
"I agree with the Commissioner."
"It is not the sole answer, but it is part of a solution."
"Shoppers who choose produce with the Fair Trade mark play a vital role in alleviating poverty and supporting marginalised producers in a manner that promotes dignity and self-sufficiency."
"New figures released today reveal that global sales of Fair Trade certified products reached 1.1 billion in 2005."
"That represents an increase of 37% over 2004."
"The message is obvious: consumers are happy to support Fair Trade."
"To generate greater sales of Fair Trade terms for the benefit of more marginalised producers, it is important to involve commercial manufacturers and to encourage Fair Trade supply to supermarkets, where most people do their shopping."
"Fair Trade’s significant worldwide growth in 2005 also shows that more and more producers, traders and suppliers trust the Fair Trade certificate mark and like to join the system."
"However, the challenge ahead will be to make sure that the standards in that certification are maintained."
"I recently visited Guatemala with Trocaire, an Irish NGO."
"During our visit we visited the Claremont coffee estate, where 50 families who have lived and worked on that estate for three generations, living in what can only be described as feudal conditions, were thrown off their farm because the owner, who happens to be the sister-in-law of the country’s president, decided that she did not want them on the estate and wanted to change what they were doing."
"They are a group of people who want to start a co-op to produce Fair Trade coffee."
"They know how to produce coffee; as I said, they have been doing it for generations."
"I just want it put on record that I have raised the plight of these people in Guatemala in this House, because I think it is an absolute outrage that people can be treated like that in this day and age."
"Fair Trade is not just about selling and buying, it is about creating justice for people globally."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I am in favour of Fair Trade."
"For me, it means free trade, trade without customs and quotas in an environment where free enterprising spirit and the right to property are respected."
"In parts, this report has a different perspective to mine, and in places it seems almost to strive for the opposite."
"The report mixes up two different kinds of Fair Trade."
"When companies and organisations themselves define what they think is fair and then offer the consumer products produced according to the criteria thus defined, this is a demonstration of consumer power, which is a very good thing."
"The other kind of Fair Trade is when politicians involve themselves in a voluntary business relationship and lay down conditions and prices that they deem to be fair so that they can then call this Fair Trade."
"For me, this is socialism and something very bad."
"The report proposes providing companies’ Fair Trade with a legal basis of its own and setting political goals and criteria."
"This is to take consumer power, which is so important, and turn it into some sort of socialist planned economy."
"It amazes me that so many MEPs think this is desirable."
"Despite the fact that Fair Trade labelling is an expression of consumer power and something very positive, I would still like to conclude by calling on everyone, both politicians and citizens, to continue to be critical consumers, particularly in relation to goods bearing Fair Trade labelling."
"They often give more money and influence to organisations controlled by leftist ideology and opposition to free trade than to the really poor in underdeveloped countries."
"Tropicana and Dole orange juice probably do more to contribute to development and fighting poverty than, for instance, the example we have here from Oxfam."
"The European Parliament’s unthinking embrace of Oxfam is in itself a good example of the crazy turn things can take when we are not critical in embracing Fair Trade products."
"The Oxfam orange juice sold here in Parliament, for example, comes from Cuba."
"Until someone has explained to me how it can be called Fair Trade when I buy state-produced juice and my money goes to a communist dictatorship I demand that all Oxfam products be removed from the range of goods on offer in Parliament, because that is not Fair Trade."
"– Madam President, I wish to convey my congratulations to the rapporteur and also to the draftsman of the opinion."
"It is a very fine report."
"In the case of certain speakers, one gets the impression that they have not read the report and are giving lectures they have brought with them from other political fora."
"Irrespective of whether fair trade is written with capital or small letters, for me, it is very important that attention is drawn to the fact that the ‘fair trade’ label, under the corresponding conditions, can be a model for the global market."
"I am wondering why people in this House are so afraid of fairness in world trade."
"We would save ourselves numerous discussions on development and migration policy if the world trade system was structured more fairly."
"We spoke with entrepreneurs from the ACP (Africa, Caribbean and Pacific) States when a parliamentary meeting took place two weeks ago in Vienna."
"Representatives of these small business employers told us about the important role played by the ‘fair trade’ label in their regions."
"They also mentioned that it would be a good example and a solution to the problem in their regions if international trade as a whole would move more in this direction."
"Reference was also made to the enormous influence of fair trade production on combating poverty in general and, specifically, on the lives of women."
"It is important that we state this clearly and I hope that we adopt the rapporteur’s report as is so as to support both the ‘fair trade’ label and fair trade itself in an energetic manner."
"Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Schmidt for his excellent report."
"Fair Trade is a success story."
"The value of Fair Trade products sold in the United Kingdom doubled between 2002 and 2004 and Fair Trade brands of coffee and tea have become household names."
"It is estimated that three million Fair Trade hot drinks are consumed in the UK each day."
"The largest UK Fair Trade organisation, Tradecraft, is based in Gateshead in my constituency."
"I am proud of the momentum towards Fair Trade that now exists in the North East of England, with more and more places signing up as Fair Trade towns."
"However, although Fair Trade is growing in many places, it is much less developed in some Member States than others."
"EU support for Fair Trade through consumer awareness and information campaigns can help Fair Trade grow across the whole of Europe."
"A modest amount of promotion of Fair Trade would trigger a substantial growth in the market for Fair Trade goods and significant poverty reduction in producer countries."
"– Madam President, the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, the fairer distribution of the benefits of globalisation and the more effective incorporation of developing countries into the global economic system are the prime challenges for the global community."
"No one can doubt the positive contribution of fair trade initiatives and programmes to the sustainable economic and social development of developing countries."
"It is a well-known fact that the Union is one of the most open markets in the world, especially as a result of the 'everything but arms' initiative for the benefit of less developed countries and the preferential treatment of other developing countries."
"Nonetheless, free access is not all that is needed."
"We also need more balanced access and a redistribution of resources between competitive exporters and small producers."
"We also need to combat social and ecological dumping."
"The concessions made by the Union and its development policy need primarily to target vulnerable countries, especially those in greatest need."
"In other words, there is no point in opening up the European market for the benefit of large exporters in developing countries to the detriment of small and medium-sized European producers."
"The development of fair trade systems and the promotion of products which meet high social and environmental specifications are even more important in light of the absence of such matters from current World Trade Organisation negotiations."
"To close, I too should like to take my turn in congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Schmidt, for his qualitative contribution to the debate on international fair trade law."
"Madam President, I welcome the commitment shown by the Commissioner to these issues and indeed for giving us the clear understanding that it goes beyond just enjoying Oxfam chocolates."
"I would also like to say that, like Linda McAvan, I have many experiences from developing countries, such as Uganda, where last year I met a farmer who had a kilo of coffee beans to sell for 150 Ugandan shillings."
"Subsequently I paid 1000 Ugandan shillings for one cup of coffee."
"This is the kind of injustice which the Fair Trade movement is dealing with."
"My own country, Wales, has now voted to become a beacon of Fair Trade practice."
"This week our First Minister announced proposals for Wales to become a Fair Trade nation."
"We are now working to increase awareness of Fair Trade issues amongst the population in Wales."
"That means working in colleges, schools, the voluntary sector, across business networks and elsewhere, and increasing awareness amongst our population."
"I believe that in 2007 Wales will become a Fair Trade nation and our Fair Trade support will, as others have said, make an enormous difference to the lives of countless poor people and will mean that we will make our contribution to making poverty history."
"Madam President, I fully support Mr Schmidt’s report and the European Parliament’s motion for a resolution."
"In summarising the documents, I can state that fair trade is not simply about achieving fair prices and access to markets."
"Neither does it solely involve work to increase social standards, eradicate poverty, provide technological assistance and build skills."
"It also involves paying attention to the socio-economic situation of producers and their local communities."
"That is why, on behalf of the members of the European Parliament’s working group on the destruction of obsolete pesticides and the non-governmental organisations working with us, I would like to draw your attention to the problem posed by the tens of thousands of tons of obsolete pesticides stockpiled in African countries, former Soviet states, European Union Member States and countries applying for European Union membership."
"These pesticides are a serious threat to development."
"They restrict the production of healthy food and, as a result, affect these countries’ ability to participate in trade."
"Let us please help these countries eradicate the source of this threat."
"."
"Madam President, this has been an important and illuminating debate that will send a very clear message to citizens across Europe who want to put trade more effectively at the service of development."
"Just because Fair Trade schemes are not a panacea, that does not mean to say that we should fail to support them."
"Just because they are not a total solution, that should not blind us to the fact that they make a very important contribution to the overall solution that we want to see in putting trade at the service of development, to enable us to tackle poverty in the world."
"That is why this report and debate enable us to take a stand and deliver a message, not least because there is growing public interest and concern."
"I thought Mr Karim’s speech in particular illustrated the growth of activity, public opinion and consciousness."
"We as politicians need to express and reflect that opinion and find ways for it to grow."
"For all those reasons, because consumers are becoming increasingly aware and want to make an informed choice, that translates into pressure on mainstream operators, producers and traders to raise their game in order to match higher public expectations and standards."
"That then also converts into pressure on governments to act to help raise those standards and to increase consumer awareness and information."
"So we have a ‘virtuous’ circle here, to which we should be contributing."
"Of course, what works in the private context and what works for an individual consumer choice does not automatically or neatly convert into a prescribed public policy."
"That is obvious."
"Nor is it the case that one particular Fair Trade scheme or Fair Trade label gives that scheme or that label an exclusive right to endorsement."
"There are other organisations and NGOs, such as the Rainforest Alliance, which deliver many of the same environmental and social benefits by working in collaboration with mainstream companies."
"The key policy challenge is to get the most out of all these efforts, not to identify some in order to discriminate, unwittingly and unintentionally, against others."
"I would like to re-commit the Commission to working with NGOs in this area and we welcome Parliament’s support."
"There is broader work being led by Mr Michel on commodity supply change, through which we are planning to support the creation of a web portal to serve as a clearing-house of information about consumer assurance schemes of all kinds."
"There are other ideas and proposals that I want to take back to the Commission and to consider with my colleagues."
"We need to establish good models that provide for higher standards."
"That is what we are jointly committed to and I look forward to continuing this work with Parliament."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today."
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission (0-0036/2006/rev.1 – B6-0314/2006) by Mr Enrique Barón Crespo, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the results of the WTO meetings at the end of April in Geneva and future perspectives."
"."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the result of the WTO ministerial meeting held in Geneva from 29 June to 1 July is clearly a disappointment."
"We went to Geneva the previous week to hold a meeting of the Steering Committee of the WTO Parliamentary Assembly that we have created with the Interparliamentary Union."
"The Director-General, Mr Lamy, told us that it was the moment of truth and, as he himself has said, the result we are faced with is that we are in crisis."
"The Chinese have a character to illustrate the idea of crisis, which I believe can be applied to the current situation of the WTO: the upper part means 'mortal danger' and lower part, 'opportunity'."
"I believe that we are in a situation in which what is at stake is the survival of the WTO as a multilateral platform for consolidating world trade and the process of globalisation, in order to ensure that the WTO does not fall apart and we do not return to bilateral approaches, which may be useful within a multilateral framework, but which, if they become an alternative to the multilateral, would be extremely destructive in the long term."
"This is the situation we are in and, furthermore, time is fast running out for the US President's authorisation from the United States Congress to negotiate, which is known as the Trade Promotion Authority."
"I must say, in this regard, that I believe that there will be negotiations at these meetings."
"The method chosen by the recently appointed Mrs Schwab, the US Trade Representative, is not the best method: to meet on Capitol Hill and have a photo taken before coming out with 56 Senators and with the representatives of the American Farm Bureau Federation, which is the most important agricultural lobby."
"That may be appropriate for going to play in the Football World Cup, but it is not the best method for going to a negotiation of this kind. I believe that we must point this out to our colleagues in the United States Congress."
"The fact is that that is the situation we are in, and the Director-General, Mr Lamy, has been given a mandate to try to determine the methods for applying the agreements reached in Hong Kong."
"In this regard, I believe that Mr Lamy is being asked, by means of travelling diplomacy — not an exploratory mission — to find a solution by means of what we in the European Union institutions call the confessionary system, that is to say, to try, by means of bilateral meetings amongst the interlocutors, to talk about things that nobody dare raise at a table, either in the green room or in the general meeting."
"Above all because, when something is put on the table, it is no longer part of the negotiation, but rather it is something acquired."
"In this respect, I believe that we must continue to support this process."
"From Parliament’s point of view, as Commissioner Mandelson knows, we are following the process very closely: a delegation from Parliament travelled to Geneva, having travelled to the Assembly the week before."
"I must point out that we have obtained an interview with the Presidency of the Council, both the outgoing Presidency and the incoming Presidency, although it is not what we achieved in Cancún, which was to talk to the 133 Committee, and that our collaboration with the Commission has been very positive, both with Commissioner Mandelson and with Commissioner Fischer Boel."
"Not only have they given us important information, but we have also been able to work together, building bridges and holding talks."
"I must also tell you that we were given some excellent coffee in the Council building."
"It now falls to the Commissioner to explain to us why it was not possible to make progress, above all, on the basis of agriculture and the NAMA, with other products, and also to what extent we can make progress on services."
"Furthermore, I believe that it would be useful for the Commissioner to explain to us how far he has remained within the mandate, because that is one of the criticisms that have been levelled at him and that I imagine will be again."
"I believe that you have acted well, but in any event, Madam President, these are my questions on behalf of the European Parliament."
"."
"Madam President, between 29 June and 1 July, Mariann Fischer Boel and I attended ministerial meetings in Geneva on the Doha Round of trade talks."
"We also met and remained in contact with the MEPs who were present in Geneva during those days."
"I would like to thank the honourable Members of this House for their effort and for their commitment."
"It is much appreciated by the Commission."
"The ministerial meetings did not find agreement on the main parameters for reductions in tariffs and subsidies, in agriculture and industrial goods, the so-called modalities of the agreement which are necessary to move to the final stage in the talks."
"We met several times with the ministers from the Group of Six, that is ourselves in Europe, the United States, Brazil, India, Japan and Australia."
"We also met in the Green Room format of 30 ministers and in the Trade Negotiations Committee, which brings together the entire WTO membership."
"There was no shortage of ministerial meetings and encounters, but the encounters were frankly better than the quality of the negotiations that took place within those encounters."
"We went into the discussions stressing the EU’s agreement with a principle expressed by Pascal Lamy beforehand, that the landing zone for an agreement would require effective real cuts in farm subsidies by all and real cuts in both agricultural and non-agricultural market access – real cuts in tariffs."
"We then specified that to capture such a basis for agreement we would on our side be prepared to move towards and close to the level of average cuts in farm tariffs proposed for developed countries by the G20, provided that others moved in concert, with a similar level of ambition in other areas of the negotiation."
"We made it clear to our partners that we would not be prepared to meet every G20 demand, in particular on the structure of the cuts."
"We pushed hard to establish a clear correspondence between the effort that we would make in agricultural market access and the effort that the United States in turn would have to make in the reduction of domestic subsidies close to the G20 levels of average cut by us, to be matched by close to G20 reductions of trade-distorting subsidies by the US."
"The United States was the only major player to refuse to consider moving on this basis and declined to signal any room for further movement within this landing zone."
"Indeed, they demanded further significant moves by others in order only to sustain their present offer, which all others regard as insufficient."
"We also made it clear that, if a negotiating landing zone was to be identified in agriculture, we would only take our position in this pillar to the limit of our flexibility if we got a fair result in non-agricultural market access, requiring real cuts in developed and advanced developing countries’ tariffs."
"That is economically doable and, I would argue, desirable for these developing countries and politically essential for us and for other developed countries."
"The United States’ unreadiness to engage stopped developing countries from making any move or showing any flexibility of their own."
"The conclusions of the meeting therefore focused on the political handling of our failure to reach a breakthrough."
"All members reaffirmed a willingness to reach agreement by this summer."
"In this context G6 members first, subsequently backed by the broader membership in the Trade Negotiations Committee, asked the Director-General, Pascal Lamy, to intensify consultations and act as a catalyst for generating the basis for an agreement in the coming few weeks."
"He has not been asked to author a final agreement or provide a Dunkel-type text, like the previous Director-General at the end of the Uruguay Round, but instead to use his good offices to act as a go-between for a final agreement to emerge."
"That will require very active engagement by us with him and with the main players in the next ten days to two weeks."
"Depending on progress made, it is likely that ministers will need to meet in a similar format towards or at the end of July to take the key decisions on modalities as well as to confirm progress made in the other key areas of the round, i.e. services, rules and the development package."
"The possibility of a meeting of Heads of State and Government in some formation or another to take forward the negotiations around the time of the G8 meeting in ten days is not ruled out."
"There is a lot at stake here and we shall have to work very hard and very fast in the coming days and weeks."
"Failure of the DDA would have severe consequences, not least for the developing countries."
"This is an opportunity that will not repeat itself to open markets further, to reduce subsidies, to strengthen world trade rules and to make a real contribution to growth in the poorest countries in the world."
"This is why these multilateral negotiations continue to be the EU’s top trade priority."
"No number of bilateral deals would have the same widespread effects or benefits."
"This being said, our trade agenda goes beyond achieving a successful Doha deal."
"In the months ahead, the Commission will define its commitment to boosting our competitive performance at home and abroad and this will be set out after the summer in an overarching Commission communication on the external aspects of Europe’s competitiveness."
"This will examine how future trade policy can contribute to our internal competitiveness policies and what the priority tasks are for us to build new and secure global markets for our investment and trade."
"This will include a new strategic approach to market access, including non-tariff barriers, the consideration of new bilateral and regional policy approaches and the examination of our political and economic ties with China."
"This is not, however, an alternative to the DDA: it is an extension of a successfully concluded end to this round."
"Our immediate priority remains, therefore, to bring about the necessary political engagement by all governments to negotiate a balanced and ambitious end to the DDA."
"We will, of course, take a closer look at the social dimension of globalisation."
"Modern social systems and a better quality of life are not optional extras: they are an integral part of a formula to deliver a lasting political response to globalisation and it is this goal, above all, that remains at the heart of my mandate."
"I ask that Members lower the noise level."
"I can tell you that we are now adjourning."
"We have very many votes so I ask for your understanding."
"– The next item is Voting Time."
"."
"Madam President, the NPI regulation is of major importance."
"It provides an essential basis for the European Union’s work and partnership with our neighbouring countries to promote and assist political and economic reforms."
"Today’s vote follows a lengthy process of negotiations on many detailed and complex issues, which all sides approached in a constructive spirit."
"I am pleased to report that many significant amendments proposed by Parliament have been accepted."
"As a result, the regulation is more complete and more comprehensive."
"The amendments I have now tabled jointly with the shadow rapporteurs of the PPE-DE and PSE Groups reflect the common intention to secure a first-reading agreement."
"The normal legal-linguistic verification process should deal with any remaining textual variations on this basis."
"There are minor textual variations in Article 3.1 and in certain amendments."
"These are considered purely linguistic or technical and do not involve any point of substance."
"Mr President, on behalf of the rapporteur, Mrs Beer – who cannot be here at this moment, for which I pass on her apologies – I would like to give a few words of explanation before the vote on her report."
"Mrs Beer asked me to pass on her thanks to the various political group coordinators and to the Council and Commission for their good cooperation in the fruitful compromise negotiations."
"Today we will vote on a first reading compromise agreement."
"However, there are five important agreements that were reached during the negotiations which are not reflected in the amendments in front of you, but which nevertheless form an integral part of the compromise achieved."
"They have been documented in a letter by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner."
"Amendments 108 to 112 take account of various documents concerning the following issues."
"Firstly, the Commission reacted to Parliament’s demand for enhanced involvement in the policy level, which is closer to the implementation phase."
"Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner gave formal assurance that the Commission would enter into regular dialogue with Parliament on the content of the draft country, regional and thematic strategy papers and guarantee to take due account of the position of Parliament when implementing the strategies proposed, the ‘declaration on democratic scrutiny’."
"Secondly, concerning exceptional assistance measures, the Commission gave the guarantee to treat the European Parliament at the same level as the Council, which means informing Parliament in a timely manner of exceptional assistance measures which it has adopted."
"Thirdly, the Commission gave its word that anti-terrorism measures will be based on full respect for human rights and humanitarian law and that the Commission engages to ensure compliance with these principles through careful monitoring."
"Fourthly, as a result of the demand by Parliament and civil society for better coordination of the EU’s peacebuilding capacities, the Commission agreed to establish a Peacebuilding Partnership."
"The Commission’s written explanation also reflects the long-standing demand by Parliament to advance the idea of a European Civil Peace Corps."
"Lastly, in view of the severe financial cuts that the Stability Instrument underwent in the course of negotiations for the new Financial Perspective, Commission Ferrero-Waldner confirmed in writing the Commission’s engagement to secure additional resources if needed, via various budgetary options, including the Emergency Aid Reserve and the Flexibility Instrument."
"Our Legal Service has asked us to state that there are still a small number of purely linguistic and technical variations between the texts adopted by the Council and the text recommended for adoption today."
"This is a purely technical issue linked to the fact that, in a first reading agreement, the normal process of legal revision and verification can only take place after the vote."
"However, any variations should take full account of the intention of the House."
"."
"Mr President, the purpose of the pre-accession instrument is to ensure an efficient and transparent framework for financial assistance, and to provide a genuine European perspective for candidate states."
"We have taken into account the experience gained during previous rounds of enlargement, and we have considered the interests of the European Union and the specific requirements and problems of candidate states."
"The adoption of this instrument is particularly important at this time, when we are experiencing apathy towards enlargement in Europe."
"The adoption of this instrument will send out the message that construction has not stopped, but is continuing."
"However, a good instrument requires an appropriate budget."
"The budget framework is very ungenerous towards candidate states."
"We hope that the 2008 – 2009 review will create an opportunity to rectify this."
"I would like to thank the co-rapporteurs, Mr Dimitrakopoulos, Mrs De Keyser and Mr Lagendijk, for their help and constructive cooperation, and the Commission too for its constructive and supportive cooperation."
"Please adopt this instrument."
", . – Mr President, I would like to emphasise an important point as the outcome of the negotiations and, provided there are no objections, I would also like to have this put on record."
"The Commission and the Council have agreed that these three instruments shall be subject to a review prior to the European elections in 2009."
"As regards this review, Parliament’s full rights, including its power of codecision, should be preserved so as to thereby facilitate practical and flexible management without delay and to ensure that Parliament has the opportunity to carry out checks, but also to ensure at the same time, in the case of a project which, in total during this financial period, including the development instrument, accounts for EUR 43 billion, that Parliament’s influence is guaranteed."
"I would like to say a special thank you to the rapporteurs, the Commission, the Commissioner and their assistants for their cooperative attitude."
"."
"Mr President, I would like, in particular, to take this opportunity to say how very grateful I am to Mr Bullmann and to Professor Lauk of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who ensured that cooperation with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs was very good and very fruitful, and, at the same time, extend warm thanks to the Council and the Commission, too, for their cooperation."
"I would also like, speaking on behalf of my group, to reiterate that we, despite the content of this report, will be abstaining when it is voted on, and that the reason for our doing so is that there is a very close connection between the matter we are dealing with and the SWIFT debate that is currently going on."
"It is particularly because so many people are concerned about interference with fundamental rights and about programmes about which people are not informed that I would have thought it politically well-advised for us to wait and see what comes out of the SWIFT investigation, and I will, for that reason, be recommending to my group that we should abstain."
"As for the report itself, Mr Lauk and Mr Bullmann have my support, and I wish to thank the two groups for their good cooperation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, would like to thank Mr Alvaro and Mr Lauk for their good cooperation."
"We have come to agree, to a very great degree, on how a proper basis in law should be created, although, as regards the European Union, we do take the view that it is best to frame laws that everyone has to comply with and that every member of the public can comprehend."
"It is on this small point – the only thing that divides us – that we are to vote today."
"All I want is for this procedure to be technically unobjectionable."
"There is a certain connection with the Corbett report, which has just been adopted, and in respect of which an amendment tabled by Mr Radwan was adopted, the intention of which was to affect a single technical detail in the way we are now to vote."
"That does nothing to change the result, but the amendments relating to comitology have a minus against them in all the voting lists, in that we all agree on them; they should not be allowed to lapse, but should be voted on."
"Let me now tell the House which ones these amendments are;"
"I ask you to allow them to be voted on, but all the groups that have considered them have marked them with a minus."
"Even so, we need a clean procedure if comitology and the Corbett report are to be brought into line with the item of legislation that we are now enacting."
"The amendments in question are Nos 20, 22, 24, 103, 124 and 125, and they are to be voted on, and they are to be voted on even if there is a minus against them; that is the political compromise on which the rapporteurs have agreed."
"I should like to amend the title before paragraph 6."
"Instead of ‘most of which are alleged’, it should read ‘some of which are alleged’."
"There was a linguistic mistake in the original version."
"."
"Mr President, if my fellow Members will allow me, I should like to table an oral amendment to Amendment 6, as tabled by our group."
"Only yesterday in fact, after the deadline for tabling amendments had expired, we learnt of serious developments in the Italian investigation into the abduction of Abu Omar."
"We feel that it is logical, right and necessary to update the text of the amendment."
"Thus, in Amendment 15, after:"
"there must be added:"
"I call on my fellow Members, including those who do not agree on this matter, not to prevent this oral amendment from being tabled, as we did earlier with Mr Gawronski, since it simply describes the current legal situation."
"Mr President, while it is envisaged that the original document be translated into all languages, Amendment 1 proposes that these be whittled down to English and French."
"I wish to propose, by way of a compromise, that it be translated into the languages of those EU Member States affected by the investigations."
"I think it only fair that we should do this, not only for this House, but also for the benefit of other committees of inquiry in – for example – other parliaments."
"– That concludes Voting Time."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by means of my report, we are making an important proposal for the combating of VAT fraud within the European Union, which cheats the European taxpayer out of some EUR 60 billion every year."
"I see my report as constituting an important step in combating this fraud, including as it does the proposal for the reversed charge procedure, an approach that would also be practicable at the national level."
"That is something that will need to be discussed, but, right now, it is the turn of the Council and the Commission, now that this House has shown great unanimity in taking this step – for which I am very grateful to it."
"– The EU-Caribbean partnership for growth, stability and development, a mutually beneficial partnership based on shared values, represents an opportunity for the two sides to work together towards democracy and human rights, and to fight against poverty and against threats to peace and stability."
"I support the steps proposed by the Commission aimed at helping the countries of the region, which are already on the road to regional integration thanks to CARICOM, CARFORUM and MEUC."
"The usually small and economically vulnerable Caribbean countries have made significant attempts at economic diversification, restructuring and reform and should now, with Europe’s help, be able to make the most of the opportunities offered by globalisation and to avoid its pitfalls."
"I should like to thank the Members of this House for adopting my amendment calling for the French overseas departments in the region, namely French Guyana, Guadeloupe and Martinique, to be closely involved in the future political dialogue on EU-Caribbean cooperation, on account of their obvious role as 'Europe's bridgehead' in that part of the world."
". Needlestick injuries occur when the skin is accidentally punctured with a needle that is potentially contaminated with a patient's blood."
"Contaminated needles can transmit more than 20 dangerous blood-borne pathogens, including hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV."
"The majority of these injuries are suffered by nurses and doctors, but other medical staff are also at significant risk, as are auxiliary staff, such as cleaners and laundry staff and other downstream workers."
"I welcome this report, which outlines the preventive steps that should be taken in health and veterinary care to protect workers from injuries caused by needles and other medical sharps."
"This includes written instructions at the workplace and training for all workers, especially those who perform cannulation."
"Effective response and follow-up to accidents or incidents is also outlined in the report, including rapid post-exposure prophylaxis."
"Furthermore, all workers who might come into contact with needles and other medical sharps are to be offered vaccination against hepatitis B."
"– Mr President, trust is a beautiful thing, but there cannot be unconditional trust."
"Although we voted today on a number of packages of financial proposals, the stability instrument is the least transparent of them."
"The complexity is apparent from the very goals of this measure."
"Such a broad-brush definition is capable of covering practically anything, for example justification for the policy of non-engagement in the case of right-wing coups such as the putsch carried out by General Franco."
"Two days ago, Mr Giertych indicated that, according to the second part of the objectives of this instrument, it would even have been possible to support General Franco from EU funds."
"He pointed out that he was merely interested in renewing and consolidating traditional Catholic values in Spain."
"Although the document does not contain any figures, the Commission has promised that it will provide them soon."
"For the time being, only one thing can be said. Parliament is completely out of the loop."
"Ultimately Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs emphasised this in the trialogue between the Council, Parliament and the Commission and called for this state of affairs to be changed."
"Parliament should not give anyone carte blanche."
"Some parts of this document are dubious, unclear and manifestly open to possible abuse."
"I therefore voted against the proposal before us."
". Just like the rapporteur, I welcome the Commission’s proposal to simplify the management of the EU’s external aid, by reducing the 30 or so existing instruments to six, including the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI)."
"This will lead to greater efficiency and effectiveness, and ‘makes perfect sense’."
"I support many of the amendments proposed in the report, including strengthening Parliament’s role in planning and monitoring ENPI programmes; increased involvement of civil society in the consultation process; and a bigger role for partners such as local and regional authorities, and civil society."
"I regret, however, that the point relating to the outermost regions in the neighbourhood context, such as Cape Verde, was not brought into the scope of application of the ENPI."
"A Wider Neighbourhood Action Plan had been proposed, with a view to facilitating cooperation between the outermost regions and their neighbouring countries. This formed part of the sustainable development strategy for the outermost regions proposed by the Commission in order to pursue one of its priority action areas, namely bringing these regions into their own regional environment."
"In spite of this, I voted in favour of this report."
". As draftsman for the report from the International Trade Committee on this report on external actions for financial, economic and technical assistance to third countries recovering from crisis I was concerned that this Stability Instrument should provide genuine added value, delivering an effective, immediate and integrated response."
"Although there were concerns initially about the legal base of this instrument, it was eventually agreed that it should be based dually on development cooperation and economic, financial and technical cooperation."
"I support Development Committee colleagues in their concerns that the inclusion of peace-support measures in this instrument should not bleed funds from the development budget."
"Most importantly, the agreement between the Council, the Commission and Parliament on this report reflects Parliament’s initiative on a review clause, which will allow for modification and better reporting: an important consideration, since this instrument is new and far-reaching."
"– The so-called stability instrument forms part of the broader package of financing instruments (development and economic cooperation, pre-accession aid, neighbourhood and partnership) which are designed to form an integrated tool for exercising the imperialist policy of the ΕU in candidate countries, in countries in the immediate and wider neighbourhood and on the entire planet."
"By giving 'economic aid' to third countries, the European Union is acquiring the right to intervene in them, on the pretext of addressing situations of destabilisation, 'crisis' and ‘unfolding crisis', situations which constitute 'threats' to the rule of law, law and order and the protection of human rights and to the promotion of the principles of international law, including support for special national and international criminal courts."
"This funding will at the same time be used as a means of coercing third countries into complying with the imperialist ambitions of the ΕU and of open interference in the internal affairs of independent countries, with governments being undermined and the EU's candidates being funded, given that the facility to use financing to support and organise civil society, including to promote independent, pluralistic and professional media, is being introduced."
"The Greek Communist Party voted against the report because it is in favour of and at some points formulates in an even more reactionary direction the tenet of the European Commission's proposal for a regulation."
"Mr President, against my advice, Parliament adopted the amendment tabled by Mr Radwan, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, to my report on comitology."
"In its statement last night in the debate, the Commission took the view that this amendment effectively undermines and sabotages the agreements that we have negotiated."
"This may, indeed, have been Mr Radwan’s intention – I do not know – but the amendment refers to a resolution adopted by Parliament, which envisages the adoption of sunset clauses on the delegation of legislation that apply systematically to all legislation that we adopt in the financial services sector."
"However, I would urge the Commission not to overreact."
"The amendment adopted – however much I deplore it – was only an amendment to a recital in which we refer to a past resolution having regard to it."
"We do not, as a Parliament, reaffirm our endorsement of the resolution."
"This nuance should enable the Commission to accept our text and to consider that the agreement we have negotiated remains valid."
"– Mr President, I should like to go back to the Corbett report."
"I can only assume that my request for an explanation of vote went astray in the confusion caused by Members leaving the Chamber."
"I should like to say a few words on the subject of comitology."
"Just like my fellow members of the Czech Civil Democratic Party (ODS), I voted against this report."
"I did so because we believe that this is a controversial issue insofar as it transfers more power from the Member States to the Commission."
"We feel that the voters of France and the Netherlands told the European institutions quite clearly how they feel about transferring those powers to the Commission."
"We do not think that their decision should be circumvented through the back door."
". In 1993, under a new codecision procedure, legislative powers were allocated to Parliament and the Council on an (almost) equal footing."
"Parliament took the view that codecision acts, in which Council and Parliament can jointly delegate implementing measures, implied that they should both be involved in defining the procedures for exercising delegated powers and that they should have equal rights regarding retrieval or call back."
"The Council, however, argued that Article 202 of the EC Treaty remained unchanged, providing for the Council (alone) to define the system for implementing powers."
"The key step forward for Parliament which is possible now as an outcome of negotiations with the Council and the Commission, is that Parliament will be able to block the adoption of ‘quasi-legislative’ implementing measures to which it objects."
"If it does so, the Commission can make a new proposal or table draft legislation."
"I welcome this report´, as it expands the powers of the European Parliament and enables it be an ever more effective and democratic institution."
"– Should we be pleased or concerned about the agreement reached between the Council, Parliament and the Commission on the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission?"
"One might be pleased to see curbs, however few, placed on this disproportionate power, unprecedented for a democracy, that practically enables Brussels officials to amend legislative acts without the legislator."
"There are a great many reasons to be concerned, however."
"The first is that one must once again point out the cardinal sin of the European institutional structure – the Commission is the institution with the least legitimacy but with the most power."
"The second is that Europe’s body of legislation has not been simplified."
"The ‘better lawmaking’ initiative, which Parliament debated for the umpteenth time last month – the thorny issue of ‘Eurocracy’ – is clearly nothing but window dressing."
"The third is that this agreement is the implementation – partial, it is true, but actually happening – of a provision contained in the European Constitution, a document which, as the House is no doubt tired of hearing, is obsolete given that two European populations rejected it by a huge margin in referendums."
"The best way to curb the Commission’s powers is to revise the Treaties and to build the Europe of the nations, which could do without this institution in its current form."
". The ALDE group unfortunately feels compelled to abstain from voting on the final vote on this report."
"ALDE's request to postpone the vote not having been granted, we feel adoption of this report is premature as long as the question marks over the recent SWIFT scandal have not been resolved. The legislative proposal at hand must be adopted on the basis of an international agreement (FATF), to which both the EU and the USA are signatories."
"The position of the USA must be clarified before the EU should proceed to fulfilling its part of the agreement. Clarification by the ECB and the national central banks is equally precondition for adoption."
"In view of growing concerns about civil rights and protection of personal data of EU citizens, ALDE feels further assurances are needed in this area."
"We note that in recent years a host of security measures has been taken, whereas measures to strengthen civil rights and privacy protection have been stalled, and decision making in this area largely takes place without any meaningful parliamentary scrutiny or judicial review."
"The case of SWIFT casts doubts on the adequacy of data protection instruments in the EU."
"A fundamental debate must be held first."
"In the past decade, there has been a huge rise in acts of terrorism around the world. The fight against this scourge has accordingly become one of the key political priorities in Europe and around the world."
"This proposal forms part of a range of measures taken by the Union aimed at reducing access for terrorists to financial and other economic resources."
"Its purpose is to transpose into Community legislation the Financial Action Task Force’s Special Recommendation VII on wire transfers."
"It is aimed at the authorities responsible for combating money laundering and terrorist financing, and establishes rules on the requirement to provide information on payers transferring funds."
"This will be a useful, effective measure to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute terrorists and other criminals, and to trace their assets."
"I agree with the proposed derogations aimed at taking on board the specific nature of the payment systems in the different Member States."
"I support Mr Brejc’s position that there must be a sunset clause, whereby this regulation will lapse after five years if it does not prove useful. I also support the compromise reached between Mr Brejc and the rapporteur."
". We abstain from voting on this report, as it presents Parliament with an unsolvable dilemma."
"On the one hand, it is implementing an international treaty and voting against it would simply reinforce the Commission’s position."
"On the other hand, we cannot support the introduction of ever more legislation intruding on privacy without further evidence that a massive surveillance of innocent citizens increases safety or is helpful in preventing acts of terror."
"It has been shown that money flows for the funding of terrorism are increasingly going underground, making use of cash and transferring money using couriers."
"Further, no matter what steps are taken to protect privacy, the temptation to use these for other purposes by authorities will be great and so far no-one has created a register that does not leak information."
"We are also deeply concerned about the effects on NGOs promoting democracy and human rights in undemocratic regimes."
"An extensive register, even though we are told it will not be used that way, will undoubtedly impair their activities."
"In abstaining, we also urge the Parliament to start discussing a comprehensive policy on protection of privacy and civil liberties."
"The present course, where liberties are curtailed step by step, must come to an end."
"The purpose of the amendment to the financial regulation is to simplify the rules on external contracts and grants and make them more transparent. The text currently lacks clarity and structure and as such is difficult for potential users to read."
"This bureaucratic collection of rules, solely in the area of some within the Commission’s DGs, is a very costly procedure for providers and organisations applying for these grants. This excludes many micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as smaller associations, institutes and NGOs."
"Furthermore, the Commission has discretionary powers in the process, and there are therefore very few companies and organisations – and it is always the same ones – that are conversant with the mechanics of the process."
"Ultimately, this may lead to choices being made on the basis of political support or otherwise."
"As the Court of Auditors has stated, however, the review that has been submitted is not sufficient to reduce the burden and simplify the procedures for both the Commission and for potential users."
"Parliament’s proposals improve the situation but fall short of the urgently needed global review of the financial regulation in these matters."
"– Mr President, I have already, during past debates on mutual information procedures relating to asylum and immigration, had cause to put a number of questions to Commissioner Frattini, since I do find myself wondering what the added value is of this system in contending with illegal immigration."
"I am not saying that it is a bad thing, but I do think that it still amounts to a sticking plaster on a wooden leg."
"The real problem is, after all, that the policy of regularisation adopted by Italy, by Spain, and by Belgium, has resulted in an inflow of hundreds of thousands of new economic migrants, whom our open borders policy is enabling to spread themselves throughout Europe without difficulty."
"If the European Union really does have the intention of addressing the problem of illegal immigration, then it has to begin at the beginning."
"It goes without saying that the practical repudiation of the pernicious regularisations is the only way in which this policy’s powerful attraction can be neutralised, followed immediately by a consistent policy of sending all illegal and criminal immigrants back whence they came."
". – We need to implement a proper joint asylum and immigration policy."
"It is crucial for the Union that we put mechanisms in place for the Member States to exchange information."
"Indeed, if the Member States can gain a better idea of each other's laws and regularly exchange best practice, they will be better able to identify the areas in which European legislation is needed and in turn reach an agreement that is acceptable to all."
"It would be simplistic and inaccurate to say that this instrument could enable the Member States to ban regularisation, which in some national contexts is necessary."
"Exchange of information on these measures will help them to be better understood."
"Furthermore, a crackdown on legal immigration could have the effect of diverting flows to another Member State."
"A crackdown of this nature will therefore also have to be reported."
"– Mr President, Mr Gargani is right to ask for Parliament to be consulted on the modification of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities."
"He is also right to call, in his report, for Parliament to have the right to appeal to the Court of Justice in the event that Member States fail to respect Members’ immunities, which were established to defend Parliament’s rights and in particular to protect MEPs against action that a hostile executive may decide to bring, via a proxy prosecutor."
"Particularly so after the act of utter treachery – that is not too strong a word – committed by the French Supreme Court in the case of our erstwhile fellow Member Mr Marchiani."
"Mr President, the Committee on Legal Affairs must also uphold the fundamental law not to examine a request for parliamentary immunity protection on manifestly inappropriate grounds, in this case Article 9, when it is Article 10 that applies."
"It should adopt the same legal stance on defending freedom of expression when there has manifestly been , as in my case."
"Lastly, Parliament’s legal service must not endeavour to water down Parliament resolutions, or rules that the latter has inserted into its own Rules of Procedure, while there is action pending before the Court of Justice"
". Mr President, the MEPs belonging to the Free Democratic Party have voted against the resolution on the economic and social consequences of business restructuring operations in Europe, being convinced that, in Europe’s market economies, businesses should be free from political pressure in deciding where their production sites should be located."
"In our single market, competition – including competition between regions – plays a decisive role in terms of the further development of European enterprise and of the way in which it can keep itself fit."
"The ultimate effect of political pressure is to impede the functioning of the market and it is for that reason that it should not be applied as a means of deterring businesses from acting on their own decisions."
". We voted against for the following reasons:"
"- there is no mention whatsoever of solidarity with the Opel/GM workers, and in particular the 1 700-plus workers (and their families) of the Opel factory in Azambuja, Portugal, whose jobs are under threat due to the indifference of the GM board to the potential economic, social and regional consequences."
"This position has been imposed by the Right, with the complicity of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, which signed the joint resolution;"
"- the defence of the right of companies to take management decisions aimed at delivering their own economic growth, regardless of the potential social consequences;"
"- there is no mention of the economic and social impact of relocations, which most often take place with the sole purpose of cutting costs and maximising profits, with factors such as economic viability and productivity playing no part in the decision; these relocations often fail to respect contractual obligations, yet in the most mercenary fashion the businesses involved enjoy local, national and Community public aid, leaving behind a trail of unemployment and undermining local economies."
"Last year alone relocations led to half a million redundancies in the EU;"
"- the resolution falls well short of the results obtained in the March resolutions on the impact of relocations and restructuring on employment and regional development."
". The spirit of entrepreneurship and the role of business is vital to economic growth and development, and the substantial economic changes that we have seen mean that many companies need to restructure."
"Yet it is also true that there are two highly pertinent points in this proposal that should not be overlooked."
"The first of these is the social responsibility of businesses and the duty to honour agreements and contracts, not least when they have received grants and subsidies in respect of a particular activity."
"The considerations, concerns and proposals contained in this resolution are worthy of my support."
"I feel, however, that the proposal to set up a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is a timely reminder of the scale of the problem, to which we must find far-reaching solutions."
"The ongoing process of restructuring Europe’s business fabric, not least manufacturing, will hopefully have positive consequences, but will also have a negative social impact, especially in the initial stages."
"Europe, individual governments and Community institutions have a duty to prepare now for the very near future."
"In addition to this fund, we need to discuss other solutions and invest in other mechanisms."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, in voting in favour of this report, we must pay tribute to what is perhaps a positive development, namely that the European Parliament, rather than constantly laying the blame on the United States, is beginning to look at the way in which the European Union and the Member States comply with the law, because all too often, when faced with illegality and abuses that exist, for example, regarding the transfer of personal data and regarding air passenger traffic, we have actually hidden our own illegality – the inability to comply with our own rules – behind that of the United States."
"It is time for us to accept our responsibility, and I believe that the Fava report is a first step in that direction."
"– Mr President, I voted against the Fava report on the grounds that it is a typical example of Left-wing bias."
"The temporary committee has already decided everything in advance, so that all that was needed was to find the evidence."
"It just so happens that no evidence has come to light of torture or of other illegal activities on the part of the CIA in the European Union, so what this report does is to take what are actually suppositions and indications and systematically put them forward as facts, and that is intellectually dishonest."
"That typifies a certain mentality that is present in this House."
"It can indeed be said, speaking frankly, that there are Members of this House who do not actually want terrorism to be dealt with."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my bitter disappointment at the adoption of the Fava report."
"There are a total of four reasons why I say this."
"Firstly, the report is based on one-sided, general information, and not on accurately expressed facts verified by various sources."
"Secondly, the report is full of contradictions."
"If there were incontrovertible facts showing that the CIA had used European countries for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners, the word ‘alleged’ should have been taken out of the title."
"On the other side of that coin, the rapporteur’s use of the word ‘alleged’ in the title of the report, after all the efforts of the members of the Temporary Committee and other interested parties, is tacit acknowledgement that the committee has been unable to prove that any illegal act has taken place."
"Thirdly, it is possible that over time, a number of the suspicions that have been voiced will prove to have been violations of the law, or perhaps new cases will come to light."
"Given the extent and complexity of the fight against terrorism, this should not come as any surprise."
"The most important thing is that we would be talking about details and not about errors in the system."
"People who consider that their rights have been curtailed can go through the proper, well-functioning channels to enforce these rights and claim redress."
"Fourthly and lastly, we must look carefully into how much time Parliament devotes to investigating an alleged problem and how much time it devotes to the real problem of terrorism."
"By adopting the report by Mr Fava, we are leaving ourselves open to doubts as to whether we are capable of assessing the relative importance of individual problems and whether we will manage to address those problems appropriately."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today in this plenary session, the MEPs from the Czech Civil Democratic Party (ODS) chose not to support the interim report by Mr Fava on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners."
"The report is, in our view, based on the current trend for anti-Americanism, which does not take account of the serious threat of international terrorism."
"The United States of America and its allies, including the Czech Republic, have channelled all their efforts over the past five years into combating this terrible threat."
"Since 2001, we have witnessed terrorist attacks in the USA, the UK, Spain and a host of other countries."
"This is a very real danger and the Fava report completely ignores the need to combat it."
"The report also entirely disregards the fact that it is the approach jointly adopted by the USA and its allies from a number of European countries that has enabled us to reduce international terrorism substantially and has thus provided the citizens of Europe with greater security."
"The report instead focuses on a number of unsubstantiated cases of dubious behaviour by the security services of the USA and its allies, and draws sweeping conclusions from those cases."
"The MEPs from the Czech ODS cannot support such a position with their votes."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the fact that some of our amendments have been accepted, the Fava report, on which we have voted today, remains biased, one-sided and imbued with preconceptions, as well as being intent on supporting totally groundless theories."
"This is a text that is one-sided in terms of its content and that even runs counter to the positions of the Italian Government."
"It was Prime Minister Prodi himself who, in an official communication, contradicted Mr Fava on the Abu Omar affair."
"While Mr Fava rejected an amendment of mine, which maintained that there was no evidence of involvement on the part of the government and of the Italian intelligence service, the Prime Minister's office was last night reaffirming its faith in our secret services."
"Mr Fava’s attitude demonstrates how much bad faith exists within the Italian left, which does not want to renounce the anti-Americanism of the past or to stop using the European institutions for the purposes of attacking its opponents."
". I voted against extending the mandate of Mr Fava’s committee to continue investigating so-called ‘extraordinary rendition’ because to date it has produced no substantiated evidence such as would justify its continuance."
"Rather, it is being used as a vehicle for rabid anti-Americanism, willing to trade in selective tittle-tattle while operating on a presumption of guilt by the CIA."
". UKIP have voted in favour of Amendment 13, because it emphasises that the EU High Commissioner and EU High Representative have no powers to request information in this matter from Member States."
"UKIP rejects the authority and opposes the creation of both these positions and therefore welcomes the acknowledgement of a limitation to their powers."
". This report contains positive elements that confirm what we have known about and have been speaking out about for a long time, namely that the CIS and other US bodies ‘have been directly responsible for the illegal seizure, removal, abduction and detention’ of citizens – euphemistically referred to as ‘extraordinary rendition’ – and the transfer of citizens to third countries to be interrogated and subjected to torture, thereby brutally violating international law and human rights."
"Among other important aspects, the report considers it ‘implausible’ that European governments were not aware of these criminal activities and ‘utterly implausible’ that hundreds of flights could have taken place in European airspace without the relevant authorities taking any action."
"The report should help to demystify the real meaning of the terms ‘pre-emptive war’ and the ‘fight against terrorism’ with which the USA and its allies have sought to cloak their attacks on the populations and sovereignty of countries, in breach of international law and human rights."
"The report should also help to get to the bottom of what happened and to bring those responsible to account, by clarifying the content of the NATO agreements and the agreements between the EU and the USA on this issue. It will, moreover, ensure that national parliaments will carry out their own enquiries."
". I voted for this report as I consider it is an important practical step forward in the way in which the European Parliament is now willing to confront serious abuses of human rights within its borders and its relationship with the USA."
"We cannot simply accept assurances from friendly governments concerning the prohibition on torture and cruel and degrading treatment: we have a responsibility to ensure that we and our allies act within international law."
"In political terms, we now need to examine whether the EU and its Member States have the necessary instruments to pursue the truth about what is happening on our territory and in our name and the appropriate safeguards to protect our citizens and residents."
"I welcome the parliamentary majority for the continuation of the work of this Temporary Committee."
". – I did not vote for the motion for a resolution by the Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners."
"Firstly, I feel that this Temporary Committee should not have been set up in the first place, given that the Council of Europe carried out an inquiry into the matter, under Article 52 of the European Convention on Human Rights."
"Why duplicate this task?"
"Why impinge upon the powers and responsibilities of the Council of Europe?"
"Why bother tasking a Prime Minister, regardless of the size of his country, with drawing up a major report on collaboration between Parliament and the Council of Europe if, at the first opportunity, we waste our time creating a new resolution, the only purpose of which seems to be to indulge in rabid anti-Americanism?"
"I share the minority opinion that this Temporary Committee, which has hitherto failed to find any confirmed evidence of the alleged violations of European law and international law by EU Member States, is surplus to requirements, and that it should not continue its work."
". Yesterday’s plenary debate on the Americans’ secret flights and secret prison camps brought out two violently opposed points of view."
"There are those governments that make people’s rights and freedoms subordinate to the campaign against anyone who dissents and can therefore be suspected of terrorism."
"Those who think like that are under the illusion that freedom and democracy can be protected by being restricted or even abolished, and tend to have a sense of close ties to the USA, with especial loyalty to the present American administration and its policies, which have resulted in the occupation of Iran and Afghanistan and to the toleration of the unsustainable situation in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories."
"I utterly repudiate this approach."
"Terrorism cannot be fought by extending, rather than reducing as much as possible, the seedbed from which it springs."
"Such an approach does no more than prompt more and more desperate people to sympathise with the terrorist hotheads who claim to know the best solution and the best way of improving their living conditions."
"What is going on before our very eyes is a gross abuse of human rights."
"The freedoms of individual human beings evidently no longer count for anything in the fight against terrorism."
"The EU’s Member States must acknowledge their share in responsibility for this."
". The EPLP will be voting for the Fava report because we believe that it continues to be important for the European Parliament to investigate the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the alleged transportation and illegal detention of prisoners."
"The interim report is important for two reasons."
"Firstly, unlike members of the Council of Europe, MEPs are directly elected and answerable to our constituents."
"We investigate all manner of issues on behalf of them and we cannot ignore calls that Member States may have breached their Treaty obligations under Article 6 of the EU Treaty, which outlines the basic principles of democracy, human rights and respect of law."
"The European Parliament is the only body that can impose sanctions on Member States that breach these Treaty obligations."
"Parliament's report is also important as, unlike the Council of Europe, the committee was able to call witnesses to testify before it."
"The committee heard strong personal testimonies, which provided compelling evidence in the report."
"– The interim report on CIA activities, with abductions, transportation, interrogations and torture in European countries confirms the disclosures by organisations and the media."
"The resultant outcry forced conservative socialist forces to set up a committee of inquiry to acknowledge known facts, so that they can appear as 'innocent doves' in the eyes of the people, thereby creating a delusion as to the role of the ΕU."
"The MEPs of the Greek Communist Party abstained, in a refusal to take part in the theatre of the absurd being played in the European Parliament because: An EU-US agreement was signed in Athens allowing the CIA to act with impunity and now the forces which support it are 'protesting' about its results."
"The governments of the Member States, both centre right and centre left, knew about and took part in the CIA orgy and the members of the parties which support them, many of whom knew about it, appear to condemn them."
"They are mocking the world."
"Conservatives and social democrats have sided with the 'anti-terrorist' strategy of the USA and have accepted 'preventive war' and the massacre of grassroots freedoms and democratic rights and are now washing their hands like Pontius Pilate."
"No European Parliament report can be used to launder the political responsibilities of the parties that support imperialism or to delude people into believing that US-EU terrorist action will stop."
"It will increase as the grassroots, anti-imperialist movement grows and shifts the power ratio."
". The subject matter of this report cannot be addressed lightly."
"Human rights and the fight against terrorism, in tandem with relations with our main ally, require special focus and consideration."
"What emerges from this interim report is a number of doubts and suspicions that have not been clarified, as well as some contradictory statements from a number of bodies."
"It is therefore understandable to press ahead with the Commission’s work, but unreasonable to present unproven hypotheses as conclusions."
"On a more serious note, the rejection of a number of amendments aimed at including in the report some relevant details counteracting some of the accusations and insinuations is indicative of a desire to behave belligerently towards an ally that is above any desire to discover the truth."
"I will have no truck with this interpretation of the role of Parliament and the EU’s external relations."
"I believe that both European countries and our allies are capable of making mistakes and of carrying out acts that break the law. These acts should be acknowledged and punished, but I am not prepared to make accusations without investigation or to condemn without evidence."
". My British Conservative colleagues and I are unable to support the Fava report because we believe that the report is heavy on allegations and short on new evidence or proof."
"We were against this TDIP committee from the beginning and feel that it is a waste of money which duplicates Senator Marty's efforts in the Council of Europe."
"Furthermore, there is no proof whatsoever of the existence of CIA detention camps in either Romania or Poland, neither do I believe that there has been a systematic US policy for extraordinary renditions to torture abductees in third countries."
". UKIP (the UK delegation in the IND/DEM Group) voted in favour of Amendment 13 because it emphasises that the EU’s High Commissioner and High Representative have no powers to request, from Member-State governments, information of the kind referred to."
"UKIP opposed the creation, and does not recognise the authority, of these posts. We welcome Amendment 13, therefore, insofar as it acknowledges some limitation of their powers."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when bank transfers are carried out in foreign countries, these are actually commercial transactions, and the personal data resulting from these transactions are data that must not be systematically used for security purposes."
"In confirming my vote in favour of this resolution, I should like to stress that the problem is not just one of data being illegally transferred to a third country, but is also one of data that has been collected for commercial purposes being used instead for security purposes."
"According to the European Court of Human Rights, it is a question, in this case, of blanket surveillance, which runs counter to the European directives and to the legislation of the Member States, and it is also for this last reason that we support the Swift report."
". – We voted for the resolution tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, but rejected the joint resolution on the Society for World Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) case, on the grounds of a lack of balance that cannot be rectified by a series of amendments."
"We all know the difficulty involved in assessing the level of priority of the fight against terrorism and the similarly fundamental respect for our individual rights."
"The debate has been regularly affected by the news of detention conditions at Guantánamo, the case of the secret CIA flights, the detention centres in Europe, and now the SWIFT case."
"It is tricky to know where to draw the line, but this is a crucial debate in a world in which terrorism cuts across national borders."
"An inquiry has been launched in Belgium to ascertain whether there are any loopholes in our data protection laws."
"We do not think that this vindictive resolution – which is virulently anti-American in its form, flawless in its substance (4 and 13: what a brilliant idea – the secret services are to make their operations public!) and often unreadable – improves our image among Europeans."
"There were other ways in which we could have expressed our determination to shed light on any breaches, whilst reiterating our steadfast commitment to combating those whose ideology flies in the face of our values."
". Although there are some aspects with which we disagree, we feel that this resolution should help to show the so-called ‘fight against terrorism’ in stark relief, and the securitarian trend that characterises it."
"Under the ‘Terrorism Finance Monitoring Programme’ the USA has, with the help of a secret agreement, gained access to all financial data stored by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT), a cooperative of 8 000 banks and institutions in 200 countries, including the European Central Bank."
"The USA has thus gained access to an extraordinary amount of data on bank transfers and transactions carried out by citizens and businesses around the world."
"Access to this kind of information has been granted in violation of the legal procedures on data protection and without any legal basis. This breaches people’s rights, freedoms and guarantees, and the sovereign responsibility of each country as regards protecting its citizens."
"Consequently, the truth must be brought out and those responsible for this unacceptable situation held to account, including the role of the European Central Bank."
"This is not an isolated incident, but yet another tip of the iceberg of the true meaning of the securitarian trend that is undermining the citizens’ rights, freedoms and guarantees."
"– The monitoring of movements on the accounts of millions of innocent people by the USA, with the agreement of the ΕU and the governments of the Member States, shows the depth and the objectives of the so-called anti-terrorist strategy."
"It forms part of the global and integrated strategy of the imperialists to record data in order to control, coerce and terrorise anyone who opposes them."
"It reveals the role of the banking system, private companies and public corporations in the capitalist countries and the European Central Bank, which even infringe their own rules in the general interest of the system."
"Resolutions and calls for protection of citizens' privacy and for a balance between the fight against terrorism and human rights by the conservative and social democrat parties that predominate in the EU and in the governments are monumental hypocrisy."
"They were the ones who signed these agreements."
"It is equally insulting that, at the same time, at the same meeting, they approved a report and a proposal for a regulation to record the financial banking transactions of all EU citizens."
"The MEPs of the Greek Communist Party abstained, in a refusal to take part in the attempt to create false impressions and sanctify the ΕU and the forces that support it."
"The Greek Communist Party will help to uncover more of the role of the ΕU which, however hard it tries to appear sensitive and democratic, will take harsher anti-grassroots and anti-democratic measures and will feel grassroots resistance growing."
"Mr President, no matter how much it is claimed in the Lambrinidis report that integration is, in principle, a two-way process, I in fact find in the text as approved little or nothing of the sort; on the contrary, indeed, it was once more the same old tune of plenty of rights and hardly any duties."
"Once again, the European Member States are called on to make it their business to discriminate positively in favour of immigrants, the logical consequence of which is that the indigenous population are to be put at a disadvantage or discriminated against."
"Moreover, immigrants must be accorded all political rights without any questions being asked about their willingness to integrate."
"It is even claimed at one point that certain cultural and religious customs must not be an obstacle to foreigners enjoying rights or being integrated into society: this even though we all know perfectly well that this is a veiled way of talking about the so-called cultural and religious customs of Islam, which are the real point at issue here and which, in fact, run completely counter to the things our European democracies have achieved and the rights enjoyed in them."
"It is for this reason, among many others, that I have, of course, voted against the adoption of this report."
"– Mr President, I voted against the Lambrinidis report on the grounds that it contains no solution whatsoever to these problems, but, on the contrary, is itself part of the problem."
"The fact that it speaks, for example of the 40 million foreigners in the European Union being capable of being considered as a twenty-sixth Member States is in itself an adequate demonstration of that."
"For the umpteenth time, Europe’s voters are being made the scapegoats and a veiled plea is being made for yet another restriction on the right to the free expression of opinion."
"The report calls for the introduction of suffrage for aliens and for positive discrimination, which is another way of saying discrimination against Europeans and in favour of aliens."
"It is not just a matter of practical experiences that unrealistic rules of this sort do not work, but there is also no democratic basis to be found for them."
"This sort of report is the latest of innumerable examples of the democratic deficit in Europe and of the interference from the European level that can only erode still further Europeans’ confidence in Europe."
"– If proof were needed of the collapse of the pro-European political pseudo-elites, of the mental confusion in which they live, of their loss of reference points and of the topsy-turvy values from which they are suffering, the Lambrinidis report has given us that proof."
"What he is proposing is tantamount to across-the-board, institutionalised bias towards non-Europeans, and a form of discrimination against Europeans on their own soil, which is accompanied, financially speaking, by a kind of Marshall Plan for what he calls the ‘26th State of the Union’ and, politically speaking, by the unilateral granting of rights that ought only to be for nationals of a State."
"Wake up, Mr Lambrinidis."
"The official admission of 40 million immigrants from outside Europe is the opening of the floodgates."
"The Member States already set aside hundred of billions of euro every year for so-called integration policies, which are blatantly failing, costly for society and a hindrance for their economies."
"Do not forget the inter-ethnic conflicts in the United Kingdom."
"Do not forget why Theo Van Gogh is dead."
"Do not forget the riots in France, in which young people shouted their hatred of our institutions, our values and everything that we stand for."
"The multicultural societies that you want to create are powder kegs."
"Millions of Europeans are doomed to unemployment, social problems and housing difficulties."
"They are the ones with whom we should primarily be concerned."
". My British Conservative colleagues and I welcome the broad approach of the Lambrinidis report and support the many positive and balanced elements of this report to promote the integration of immigrants into European society."
"However, we should like to restate that great attention needs to be paid to ensuring that the principle of subsidiarity is completely respected in each and every aspect of policy in this important area."
"In addition, we believe that asylum policy must remain the competence of national governments and do not believe in a pan-European approach as stated in recital L."
"For these reasons, we have decided to abstain on this report."
". – Today, there are around 50 million immigrants in Europe, most of them from Africa and Asia, and that figure is increasing by one to two million every year."
"The explosion in ethnic violence, the islamisation of many of our towns, and the challenges faced by our social security systems, which cannot cope with these new arrivals, are the most serious consequences of this immigration, which is all the more difficult to assimilate because the immigrants come from cultures alien to our civilisation."
"Far from solving the problems, the integration proposed by the rapporteur in fact aggravates them."
"In France, three weeks of rioting in November 2005 reduced to ashes dozens of buildings constructed as part of this policy, including community halls, gymnasia and schools."
"Other proposals, such as 'encouraging political participation among immigrants', in other words giving them the right to vote, as Mr Sarkozy wants to do in France, will break up our societies still further."
"Instead of swallowing up thousands of people in pseudo-integration, our governments should, firstly, establish a true cooperation policy with the countries of origin, based on reciprocity, and, secondly, launch a major pro-family policy in order to ensure the long-term survival of our nations."
". I wish to congratulate Mr Lambrinidis on his outstanding report on the strategies and means for the integration of immigrants in the EU, to which I lend my full backing."
"In this regard I wish to highlight the need to guarantee the effective implementation of the Community directives on the integration of immigrants."
"To this end, the EU must monitor the transposition of directives on integration and the effectiveness of administrative practices that implement the relevant legislation in the day-to-day lives of immigrants."
". Although I share the rapporteur’s concerns, I cannot agree with all of the proposals he puts forward to solve one of the key problems raised by immigration, namely integration."
"To cite just a few examples: the rapporteur confuses immigration from accession countries (especially in the past) with immigration from other countries, which is an error of analysis that emerges in his conclusions; he makes the mistaken assertion that the 40 million-plus nationals from third countries make ‘the EU’s 26th Member State (and its fifth largest)’; and lastly the idea, since withdrawn by the Confederal Group of the European United Left, that the Member States must confer citizenship on immigrants, without mentioning that this issue has different regulations and different , is a simplistic approach to a complex matter."
"The fact that there is a problem at the moment with integrating some immigrant communities in the EU shows that no European model is currently working fully and effectively."
"Integration is a two-way process."
"It needs to be facilitated by the host country (by the authorities and the citizens) and must be something that the immigrants themselves want and put into practice."
"Failure to acknowledge this is tantamount to handing the initiative to extremist movements on both sides."
"– Immigration is too serious a subject to simply leave to the polling organisations or to decree it to be an important subject only during national elections."
"Immigration is a fact of life: more than 40 million people live within the territory of the European Union, which seems to have a great deal of difficulty coordinating its activities."
"It must act quickly to establish a consistent and effective immigration policy."
"The Finnish Presidency intends to move this thorny issue forwards by breaking down the barrier of unanimity in the Council of Ministers, which is holding back all progress in the crucial field of judicial and police cooperation, in order to combat human trafficking and illegal immigration."
"I very much hope that this Nordic desire will soon be put into practice, through the implementation of a humane joint policy on the right to asylum, or cooperation between the 25 Member States to allocate quotas to each country."
"Another challenge that needs to be met is the integration of immigrants."
"As the Lambrinidis report emphasises, there is still much progress to be made in the Europe of 25 Member States if we are to make a success of this integration, particularly in the fields of access to employment, non-discrimination, the education of women, language-learning programmes and political participation."
"If we can win this bet, we will be one step closer to social peace."
". – European immigration policy cannot be limited to the fight against illegal immigration: we must, as a matter of urgency, establish a European policy on the integration of third-country nationals."
"The Commission communication on a common agenda for integration therefore constitutes an important step forwards, and the creation of a European Fund for the integration of third-country nationals is very much in line with this."
"Immigrants must be able to benefit directly from this fund, and it must therefore allow them to participate more actively at all levels of education, culture and politics."
"We need to promote an exchange of best integration policy practice across the Member States, in order to smooth the path for a truly European integration policy."
"I also support the rapporteur's proposal that we establish fast and humane procedures to grant long-term resident status, for family reunification and for the naturalisation of long-term resident immigrants."
"The ΕU addresses the question of immigration solely within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy, in order to increase the competitiveness of its economy; in other words, from the point of view of increasing the profitability of European capital."
"That is why its pronouncements about the social integration of immigrants are nothing more than a general wish list, without any practical backup to resolve their worsening problems."
"They are insulting hypocrisy, given that immigrants throughout the EU are subject to the harshest exploitation of capital, in poorly paid, uninsured jobs, with no access to fundamental social and political rights, permanently hostage to the reactionary institutional framework of the Member States and of the ΕU, which illegally keeps millions of immigrants prisoner."
"The Greek Communist Party supports the fair applications of immigrants for legal status, the abolition of undeclared, uninsured jobs, increased wages and salaries, equal pay for jobs of equal value, improved, free public education and health services and full political rights for everyone."
"The way to resolve their problems is through their integration in the workers' class movement, resistance and the development of its struggle against the anti-grassroots policy of the ΕU and the governments, which are responsible for the poverty and misfortune of local and immigrant workers in the ΕU and the entire world."
". I and my British Conservative colleagues welcome the broad approach of the Carlotti report and support the many positive and balanced elements of this report."
"However, we are against the idea of integrating the migration issue into EU external policies, as stated in paragraph six."
"We do not believe that a common strategy is the best way to deal with the issue."
"We believe that policy in this area must remain within the competence of national governments and do not believe in a pan-European approach to immigration policy."
"– Mrs Carlotti's biggest failing, which can be found in all the European Parliament's reports on this subject, is that she thinks that immigration, rebaptised for the occasion as 'human mobility', is a human right."
"No, we do not all have the inalienable right to settle permanently in whatever country we choose: the states must be able to decide who can enter their territory, who can stay there and for how long."
"The quasi-religious philosophical prejudice held by the rapporteur has therefore led her to the wrong answers."
"It is quite obvious that there is a link between development and migration: hundreds of thousands of people are forced into emigration by poverty, and it is clear, as the has been saying for years, that development policies are needed that will enable these people to stay in their own countries by giving them the means to live there with dignity."
"One element of this is to organise the repatriation of immigrants to their countries of origin, so that those countries can benefit from the experience and the skills they gained during their stay in the European Union."
"This is the only option that Mrs Carlotti's report completely ignores, and that is why we are going to vote against it."
"We supported this report because it contained a number of points that we welcome. It does not, however, criticise the immigration policy operating in the EU or condemn the underlying causes behind the migration of millions of men and women around the world."
"The report fails to criticise the EU’s immigration policy, the prime objective of which is to exploit cheap labour deprived of rights while implementing repressive measures that seek to criminalise immigrants, men and women who simply want to enjoy the right to live – that is to say, access to food, health, water, housing, education and culture – the right to employment and the right to an income."
"The report also sidesteps the underlying causes of migration, which are rooted in increasingly deep inequality."
"This inequality is engendered by the neoliberal, militaristic policies that lie at the root of capitalist globalisation."
"These policies of liberalisation and privatisation are intended to promote the concentration of wealth and property in the large economic and financial groups and to manipulate the Member States into pandering to their interests, which demonstrates that they do not need interference and war to impose their ideas."
". – On the eve of the Rabat conference, it is vital that we remember that cooperation between the European Union and immigrants' countries of origin must not be limited to helping them to strengthen their borders."
"We must engage in dialogue to tackle the fundamental reasons why people risk their lives to cross the oceans in search of a better life in Europe."
"We must facilitate codevelopment that is more closely focussed on the people, in order to reduce poverty and inequality, which are the primary causes of emigration."
"The establishment of a European codevelopment fund will perpetuate this principle."
"Finally, we need to remember that migration must represent an opportunity for the countries of origin: we can encourage migrants to invest in their countries, in order to optimise their impact on the development of their countries."
"I am voting in favour of this report as it does not set out legislation and does provide many sound proposals."
"It emphasises equality, rights for asylum-seekers and assistance for integration and cooperation."
"I am, however, against the proposals contained in the report that provide for greater power for the EU on migration policy since this would have a negative impact both in practical and democratic terms."
"I am opposed to the inefficient new funds that are proposed and that the EU will be unable to administer successfully."
"I am further opposed to the cost-ineffective proposal to pay the difference in wages for returning high-earners."
"– In Mr Schmidt's report, the European Parliament has tried to make a statement on the need to give fair trade a truly European political framework."
"This approach is absolutely vital, because the pressure currently exerted by the increasing openness of the world markets represents a serious threat to the economic, environmental and social viability of the various agricultural models across the world: by forcing farmers to sell their produce for lower and lower prices, it puts them at risk by undermining their income, and is partly responsible for the deteriorating working conditions of agricultural workers and the deterioration of the environment."
"Free trade can and must help to provide an alternative to this situation, which, by favouring the lowest common denominator, undermines the Millennium Development Goals."
"In this light, the Commission now needs to send a strong political signal in favour of a system of trade that provides producers with a decent income and helps to remove any temptations to social and environmental dumping."
"The growing popularity of free-trade products with European consumers is bound to act as an incentive for an initiative of this kind."
"Therefore, even though I find it regrettable that Parliament has not seen fit to advocate special tariff measures (a differentiated approach similar to GSP+) to benefit free-trade products, I will vote in favour of the Schmidt report."
". Although this report has the best of intentions, it ultimately fails to get to the root of the problem."
"The producer must of course receive a fair income – so as to cover the costs of production and to ensure a sustainable livelihood – and must, moreover, be involved in the process of placing his products on the market, to name but two of the many positive points in this report."
"This must not hide the fact that the broader ideas underpinning so-called fair trade are very much at variance with the policies of liberalisation of world trade, for example in the WTO (not to mention the free trade agreements encouraged by the EU and the USA), which seek to manipulate the production systems of the economically least developed countries to meet the expansion needs of the large economic and financial groups of the ‘northern’ countries."
"What is needed is a policy that respects people's right to use the natural resources and to enjoy the production and economic benefits of their country in order to improve their living conditions; a policy that encourages mutually beneficial cooperation and delivers food sovereignty; a policy whereby natural resources and the strategic sectors of the economy remain public property and under public control."
". I welcome this balanced report which explores the ways in which the growing popularity and number of Fair Trade products in the EU could contribute to our attempts to end social injustice and raise the standards of production in developing countries."
"I have support for a number of conclusions for this report, namely that there should be adequate consumer information, a fair producer price and transparency throughout the supply chain."
"I sought to amend the report to make sure that the conditions of production play a full part in the notion of Fair Trade through the need to respect the eight core ILO conventions."
"I also submitted an amendment urging the Commission to liaise with the international Fair Trade movement in supporting clear and widely-applicable criteria against which consumer assurance schemes can be assessed, so as to support consumer confidence in such schemes."
"Given the existence of several national schemes recognised by the consumer I would not at present support an EU-wide Fair Trade mark."
"However, I think this option should be considered in the event that a proliferation of standards and marks leads to confusion among consumers."
". It is well known that more than 65 million people in the world have been infected with HIV, around 25 million people have died and some 15 million children have been orphaned by AIDS."
"This is especially serious in the developing world, where of the 40 million people currently living with HIV, over 95% live in the developing world, with over 70% in Sub-Saharan Africa alone."
"Against this appalling backdrop, I wish to highlight the plight of women, who represent over half of all people living with AIDS and 60% of those living with AIDS in Africa, with women being between two and four times as susceptible to the disease as men."
"Although we wish to highlight the declaration of the UN General Assembly Special Session of 2 June 2006, in particular its references to promoting access to medicines for all, which includes production of generic antiretroviral drugs and other essential drugs for AIDS-related infections, it is regrettable that the declaration lacks any global targets or timelines on treatment, resources and prevention, and does not provide a viable action plan to back up the goal of providing universal access for all HIV-affected people by 2010 ..."
"– The next item is the continuation of the debate on the oral question raised by Mr Barón Crespo on the results of the WTO meeting at the end of April in Geneva and future perspectives."
"Mr President, I think most of our speakers would like Mr Mandelson to be here when they are speaking."
"Do you know if he is coming?"
"– I am told that the Commissioner is on his way and, in fact, I think he has just entered the Chamber, so I think we can let Mr Mandelson make himself comfortable while the first speaker takes the floor on behalf of his group."
"– Mr President, I should like to make a serious proposal in addition to what was quite rightly said by the chairman of the Committee on International Trade, Mr Barón Crespo. The results of the meeting in Geneva should not deflect our commitment to multilateralism, to organised international economic relations and to balanced and fair world trade governance."
"Nonetheless, I do not understand why the Union continues to be at a disadvantage in the agricultural sector."
"We all know that it has demonstrated a constructive negotiating stand."
"The negotiating emphasis, with concessions, is being dictated by other leading developed and dynamically developing actors."
"We must stamp out the delusions which some of our trading parties are taking pains to maintain."
"Firstly, agricultural liberalisation is not a panacea for development."
"On the contrary, it is only expected to benefit a few competitive exporters, such as Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and Argentina."
"All recent economic studies agree that the greatest benefits from the current round are expected from the opening up of the industrial products and trade services markets."
"Secondly, the liberalisation of industrial products and services does not only constitute an aggressive interest on the part of developed countries."
"Gradual liberalisation, with the necessary technical assistance, will prove to be of benefit to developing countries themselves."
"Thirdly, special treatment for developing countries is absolutely positive."
"At the same time, however, it is by looking outwards that these countries will help themselves to integrate more effectively into the global trade system."
"When it comes to the multilateralism or bilateralism/regionalism dilemma, we are unreservedly in favour of multilateral trade relations."
"Consequently, further negotiation is needed, but keeping the principle of uniform commitment intact."
"I believe that there are still margins for agreement."
"The Doha round must not founder."
"It is accompanied by major ambitions and expectations."
"To close, I should like to extend my particular thanks to the Commissioner, Mr Mandelson, for his detailed report on the Geneva meeting and to honestly congratulate him on his negotiating stand."
"– Mr President, I should like to take my turn in thanking the chairman of the Committee on International Trade, Mr Barón Crespo, and the Commissioner, Mr Mandelson, on their reports."
"I believe that the breakdown of negotiations in Geneva last week created a climate of scaremongering; that was the climate that was cultivated."
"However, I believe that this climate must not under any circumstances put pressure on the Commission or on Commissioner Mandelson to continue to make concessions, especially in the agricultural sector."
"Commissioner, I fear that, as the European Union and as the European Commission, we have lost the battle for our positions."
"We have lost at the level of communication and I believe that we need to take particular care here."
"Our message must be crystal clear."
"We want a balanced and logical compromise that will cover all sectors of the Doha round."
"However, any such compromise cannot be at the expense of the agricultural sector of the European Union."
"Hence, for us the position is the mandate from the Council of Ministers and the revised common agricultural policy."
"Finally, Commissioner, I should like you to explain to us something you have said on numerous occasions recently: what does 'the European Commission will demonstrate conditional flexibility' mean?"
"I fear that this is being exploited by our trading partners in order to exert greater pressure on the European Commission."
"."
"Mr President, I welcome Commissioner Mandelson here today."
"I listened to what the Commissioner had to say this morning."
"He spoke of real cuts in agricultural subsidies by all and he used the phrase ‘operating to the limit of our flexibility’."
"I want to ask him about that flexibility and the mandate he has from the Council of Ministers with regard to trade concessions in agriculture."
"Has the negotiating mandate set out in the Council conclusions and the Luxembourg Agreement changed?"
"While I do not expect him to give me precise details of his negotiating position, I would like to know what the broad parameters of that flexibility are and if there is a limit."
"The Commissioner also said that he had negotiated alongside Commissioner Fischer Boel in Geneva last week."
"Does he agree with her statement last week that if we accepted the G20 proposals in their entirety we would lose up to half a million jobs in the supply chain, with beef production in the likes of Ireland and France being wiped out and poultry production disappearing altogether?"
"Finally, I apologise sincerely to the Commissioner that, as the debate has run several hours late and I have a plane that will not wait, I will have to listen to his answers on the Internet."
"."
"Mr President, it is clear that the WTO crisis is deepening."
"There is a risk that the failure at the WTO ministerial meeting last week to bring members closer to trade deals represents another step towards the final betrayal of the very idea of a Development Round."
"Some have even said that the meeting was counterproductive, with an atmosphere even more difficult than before, but perhaps the silver lining is that developing countries are united in insisting that rich countries put development at the heart of the process as a matter of course and deliver on their extremely long-standing promises."
"More than two thirds of the WTO membership – developing and least-developed countries – declared that they were prepared to make a deal, but that industrial countries have to make the greatest contribution to show real leadership."
"I am glad the EU signalled that it was prepared to move closer to the G20 position, particularly by lowering domestic support, but there are still loopholes in the EU offer that would undermine the potential of a true development deal."
"The US offer is of course still far removed from what is necessary to stop dumping and protect food security."
"As regards the special and differential treatment in agriculture, the Development Box, it is not clear whether the Commission will support the G33 request for a significant percentage of products to be covered in order to guarantee food security."
"I would be grateful if Commissioner Mandelson could set out the EU position and hopefully distinguish it from the extremely damaging proposals from the US."
"On NAMA, the Commission is still demanding too much extreme liberalisation, which will threaten the very survival of some developing countries’ local manufacturing and it is hardly in the spirit of the Development Round to demand action on applied tariff levels rather than, as usual, bound tariff levels."
"It looks very unlikely that we will have an agreement in July and the timetable is too hurried."
"We should have a reflection period on the reasons for the failure of the Doha Round."
"We must learn lessons from this and ensure things are better processed through a much reformed WTO and obtain a clear understanding of the role of trade and delivering sustainable development."
"Perhaps in that way we can devise a Development Round generally worthy of the name."
"."
"Mr President, what we are debating this afternoon is not just what has emerged from the WTO meeting in Geneva but also the future of the WTO as an institution."
"The crisis within the WTO makes it more likely that the institution will no longer be able to act as anything more than an arbitrator and will no longer be able to take the initiative in proposing new rules, with the consequent threat of world trade being once more in thrall to innumerable bilateral agreements."
"I have three questions I would like to put to Commissioner Mandelson."
"Firstly, are all the parties involved in the trade talks fully aware of just how urgent it is that the Doha round be brought to a good conclusion?"
"My second question follows on from the first and it is this: what is the Commissioner’s view as regards the role of the United States and the G-20, and to what degree, Commissioner, do you think they are willing to take action?"
"My third question is the most urgent."
"Is the Commission clear in its own mind about what it will do if the Doha round fails, and what sort of agenda does it have prepared for that eventuality?"
"I want to put to the Commission two proposals as regards this trade agenda."
"Above all else, the way ahead through multilateral agreements must be kept open for as long as possible."
"Bilateral agreements always present world trade with innumerable sorts of trade rules that make it less manageable and less effective."
"On top of that, they also present the threat of a new economic protectionism."
"My second proposal has to do with the role of developing countries, which must not be allowed to fall victim to the power of any future bilateral agreements."
"The Commission must offer such countries technical support in order that they may not, in negotiations, lose out to the big ones."
"Mr President, I thank the Commissioner, not just for coming here today to listen to the debate, but also for the help I believe he gave to Members of Parliament in Geneva last week."
"I could not be there, but they did express their thanks for the way he kept them informed."
"I got the impression from your address, Commissioner – which I thought was quite frank – that, to choose my words carefully – and I could have used stronger words – you were pretty fed up with the way the US was involved in the negotiations."
"In fact, it would appear that it was pretty intransigent."
"Although you cannot always believe what you read in the press, according to a press release you had asked the US trade representative, Susan Schwab, what she would be able to offer if the EU were to give the US everything it wanted on market access."
"Apparently she was unable to answer that."
"I wonder whether the US has a mandate."
"When we were in Hong Kong, Rob Portman seemed never to be able to negotiate."
"Whenever I listened to him, there was a particular problem with West African cotton."
"Certainly when producers lobbied him in Hong Kong he got very upset and seemed not to be able to make any comment."
"That was not a big issue for the United States and not a big issue in terms of trade, but it was very important."
"What is the fallback position if nothing happens in the next month in the negotiations?"
"Where do we go?"
"What is the situation?"
"On a minor point, Mrs Harkin mentioned agriculture."
"What is the position?"
"There is a huge worry, certainly in the United Kingdom and, I am sure, across Europe about hormone beef coming into the European Union under a trade negotiation with the US."
"Is there a real risk that might happen, or can we stop it?"
"Mr President, it is clear that the World Trade talks are in serious crisis, but I hope Members will not talk us into an assured failure."
"It is clear that a successful round depends on tackling agriculture."
"With up to 85% of their populations living in rural areas it is not surprising that the world’s poorest countries will judge any package on the basis of its impact on their farmers."
"What I find more baffling, frankly even inexplicable, is the notion that the talks could flounder on the US and to a lesser extent the EU position on agriculture."
"Agriculture represents only 2% of our wealth, therefore it seems perverse to make this a sticking point when we have so much to gain from improved non-market agricultural access and in particular from services liberalisation."
"Since the beginning of the Doha round, the EU has undergone substantial CAP reform."
"In Hong Kong we offered to end agricultural export subsidies by 2013; our Everything but Arms scheme offers duty-free access for products from the poorest countries."
"While I believe we can and should go further and I commend the Commissioner for his flexibility, particularly the flexibility he showed in Geneva, this is a flexibility that is sadly lacking in our negotiating and trading partners."
"What I would like to ask the Commissioner, given his extensive contacts with other negotiators, is whether he can tell this House what sort of package he believes it is necessary for the United States to put on the table in order to break this log-jam."
"Susan Schwab has indicated that she remains committed to a successful outcome."
"What does she need to bring to the table to show that the US is prepared to put its farm subsidies where its mouth is?"
"Mr President, we seem to lose sight of the development aspect of the Doha Development Round as it grinds on."
"There have been no noticeable gains for least-developed nations."
"There have been noticeable losses to countries like Mauritius, which now run the risk of being relegated to the category of poorest countries."
"There have also been major losses for Irish agriculture."
"Recently a farmer – who is a third-generation sheep farmer – took me to see his last flock of sheep."
"In our once flourishing sugar industry, the lights have been switched off and the door closed in our last factory."
"Although I would like to see some tangible progress for the poorest nations, I suppose I should be grateful that in this latest round of talks no more Irish agriculture has been given away."
"However, if the Commissioner needs to find leverage to shift the US position, I suggest that he works to get GM crops categorised separately from their natural equivalents."
"This would give us and the least-developed countries a distinct advantage over the US, which would find it hard to separate GM crops and natural equivalents."
"When the Commissioner does that, would he also again talk to Commissioner Fischer Boel about allowing countries in Europe to have GM-free status?"
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Commissioner Mandelson for the spirit of openness he showed the four of us who made up Parliament’s delegation in Geneva last weekend."
"It was very rewarding and I think that we cooperated very well."
"There is an intrinsic value in us obtaining a new WTO agreement."
"Doing so requires confidence, both in the WTO and in multilateralism itself."
"It is, after all, the only system that has delivered real liberalisations of world trade."
"I do believe, however, that we are right to demand more than just an agreement from all the parties."
"We deserve an ambitious agreement, an agreement that provides greater market access for both agricultural products and industrial goods for everyone, both in industrialised countries and in developing countries, and one that does not leave out services."
"This is a crucial matter if poor countries are to develop, but also if our own European companies are to have access to new markets."
"In the long term, no one would gain from a ‘Doha light’ deal or a complete failure of the Doha Round."
"I therefore do not believe that there is any justification for the entrenched positions that we see many of the parties taking up at the moment."
"It is easy to see the problems with the negotiations."
"The economic reality should be enough to convince all the parties to make that little bit of extra effort, particularly the EU-Brazil-USA triangle that was so much in the spotlight over the weekend in Geneva."
"All of these countries have strong practical reasons to take a further step."
"In the USA, for example, even the most dogmatic advocates of agricultural protectionism should be able to see that it is better to give up their agricultural subsidies in the course of the negotiations and receive market access to key regions in exchange, rather than to be forced to give them up by a dispute settlement body following a breakdown of the talks, and then receive nothing at all in exchange."
"The sugar panel that came down against us and made us reform our subsidies to sugar producers ought to have given us the same insight."
"The EU should also understand that it is absurd to fail to secure much more important market openings for industrial goods and services as a result of clinging on to an agricultural subsidy that we all know is fundamentally untenable."
"It is therefore pleasing that the Commission appears to have come closer to meeting the demand from the G20, the group of advanced developing countries, to reduce the high levels of customs duties on agricultural products."
"This is crucial if we are to salvage the prospects of achieving an agreement."
"We must now ensure that we apply a flexible approach only in connection with genuinely vulnerable products and not in order to satisfy those special interests with the loudest voices."
"If anyone should understand the importance of trade without customs and barriers then it should be us, here in Europe."
"We, who see the benefit of it every day through the internal market."
"– I was part of Parliament’s delegation in Geneva and I should like to share a couple of positive points with you: the first was the positive cooperation between the Commission and the MEPs that were there."
"As previous speakers have said, there was daily contact with Mr Mandelson and Mr Fisher Boel."
"This ensured that there was a constant flow of information, which meant that the MEPs could achieve more."
"The second is the image of the EU as a proactive bloc that is prepared to negotiate, in contrast with other partners, in particular the United States."
"On the downside, there is no doubt that the negotiations did not achieve a great deal, which is bad for the world and for Europe."
"In Europe we need to strengthen competitiveness, growth and employment."
"To this end, we need to ensure effective access for industrial companies – non-agricultural market access (NAMA) – and for more dynamic services to markets; we need to guarantee respect for intellectual property and to negotiate an environmental and social level playing field that regulates international competition."
"I have one or two questions. Firstly, what is Europe's actual ability to find a solution, even a partial one, to these problems in the Doha round?"
"Secondly, if, as we expect, an agreement is not reached in July, what strategy will the EU adopt?"
"You mentioned a new set of proposals in September."
"Can you give us some details about that?"
"Third question; is the great difficulty in achieving results at the current Doha Round down to routine problems or does the multilateral model of the worldwide harmonisation of trade, which I am personally in favour of, need to be completely revamped and perhaps supplemented?"
"Mr President, as Commissioner Mandelson knows, increased trade and prosperity go together."
"Increased trade and prosperity means a reduction in migration, a more stable society and peace."
"The Third World needs as big a share of world trade as anyone else, but the current regime of tariffs and subsidies stifles it."
"Why not drop barriers against the Third World in return for domestic, legal and infrastructural progress?"
"The EU will not look again at tariffs before 2013 and precious time will be lost."
"Now we come to the issue of globalisation."
"Why on earth are such high tariffs being put on shoes from China?"
"Are we afraid of China’s massive population out-producing Europe?"
"We must think again; trade is a two way thing."
"Buying from China means that 500 million Europeans will get an entry into a market of 1.3 billion Chinese."
"That is an enormous opportunity for European producers."
"So I would urge the Commissioner to please have the courage and the daring to reduce tariffs and subsidies drastically and stimulate free trade worldwide."
"Let us not just talk about reducing poverty and making poverty history, but let us take real concrete steps to promote trade, which offers the only real solution."
"Mr President, what I want to say to Commissioner Mandelson and his staff is: many congratulations on the success of the negotiations over the past few weeks!"
"It has proved possible, once and for all, to pass the buck to the United States; the European Union has at last managed to escape from its assigned role of stonewaller, and it is plain for all to see that the time has come for the others to make their moves."
"Another good thing is that the parties to the negotiations took their leave of each other at the weekend in an atmosphere of calm, rather than, as they did after Hong Kong, laying into each other at the tops of their voices, and that gives cause for hope in the coming weeks."
"One ought not realistically to be able to expect a result by June or a line to be drawn under it by then."
"A number of things, though, will be important over the weeks to come."
"For a start, our economy needs markets to be really open, particularly in the emerging economies."
"Secondly, there must be no unilateral concessions where agriculture is concerned."
"Thirdly, not even in the next few weeks must there be any premature political deals."
"Fourthly, a bad result would be even worse than none at all, for it would be a disaster for our national economies if we were to offer across—the-board reductions in customs duties and subsidies in the agricultural sector or in NAMA without getting in return real improvements in market access for industrial products."
"Fifthly, it is absolutely vital that the European representatives to the G8 summit should raise the subject of the Doha round and put it at the top of the agenda there."
"It is vital to all the interested parties that this round should not fail, but should instead be able to yield gains in prosperity for all WTO members on the basis of clear and unambiguous results."
"With this in mind, I wish all the EU negotiators all the best for the coming weeks, in the shape of tenacity, luck and success."
"."
"Mr President, thank you for what has been a very constructive and helpful debate."
"I would like to thank those who have supported the Commission in its negotiating stance and its negotiating approach."
"It is never easy finally to judge precisely the best thing to do at the best time, but we do our best and I think it is true to say that amongst the key negotiating partners the EU has considerable support for the approach that we are taking."
"This is not as important as the support we have from our own side, from our own Member States and from the Members of this House."
"I shall make one observation immediately."
"We have a number of interests in these negotiations – agricultural, non-agricultural, relating to services liberalisation and rules."
"Our job as negotiators is to get an outcome that is balanced across the range of those negotiating subjects."
"We will give in some places more than we will give in other places."
"There will be swings, there will be roundabouts, we will gain, and we will lose."
"Nobody can make a final judgement about what Europe will be able to gain from these talks until the very end – not simply when the key modalities are put in place, as I hope they will be this summer, but when all the other negotiations have taken place on the individual country schedules and when all the negotiations about rules have also been put in place."
"It is very important that those who are particularly concerned about agriculture in Europe understand and accept that we will not pay over the limits in agriculture for what we want elsewhere in the talks."
"We will do what is fair."
"We will do what is reasonable."
"We will do what is in our mandate as far as agriculture is concerned."
"That is clear to me."
"It should also be clear to our Member States."
"Having said that, it is important to keep a sensible perspective in these negotiations."
"We must be careful not to devote such energy to protecting our defensive interests in agriculture in these negotiations that we fail to prioritise our offensive interests in non-agricultural market access and in services."
"There really must be a sense of proportion and balance as regards how we weigh the various economic and social interests that are at stake here."
"As far as the United States is concerned, let me just say this in response to one speech: I do not feel that, should the talks fail, we as European negotiators are in a race with the United States to see who can shift the blame most effectively to the other."
"I look to the United States as a genuine partner, as a country and an economy that shares some of our interests but at the same time places a different emphasis from us in various areas of these negotiations."
"We will not reach a successful conclusion unless the EU and the US work together as a team – not at the expense of other negotiating partners, not instead of sensible negotiations and links and agreements that we will have with our negotiating partners in various areas of the negotiations."
"However, if at the end of the day the EU and the US are at loggerheads and simply cannot agree the ground on which they will stand together to bring these talks to a successful conclusion, then there will be no successful conclusion to these talks."
"We will lose from that, the United States will lose from that, the global economy will lose from that and in particular developing countries will lose from that."
"I should like to thank Members who have spoken, including those who have asked what my Plan B is if these talks fail."
"I am afraid I am not preparing for failure: I am going to continue to negotiate for success only, whether it be in relation to hormone beef, which is not part of these negotiations – we do not welcome US hormone-treated beef in the European Union for health reasons, not trade reasons – or in relation to GMOs, which again are not the subject of these talks and where our policy firstly has to be in line with the regulatory framework we adopted in the EU a few years ago and in line with WTO rules."
"It is this that governs our approach, rather than something I am negotiating in these talks."
"I am glad that we – the Commission and Members of this Parliament – are able to cooperate in Geneva and elsewhere."
"I do not cooperate with this Parliament as an act of generosity on my part."
"There is nothing altruistic about this."
"The reason I cooperate is because I want the Members of the European Parliament there on these occasions."
"You give me valuable insights, you collect information and intelligence, you are able to tap different sources of opinion, which I do not always have easy access to, and you are also, on a good day, able to help us deliver a message to our negotiating partners."
"That is why I welcome Members of this Parliament being present and why I shall remain very firmly in cooperation with you."
"The debate is closed."
"– The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Mr Barón Crespo on behalf of the Committee on International Trade on the origin marking of certain imported products (O-0065-2006 – B6-0316/2006)."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the European Parliament’s Committee on International Trade, while I note what the Commissioner has just said about the excellent climate of cooperation and joint work between Parliament and the Commission, I would like in this case to express my regret about a small incident relating to the formal communication of this proposal to Parliament for information, which has prevented us from reacting properly, although we are still in time."
"I am aware that this proposal was sent within the documents of the 133 Committee, communicated as usual by the Commission’s secretariat to the secretariat of the Committee on International Trade."
"Nevertheless, I would like to point that, for both practical reasons and on principle, informal communication does not replace formal notification of Parliament for information purposes."
"In any event, Commissioner, I would like to make it clear that we do not believe that the Commission has acted intentionally, and we can therefore start dealing with the issue itself, which is very important to the Europeans."
"Firstly, with regard to the fundamental issue, I would like to point out that I am in favour of your proposal to establish an obligatory system of origin marking in the European Community."
"I believe that this initiative moves in the right direction."
"In short, the proposed origin marking system will inform European consumers of the precise country of origin of the products they buy."
"It moves in the direction of things we have approved previously, such as the traceability of agricultural products."
"The European Commission rightly sees consumers' rights as an important, even constitutional, priority."
"Nevertheless, it makes little sense to have rights if one does not have the information required to make them effective."
"Freedom of choice does not exist if consumers are not in a position to exercise it properly."
"If they are to have confidence, consumers must be satisfied with the degree of information and protection they are provided with."
"In fact, there can be no trade without confidence."
"A precise origin marking will not just benefit consumers, since this proposed Regulation will also have beneficial effects for European industry."
"Our products must increasingly be associated with a high level of quality and style."
"That is what will allow us to survive in the globalised world, in sectors with such high levels of quality and design as textiles, clothing, jewellery and footwear, for example, and also automobiles, since that is another sensitive sector."
"Consumers throughout the world are often prepared to pay more when they know that a product has been manufactured in the European Union and that is one of the 'natural' advantages that we must safeguard."
"In relation to the negotiations this weekend in the WTO, I would also say that I believe that such a sensitive issue to Europe as geographical indications is relevant to this line of thinking: we must safeguard what characterises us at world level."
"This is therefore a point on which we fully support the Commission: we do not understand the attitude of many European Union States which are currently blocking the decision in the Council."
"We believe that this is an important step towards increasing our presence and competitiveness at world level and I believe that this falls within our collective responsibilities."
"The Commission and the Members States should not just listen to the views of importers, wholesalers or companies that have already relocated their production to other continents, however respectable they may be."
"They should also listen to the legitimate demands of consumers and of European industry, which needs to accept this origin marking."
"This is also a question of justice."
"Our main trading partners impose the ‘Made in Europe’ upon us, so why do we, for our part, not contribute to increasing the prestige of this marking?"
"Globalising does not mean surrendering our experience and capacity, it means strengthening them."
"I hope that the Member States who are opposed to this fair initiative in the Council will understand that."
", ."
"Mr President, I should like to start by saying that this Commission and I, as Commissioner for Trade, are fully committed to working very closely with Parliament, in line with the framework agreement governing relations between the two institutions."
"As this question rightly points out, the legal basis for this measure – Article 133 of the EC Treaty – does not provide specifically for consultation of the European Parliament on this proposal for an ‘origin marking’ scheme."
"However, in line with our commitment to keep the European Parliament fully informed, on a par with the Council, of the conduct and conclusion of international negotiations, as well as legislative initiatives, the proposal and the accompanying impact assessment were transmitted on 12 January 2006 to the European Parliament via the Committee on International Trade."
"I should like to refer to paragraph 2 of the motion for a resolution that you have before you."
"The language of that paragraph is slightly unfortunate because it could, as it is written at the moment, be read as if the Commission had not sent any document at all on ‘origin marking’ to Parliament."
"As I said, we sent it as an Article 133 document to the INTA Committee."
"I believe that it would certainly be fairer to me and to the Commission – and more accurate – if an adjustment were made to the wording."
"Our intention has been, and continues to be, to act in line with both the letter and the spirit of the framework agreement."
"To meet the commitment in that agreement, and in addition to the many formal and informal contacts that I have with you, the Commission tries hard to share a maximum of information with Parliament, just as I did last week in Geneva."
"In particular we sent to the INTA Committee copies of all policy documents that are being discussed in the Council’s 133 Committee."
"If a more formal interinstitutional way to bring this issue to your attention should have been used on that occasion, the opportunity was certainly not missed on purpose."
"I very much welcome the interest you have already shown in this proposal through several questions on the subject, which we have answered."
"So let me now come to our proposal."
"We have proposed a mandatory origin marking scheme, to create transparency about the origin of certain imported goods according to a single standard by which origin is determined."
"This system will allow consumers to take informed decisions; it will reduce the incidence of fraudulent or misleading origin marking."
"We believe it will help improve the image of European goods and will help our competitiveness."
"While it is clear that ‘made in’ marking as such does not contain information on the social, labour or environmental conditions in the country of production, origin information helps the consumer to choose between different available alternatives according to their preferences and the background information they already have."
"As regards WTO compatibility, the Commission believes its proposal is in line with international rules, notably Article 9 of the GATT."
"That provides that WTO members may adopt and enforce laws and regulations relating to marks of origin on imports, notably to protect consumers against fraudulent or misleading indications."
"Concerning the enforcement of the proposal, the Commission considers that customs authorities are well placed to ensure that the requirements of the proposed scheme are respected, just as they do with many other rules on environmental, health and technical issues."
"That part of customs work is crucial to ensuring that our businesses can trade on a level playing field and that consumers draw the full benefits of globalisation."
"I should add that in addition to possible controls carried out before the products are released into the internal market, the regulation provides for Member States to check origin marking on goods that are already on the market."
"That should enable Member States to draw on other expertise in policing the scheme, for example by working with those who are presently involved in the enforcement of national rules concerning the voluntary use of origin marking."
"As you will be aware, Mr President, the Commission proposal is being debated in the Council and I am of course ready to keep you informed as discussions on the proposal move forward."
"Mr President, I totally endorse what the Commissioner said."
"What I can never understand in these situations is why a country – and I can think of one in particular, because we had this problem in Hong Kong – is so afraid of having its own name on a product."
"If you look, for example, at Canada, it almost seems frightened to have its name on products."
"These countries should be proud of it and see it as a wonderful opportunity."
"It is not a question of protecting EU trade, of protecting EU jobs; it surely is a question of protecting the consumer across the world."
"I therefore find the attitude of these non-EU countries difficult to understand."
"Having said that, perhaps we ought first of all to put our own House in order and have country-of-origin marking within the EU, which we do not seem to have at the moment."
"That might help considerably."
"The Commissioner briefly mentioned one issue that is particularly important: counterfeiting and fraud."
"Origin marking would be of considerable help there."
"But I say again that while the matter may not come under this remit – and the Commissioner was quite right to say I was wrong in assuming that hormone beef was part of the trade negotiations – all this is connected with world trade and it is the kind of issue that will come up."
"I do not want to see origin marking as a non-trade barrier."
"I want to see it as an opportunity for countries outside the European Union to be able to be proud of what they produce, providing it is produced – and here I totally agree with the Commissioner – to the same standards that we have within the European Union."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal for a regulation on the indication of the country of origin on certain products imported from third countries is unquestionably very important, and represents noteworthy progress in implementing the principles of fairness and transparency in international trade."
"Origin marking contains a great deal of information enabling European consumers to make more informed choices."
"This, right away, enhances their rights considerably."
"These new arrangements can and should have additional impact, insofar as a clearer comparison can be made of the expected quality of a product, and the processes involved in making that product."
"At the point of purchase of the products covered by this proposal, European consumers will, among other things, be in a position to compare various approaches to environmental, social and safety, and other such important issues."
"It is plausible that this may have a very positive knock-on effect on European production, and especially SMEs and the sectors most vulnerable to external competition."
"Such effects should not be seen as the result of adopting a protectionist stance, but as the fruit of a tighter approach to transparency and fairness."
"Taking a firm decision to go down this route may, according to the European public, lead to the pursuit of a process of gradual liberalisation of international trade, thereby ensuring it is not wooed by the appeal of protectionist, anti-liberal rhetoric, which is always capable of rising to the surface on all sides of the political spectrum."
"This is therefore a fair and timely proposal that should be implemented at the earliest opportunity. Those opposed have not presented any salient arguments against it."
"The Commission should implement the initiatives that will help overcome any lingering resistance, so that the EU can take this vitally important step towards promoting genuinely free and fair trade."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the compulsory origin marking proposed by the Commission must be supported because it has a dual purpose: to make Europeans, as consumers, better informed and to optimise the industrial system of those European countries that are investing a large amount of resources in innovation, with the aim of transforming their production apparatus into something of excellence."
"We must strive for equal rules with those trade areas – China, the US, Canada, Japan – that have already introduced origin marking to be restored to a minimum level, in the knowledge that such a move does not bring with it any risk of illegality."
"A more transparent market and more controls are needed, legal uncertainty needs to be reduced, and counterfeiting and unfair competition need to be clamped down on."
"The compulsory origin marking of imported goods may be indirectly or directly useful in all of this."
"It would not incur extra costs for producers, exporters or European consumers, thus making it easier to create a level playing field with those trade partners that have already implemented the standard, in line with the political and cultural decision that was and is aimed at creating, expanding and strengthening an increasingly large and free world market."
"Compulsory origin marking will also make it possible to promote the high-quality, and I stress high-quality, manufacturing industry in many European countries, which is wrongly regarded as inconsequential."
"This attitude is, in itself, also a major social issue that Europe must not overlook if the Lisbon objectives are to be pursued in practical terms rather than with abstract statements."
"Finally, this is an opportunity to put some questions to the Commission."
"What is the Commission’s strategy when it comes to strengthening the external aspects of European competitiveness, given the extremely close relationship between industry and trade, between production and promotion?"
"What resources does the Commission intend to use in order to strengthen these aspects?"
"Why has the Commission confined itself to including in the proposal only products from those sectors that asked to be included and not extended it to all industrial products, as the United States has instead done?"
"These are a few questions that it seems only natural to ask in an increasingly globalised world, which must develop freely, without protectionism, but which must do so while also respecting the rules that govern the general interest, above all of the citizens and of consumers."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate enables us to make two contrasting observations to the Commission."
"On the one hand, in fact, we condemn the fact that the Commission did not inform Parliament of the initiatives undertaken with regard to origin marking."
"This constitutes a breach of the Interinstitutional Framework Agreement of 26 May 2005, and I do not believe that a justification citing Article 133 of the Treaty can be accepted."
"On the other hand, however, the content of the proposal, on which Parliament has nevertheless succeeded today in issuing its opinion, enables me to express the support of my entire group for a long-awaited initiative that has already been warmly praised in the past by Italy’s centre-right government."
"Yet, it is an initiative that some people still insist on not supporting, demonstrating political short-sightedness and a lack of interest in consumers."
"Origin marking for certain categories of highly important products, from footwear to clothing, is wrongly seen by some people and in some sectors as a measure that has the same effect as trade barriers."
"That is not so; one need only point out precisely that famous Article 133 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Article 9 of the GATT and the recent opinion of the Council’s Legal Service."
"What is more, major trade partners and competitors of the Union, such as the United States, China, Japan and Canada, have equipped themselves with legislation on this matter."
"By adopting a regulation on origin marking, Europe too would at last be putting itself on an equal footing with the countries mentioned above, and be preventing unjustified discrimination that would heavily penalise not only European producers, but especially all consumers, including non-European consumers."
"The origin marking of products represents a guarantee for consumers that they are finally in a position to link their choices to safety and quality assessments, in addition to assessments of the social and environmental conditions existing in the country in which the products originate."
"We need to proceed with transparency and clarity, criteria that are demanded by everyone but then all too often ignored."
"We call on the Commission to do everything in its power to ensure that the Member States adopt a determined approach to consumer protection, which can be guaranteed only by the rules in force within the Union, rules that protect quality and safety, and by the label of origin, which guarantees that no one, either inside or outside the EU, can bypass those criteria."
"We call on the Commission subsequently to monitor the application of the rules, in terms both of labels of origin and of product composition, and we are grateful to the Commission for its swift action, because the swifter the action, the greater the protection of our fellow citizens."
"Mr President, protectionists are reluctant to admit that their proposals are protectionist but, rather, often hide their intentions."
"Mandatory origin marking is an example of this."
"I think now is the time to kill off some of the myths that the protectionists are spreading about this particular proposal."
"The first myth is that consumers are calling for this measure, but the truth is that most do not care."
"The advocates use the Commission’s internet consultation on this issue to back them up, but they neglect to mention that 96.7% of the responses came from a single country, namely Italy, where industry is the driving force on this issue."
"The second myth is that marking gives consumers relevant information, but in the global marketplace products and components more often than not have multiple countries of origin."
"It can be directly misleading to specify a single country of origin."
"The third myth is that marking strengthens European competitiveness, but new technical barriers to trade to protect European industry have nothing to do with competitiveness, which is strengthened only by open markets within a good business environment."
"The fourth myth is that mandatory marking would provide more consumer protection, as if safety were a question of geography."
"This could, at the very most, be of relevance in the case of agricultural products, but they are exempt from this proposal."
"The final myth is that it is an inexpensive proposal, but the Commission's own impact assessment states, for instance, that imported clothes would, on average, be EUR 1 to 1.50 more expensive, while a pair of shoes would be EUR 2 dearer."
"Thus the cost would be in the millions, maybe even the billions."
"In my opinion, origin marking is a badly disguised form of protectionism that will be expensive, and all this merely in order to force on foreign competitors new barriers to trade that do not qualify as tariffs."
"Why else would there be such a clear repudiation of the idea of introducing ‘Made in the EC’ labelling, something that is dismissed by saying that it would create unnecessary costs for European producers?"
"It is currently prohibited to require origin marking by other Member States, as that constitutes protectionism."
"To now require it of third countries without recognising that, in this case too, it is protectionism, smacks of hypocrisy, in my view."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will start by congratulating Mr Barón Crespo, who regularly draws attention to the Council's lack of tact when it does not involve Parliament sufficiently in decisions on international trade."
"We have a long way to go to get the governments to understand the need to get the citizens, and therefore their legitimate representatives here in Parliament, involved in major decisions on international trade."
"I would also like to congratulate Mr Sturdy on his wisdom in working towards this compromise."
"I will be voting in favour of the joint resolution, even though it regrettably restricts itself to taking note of the draft regulation on origin marking."
"Clearer political support will be needed in future, in view of the marked divisions in the European Council."
"Unfortunately, the text of the draft regulation contains some editorial errors, and would benefit from some operational clarifications."
"For example, Article 3(2) of the French version of the draft regulation refers to the Member State '' ['where the goods must be marked']."
"It is clear that this reference should be to the destination Member State, as the goods are marked in the country of manufacture, not in the State where they are sold."
"Turning to the operational clarifications, we absolutely must, for example, clarify the concept of the 'last substantial processing', which determines the origin of goods whose production involved more than one country, in accordance with Article 24 of the Community Customs code."
"Finally, we need to ensure consistency with customs legislation, particularly in the context of the control procedures planned for the future reform of the Community Customs Code, of which the Committee on International Trade would like to be informed, Mr President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the traceability of products and, in more general terms, intangible elements are elements that add value to products, are necessary in the fight against fraud and counterfeiting and, finally, are a vital tool in the economic and social battle awaiting us."
"This economic, social, and also environmental battle, as you know, is a battle for respect for our values."
"If we want our convictions to be respected, with regard to both social and environmental clauses in international trade agreements, we must require imported products to be traceable, and our internal market will be an important weapon in this battle."
"."
"Mr President, I am glad that almost every Member who has contributed to this debate has supported the original proposal made by the Commission."
"Very properly, some important questions have been raised about our ability to meet new customs codes, etc. These are important technical issues that we shall continue to address and to discuss with Members of this House."
"However, overwhelmingly, there is support for the essence – the principle – of our proposal."
"If we can overcome our disagreement about the method or manner or channel of depositing this proposal with Parliament, we would benefit from concentrating subsequently on the substance of this proposal."
"Very simply, it seeks to re-establish a level playing field with our trading partners, many of whom have already instituted forms of origin marking."
"It creates transparency about the origin of goods and establishes a single standard by which origin is determined."
"It permits informed consumer decisions."
"It reduces the incidence potentially of fraudulent or misleading origin marking and it contributes to improved competitiveness."
"For the consumer to be king – or queen – the consumer needs full information, or as much information as possible."
"I do not think it is unreasonable that amongst the information that consumers receive is the place of origin of the production or supply of particular goods."
"Let me just stress that it is not a ‘buy Europe’ campaign."
"Products will not be stamped ‘This is foreign – do not buy it’!"
"That is not part of my or the Commission’s motivation."
"Indeed, the more people know about the origin of goods and come to associate that origin with particular features or the quality of those goods, it may encourage them to buy those goods from those sources and places of origin."
"Why not?"
"However, that is not the point."
"The point is not whether we want to encourage people to buy goods from particular places of origin or discourage them from doing so, but to give them the information to enable them to make an objective judgement about where they purchase goods."
"I hope that Members of this House will see the ‘origin marking’ proposal as an alternative to protectionist instincts and measures and not as paving the way for them."
"I do not believe that we run the risk of putting up new non-tariff barriers to trade. I would certainly be very resistant to that."
"People in Europe are entitled to express or to demonstrate whatever preferences they have."
"Those preferences will include the origin or source of production of those goods."
"This is no more than a simple way of enabling them to do so."
"In accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received seven motions for resolutions(1) at the end of the debate."
"I would point out that the Committee on International Trade has withdrawn its motion for a resolution B6-0381/2006."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of this afternoon’s debates."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Somalia(1)."
"."
"Mr President, I am pleased to start off this debate, which I am sure will, as usual, meet with considerable agreement from all sides of this House."
"I dare say we will also have considerable agreement from the Commissioner, though I would point out that the Commission usually does agree with us and that is encouraging."
"As a fellow native of the British Isles – although I come from the Scottish European rather than the Anglo-Saxon political tradition – I would ask Commissioner Mandelson to engage in some discussion with us today, unlike his Commissioner colleagues."
"Would he outline in particular what the Commission thinks of paragraphs 8 and 6 of this motion for a resolution and, crucially, what the Commission is going to do about them?"
"It is difficult to look at Somalia and feel anything but sadness and frustration."
"It presents us with a fundamental dilemma."
"If the locals, left to their own devices, get it wrong, in our eyes at least, what, short of stepping in and running their country, can we actually do?"
"Military engagement is not our way."
"We do not have the stomach or the appetite for it, or indeed the wherewithal for such action."
"So what can we do?"
"As a Scot, I look with admiration at the role that Sweden and Norway, small independent Northern European countries, have played in promoting dialogue within Somalia and the parties there."
"As a humanitarian, I look with pride at the humanitarian aid we have given."
"The discussions in the newly formed international Somalia Contact Group are going to be crucial to the strategy which this motion sets out."
"The discussions in that group are the only way forward in terms of finding a solution."
"Continued engagement in dialogue, sweetened by aid to those most in need, is the European way, and in the long term that is far and away the most successful."
"Right now Somalia has taken a turn for the worse."
"Hopefully Parliament, together with the Commission and the Council, can help to bring it back on track."
"I look forward to hearing from our Commissioner as to how the Commission will spearhead those efforts, and I assure him of this House’s support."
"."
"Mr President, when considering the case of Somalia, I think it is worth taking something of a backward look into its history."
"What the West did to Somalia involved the application of every bad policy imaginable."
"Let us recall the intervention in 1993, which ended up as a fiasco."
"Germany had stationed troops there, who were meant to be supporting Indian troops, but these never actually turned up."
"We have to face up to the fact that, as soon as the troops were withdrawn, there was scarcely any interest in Somalia any more."
"Things in Somalia have now rearranged themselves."
"The coalition, whose members are described as Islamists, have, slowly but surely, achieved military dominance, and the troops that the press describe as being supported by the USA – the Warlords Alliance, that is – have been pushed further and further back."
"It is obvious that the US administration, in particular, has backed the wrong horse and now sees its own policies in virtual ruins."
"The question now arises as to what the European Union can do about this state of affairs."
"It would be quite utterly wrong to support one of the parties to the conflict on the ground, and it needs to be stressed above all that since, at the moment, Ethiopia and Eritrea have a manifest and considerable interest in using Somalian territory as a place in which to settle their differences by force of arms, it is very important that the European Union should, through diplomatic channels, make it perfectly plain to both of them that this is just not on."
"As things stand at present, I see absolutely no sense whatever in foreign military intervention in Somalia, within which there are certain regions that are stable;"
"Somaliland is one of them."
"For that reason, no troops must be sent, nor must there be any support for the deployment of them, or else we will again end up with what has come to pass often enough already, namely, the creation of a Frankenstein’s monster, for support was given to this or that grouping, which then did the very thing that it was intended should be avoided."
"I therefore urge that any action there on the part of the European Union be diplomatic in character."
"."
"Mr President, Somalia has not had effective government for more than 15 years now."
"Instead we have seen bitter and tragic civil war between warring factions, Islamic militia and factions controlled by rival war lords."
"On 4 June 2006, to the surprise of many, the Islamic Courts militia took control of much of southern Somalia, including the capital Mogadishu – partially destroyed by now – when they drove out the powerful faction leaders who had controlled Mogadishu since 1991, when the central administration was toppled."
"That has dramatically changed the political landscape in the region and the power shift has left the outside world in an unsure position as to with whom it should or could negotiate and develop a relationship."
"What is required from the EU is to recognise what has happened and to support the work to date of the Arab League, for example, which initiated a dialogue in Khartoum on 22 June between the Transitional Federal Government institutions and the Union of Islamic Courts, which controls the south."
"They have agreed for now not to fight each other and to engage in dialogue for peace and reconciliation."
"We must also support the efforts of the African Union to monitor and, if necessary, enforce peace to protect civilians."
"The truth is that serious concern exists on a number of levels."
"The first concern is what to make of the Union of Islamic Courts."
"Is it a body that can be trusted and a partner for peaceful discussion?"
"I know that the US has recently opened a dialogue with various parties about prospects for confidence-building measures."
"The other, and more real, concern is that in an effort to achieve stability and an end to violence, strict and fundamentalist Islamic law will be enforced on large populations."
"That is very worrying and the concern is well founded."
"Yesterday’s media reports of a cinema crackdown in Somalia’s Galgadud region, where two people were shot after protests following the closure of a cinema there, are of great concern."
"Also yesterday, the Islamic Courts vowed to practice Sharia Law throughout the country and, in particular, in Mogadishu."
"Sheikh Abdullah, one of the co-founders of the Union, said yesterday: ‘He who does not perform prayer will be considered an infidel and our Sharia Law orders that person to be killed’."
"That kind of language is inflammatory and dangerous."
"The EU needs to monitor what is happening carefully and be careful which sides it supports."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, for many years now the people of Somalia have been suffering the plague of civil war and this House, gravely concerned especially about the violation of human rights, has previously passed a number of resolutions on that country."
"The long-term lack of an effective government in that country has led to an anarchistic vacuum as far as central power is concerned."
"As a consequence, Islamic Courts militias and various radical factions are fighting for control of parts of Somalia, at the expense, as is inevitable in such circumstances, of the safety and well-being of innocent civilians."
"Especially worrisome and worthy of condemnation has been the recent fighting in and around Mogadishu and in the Jowhar region."
"While expressing support for the initiatives by the UN, the African Union, the Arab League and IGAD in bringing peace and reconciliation to Somalia, this joint motion for a resolution calls upon all parties involved in the cancerous internal war in that nation to strive to pursue the path of dialogue and peace and offer the necessary cooperation to the transitional federal government and Parliament as the legitimate central authorities in Somalia, governed by the framework of the Transitional Federal Charter."
"At the same time, it urges the international community and the EU to increase their help, especially through humanitarian aid to Somalia."
"One hopes that eventually this poor developing country will gradually begin to find a decisive way to much-needed peace and prosperity, for the benefit of all its citizens."
"."
"Mr President, the Horn of Africa is plagued by disastrous political failures, not just of the making of local powers, but also compounded by a series of misguided international actions and mostly inactions."
"The failed state of Somalia is just the most glaring example."
"The procrastination of the Ethiopian regime in solving the border question with Eritrea and the awful human rights, democracy and development records of the regimes in both Asmara and Addis Ababa are another sad example of international neglect of the region."
"So it is no wonder that international terrorists are taking advantage of so much conflict in such a lawless region."
"It looks as though they are getting more of what they want for their murderous purposes."
"Rumours are spreading that the government of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi is dragging IGAD into violating the arms embargo imposed by the UN Security Council in Somalia."
"He is sending hundreds of thousands of troops into Baidoa."
"Last week I was in Washington and New York and I got confirmation from important sources within the administration and the UN that preparations by the Ethiopian army to march even further towards Mogadishu are under way."
"They are backed and blessed by the US in a very misguided policy."
"It is as if the lesson has not been drawn from the latest fiasco that drove the Islamic Courts into power in Mogadishu."
"This will provide even more grounds for the terrorist actions of al-Qa’ida."
"There could be a reignition of the Eritrean-Ethiopian border conflict not just in Somalia but in the region as a whole."
"There could be more rebellions inside Ethiopia, leading to disintegration."
"The EU has to take a stand on that, and I would urge the Council and the Commission to warn against this interference and to ensure that the Somalia Contact Group be given all the support it needs to work towards a political solution that does not fail, as the previous 14 attempts have done."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has not shown enough conviction in supporting the efforts to restore peace and democracy within the institutions set up by the National Reconciliation Conference, held in September 2003 in Nairobi."
"It was at this Conference that the Transitional Federal Charter was adopted."
"The installation of the federal parliament, the election of the president of parliament and of his vice-presidents, the appointment by parliament on 10 October 2004 of Abdullah Yusuf Ahmed as president of the republic, and the appointment of the Prime Minister of the federal government were important steps, but the help and support provided by the Union was too half-hearted, and the lack of prompt action to help the population has left the way open to a resurgence of radical fundamentalism, which poses more and more of a risk because it is allied to terrorism."
"Since 1991, the civil war has been bathing Mogadishu and the neighbouring areas in blood, with devastating consequences for the population."
"In the past, global and regional terrorism, with training camps in Somalia, was responsible for the Nairobi, Dar es Salaam and Mombasa attacks, and in the past few days in Mogadishu, the Union of Islamic Courts has executed at least 350 civilians."
"We, in this Parliament, have continued for many years to stress the need for Europe to pay more attention to Somalia's problems and to its ambition to become a democratic State once again."
"A large majority of the federal parliament has given its support over the last few days to international peace-keeping forces intervening in Somalia as part of the national security plan."
"This is in an effort to respond to the Islamic courts."
"We need to be alert to the danger posed by the political destabilisation plan implemented throughout Africa by the vast network of international extremism, and of the danger posed by Osama Bin Laden's message supporting the supreme council of Somali Islamic courts and opposing the legitimate president of the republic."
"The Union and the international community must support and protect the role that President Abdullah Yusuf Ahmed is performing in his country through constant dialogue between institutions and civil society, the aim being to establish federalism in Somalia, while respecting the identities and rights of minorities."
"We call for the Security Council to partially lift the arms embargo within Somalia so that the national security forces can be legitimately strengthened, and for the international community to consolidate the East African presidents’ anti-terrorism initiative, which was created in 2003."
"Measures to counter the dangerous domino effect of terrorism throughout the Horn of Africa must be made effective."
"The Union must appoint a special envoy for the Horn of Africa and formally establish a Somali diplomatic representation in Brussels."
"There is an urgent need to speed up our efforts to support the president, parliament, the government, the judicial system and the security forces and to protect the health and lives of the Somali population."
"."
"Mr President, the rule of the Union of Islamic Courts has been established in southern Somalia."
"From the beginning of July this year, radical forces have gained increasing influence in the territory controlled by the Union."
"The new leader of the Council of Islamic Courts is Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys, a 60-year old radical Muslim cleric."
"Sheikh Aweys is suspected of working with Al-Qaeda."
"After 11 September 2001, the United States added Sheikh Aweys to the black list of international terrorists."
"Sheikh Aweys does not recognise the UN-backed Somali Government with which Sheikh Sharif Ahmed, the first leader of the Council of Islamic Courts and viewed as being a relative moderate, signed a peace treaty after assuming power in Mogadishu."
"Islamist factions have announced their intention to seize power across the whole of Somalia and there is a real danger that the Union of Islamic Courts will attack the northern part of the country which, until now, has been considered a relatively peaceful region."
"It is made up of provinces that are divided into two autonomous regions, Somaliland and Puntland, which have strategic ports along their coastlines."
"These actions would mean that Somalia would turn into another Afghanistan, ruled by the Taliban."
"The human rights situation in the territory controlled by the Union of Islamic Courts has deteriorated to a dramatic extent."
"Last week, Martin Adler, an independent Swedish journalist, was murdered at a rally organised by Sheik Aweys’ supporters."
"One of the first decrees to be passed by the Islamic radicals in Mogadishu was an order to close cinemas and halls where the World Cup was to be shown."
"Press agencies report that the Islamic military police shot two people and wounded four others during the Germany-Italy match."
"The cinema owner and a young woman were killed when the cinema where the match was being shown came under fire."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if the radicalisation of the conflict in Somalia is to be avoided, then it would be helpful if the Islamic Courts had a part to play within the country’s transitional federal institutions."
"It is crucial to strengthen the Somali institutions by acknowledging that the Courts have, at least until now, supported the system of clamping down on the so-called warlords, who were tolerated and subsequently supported by United States governments."
"The European Union should take a leading role again in Africa, just as Italy should in Somalia and throughout the Horn of Africa because of its historical precedents."
"For example, we should lift the ban on Somali immigrants entering Italy, which was something that Mr Dini wanted."
"The ban merely weakened the good relations between Italy and Somalia and made sure that Somalis dispersed to countries throughout Europe with the exception of Italy, where historical ties and responsibilities should have encouraged them to go."
"Italy accommodates immigrants from many countries with which it shares neither historical responsibilities dating back to colonial times nor cultural affinities, while it ignores Somalia."
"It would make much more sense for each European country to take on the needs of its respective former colonies, and each country would obviously also have to be entrusted with a mandate for an international protectorate over those countries."
"Mr President, I would like to express my great concern regarding the continuing civil war in Somalia."
"Somalia has not had an effective national government for over 15 years."
"This situation is a serious threat to the peace and reconciliation process in that country."
"It is also a threat to security and stability in the whole region of the Somali Peninsula."
"We have to unequivocally condemn the recent fighting in Mogadishu and the events in Johwar and in other parts of the country, which have claimed the lives of many Somali people."
"At the same time, we must appeal for no actions to be taken that might cause tensions to escalate."
"We must appeal for the dialogue to continue and for the interim federal government and parliament, the central authorities which govern Somalia on the basis of a temporary federal act, to be involved in the cooperation efforts."
"We also must not forget to provide the Somali people with humanitarian aid, aimed at helping the displaced and communities in need."
"We should therefore support all action taken to uphold International Humanitarian Law and to guarantee humanitarian aid agencies access to communities requiring aid, as well as ensuring the safety of staff working for humanitarian organisations."
"."
"Mr President, this Parliament and the Commission are certainly joined in seeking a peaceful and democratic existence for the people of Somalia."
"That has been brought out in the debate this afternoon, following Mr Smith’s original introduction of this subject."
"I hope I shall be able to respond to paragraphs 6 and 8 in particular, concerning governance and institution-building in Somalia and protection of humanitarian relief and humanitarian relief workers, as he asked me to do."
"The discussion today on Somalia is timely, as the situation of the country and the region as a whole remains very fragile."
"The Commission is very much concerned about the risk of Somalia returning to war and to chaos."
"Ever since the establishment of the Transitional Institutions in 2004, the Commission has been spearheading the international community’s efforts to support the Somali Transitional Federal Institutions."
"My colleague, Mr Michel, follows the situation very closely and is in regular contact with President Yusuf and Prime Minister Ghedi of Somalia, as well as with leaders of the region."
"I should like to focus my speech on three main aspects: firstly, the current state of play in the dialogue between the Transitional Federal Institutions and the Council of Islamic Courts; secondly, the regional dimension of the crisis in Somalia; and, thirdly, the extent of the Commission’s support for the peace process as the most valuable way to promote respect for democratic principles, human rights and the rule of law."
"Concerning the first – the current state of play in the dialogue between the institutions and the Islamic Courts – on 22 June the Transitional Federal Government and representatives of the Union of Islamic Courts met in Khartoum and reached an agreement of principle to engage in dialogue, to mutually recognise each other and to convene for further substantive talks on 15 July, again in Khartoum."
"This agreement was welcomed by High Representative Solana and by the Commission."
"The Commission takes the view that there is a window of opportunity for an inter-Somali political dialogue and it is crucial to engage the Islamic Courts with a view to reaching a political solution within the framework of the Transitional Federal Institutions."
"Confronting the Islamic Courts is not the solution: it would not only radicalise the positions of all involved but also offer an opening to the extremists to further their agenda to create an Islamic state, to introduce Sharia Law and provide a safe haven for al-Qaida cells."
"Secondly, the regional dimension of the crisis in Somalia is crucial."
"It is essential that all regional partners show unity of purpose and engage constructively in the Somali peace process."
"Destabilising interventions in Somali affairs by other countries in the region must be rejected and condemned."
"We are committed to work closely and support the initiatives of IGAD, the African Union and the League of Arab States in finding a political solution to the crisis, as Mr Coveney was asking us to do."
"The Commission intends to anchor Somalia in a broader regional strategy for peace, security and development for the Horn of Africa."
"The outline of that strategy was presented by Commissioner Michel to the IGAD Heads of State last February."
"Finally, the Commission is the main donor for Somalia, with an ongoing overall aid programme of EUR 300 million."
"We have supported the Somali National Reconciliation Conference and the establishment of the Transitional Federal Institutions and are now committed to further enhancing the functioning of the Transitional Institutions."
"On 28 May 2006, President Barroso and Commissioner Michel signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Transitional Federal Government."
"I can confirm that the Commission intends to make EUR 22 million available immediately to support the short-term governance and capacity-building priorities set out by the Transitional Federal Government."
"We remain unequivocally committed to supporting the peace process."
"The Commission’s humanitarian arm, ECHO, is also providing direct relief assistance to the civilian population affected by the fighting, as well as by the consequences of drought."
"Everyone has a responsibility for ensuring the safe delivery of that humanitarian assistance and providing the safe custody and security of the humanitarian workers, all of whom are involved in this very valuable work."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of this afternoon’s debates."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Mauritania(1)."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite being an ACP member state, Mauritania is one of the world’s forgotten countries."
"For too long, the countries of Europe turned a blind eye to the dictatorship of President Ould Taya, who imprisoned, tortured and banished opponents of his regime."
"Parliament and the European institutions remained silent when we submitted a request for an observation mission to be dispatched during the 2003 presidential elections, even though some candidates were being held in prison."
"The Union was overcautious following the events of 3 August 2005, which brought down the dictator, without a single drop of blood being shed, even though we knew that the country was on the verge of exploding."
"I am pleased that I organised the first discussion platform in 2004 at the European Parliament, gathering together, on neutral ground, Mauritanians from civil society, political parties and official representatives in an effort to pave the way for democracy."
"We are paying tribute today to the Union, which supports the democratic process on which Mauritania has embarked, on the basis of a public consensus behind the Military Council for Justice and Democracy."
"Pledges have already been made by this transitional authority, with the creation of an independent national electoral commission, with the abolition of media censorship and with the organisation of a referendum, on 25 June 2005, the smooth running of which was hailed by international observers."
"I am also pleased that the Union has committed itself to sending a long-term observation mission to monitor the elections taking place this November, thus ensuring that every Mauritanian citizen can exercise his or her voting rights."
"Finally, the revenue from oil exploitation must be used for education, health care and the development of the peoples of Mauritania."
"The exploitation of oil, which will not last forever, must not be done in a manner that is detrimental to marine and coastal biodiversity, but must protect the Banc d’Argouin, for example, from all forms of pollution and ensure that the fishery resource, which is so important to the people of Mauritania, is managed in a sustainable way."
"I am pleased that the authorities, together with the Union, have embarked on a more open debate on the fishing agreements with a view to reaching a fair agreement."
"The ban on factory ships such as the ‘Atlantic Dawn', for example, is a prerequisite for reaching such an agreement."
"Finally – and here I conclude - the anti-immigration cooperation project must help to create jobs in Mauritania and to give migrants a reception that is worthy of the values espoused in Europe."
". – Mr President, the press is now talking about Mauritania in terms of its being a model for democracy in Africa, and the EU has officially re-established relations with it, but is the situation really that good?"
"It certainly is not!"
"That there is to be a referendum in Mauritania on a new constitution, and, in particular, that the President’s powers are to be limited by it, are things to be welcomed, but, according to the information available to us, there is still slavery in Mauritania, and that is utterly unacceptable, and something must be done about, not least on the part of the EU."
"The name of Mauritania also comes up whenever discussion turns to the way the European Union deals with refugees, a very large number of whom are sent there, where they are left to their fate."
"The EU is making its defences against refugees more and more military in character – the Frontex agency is one example of this."
"Major military manoeuvres recently took place in Cap Verde; the plan had originally been that they should be held in Mauritania, and the reason why they were not was that France objected."
"I have had sight of the scenario for these manoeuvres, which do indeed have something to do with repelling refugees."
"The UNHCR has since noted that no checks on individuals’ refugee status are now carried out in such places as Lampedusa, where refugees from Mauritania are living, and the concept of what are termed ‘safe third countries’ is now being introduced, the eventual effect of which will be that refugees will not be able to get into the European Union in the first place."
"We must therefore insist on help being given to people in need."
"What the EU is currently doing is building up what amounts to a deportation machine, and it must not be allowed to get away with it. Help must also be given with the ongoing democratisation of Mauritania."
"."
"Mr President, taken together with Morocco, Mauritania constitutes an ancient culture, one that for centuries traded heavily with Europe and can boast highly-developed literature and traditions of well-organised trade, chivalry, large-scale agriculture and early forms of industry and craftsmanship."
"It has always enjoyed a flourishing culture, much of which one can sense there even today."
"This makes it all the worse that some of us Europeans should have completely forgotten this country."
"I hope that we will now give more attention to Mauritania, and not just because of the refugee situation, difficult though that indeed is, or because of the discontinuation of the fisheries agreement."
"I believe that this is a country that deserves our full support."
"The referendum was a strong indication of a democratic trend in a country that is an important bridge between the Mediterranean and West Africa and has enough to contend with in the shape of natural disasters and challenges to be faced, in doing which it has developed an astoundingly innovative talent for agriculture."
"I am also at one with those who argue that this country, with its natural reserves and maritime resources, is one that needs to be handled with great care, but that must not, contrariwise, mean that we want to plunder its waters of their treasures, on which the country is dependent, while also being dependent on the extraction of certain raw materials that occur there and constitute virtually its only source of income."
"The policy we apply in this respect must, then, be a very careful one – one that will build up Mauritania’s abilities to help itself, enable it to emerge from the state of being an often grossly exploited country and return to it its proud and ancient tradition of independence in a new and democratic form."
"This can be accomplished only if the powers of its President are limited, if the records of voters and residents are improved, and if truly democratic elections can be held with all Mauritania’s people participating in them on an equal footing."
"."
"Mr President, at last the Republic of Mauritania appears to be gradually and delicately beginning to move towards the eventual restoration of democracy and respect for human rights."
"So far the transitional authorities in the country are seen to have kept their promises as regards the timetable for elections and the referendum conducted last month, despite the difficult practical problems, showed an overwhelming electoral majority in favour of urgent and vital constitutional changes."
"The transition towards democracy is fully supported by the newly formed political parties and by civil society and there seems to be, at least in principle, agreement to allow the return of refugees from neighbouring countries to which they had fled, justifiably fearing for their safety."
"If they are properly managed and corruption is kept at bay, the new petroleum resources being exploited in Mauritania offer the possibility of providing financial wealth for the benefit of the general population, especially in fields such as health and education."
"This joint motion for a resolution aims primarily to offer support to the people of Mauritania in their difficult and eagerly awaited transition to democracy, in the hope that this worthy goal will be achieved amicably, peacefully and within the expected time parameters previously agreed with all the parties concerned."
"."
"Mr President, on 3 August 2005, the regime of the former President Ould Taya was overthrown, with a military council declaring its intention to put a stop to totalitarian practices and to establish democracy."
"One might therefore imagine that these are merely declarations designed to justify what the international community referred to as a coup d'état."
"Then, it quickly becomes clear that not a single drop of blood has been shed, that the transitional authorities have begun talks with all of the political parties and civil society, have set out an electoral timetable and have taken the unusual step of deciding to stand in the next elections."
"One therefore has the feeling that something is happening in Mauritania and that this might be an opportunity to free this country from the dictatorship."
"From now on, our role consists in supporting the democratic process under way while respecting the timetable that the people of Mauritania have themselves set out."
"In this connection, I am delighted at the way in which the last constitutional elections were held. I support INEC, which must nevertheless ensure that every Mauritanian citizen can obtain his or her identity papers so as to be able to vote in the next elections and that Mauritanians living outside the country can take part in future ballots."
"I also support the political parties’ having the means to express themselves and to campaign on electoral platforms that act as a vehicle for proposals designed to improve the circumstances of the people of Mauritania."
"."
"Mr President, when you hear of yet another putsch in Africa, you tend to think it is about one autocrat replacing another and carrying on plundering the country; fortunately, though, what happened in Mauritania after the putsch of 3 August 2005 appears to be something different."
"It is not just that things went to a timetable, with a constitutional referendum in the June following the putsch, and elections now expected to be held in November, but also, everything has been done in agreement with all the political stakeholders, the Military Council, the transitional government and with the institutions – such as the independent electoral commission – that have been set up."
"That in itself I regard as pretty remarkable, and a joint delegation from the ACP and the EU went there to review what was going on, affording a good example of how North and South can come together to consider problems and conflict situations."
"Now that we have completed the Article 96 process with Mauritania, I would like to see us making aid fully available again, but we do have to take care that income from the oil reserves, which were plundered as a result of a contract with an Australian firm, appears as income in the country’s budget, so that the resources it possesses really can be made available to the people."
"We have already heard what the key issues are."
"There are refugees who must find their way back home."
"There are others who must get back to their economic activities in various sectors, and I hope that we will all join together in supporting this country as it continues on the road ahead."
"Now in particular, at a time when it appears to be on the right track, we must not lose sight of the need to encourage all the interested parties not to deviate from it."
"."
"Mr President, at the risk of repeating what others before me have said, I too should like, on behalf my group, to stress the importance of what is currently taking place in Mauritania and to point out that since the coup d’état, about which several Members have spoken in this House, Parliament has never focused on the situation in this country, which has been somewhat abandoned by us all."
"I therefore believe that this resolution comes just at the right moment, at a time when an important democratic process has just got under way in the country."
"What must be stressed above all today, with this resolution, is the will of the European Union, and of our Parliament in particular, to pay attention to the situation in Mauritania and to the way in which it is evolving, and to help, as much as we can, to implement and to pursue the democratic process since, on 25 June 2005, in fact, it was possible to hold the constitutional referendum."
"There are still, of course, a number of duties to be carried out on Mauritania's part; as Mrs Carlotti mentioned a moment ago, the electoral register, in particular, still needs to be completed, a duty to which we refer in the resolution."
"It also remains for Parliament, for its part, to support a request coming from the Mauritanian authorities, namely that an election observation mission be sent by the Commission to Mauritania for the forthcoming elections: the legislative and municipal elections in November and the presidential elections in March."
"I believe that this is important and that Parliament and the Commission must take the necessary initiatives on this matter."
"."
"Mr President, following last year’s coup d’état the EU decided to open consultations with the Islamic Republic of Mauritania under Article 96 of the revised Cotonou Agreement."
"The opening meeting was cordial and constructive."
"It was attended by representatives from Mauritanian political parties and civil society, who were given the opportunity to air their points of view, and by a group of ambassadors from ACP countries."
"Mauritania gave 23 undertakings in the areas of respect for democratic principles, fundamental freedoms and rights, the rule of law and good governance."
"A further undertaking was also given regarding monitoring and reporting."
"At the opening meeting, the Commission encouraged the Mauritanian authorities to ensure the widest possible registration of voters in the country and abroad, as well as participation in the constitutional referendum and in the several elections due to take place during the transition period."
"The Commission also encouraged the creation of an electoral level playing field through the adoption of equitable mechanisms of party financing and the guarantee of impartial behaviour by the military, the transition government, the administration and the judges."
"The Commission invited the transition authorities to take account of past problems, the most important of which are the sequels of slavery and the consequences of the inter-ethnic violence of 1989-1990 that led to loss of life and property and to the departure to neighbouring countries of tens of thousands of Mauritanian citizens."
"While recognising that the duration of the transition period will not allow the new authorities to solve all problems, the Commission encouraged them to take decisive action in all those areas."
"The undertakings given by Mauritania have, in the Commission’s opinion, addressed all the main problems that the country is facing."
"Their formulation by the authorities was largely based upon the conclusions of the October 2005 National Consultation Workshops, which benefited from the participation of all stakeholders and reflected a broad national consensus."
"Progress in the implementation of Mauritania’s undertakings allowed the EU to recognise that steady progress had been made and to conclude the consultations at the end of May 2006."
"However, given the measures still to be put in hand, the EU will conduct an enhanced political dialogue with the government over an 18-month monitoring period."
"In that context, the deployment of electoral observation missions for the forthcoming elections is foreseen and a first evaluation mission by the Commission will indeed take place next week."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of this afternoon’s debates."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on freedom of expression on the Internet(1)."
". Mr President, I would like to begin by reminding you of the declaration of the World Summit on the Information Society, which took place in Tunis in November 2005 and which attached great importance to the information society in terms of human rights and fundamental freedoms and in particular freedom of expression and of opinion, as well as the freedom to receive and have access to information."
"That is why it is so sad and regrettable that today we have to point out that dozens of people are in prison in various countries of the world, though particularly in China, simply because they wanted to communicate and express themselves via the Internet."
"Nevertheless, although there is no doubt that the censoring governments are mainly responsible, we must always remember that, in many cases, western companies, many of them European, supply those governments with the instruments and capacity to be able to carry out their control and censorship."
"This is true of companies such as Yahoo, Google, Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Telecom Italia, Wanadoo and certain subsidiaries of France Telecom."
"For all of these reasons, the intention of this Resolution is to roundly condemn the restrictions to freedom of expression that certain governments impose via the Internet, and in particular the acts of persecution and detention that some of them carry out."
"We therefore expressly call upon the Council and the Commission to raise this issue in their bilateral meetings with the countries mentioned in the Resolution, particularly China."
"Secondly, we want to call upon the Council and the Member States to make public, through a joint communiqué, their commitment to protecting the rights of Internet users and to freedom of expression on the Internet."
"Thirdly, we call for restrictions to be placed on certain companies that make profits in certain countries at the expense of curtailing human rights."
"In summary, in today’s world, one way to promote and respect human rights is to guarantee freedom of expression on the Internet and to prevent censorship, persecution and imprisonment."
"We must therefore call upon the Commission and the Council to take account of the need to pay attention to these particular issues, including when drawing up their aid programmes."
"."
"Mr President, not everywhere in the world is access to the various media open to everyone; it is often the case that the Internet offers opposition elements the only chance of getting their position across to the public, and recital C of this resolution expresses that very well, although we must of course ask why this is so."
"All this has a great deal to do with media concentration; for example, there are very many people who find it absolutely impossible to get access to television or newspapers."
"The resolution is critical of the censorship of the Internet that goes on in certain countries, and that is very much to the point, but it is another example of what happens in this House very often, in that we point the finger only at the others, without considering the situation in the European Union itself."
"Censorship of the Internet is not a good thing anywhere, not even in the Member States of the European Union."
"Let me give some examples of what I am talking about."
"In Germany, the Chaos Computer Club has been subject to recurrent repression over recent years, and there are, for example, such sects as Scientology that have taken legal action to close down sites that examined them in a critical way."
"The two particular pretexts for censorship that are adduced are, on the one hand child pornography and on the other right-wing extremism, but, although both are deserving of forthright condemnation, child pornography is criminalised throughout the world, and those who, wherever they are, access such sites make themselves liable to prosecution, while right-wing extremism – one example of which is what Mr Giertych came out with in this House a few days ago – is something we have to deal with politically."
"It is also very important, when considering the Internet, to point out that search engines are now adapting their power to the rules, so that certain material no longer shows up when they are used."
"What is going on here is piecemeal commercialisation, so that only certain content – which has been paid for – can be found on webpages."
"What must be spelled out in plain language is that there must be no censorship of the Internet in the European Union, and that means, too, that the Commission must do something about this and banish such censorship from the European Union."
"."
"Mr President, this resolution is a broad one attempting to deal with global access to the web, which is a huge issue."
"It welcomes the statement from the world summit in Tunis last November on the prime importance of the information society for democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular freedom of expression and opinion, as well as the freedom to receive and give access to information."
"The reality is, of course, that the web provides a fantastic vehicle for change in countries that have to date suppressed freedom of expression and frustrated democracy."
"For that reason, the Internet is a real headache for totalitarian dictators and governments, who go to great lengths to restrict and prevent its free use."
"This resolution uses strongly worded language and condemns a number of countries who are openly attempting to restrict and censor information over the web, referring to them as enemies of freedom of expression."
"Many of these countries continue to imprison persons who are referred to as ‘cyber dissidents’ and we call for their immediate release."
"This is particularly the case with China, and we have named a whole series of people involved."
"The resolution also tries to deal with the more sensitive issue of involvement by Western, and specifically US and European, technology and companies in providing the capacity for certain governments to censor and filter Internet material."
"The great firewall of China is perhaps the starkest example of such censorship."
"The Chinese authorities have successfully persuaded companies such as Yahoo and Google to allow filtering of their search engines."
"For example, if one types in Tiananmen Square in China, one is likely to get an architectural history of the buildings around the square."
"We call on the Commission to put together a voluntary code of conduct, working with rather than lecturing to companies operating in repressive countries, in an effort to reduce the capacity to prevent freedom of expression."
"."
"Mr President, countries such as China and Cuba, Burma and Belarus – and the resolution names dozens of others – are placing tighter and tighter restrictions on the use of the Internet, and it is understandable that they should do so, for if there is anything that is a vehicle of free expression of opinion, that serves the opposition and the development of opposition to totalitarian states, then the Internet is it, and Internet service providers have always made a great thing of the freedom, specifically of information, that the Internet affords."
"Yet it is quite often American and European ISPs that make it easier for free expression of opinion to be interfered with by, for example, agreeing to allow their services to be censored."
"American companies, for example Google, Microsoft and, in particular, Yahoo, have, in China, stirred up a hornets’ nest."
"A number of other companies have, of course, been doing the same thing: Secure Computing and Fortinet in Tunisia and Burma, Cisco Systems too, but European firms are also among them, examples being Telecom Italia in Cuba and Wanadoo – which belongs to France Telecom – in Tunisia."
"It is of course intolerable that Western businesses should be helping repressive governments to trample human rights underfoot."
"The first thing to be done is for the European institutions to draw up a code of conduct in which they undertake not to have a hand in actions aimed at repressing what goes on online."
"It must also be stressed that businesses providing search, chat, publishing or other services on the Internet must do everything they can to ensure that the rights of consumers to use the Internet are fully safeguarded."
"In China, there are now 48 cyber-dissidents behind bars, simply and solely because they deviated from the path through the Internet mapped out for them by the authorities."
"It is, to my mind, unthinkable that Western businesses should give active assistance to these repressive and authoritarian regimes by maintaining censorship."
"That sort of collaboration runs counter to fundamental European values such as the free expression of opinion and freedom of information."
"Free expression of opinion must remain a priority on the Internet, indeed, on the Internet in particular."
"American legislators are working on a , and it goes without saying that Europe cannot stand on the sidelines."
"Even if we insist on legislation, I would prefer to see an attempt made at working out a code of conduct in order to see what we can sort out with the companies in question."
"We must also make it perfectly clear what we stand for."
"At the end of the day, of course, the problem does not primarily lie with the Internet companies, but with the repressive regimes themselves."
"Trade and communication with such countries can often have a beneficial influence, and of that I am, generally in favour, albeit not, of course, if we allow these regimes to bully us as regards what we trade in or what we communicate."
". Mr President, in our globalised society, the Internet is a fast and user-friendly means of communicating among individuals or in a group, of buying and selling, of accessing information and of creating material."
"The Internet has become an open global public space in which everyone is, in principle, free to move around and to express him or herself."
"The World Summit on the Information Society has placed fundamental human rights at the core of the information society."
"The fact is, we are not all equal when it comes to freedom of expression on the Internet, and some States have begun to ban citizens, journalists and others from expressing themselves."
"Worse still, Reporters without Borders has made an alarming finding concerning Internet repression and reports that a very large number of Internet users are being held in prison, particularly in China."
"Our resolution enables us to take a strong stand against these attacks on people’s freedoms and to condemn the States that carry them out."
"We call on the Council and the Commission to demonstrate the same rigour in their international relations and their aid and cooperation programmes."
"Yet, we also want to appeal to the responsibility of businesses, particularly European ones, which, by providing technologies or services, are more or less involved in these acts and which ought to commit themselves to subscribing to a code of conduct preventing them from playing a part in censorship, in repression and in persecution."
"We cannot advocate freedom of trade while refusing to protect individual freedoms."
"The Athens Forum on Internet governance, scheduled for November, must enable the European Union to put the recommendations from this resolution into practice."
"."
"Mr President, the resolution which the European Parliament is to adopt today is really a resolution on defending freedom of speech, which forms the basis of any democratic society."
"We might dare to say that the Internet protects this freedom better than any other medium."
"However, the governments of many states are trying to influence online content."
"The Internet is viewed as a wild and dangerous river and there are legislative initiatives in many states aimed at regulating its current."
"By the same token, however, these states are unfortunately running a serious risk of restricting freedom of speech."
"After all, a PC and a printer can become a printing press which could be used to print pamphlets, public notices or even whole books destined for unofficial circulation."
"A computer connected to the Internet is nothing more than a radio tuned to ."
"Moreover, it is an interactive radio, where anyone can express their views and make comments."
"It is a serious threat to any totalitarian country or any country that restricts access to information to a certain extent."
"It is only possible to censor individual pages on the Internet."
"It is impossible to censor the whole network but the temptation or threat to do so still exists."
"The Chinese Government, for example, has created an Internet police force which checks whether any of the dozen or so million Chinese Internet users have infringed the network usage regulations."
"Any infringement may result in up to 10 years in a labour camp."
"The owners of Internet cafes employ monitoring staff to check whether any banned content appears on the users’ screens."
"This content is filtered using keywords."
"If the words ‘Tibet’, ‘dissident’ or ‘China and human rights’ appear, the page is then blocked."
"The Internet, which is fundamentally anarchic by nature, is a thorn in the side of governments and bureaucrats, who are not absent from cradles of democracy such as Europe and the United States, either."
"We should remember that the long-standing struggle between freedom and censorship never ends and that it is also a battle between good and evil."
"We have to remember that the freedom the Internet gives us also brings with it the danger of spreading antidemocratic and immoral information."
"."
"Mr President, freedom of speech and opinion are fundamental values enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"Freedom of speech should be guaranteed, irrespective of the way in which views are expressed."
"The Internet has, in recent years, become a new, universal form of communication."
"According to current estimates, there are around 600 million Internet users and this figure is increasing on a daily basis."
"The Internet is a medium which allows freedom of expression."
"This freedom also extends to groups such as human rights campaigners, democracy activists, political dissidents and independent journalists."
"As it is an open forum, it also contributes to the growth of democracy, something that was observed during the World Summit in Tunisia in November of last year."
"However, not everyone likes such an open medium."
"Governments that are accustomed to controlling the press, the radio or the television now want to control the only independent medium which keeps slipping out of their grasp, namely the Internet."
"China, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Nepal, Cuba and Belarus are using increasingly sophisticated methods to control and restrict freedom of speech."
"What is worse, companies such as Yahoo, Google and Microsoft are agreeing to censorship at the request of governments, as is currently the case in China."
"This situation is unacceptable."
"Freedom of speech is an inalienable right."
"We have to act to prevent any attempts to restrict it, including on the Internet."
"We have to create a net management system where only illegal activities, such as the dissemination of child pornography or other forms of abuse, will be restricted."
"To restrict freedom of speech on the Internet is to muzzle those who speak uncomfortable truths, which are a part of the very values that we have to defend in particular."
"."
"Mr President, I think there are controls and controls."
"We pass laws every month for controls and limits that protect the vulnerable."
"Restricting pornography that uses or targets children should not be seen as an affront to true freedom."
"As a mother, I believe that robbing children of their innocence is a crime."
"Indeed, the Christian gospels say it is worthy of a millstone around the neck."
"For a child, abuse, whether it is at the hand of a lecherous adult or the Internet, becomes a psychological millstone that blights the child for life."
"With the use of technologies like MRI and chemical screening, we now know that pornography alters children’s developing brains and stimulates the production of highly addictive brain chemicals."
"Researchers have even likened the long-term use of Internet pornography to the devastating effects of heroin."
"We must do what we can to make the Internet safer."
"If Yahoo and Google can censor the web to suit a totalitarian Chinese Government, they can certainly censor the web for the benefit of our children."
"When discussing Internet censorship, it is easy and satisfying to be able to condemn a dozen or so countries spread across a few continents."
"However, I am afraid that, other than making ourselves feel better, our actions will remain purely symbolic."
"Perhaps we should look at the facts, particularly those which relate to European countries and companies."
"Let us take Belarus as an example."
"It is a neighbour of the European Union and a typical enemy of online freedom."
"If we mention Belarus in the same breath as the Maldives or Nepal, we will not be helping any of these countries in practice."
"If the Italian company Telecom Italia is the network operator in Cuba, then the Communist regime censors freedom of expression with this European company’s agreement."
"If a branch of France Telecom decides to introduce broadband services together with a Tunisian operator, this move takes place at a time when the Tunisian Government is cutting off access to all opposition Internet sites in that country."
"These are the facts."
"Let us not use avoidance tactics such as discussing issues over which we can only exert a moral influence."
"Let us focus on issues we can influence in practice."
"Mr President, thanks to science and technology, mankind has begun to conquer space and has walked on the moon."
"We have also created wonderful communication tools such as the Internet."
"However, we should remember that technology has also been used to commit millions of murders, acts of moral corruption and those which destroy human dignity."
"Thus, although science and technology are undoubtedly good in themselves, they, like all human activities, should be constantly subject to monitoring, limits should be established and ethical principles should be followed."
"These principles allow us to distinguish good from evil, which does not have to mean limiting expression."
"Modern technological problems extend far beyond the scope of technology and become moral problems."
"We should encourage real freedom, namely freedom from evil, and not wilfulness and lawlessness which destroy and demean humankind."
"There are many examples of dangers that result from the Internet."
"The ones which cause most outrage and that are most serious are Internet sites which feature child pornography and those with paedophile-oriented content."
"They reflect how rapidly and how low mankind can fall."
"."
"Mr President, the motions for resolutions on freedom of expression on the Internet propose the means to promote access to the Internet free of repression by national authorities."
"These suggestions concentrate on measures to improve Internet governance and fight human rights violations."
"The World Summit on the Information Society held in Tunis in November 2005 reaffirmed the links between the development of the Information Society and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of expression and opinion, as well as the freedom to receive and access information."
"This consensus reached during the summit is a basis for us ‘to prevent and counteract threats, risks and limitations to human rights posed by the misuse of information and communication technologies’ as outlined in the Commission’s communication of April 2006 on the summit follow-up."
"In this communication, the Commission ‘encourages the companies concerned to work on a code of conduct on this crucial issue, in close cooperation with NGOs’."
"This code of conduct would constitute an important step towards inspiring these countries to establish respective ethical standards."
"The promotion of freedom of expression figures highly on the agenda of the Community’s corresponding external assistance programmes, in particular the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights."
"This will remain unchanged in the coming years under the new financing instrument for democracy and human rights."
"Furthermore, we have a policy of bridging the digital divide between rich and poor countries."
"The more Internet use spreads, the more difficult it becomes for repressive governments to control it, despite the whole panoply of censorship methods."
"The Commission is actively promoting the summit’s recommendations in this area."
"Before concluding, let me add a few more words on Internet governance."
"The Tunis Agenda called for the establishment of a forum for multi-stakeholder policy dialogue, the Internet Governance Forum, which will first meet at the end of October in Athens."
"Europe should play a central role in this process."
"I am therefore hopeful that the European Parliament will take this opportunity to launch this dialogue with the representatives of European civil society before the Athens Forum."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of this afternoon’s debates, that is to say in a moment."
"Firstly, I would like to praise this proposal for its timeliness."
"As electronic communications spread rapidly, it is really very important to focus attention on freedom of expression on the Internet as well."
"Freedom of expression is an important issue."
"It must obtain in all circumstances, although at the same time we need to remember that freedom of expression carries with it a special responsibility."
"We have to ensure that the Internet does not contain material which conflicts with humanity, human rights and democracy."
"We need to be especially concerned about children and young people, who are our society’s most valuable asset."
"They represent today, and the decision-makers must try and ensure that they can use the Internet to obtain relevant and appropriate information and avoid anything that runs counter to values which are enduring and which protect human life."
"Freedom carries with it a responsibility."
"That is worth remembering at a time when the main theme in society often seems to be worthlessness."
"The next item is voting time."
"Mr President, my oral amendment is to avoid ambiguity in recital C. I propose to insert the word ‘unfortunately’ between the word ‘whereas’ and ‘Somalia’ and to replace the words ‘with a view to restoring order’ with the words ‘with a view to taking charge’."
"That is in an effort to ensure that nobody would interpret recital C as justifying the setting-up of radical Islamic courts with a view to restoring order."
"I hope that the other groups will agree with the PPE-DE Group on that issue."
"I believe it is a sensible and understandable oral amendment."
"Mr President, that has to do with the last paragraph, in relation both to Somalia and Mauritania."
"I would ask that the resolutions we adopt should, in so far as they relate to Africa, be addressed to the Panafrican Parliament as well."
"Mr President, what has just been said about Somalia should apply in exactly the same way to Mauritania."
"That concludes the vote."
"The origin marking of a product represents the strength and the transparency of the product, a guarantee for the consumer and a necessary act of protection with regard to a nation’s work and its businesses."
"The protection of European products (at least when this is entrusted to the clarity of markings, of production processes and of all those guarantees on products that a consumer has a right to know about and that, if you will, are also ethically necessary) is also crucial to the ‘fair competition' that precisely the dominant criteria of the ‘free market' (which should therefore be free, but properly competitive) require."
"Origin marking is not in itself a sufficient guarantee of the above, but it does at least represent a first step."
"Making origin marking compulsory, as what we are discussing here provides for, is only a first, crucial step in protecting against those products that are flooding the European market, competing unfairly with our products and causing damage to our businesses and our work."
"The traceability of a product – the complete transparency of the production process would be better – and an appropriate acknowledgement of the quality and the research and also of the craft and industrial traditions of the nations of Europe are also guarantees designed to protect consumers, as well as European businesses and industries."
"That is why I voted in favour of the new regulation, even though I must stress that I regard it merely as a first step."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 6 July 2006."
"Ladies and gentlemen, several events have taken place since we were last together before the summer. I would like to mention them in order to provide a context for our work and in order to inform you of the activities of Parliament’s bodies over the summer."
"Firstly, the war in Lebanon: given the tragic events that were taking place, I felt that Parliament could not remain on holiday and had to react."
"I therefore called an extraordinary Conference of Presidents of political groups that was held on 20 July."
"That Conference of Presidents approved a clear statement that was considerably more vigorous than that of the Union’s Foreign Affairs Council that had taken place beforehand on 17 July."
"In it, we called for an immediate ceasefire in the region; we were also the first to call for an international force to be deployed within the framework of the United Nations, with significant European Union participation."
"The chairmen of the political groups called unanimously for the Union’s institutions and Member States to speak with one voice. Unfortunately, that did not happen."
"On 1 August, in view of the continued escalation of violence and the attacks against civilian populations, the Conference of Presidents held another extraordinary meeting, this time open to all Members of Parliament."
"That Conference of Presidents roundly condemned the attacks on civilian populations, such as those that had just taken place against the Lebanese town of Canna."
"We again appealed to the Council to call for an immediate ceasefire."
"In accordance with the resolutions of that Conference of Presidents, I negotiated a statement by the Bureau of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, which was published on 7 August – a statement unanimously approved by the members of that Bureau, the Presidents of the Parliaments of Tunisia, Egypt and Greece and myself."
"It was the first time that European and Arab political leaders had expressed a united position on this crisis."
"On 24 August, the Bureau of the EMPA met in Brussels; it had previously summoned all of the MEPs who are members of that Assembly."
"The EMPA Bureau approved a statement that called for European participation in the intervention force and decided to send a delegation to Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian Territories."
"Finally, on 25 August, as you know, the governments of the Union’s Member States decided to respond to our appeals for action and also to the appeals to them from the United Nations to send a significant contingent of troops from European countries to operate on the ground."
"As you will appreciate, these meetings had to be called at extremely short notice and not every Member who might have decided or wished to take part in them could be notified of them in time."
"I regret that we had to hold those meetings so quickly and I am therefore delighted that we have included a debate on this issue on this first agenda."
"Everyone is aware that this is the biggest military mission the European Union has ever undertaken, that it represents a challenge in terms of our political credibility and that, in addition to our role of peace keepers in an area that affects us very directly, the Union has the opportunity to support diplomatic action throughout the region and to relaunch the peace process between Israel and Palestine."
"The second issue that has kept us busy over the summer is the influx of illegal immigrants from Africa, particularly on the shores of the Canary Islands and Lampedusa."
"I have been in constant contact with Commissioner Frattini, whom I would like to thank for the decisions he has taken and for the impetus he has given to cooperation amongst the countries of Europe in resolving certain cases of illegal immigration that are particularly dramatic from a humanitarian point of view."
"We should be aware, however, that 10 000 people have arrived in Lampedusa this summer and 20 000 in the Canary Islands – almost 2 000 just yesterday. That figure is four times higher than last year and hundreds of people have died at sea trying to cross it."
"We must also be aware that those people do not want to stay in Lampedusa or in Lanzarote. They want to get to Europe."
"What is happening there therefore affects all of us. It affects Europe as a whole, in terms of both its immigration policy and its development policy."
"I would like to draw Parliament’s attention, the attention of all of us, to the fact that we are not dealing with an emergency of an exceptional nature which only arises from time to time: we are dealing with a structural problem that is going to become more serious every summer because the income and demographic differences between Europe and Africa will increase this immigration, and Europe must respond by implementing a policy of development in Africa and cooperation amongst the European countries, to this end implementing a common immigration policy."
"Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I must point out that, as you know, this summer we have also seen the preparation of an attack on an immense scale against the airlines linking the United Kingdom and the United States, reminding us that we are still facing the threat of terrorism."
"We have also been reminded of this by the fatal attacks in Turkey, in which European citizens have lost their lives."
"This must increase our efforts to tackle the phenomenon of terrorism, using acceptable methods that respect our freedoms."
"During this part-session, on Thursday, we will have the opportunity to debate the sensitive issue of the personal data of passengers on commercial flights, which is still of concern to us."
"In this regard, I must inform you that Ireland has appealed against the Directive on data retention, and this calls into question the delicate balance that we had achieved between Council and Parliament."
"These are the events that will characterise the work that Parliament must do from now on."
"It is my sad duty to inform you that not everybody will be here for the parliamentary work we are beginning today."
"One of us will be missing, our Hungarian fellow Member, István Pálfi, who died on 15July at the age of 40."
"A member of the Group of the European Peoples’ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Pálfi demonstrated his parliamentary commitment through his active participation in the Committee on Regional Development and in the Delegation to the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee."
"At the time, I sent a message of condolence to his family on behalf of all of you, and a book of condolences is now available at the front of the Chamber for those Members who wish to leave a personal message."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to observe a minute’s silence in memory of our fellow Member, István Pálfi."
"The final version of the draft agenda, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting on Thursday 31 August pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed."
"The following amendments have been proposed:"
"I have received a request from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to replace the item on Zimbabwe with an item on Transnistria."
"Mr President, the situation in Zimbabwe is, of course, a dreadful, tragic and disastrous one, but, since there have – unfortunately – been no new developments on this front, it would be perfectly possible to replace this item in this part-session by the item on Transnistria, where, on 7 September, there is to be a referendum, with the possibility of the situation there being made considerably worse."
"Those Members who argue that this is not solely a human rights issue may well be right, but the situation in Transnistria does have to do with the human rights of those who live there, and do so under dire conditions."
"I would therefore ask that we should, on this occasion, consider Transnistria rather than Zimbabwe."
"It might be possible – if you, Mr President, agree to it – for the chairwoman of the relevant delegation to say something more about this by way of justification."
"Does anybody wish to speak in favour?"
"As the leader of the Moldova delegation, I would indeed suggest that we should show our solidarity with Moldova by emphasising first of all that we are following international law and secondly that we in this building continue to be of the opinion that, according to international law, separatist Transnistria has no possibility or right of secession from Moldova."
"We recognise Moldova within its borders."
"This will send a very important signal to this country, so I once again sincerely request that we attempt to take a preventive approach."
"This will also show that we have set a precedent in our House, in the sense that we do not follow behind events, but are confident in our position and demonstrate that in a precautionary manner."
"Mr President, I would not deny that Transnistria is a very important issue, but it merits a debate in this House on Tuesday or Wednesday."
"It should be a full debate within this House, because this is a key issue connected with the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"Regrettably, on Thursday afternoon, half the Members will not be here to debate this serious issue."
"My argument, therefore, is that – as has been agreed by the PPE-DE Group – we should maintain the human rights debate on Zimbabwe, where there is an appalling humanitarian situation under Mr Mugabe, and we should have a full debate on Transnistria at the next plenary part-session."
"I note that we are beginning the parliamentary year with a disagreement between the two largest groups, and that is just as it should be."
"We shall clear it up by means of a vote."
"The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"Mr President, the fortnightly retrial in Libya of the five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor – ongoing since 13 June – resumes again tomorrow."
"This House has been consistent in its support for and action in defence of those people."
"In particular I should like to thank the President for his intervention in this case with the Libyan authorities at the beginning of July."
"I am appalled that the Libyan prosecution has again called for the death penalty during the most recent court hearing on 29 August."
"Reports from recent meetings indicate that the retrial will be concluded within a few months."
"We have heard that before."
"Three months have passed already, and this has been going on since 1999."
"I should like to call upon the Commission and the Council – and again upon you, Mr President – to redouble diplomatic efforts with the Libyan authorities in order to bring this matter to a speedy and just conclusion, with the immediate release of the Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor."
"We shall do so again."
"All of the European institutions, and in particular the Presidency of Parliament, will do everything they can to help resolve this unfortunate issue."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to discuss the situation in Slovakia."
"It seems to have been forgotten that, following its victory in the election, the Direction – Social Democracy Party (Smer) formed a government coalition with the extreme right Slovak National Party (SNS)."
"At the beginning of August, this red-brown coalition gained the support of the members of the Slovak Parliament."
"In July, I took the opportunity to express my concern and disapproval regarding this coalition, which are shared by many of my fellow Members, but the Prime Minister, Mr Fico, did not follow up on our request to reconsider whether such a coalition was appropriate."
"Unfortunately, recent events have shown that our concerns were well-founded."
"Members of the Hungarian minority were recently attacked for speaking Hungarian, and the leader of the SNS, Mr Slota, has continued to make xenophobic and nationalistic speeches."
"By agreeing to this coalition, Mr Fico has left the door open to such outbursts, and there is a fine line between words and actions."
"Politicians need to demonstrate responsibility; making alliances with extremists who hold these kinds of views will necessarily have harmful consequences."
"For me, the violence we are seeing today is a cruel reminder of the darkest days of Europe’s pre-war history."
"Russia has realised that NGOs are the best way to influence public opinion."
"Such organisations and foundations have become quite common throughout the states of the former empire."
"By using its favourable situation in the global energy market, Russia is able to allocate more funds for propaganda campaigns."
"To this purpose, a special Euroregion Livonia-Baltic foundation has already been established with representative offices in Estonia, Latvia, Belarus and the Kaliningrad region."
"The official aims of this foundation include promoting business relations and cultural cooperation between the Baltic States, the Kaliningrad region, Belarus and Ukraine."
"However, the founders of the foundation initiated by Russia are already known for their blatant actions against the construction of spent-fuel storage facilities at the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant."
"The EU, while encouraging democratic processes in the post-soviet countries, is jeopardising its initiative in the information war."
"I have already invited the European Parliament, and I am doing so again, to more actively promote the democratic process in the post-soviet countries and clearly express its opinion on the anti-western propaganda in the EU’s eastern neighbours."
"Mr President, with all the nuclear power stations we have in Europe, we are all in greater danger than we think – in Denmark, too, which has in fact declined to adopt nuclear power."
"Take the Swedish nuclear power station, Forsmark."
"The person formerly responsible for security there, Lars-Olov Höglund, has said of this power station that it was pure luck that it did not go into meltdown at the beginning of this August."
"He calls the situation the most dangerous since Chernobyl."
"It was also a week before either the Swedish public or operators of similar power stations in other countries were made aware of the event."
"In general, details of the safety of nuclear power stations and of the requirements imposed on them by the authorities are not available to the public."
"That this is the case in Sweden’s otherwise very open society is, of course, also somewhat alarming."
"There is a lack of information where nuclear power is concerned."
"The important lesson to be learned from this episode is that nuclear power is not safe and never will be."
"It creates huge problems and, to top it all, undermines democracy."
"We must ensure that we put a stop to this development as quickly as possible."
"– Mr President, 12 September will see the eighth anniversary of the unjust detention in the United States of America of Antonio Guerrero, Fernando González, Gerardo Hernandez, Ramón Labañino and René González, Cuban patriots whose sole motive was to protect their country from falling victim to terrorist attacks promoted and carried out by Miami-based organisations."
"It should be noted that, in the opinion of the United Nations Working Group looking into the case of these five Cuban citizens held in the United States of America, their trial did not take place under objective and impartial conditions, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta deciding unanimously to annul the verdict handed down in Miami."
"These eight years have been characterised by illegal acts, unacceptable punishment, pressure and blackmail, and breaches of human rights; for example, the US Administration has not allowed the wives of René González and Gerardo Hernandez to visit them."
"Mr President, justice must be done by putting an end to this cruel and inhuman situation. These five Cuban patriots must be released and their convictions overturned."
"Mr President, the Union for Europe of the Nations Group requested an oral question in the debate on forced labour camps on Italian soil whose inmates included Polish nationals."
"This item was not included and I would like to ask you to include it in the next plenary session."
"The matter is incredibly important."
"We are dealing with a blatant case of slavery."
"People have even been killed in these work camps in the heart of Europe."
"There are signs that this is a more widespread problem that also affects other Member States."
"We have adopted hundreds of resolutions on human rights violations in various countries throughout the world, and yet here we have a serious infringement of human rights in the European Union itself."
"We should deal with this issue as a matter of priority."
"The European Parliament should call for Member States to address the issue of foreign workers."
"Mr President, I appeal to you and to all my colleagues from other political groups to look into this matter."
"Mr President, it is said that the EU project has no greater ambition than to see the destruction of nation states and to have unwanted and unrealistic federal fantasies imposed upon them."
"There is an EU programme called Interreg – detailed in the British press today – which demands the setting-up of ‘transnational regions’."
"These include parts of Europe that are not even part of the EU: the southern part of Norway is in one such region; northern Norway and Iceland is another."
"Perhaps this is one reason why Iceland has decided not to even think about joining the EU for many years to come."
"My question is, who asked the bureaucrats to spend time considering such stupidity?"
"You will be distressed, however, that these crazy folk have fallen foul of the law of unintended consequences."
"They have hastened the day when Britain says goodbye, for, as Winston Churchill once said, ‘Up with this we will not put’."
"– Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating you on the victory of Spain's national team in the World Basketball Championship."
"Of course, you must not think that you beat us Greeks; we let you win the match because we have connections with your royal family."
"That is why we gave the game away."
"You spoke earlier of illegal immigration in the Canary Islands."
"We have the same problem daily in the Aegean."
"Borders have not been defined due to relations with Turkey and so, every day, we have several such illegal visits to Greece."
"We are a country of 10 million inhabitants, 2.5 million of whom are illegal immigrants: one in four inhabitants in Greece is a foreigner."
"It is an unbelievable figure."
"We are a country with deficits – the only country in Europe with deficits."
"We have the worst unemployment and we have 2.5 million people below the poverty line."
"Please relieve us of this burden and we do not mean with policing measures; we must give the countries which immigrants leave the best economic support we can, so that they stay at home."
"Mr President, over the last few weeks we have seen the sorry spectacle of the EU dithering, this time while Lebanon burned."
"There was, eventually, a derisory offer of 200 peacekeepers from France – even Bangladesh managed more than that, and quicker!"
"Remember the tsunami?"
"The US had 150 helicopters and a battle fleet on their way within hours, and the EU held meetings."
"The Balkans: NATO was on the ground sorting out the mess, and the EU held meetings."
"This grandiose, self-styled supranational government finances the people who voted in Hamas terrorists and now threatens Polish shipyards with closure."
"But you will not face up to Iran!"
"Some summer recess!"
"Mr President, over the summer I took the opportunity to be briefed by some of those in industry in my region."
"When I met the leaders of the milk industry – the representatives of the farmers who produce milk in Northern Ireland – I was somewhat disturbed to find that the reduction by the European Union of the export refunds on milk powder, as well as other export refunds, has driven the price received by the farmers in my region to an all-time low."
"If this is not reversed, then, quite frankly, the European Union will be guilty of putting the dairy farmers in my region out of business."
"That is totally unacceptable."
"I ask the Commission to take this on board immediately, before it is too late."
"It is not too late to put together a restructuring package for the industry."
"The worst thing about Europe is that we always act when it is too late."
"If we act now, we can act in time."
"Mr President, in mid-July, Belarus, the State located right at the very centre of our continent, pronounced a verdict on Alexander Kozulin, a leader of Belarusian Social Democratic Party who dared to challenge Alexander Lukashenko in the presidential election."
"He was sentenced to five and a half years of imprisonment."
"The country chairing the European Union has announced a declaration not only on behalf of 25 Member States, but of 12 other European states as well, calling for the immediate release of Alexander Kozulin and other political prisoners."
"I have just talked to Irina, the imprisoned man’s wife."
"She said that she was allowed to see her husband only once a month and that he suffered from worsened vision, heart weakness and flare-up of osteochondrosis."
"I am positive that following its recess, the European Parliament should react to the first conviction in Belarus, which was based not on a mock criminal act but on a political offence – for the so-called ‘incitement to mass disorder’."
"I think that the President of Parliament and the political groups should express their opinions, if possible."
"The regime in Minsk does not expect any sharp reactions from Europe to this and similar situations."
"This should not be the case."
"I would like to say a few words regarding Ján Slota's announcement about adopting a principle of zero tolerance towards Roma people, because all summer I have been thinking about how important it is for us to finally talk about the insults being cast at the Roma."
"Ján Slota asserted his anti-Hungarian and anti-Roma views with impunity during the election campaign in Slovakia this spring more and more vociferously, a fact which we have drawn attention to on a number of occasions."
"This widely known nationalist party leader, who is deliberately inciting anti-Roma sentiments among the Slovak population with his unconstitutional and prejudiced utterances, has already taken up his duties as a member of the Slovak Government, as a coalition partner."
"Similar utterances during Meciar's government had almost irreversible consequences for Slovakia's Roma population."
"According to estimates, there are currently 800 000 Roma living in Slovakia under very difficult social and economic circumstances."
"The most important task facing the country and the government is to put an end to the Roma’s exclusion."
"However, they fail to do so."
"The current political atmosphere is justifiably frightening and uncertain for the Roma population and other minorities living in Slovakia, who suffer direct or indirect prejudice every day."
"However, these typical utterances from Ján Slota cannot be allowed in a democracy under any circumstances."
"Mr President, over the past few weeks our Slovakian friends have informed us of a number of aggressive acts and provocations targeted at people from the Hungarian and gypsy minorities."
"The incidents involved physical assaults and offensive insults written on banners at a sporting event."
"For example, a young woman from the Hungarian minority was brutally beaten for speaking on her mobile phone in Hungarian."
"These cruel acts have shocked the Slovakian-Hungarian public, as there have been no such atrocities over the last eight years."
"These alarming outrages against the minorities are completely against the European Union’s ethics and principles, which Slovakia guaranteed to abide by when it joined the EU."
"In the European Union there is no room for acts that threaten the peaceful coexistence of minorities, especially if these acts are incited by governments or politicians."
"I ask that we take steps together against the extreme anti-minority remarks made by certain members of the Slovakian Government so that they do not provoke any more aggressive incidents."
"If we want to stay loyal to the Union’s principles and to respect individual and collective human rights, we must act immediately before the atrocities lead to tragedy."
"Mr President, I would like to return for a moment to the matter of seasonal workers in Italy."
"Dozens of people are indeed thought to have disappeared."
"It is likely that they have died."
"I would like to support Mr Wojciechowski’s proposal."
"However, I would also like to strongly emphasise that the Italian police are collaborating with the Polish police."
"This cooperation is unconditional, as the governments of these two countries are also working together."
"I would also like to join those who would like to ask the European Commission and the governments of the Member States to check whether this was an isolated case."
"If so, then let it be the last."
"Let us pay more attention to the issue of temporary work, especially seasonal labour, in our Community."
"I would also, very briefly, like to ask for a positive response to the idea of providing public aid for the shipbuilding industry in Poland, which has undergone radical reforms."
"I would like to ask the Commission to adopt a positive stance on this matter."
"Mr President, this weekend there was a fire at a plant in Caldas de Reis in Galicia that stored chemical products."
"As a result, toxic substances were discharged into the river Umia."
"The Galician authorities reacted immediately and took emergency action aimed at controlling the spillage, guaranteeing the water supply to the people of Salnés and protecting the natural and seafood wealth of the ria."
"In a short space of time, action was taken effectively in an excellent spirit of cooperation amongst the administrations."
"I would like to send a message of support and solidarity from the European Parliament and call upon the Community’s authorities to monitor the process and assess whether any initiative or proposal for Community protection against these risks is appropriate."
"– Mr President, on 27 August, this season's 14th Formula 1 Grand Prix was held in Istanbul."
"At the end of the race, the trophies were awarded by the self-styled 'president' of the pseudostate, Mr Talat, in his capacity, according to the Turkish organisers, as 'president of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus'."
"According to the rules of the International Automobile Federation, trophies may only be awarded by the head of state or the prime minister of the country or the president of the federation."
"This, therefore, is a case of political scheming on the part of the Turkish Government, as Mr Talat does not hold any of these three offices."
"Even Mr Yialtsintas, the President of the Chamber of Commerce in Istanbul which organised the race, stated to the newspapers that this act was premeditated because the race was an unexpected opportunity for Mr Talat to be promoted."
"I therefore ask you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, how long we are to stand and watch these excesses by the Turkish authorities which, apart from insulting our intelligence, are an insult to the values of honesty and transparency promoted by the European Union."
"– Mr President, I am rather confused."
"We are currently in the middle of the Belgian municipal elections, and I have seen Commissioners getting actively involved in the election campaign."
"I know that, in the previous Parliamentary term, Commissioners were required to remain uninvolved;"
"I do not know whether this requirement still applies, or whether the Rules of Procedure have anything to say on this subject, and so I do not know whether I should register my indignation at these practices."
"We shall pass your question on to the Commission."
"Mr President, I want to raise with Parliament the deteriorating situation in Darfur."
"Tension is building up very seriously and a large-scale military confrontation is threatened, as thousands and thousands of Sudanese troops are now moving into the region with trucks, bombs and guns."
"We also face a massive humanitarian catastrophe, as the hard-line Sudanese junta absolutely refuses to accept the UN troops, as agreed by the Security Council last week in New York."
"We face competing pressures on the budget and I would hope that this Parliament will remain faithful to the view that Darfur should not drop out of our set of priorities at this crucial time."
"Could I also ask you to contact High Representative Solana to ask him to make urgent representations to the Sudanese, and to the African Union to make sure that the latter’s mandate can be extended until such time as that United Nations force can be deployed in this tragic region of Sudan."
"Certain vulnerable parts of the world attract more attention from the international community than others."
"Increasingly, there are also various individuals with a pronounced humanitarian calling who are attempting to draw attention to the horrors and injustices of the world."
"One such individual is Tomo Križnar, a citizen of the Republic of Slovenia and the European Union, who travelled to Chad and later Sudan as the Special Envoy of the President of the Republic of Slovenia."
"His intention was to help the Sudanese people and alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Darfur."
"During his visit to Sudan, Tomo Križnar followed the refugees in Darfur and reported the situation in Sudan to the world."
"On 19 July of this year the Sudanese authorities detained Tomo Križnar on alleged charges of espionage and illegal entry to the country."
"He was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment, a fine and deportation."
"According to the latest, as yet unofficial reports, he has been pardoned."
"This encouraging result is due to the efforts and commitment of Slovene diplomats and international support."
"I should like to thank the European Union in particular for its help in securing his release."
"Despite the fact that Tomo Križnar has been pardoned, I call on European politicians to continue to pay attention to Darfur, especially as regards of human rights violations and the severe humanitarian crisis in the region."
"– Mr President, over recent years we have witnessed a constant increase in the rate at which forests are destroyed by fires, especially in southern Europe."
"In Greece, we have had serious fires: in Halkidiki, which is perhaps the most important and beautiful tourist spot in Greece, approximately 60 000 decares were burnt."
"This is a major blow to the environment, tourism and farming."
"We need:"
"- firstly, compensation for the victims."
"Europe is the state, the organisation of solidarity and must act as such;"
"- secondly, we need direct protection from the risk so that the soil is not washed away;"
"- thirdly, we need prevention for the future."
"Here we must examine the matter in depth to see how we can plant species which do not burn as easily as pine trees;"
"- fourthly, we need to examine how we can stop ecological deterioration, because the greenhouse effect is the reason why fires are increasing."
"We have a duty to protect the environment and man."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, often speaks of a Europe of results, but he seems to be referring exclusively to economic policies."
"I would like to ask the Commission to be equally ambitious when it comes to fundamental rights."
"I am thinking of a number of incidents in particular that took place this summer, when gay people wanted to go out on the streets and demonstrate for gay rights."
"In a number of cases, those gay pride marches were banned and the authorities failed to protect the marchers’ rights."
"There have been other cases of homophobia, for example, involving the Minister for Education in Poland."
"I am very surprised to see how reluctant and timid the Commission is when it comes to such incidents, which are clear violations of fundamental rights."
"I would like to ask the Commission to make use of Article 7 of the EU Treaty, which makes it possible to start an investigation into such incidents – I am not even talking about sanctions – but I would like there to be an investigation to see if these ministers can be held responsible for violations of fundamental rights."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a representative of the Slovak Republic I would like to take this opportunity to condemn and apologise for the attacks committed recently against persons belonging to national minorities."
"At the same time, however, I would like to emphasise that the Government of the Slovak Republic is thoroughly investigating the incidents that have occurred in the Slovak Republic; the Minister of the Interior has briefed the relevant parliamentary committee on the progress of these investigations and I also want to assure you that in its declaration the Government of the Slovak Republic has clearly declared and emphasised that it will adhere to, support and promote all civil rights, including the rights of national minorities."
"The Lebanon crisis has highlighted a new situation in the Middle East."
"Iran has emerged as a major player supporting the terrorists in Iraq, Lebanon and Palestine, supplying them with high-tech Russian weapons and striving to have its own weapon of mass destruction."
"The power behind all this is absolutely irresponsible."
"Let us remember Stalin, who said on the eve of attacking Poland: ‘We need a big war to reach our goals’."
"Iran is heading in the same direction without even explaining anything."
"Now we are sending forces to Lebanon that will not act against the aggressive Iran-Syria-Hezbollah axis but rather merely take part in a play directed by others."
"If we are afraid of saying that neither Iran nor other states refusing to recognise Israel must be in these forces, our behaviour is immature."
"The European Parliament must adopt a conceptual resolution."
"– Mr President, according to articles in the Greek press, the six biggest Greek banks, which account for over 80% of the Greek banking market, reported net profits of EUR 1.6 billion during the first six months of 2006."
"This is a 64% increase compared with the same period last year."
"The unprecedented profitability of this sector is the result, among other things, of high interest rates in the retail financial services sector."
"As the European Union has rightly identified this sector as a target sector of its unification policy, I should like to point out – and this observation is directed at the European Central Bank – that specific and effective measures need to be taken to achieve greater convergence of retail interest rates in the eurozone."
"Several groups in the European Parliament, as well as the socialist party groups, expressed their concerns over the coalition formed in Slovakia in the summer that included one party leader who has been making hate speeches for years as an incitement against minorities."
"Unfortunately, their fears have come true."
"The hate speeches made by this nationalist party leader let the genie out of the bottle, and have given encouragement to extreme nationalists, who have already physically assaulted members of the Hungarian minority on a number of occasions."
"This is the first time in the last decade that such attacks have occurred in Slovakia."
