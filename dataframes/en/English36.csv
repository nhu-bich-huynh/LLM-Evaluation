"I do think you should take a closer look and see Parliament as the partner you will need if you are to be able to successfully and consistently put the case for this joint project of ours to the Council."
"We find ourselves today talking about a situation that has long been a reality on the ground."
"It has, in the meantime, become the norm for goods, just as much as people, to be able to cross the borders at will, at whatever time and in whatever manner."
"This freedom on the ground must actually have originated in the heavens, as it seems far less problematic to set down borders in the sky than to remove them on earth."
"Things have turned out differently now, though, and the public, the people who fly frequently, have expectations that are all the greater and all the more pressing; it is they who are telling us to at last get on with politics and sort matters out."
"It is the fact that the present position is simply unsatisfactory that prompted our desire for a Single Sky."
"Let me make that clearer by giving some examples."
"The situation in Europe today is that one out of every four flights is delayed."
"A proportion of the delays can be attributed to the fact that airspace is overstretched, and it is overstretched because we have this catastrophic situation with a fragmented sky."
"Every year, 350 000 flying hours are wasted because the direct route goes over military areas which may not be overflown, which means that aircraft have to fly by circuitous routes."
"We also have the situation today in which there are 41 blocks of airspace in 15 EU Member States."
"I always like to illustrate that by the example of an airline pilot who, on a flight from Rome to Brussels, has to fly through nine different blocks of airspace, meaning that he has to report in and out nine times."
"Misunderstandings are of course always possible and linguistic problems can crop up, so if anyone tries to tell me there are no additional potential hazards here, he is off beam."
"This makes it clear that we must make a long-overdue change here."
"I see these proposals as likely to give the sky a new architecture, create functional blocks of airspace and thereby ensure that, on the one hand, we increase capacity - which the increase in air traffic makes urgently necessary - and on the other, we enhance safety by minimising potential dangers from the outset, are able to reduce costs and so make flying cheaper and, finally and particularly, that we do the environment a favour by cutting at a stroke the 350 000 unnecessary flying hours to which I have already referred."
"So we have our eyes on the right objective, but I will also say that I am sure there are a number of points we could subject to critical discussion, and I know that one or other of my fellow-Members of this House has doubts about whether this or that is the right way to go ahead."
"In the Committee, we tried to add certain things."
"One I will mention is an industry consultation body, as we felt it was right that both the users and the manufacturers should be more involved in the project, to prevent us coming up with something that later proves unusable, or, on the other hand, from requirements bearing no relation to the products that come on the market."
"The fact is that, as well as the fragmentation represented by the 41 zones in the sky, Europe is fragmented in the field of technology."
"I believe that our technologies must also be modernised and harmonised as soon as possible."
"Like Mr Stockmann, who tabled an amendment on the subject, I would have liked us to go a step further by creating a European supervisory authority and removing this area much more from the nation states."
"I know that to be, at the moment, a chimera, but my relative youth gives me hope that we will today take the plunge and take an important second step by declaring our desire for a Single European Sky, deciding on the political objective, and then going down the road the Commission has pointed out to us."
"Thus we may hope that, at some point in the next ten or twenty years, there really will be a Single European Sky with a European supervisory authority, which will of course safeguard national interests."
"So I ask you to vote for these projects by a large majority."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 'and yet it does move' - European air transport policy, I mean."
"There are obviously so many pressing problems that Spain and Great Britain have given up their decades-old blockade in the Council."
"That is a great step forward for Europe."
"The Single Sky project has a significance in terms of European airspace comparable to that of the introduction of the euro for the European economic and monetary area."
"I only hope that there is just as much awareness of the problems involved and willingness to resolve them, as the devil is well known to dwell in the details."
"We can already see quite divergent national interests girding their loins to jeopardise the ambitious objective of making this project a reality by 2004."
"The reports by Mr Fava and Mrs Sanders-ten Holte show the necessary will to resolve the problems, and I hope that the House does as well."
"I would also like to say something about a number of core issues that have had a part to play in the discussion and which seem to be important."
"I still find it hard to understand why the sharing of responsibilities between the Community and Eurocontrol has not been resolved in a truly definitive way."
"Things still need to be done in that area."
"My second point is that the Commission was quite right to refer to cooperation between civilian and military authorities, but this does not, in my view, go far enough, since, in the final analysis, there is still an intrinsic need for their air traffic control services to be fully integrated."
"This area calls for more than what the Commission has proposed."
"I am aware that this would of course require an ongoing discussion in the institutions, one that would encompass the Common Foreign and Security Policy and not relate solely to transport policy."
"Thirdly, the provision of air traffic control services calls for independent national supervisory authorities, which would, in the final analysis, need to be institutionally separate from the service providers."
"As my colleague has pointed out, we would prefer it if we already had a European supervisory authority, but the time for that does not yet seem to have arrived."
"Fourthly, we need clear procedures for authorisation and appointments and transparent rules on charges."
"I would ask you, at the present time, not to let yourselves be tangled up in a discussion as to whether air traffic control requires State or private-sector service providers, or else the whole project risks being brought to a standstill, as we have seen happen with public transport."
"That would be harmful."
"It is safety that is in the foreground and has priority, along with the facilitation of integrated air traffic control services appropriate to the functional blocks of airspace."
"My fifth point, which is at the heart of the whole structure, follows from that. We need the creation of functional blocks of airspace."
"The Commission's description of how we get there is, however, incorrect and inadequate."
"Here, the need to rid the skies of the small-state mentality means that there is still a need for improvement."
"We have 26 subsystems, 58 monitoring systems, and different equipment."
"That is superfluous and, as has already been said, increases the likelihood of error."
"Safety must be the highest priority."
"Mrs Maes, your report is one that I cannot but fully support."
"There are scarcely any objections to it on the part of our group."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, I would like to start by saying that the debate in committee was lengthy and in-depth, and so the amendments accepted were not random but were the fruit of lengthy discussion."
"I too would like to thank the three rapporteurs, who have done an excellent job, and I think I can say that Parliament's support for the Single Sky was confirmed both in the discussion in committee and in today's debate, which have proved a constructive contribution to the creation of the Single Sky."
"However, if we want 2004 to remain the date for the introduction of this new airspace model, we will need, in my opinion, to pursue dialogue within the Council, particularly with those countries which are still sceptical - some of them are downright against the idea - and with the countries whose internal systems are in most need of modernisation, and here I am thinking of the problems which are clearly going to arise with enlargement, which is now imminent."
"I have noticed a political theme emerging during the course of the debate: the perpetuation of the myth that the Single Sky is an attack on the sovereignty of the individual States."
"It was even said in committee that it is an attack on the physical sovereignty of States over their territory."
"I feel it is important to make it clear that this myth is completely unfounded and that it is, of course, contrary to the spirit of the Treaties, but I fear that it is even becoming an issue in high-level negotiations."
"Dialogue is also necessary - as a number of Members have said - with the trade unions, which I believe are voicing the legitimate concerns of the people, particularly as regards the more sensitive points relating to the concept of public service or service of general interest, especially where controls are concerned, which is clearly a sensitive issue."
"I feel we must stress, as has already been done, that liberalisation, which is absolutely essential in this sector, does not mean privatisation, that competition, although as wide as possible, must, of course, take into account the essential safety requirements."
"We therefore need to increase capacity to deal with the huge volume of traffic, while, as I said, increasing safety and making air traffic control less fragmented by using new technologies, not least, and resolving the still pending complex issue of integration with military systems, for I feel that this is a political matter which does need to be addressed."
"One of our guiding principles must be to create new airways which will prevent congestion in certain airspaces, for we are now faced with saturated routes and a huge increase in costs caused by delays and the enormous amounts of fuel consumed."
"I believe that the Single Sky will bring an efficient, effective system for the European citizens."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for the creation of the Single European Sky is a complex issue, one that I, personally, still find rather ambiguous."
"I think, however, that Mr Fava and Mrs Sanders-ten Holte have done a considerable amount of work, given the size of this report."
"From the outset, in order to understand the full implications of this matter, I took the time to work with the industry."
"Only last Thursday, I spent the morning at the Roissy air traffic control centre and the afternoon at Athis-Mons, which is Europe's third largest air traffic control centre after Maastricht and London."
"From this experience, I have come to believe that - in spite of the fact that the rapporteurs and the Commission have taken a number of points into account - what is being proposed today still presents serious dangers."
"I would like to thank the RET Committee for having incorporated a series of amendments that I had proposed so that more attention is paid to safety."
"I also feel it is very positive to include an amendment specifying that each Member State is free to appoint a public or private entity as its operator or operators, although I do believe that air navigation services represent a service of general interest and that competition rules cannot apply to them, as the European Court of Justice has in fact ruled."
"Unfortunately, even though these amendments were adopted, this has not, in my view, significantly changed the liberal undercurrents of the draft text."
"I shall try to explain what I mean."
"All the amendments proposed by my group, which clearly ruled out introducing competition in the air navigation sector, were rejected in committee."
"Even so, the House must still reflect on the fact that the air traffic control trade unions are united on this issue."
"Everyone in the industry - although there are, quite naturally, differences of opinion between the various parties - is coming to the same conclusion regarding the dangers of the current proposal."
"Yet, we are not talking about staff who are attached to so-called privileges and who are unable to accept change: the very job of an air-controller involves constant development and change."
"The current system is far from perfect."
"In addition, it is already cross-border in nature."
"Everyone is aware that cut-off points do not, generally, begin and end at borders."
"There are other reasons for this apart from air traffic control."
"The current system of course needs to be improved, but in my view, there are other problems, particularly that of the ultimate objective."
"The ultimate objective should, indeed, be the priority."
"There is also a problem regarding method."
"No reform of the air traffic control system will succeed without the help of air traffic controllers who are responsible for maintaining high safety standards in Europe."
"In addition, it was possible to bridge the gap - a very considerable gap between the extraordinary growth in air traffic in recent years and improving traffic flow - due to the increase in air traffic controllers' productivity, not to mention the significant investment made to upgrade equipment."
"The search for standards that everyone in Europe can apply is an essential goal for the Union and, from this point of view, the European Commission can certainly play an extremely important role in providing harmonious organisation and effective control."
"Although the proposal for a regulation treats safety as a priority, I believe that all the proposals seeking to place the regulation on an economic basis run counter to this affirmation."
"Whatever forms, and they all differ considerably, are chosen by the Member States, the proposal to introduce competition in air navigation services by casting doubt upon the integrated system, including all the technical services, would be detrimental to navigation and it represents a tangible danger to safety."
"It is true that there is a link between safety, capacity and costs, but to purport to establish high safety standards by taking the economic question of cost as a priority and by referring to it above all else is, at best, illusory and, at worst, misleading as to the goal of maintaining high safety standards."
"Obviously, the flow of air traffic and its safety are dependent on a chain, all the links of which are essential."
"If the chain is broken, we risk seriously compromising safety."
"That is why, to put it frankly, if the texts do not make significant changes on these crucial issues, I will be unable to support them in their current form."
"Mr President, I very much welcome the proposals before us today, which are clearly designed to tackle delays caused by air traffic control problems in Europe."
"These delays are taking place on many flights because of the difficulties with air traffic systems in Europe."
"These systems need to be modernised and centralised so as to guarantee that flights are not delayed because of air traffic control deficiencies."
"We have all seen surveys that show that air traffic is going to increase in the coming years."
"The objective of the Single European Sky proposal is to ensure that air traffic management systems are designed, managed and regulated in a harmonised way within the Union and with the highest possible level of safety."
"I come from an island nation with a high dependence on air transport and improved efficiency in these transport models is extremely important to enable future economic development to take place in my country."
"At present there are 73 air traffic control centres in the pan-European airspace, which all operate under different codes of classification."
"Air traffic management in Europe is fragmented and the current system is not able to keep pace with the demand, which results in delays in many flights."
"In the European Union we need to establish effective and binding regulatory arrangements to solve this problem sooner rather than later."
"On a separate but not unrelated matter, a conciliation process is going to begin shortly in relation to the issue of the new EU regulation concerning the establishment of common rules in the field of civil aviation security."
"This conciliation process must reach an effective agreement."
"We need to ensure the introduction of a 100% whole baggage screening process at all airports in Europe. We must also guarantee that the necessary staff training is put in place to make these changes work."
"Improved security is not a cheap exercise and one of the issues that has to be addressed at the conciliation stage is agreeing exactly who is going to foot the bill for the implementation of the new anti-terrorist security arrangements."
"At present the financing of anti-terrorist security measures for air transport differs from country to country and between transport models."
"We cannot continue to accept this situation."
"Mr President, airlines and passengers are facing a number of serious problems, which the combined management of the airspace above Europe should be able to resolve."
"Increased efficiency and handling rates should reduce delays, environmental pollution and avoidable costs to a minimum."
"We are confronted with a number of complications, prime among which, in my view, is the division between military airspace and civil corridors."
"It is up to national and military authorities to take up the challenge to end this division."
"Safety should be at the forefront of our minds during the liberalisation of navigation services."
"Nobody benefits from lower costs that result in a higher risk for travellers and staff."
"This is why we endorse the emphasis which Mrs Sanders-ten Holte places on this aspect."
"The standards for the various services should be as uniform as possible, preferably at global level and at least at European level, where we should draw on the expertise and experience of organisations such as ICAO, Eurocontrol and soon also EASA."
"I would ask that special attention be given to the enforcement of these standards."
"In many areas, sound legislation breaks down as a result of insufficient monitoring and enforcement."
"An adequate draft and implementation of this inspection and enforcement also make it possible for enterprises other than strictly public ones to offer navigation services."
"Finally, time, capacity and safety all require an improvement in the current situation as a matter of urgency."
"I hope that the Commission can keep to its ambitious time schedule, which should never be at the expense of the quality and safety of drafts, however."
"In our view, the rapporteurs have sufficiently called attention to this in their reports, which we can endorse accordingly."
"Mr President, both the explosion in air traffic in recent years and the saturation of Europe's skies mean that a number of measures to reduce congestion are needed. One of these measures should be improved regulatory coordination between the European countries."
"From this perspective, the Commission's Single Sky initiative which aims to provide a safer and more fluid airspace appears to be based on the obvious."
"Yet, the obvious seems much less clear, however, when you study the practical details of the project and when you realise that there is already a body that regulates air traffic, Eurocontrol, which has a great deal of technical expertise and covers a much wider territory than that of the Union, since its membership includes 31 countries of the continent."
"In this respect, there is a considerable discrepancy which, in truth, the texts presented by the Commission do not mention."
"This discrepancy is fully evident even in Article 1 of the regulation laying down the general framework, as it is stated that the Community shall be given the means necessary in order to create the Single European Sky whilst taking into account Eurocontrol's task in establishing a pan-European airspace."
"Further into the text, the issue of coordination between the Commission, which represents the Community, and Eurocontrol, does not become any clearer."
"This could be summed up in one sentence: who gives the orders and who is has the last say in drafting the regulation?"
"Although the text attempts to suggest the opposite, we can only see one possible answer."
"It is Eurocontrol that gives the orders, which the Community must obey, alongside Member States which still have the most important role."
"We feel that the majority of Member States share the same view."
"We must maintain Eurocontrol and its prerogatives and we must, therefore, firstly clarify the prerequisites of regulatory relations with this body."
"Failure to do so will risk complicating matters rather than simplifying them."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Maes on a very competent and excellent report."
"Consideration of this subject is long overdue and I am grateful to the Commission for bringing it forward."
"The problem of third countries' aircraft and their safety standards has been of great concern to many people, particularly Eastern European airlines and maybe even further east than that."
"The Commission's directive has sought to resolve this problem by introducing a large number of ramp inspections and inspectors to do spot-check inspections on these aircraft as they land in the European Union."
"That is one way to do it."
"There is another way we could have approached this, but I am not going to complain."
"I would just like to say that the way the Commission has proposed is a massive job creation programme for aeronautical engineers and technicians."
"I myself am an aeronautical engineer so I should not be complaining about this."
"But it is going to create a number of jobs at the Community airports where people will have to go and do spot-check inspections and ramp inspections."
"An alternative that I might suggest for future consideration is to actually upgrade technical and maintenance facilities in third countries and give them support and aid so that they can upgrade their own technical specifications and maintenance facilities to a standard that is internationally acceptable."
"That is what the United States has been doing, particularly with African countries."
"This is good for exports and good for the United States aviation industry in that it provides a long-term opportunity to sell its goods and services."
"It is also a way of getting its equipment into place around the world - the Boeing-Airbus agreement, I suppose."
"There are, of course, a number of issues relating to Community air transport which we need to look at."
"Might I be permitted to raise a very important issue for the British MEPs coming to Strasbourg?"
"We get thrown off flights, even with fully confirmed tickets."
"Air France has done this repeatedly; yesterday two of my colleagues with confirmed tickets were thrown off because the flight had been overbooked."
"That is against international rules."
"It is also - and the Commissioner might wish to write to the president of Air France about this - a criminal offence for a Member of Parliament to be prevented from coming to Parliament in Britain."
"There is such a thing as a European arrest warrant, which we understand is now going to be put in place."
"I am raising these issues so that we may act before it is too late."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although I do of course agree with the basic idea, I feel that, when it comes to the question of a Single European Sky, which is a very complex issue, we should look very carefully at local parameters and anyone advocating the privatisation of air traffic control and management will need to come up with some pretty persuasive arguments."
"We also need to make arrangements, in conjunction with the military sector, in order to protect its decision-taking powers on defence issues and ensure that current common foreign policy and defence levels are not exceeded."
"Clearly, several questions have arisen which require further clarification."
"For example, on the question of national sovereignty, each Member State will be required to hand over the planning and control of its airspace to a central agency and this may cause numerous Member States constitutional problems."
"This needs looking into."
"Likewise, despite the initial opinion of the Council's legal services, airspace above international waters does not appear to have been covered."
"For countries such as Greece, but not just Greece, this is a very serious question because, without airspace continuity, technical and institutional problems will arise and we may end up with different systems operating within a single Member State."
"This will complicate daily operations and thwart the very flexibility which is the whole purpose of the exercise."
"Even the involvement of the military sector in this overall exercise has not been clearly safeguarded with respect to national security issues, i.e. second pillar issues."
"And then there is the, in our view, equally serious question of the legal basis for the proposed regulations which, by their very nature, appear to warrant more than just Article 80(2) of the Treaty, given that this is not just a transport issue."
"To conclude, I feel that if the most serious of these concerns are to be entertained, the right of defence and security enshrined in national legislation must be clearly safeguarded when we introduce the Single European Sky we all want."
"Thank you and my especial congratulations to the Commissioner and the honourable Members for their excellent work."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start by thanking the rapporteurs for their excellent work in drafting these important reports."
"They have taken different points of view into consideration and have achieved a balanced whole."
"The aims of the regulation package before us to improve the viability of air traffic are especially welcome."
"The reforms are necessary to keep the costs of air traffic down, reduce the number of delays and increase capacity."
"As has been said here many times, it is very important to improve traffic safety."
"There is broad consensus on these goals."
"There are whole areas in the regulation where opinions in Member States have differed."
"These include consideration of the military dimension, the provision of services, functional airspace blocks and relations with Eurocontrol."
"In taking a decision consideration must be given to the needs of national air defence."
"These could be ensured by means of a safeguard clause."
"The Member States must furthermore retain the power in the future to decide the provider from which it is to acquire air navigation services."
"With regard to the provision of air navigation services, the regulation proposes the possibility of establishing supranational airspace blocks."
"That would give national authorities a choice when procuring services."
"The recent EU decision to apply for membership of Eurocontrol, the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation, was a necessary one."
"After accession the EU will be able to use the powers of decision of Member of States in those matters in which the organisation is involved which concern all Member States."
"Eurocontrol's foremost objective is specifically the improvement of traffic flow and safety."
"The harmonisation of air navigation systems and the control of traffic flows will contribute to this."
"Improvements in air safety will also call for action in respect of the assessment of aircraft from third countries."
"That is discussed in the report that Mrs Maes drafted and it is important."
"The different points of view that have been raised here can be reconciled in the way the rapporteurs have demonstrated."
"We should try and make swift progress in the debate on the legislative package so that it can be adopted some time this year."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is beyond doubt that the airspace above the European Union should be under common management if its safe use and greater quality is to be guaranteed in the form of reduced delays."
"The approach taken by the rapporteurs, of involving representatives of consumer associations and of industry, as well as of Eurocontrol and of the armed forces, in the discussion in order to come to decisions on proposals for the use of the Single Sky, is one that I support."
"Only this combination, taking account of the experience of civilian and military operators, of suppliers, of those who provide air transport services and those who use them, can lead to decisions being made that effectively make the connection between the required safety standard, efficiency, and the interests of the workforce."
"I do have doubts, though, when it comes to the technical implementation that is proposed."
"I can understand why service providers and regulators are to be separated, but I am opposed to the option contemplated of destroying the hitherto integrated air traffic control system by awarding individual contracts, some of them to operators in the private sector."
"Whilst this may well lead to more competitors becoming active in the market, I see it as bringing about the very opposite of the increased safety that is intended."
"The geographical fragmentation of air traffic control services that prevails at present gives way only to fragmentation of an economic kind."
"In no way does this reduce the existing problems in European air transport, but rather - as demonstrated by the example of the recent crash of two aircraft over Lake Constance - new ones are added."
"Considerations of profitability led to cutbacks in personnel that made it possible for a situation to arise in which in fact only one pilot was actually on duty, and this made trouble-free and, above all, safe operation impossible."
"Here, it is abundantly clear, the question arises of whether air traffic management's highly-sensitive safety issues might not be better taken care of by a public service, which would incorporate the advantages of the integration of the individual services into one single chain with the required quality of work, professional qualifications and the necessary material resources."
"Whilst the introduction of cross-border blocks of airspace represents a step towards the necessary integration of European airspace, it can only come about with the agreement of all the States concerned."
"When cases of uncertainty or dispute arise, it should not be possible to settle them over the heads of one or more states."
"In contrast to this Commission proposal, which presupposes cross-border cooperation by regional services that are available only to a very limited extent, close collaboration between the nation states' existing public air traffic control services is very definitely conceivable and indeed realistic."
"In this instance, two countries would constitute a cross-border block of airspace."
"This complex question of how the sovereignty of states may be respected is also apparent in the Commission's thinking and reporting on improved collaboration between civil and military use of airspace."
"It is not clear from these reports precisely how the closure of airspace to civil, as opposed to military, aviation can be rolled back."
"The current regulations can hardly be said to achieve better use of the single European airspace or greater safety."
"The extended interoperability of the European air traffic management network can be seen in a positive light, as integrated networks have a natural tendency to facilitate greater compatibility and contribute to the reduction of acquisition and maintenance costs."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the fact that we in this Parliament are some of the most frequent users of air transport requires us to pay special attention to all initiatives designed to improve the organisation, punctuality and safety of air traffic navigation and control services."
"We are certainly not calling into question that the proposal to create a Community air regulation body, known as the 'Single European Sky', and the development of connected regulations are intended to increase the effectiveness and safety of this means of transport and to respond to the challenges of its foreseeable growth in the future."
"The simple truth is that in this field there are questions that cannot go unanswered."
"Because I have very little speaking time, I shall only discuss the main ones."
"First, is Parliament aware that the legal base invoked for the four regulations, Article No 80(2) of the Treaty, might not be a sufficient basis for the measures recommended by the Commission, which will have the consequence of communitising national airspace, leaving States Members to exercise, alone, and jointly, their powers of sovereignty?"
"Furthermore, do you realise, ladies and gentlemen, that, as a result of these regulations, the distinction between civil and military users of common airspace will become blurred?"
"Thirdly, is it not obvious that the assumption of these new competences by the Union, to be exercised in accordance with the rules of comitology, requires the inclusion of a ground of competence which does not exist in the current Treaty, and even the definition of a common defence policy, which is still so far from being reached?"
"Furthermore, will the introduction of economic competition mechanisms into air traffic control activities be appropriate to pursuing the objective of air traffic safety, in other words, the safety of people and goods that are transported and of communities living under flight paths, given the need to maintain the high standards of safety practiced?"
"Lastly, during this process, will an impartial and objective analysis have been carried out of the genuine causes of the delays European flights have been experiencing?"
"Can these only be attributed to the shortcomings of the air traffic control system, which we are now seeking to remedy?"
"Will due account be taken, for example, of the responsibilities of airports or of those of airlines that refuse to phase out their flights, or of meteorological reasons?"
"In these new regulations we do not see proposals for measures designed to improve the practices of the other components of this complex system."
"We do not see them and, therefore, we are still concerned."
"Mr President, Commissioner, if one reads the texts proposed by the Commission, one is led to believe that air navigation services might be subject to the Community's economic rules, which would mean having to publish calls for tender for public services of this particular type."
"Yet, in its judgement of 19 January 1994, the Court of Justice stated that air navigation control is a task of the public authorities that is entirely devoid of economic character, since this activity is a service of general interest designed to protect both air transport users and the populations affected by aircraft flying overhead."
"One might believe, therefore, that air traffic control, flight information and alerting services exert a form of administrative police of a regal nature, and they cannot, under any circumstances, be incorporated into a market service, despite the existence of user charges."
"The fact that these services are covered by charges paid by the users does not, however, confer upon them the character of services that are subject to the economic rules of the Treaty."
"That is why the Member States must be able to choose the procedures for organising and providing these services depending on the volume and nature of traffic that they have to manage, as well as the economic realities specific to their territory."
"We should also point out that air traffic services cannot be subject to the economic rules of the Treaty, nor can competition be introduced."
"The conflicts of interest which might arise from this would have an extremely harmful effect on the safety of air transport and, more importantly, of the general public."
"One of the sovereign functions of the State is to ensure the safety of its population and its territory."
"It is therefore the duty of the States and the States alone - which must, of course, improve harmonisation within Eurocontrol - to fulfil this duty."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking our rapporteurs, Mr Fava and Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, and also the shadow rapporteur, Mr Schmitt, for all their hard work on a very complex and detailed report."
"However, I should like to raise a number of concerns that have not yet been addressed, in particular by the Commission."
"The aviation industry cannot continue to sustain the loss of USD 4 billion due to delays across Europe and I recognise that doing nothing is not an option."
"Notwithstanding those remarks, as the saying goes, the devil is in the detail."
"The proposals before us could result in duplication of regulatory efforts and measures aimed at either Member States or at the full Eurocontrol membership that at present covers 31 countries."
"Even worse, there is still a real danger of damaging or destroying existing pan-European systems that function to everybody's satisfaction, solely because they need to be placed all of a sudden in an EU context."
"I refer in particular to the Commission proposal to recreate the Eurocontrol route charges and central flow management systems."
"I would also question the establishment of an industry consultation body, as this would be an unnecessary duplication of the existing system."
"It is our duty to look beyond our borders and create meaningful and effective actions and measures to improve the safety, efficiency and economics of air traffic management which will not lead to a two-tier system, thereby jeopardising the current modus operandi."
"In addition, we cannot ignore the genuine concerns of many Member States regarding the military dimensions of Single Sky, nor the sovereignty issue."
"On 6 July 2000, during our initial debate here in this House, I informed the House that 44% of delays and 30 bottlenecks were concentrated in sectors straddling north and south, including Switzerland, France, Italy, Spain and parts of Germany."
"I also stressed that it was inappropriate to use Eurocontrol as the scapegoat."
"A Single Sky will not solve all of our congestion problems if these Member States and Switzerland do not make a concerted effort to address their specific shortcomings."
"Finally, both airlines and airports will also need to look closely at their practices, as they too are far too often responsible for a high percentage of the delays incurred."
"This report has come a long way and, again, we must thank the rapporteurs."
"But we are not there yet."
"I hope that there will be further and better clarification once Council has met."
"Mr President, this debate is not only about safety or the elimination of delays through better cooperation at European level."
"In my view, this debate also has an international political dimension."
"Cooperation is the EU's strength but also its weakness."
"It is useful to conclude agreements about European rules on aviation, including the use of airspace."
"However, the weakness lies in the way this is done: slowly and with a large number of reservations on the part of the nation states."
"As is evident from Kyoto and the whole affair surrounding the International Criminal Court, we in the European Union try to emulate the United States on the international stage."
"The Americans often try to play us off against each other, and often, we are unable to offer any resistance."
"The aviation dossier is a case in point."
"If you compare the European Union with the United States, it is evident how much better things are organised over there and how weak we often still are."
"The debate and the Fava report also show that we are still not agreed by a long shot on the use of airspace and the rules for air traffic control."
"This discussion is immaterial in the US, as it has one aviation authority."
"I therefore believe it is important, also in the light of this debate, to make swift progress and to work on a system, a set of rules, which can form the basis of one space instead of fifteen different regulations that are given a common European denominator in one way or another."
"I should like to conclude with a remark about Mrs Maes' report, which is excellent."
"It is good that we can now finally wrap up this dossier."
"It has gone on for too long, partly as a result of the Gibraltar issue."
"There are risks involving third-country aircraft, often because these are obsolete."
"This creates unjustified risks, including for airports in the EU at which passengers board these planes."
"I welcome an inspection system, and I should like to congratulate Mrs Maes once again on her sterling report."
"Mr President, introducing competition within the air navigation services will not reduce delays to flights, nor will it harmonise Europe's skies, as the Commission claims."
"Competition would, in fact, compound these difficulties, as competition hampers cooperation."
"Applying productivity criteria to what is merely a question of commercial profitability cannot improve the service provided to air transport users."
"More importantly, though, attacking the public and integrated character of air traffic control services and, therefore, breaking the safety chain that this service provides, only increases the risk."
"Unfortunately, the air disaster that occurred at Lake Constance in July served as a tragic reminder of this."
"Air traffic controllers are quite right to reject the so-called 'Single Sky' project, a message reinforced during their Europe-wide strike on 19 June, and the risk that it involves."
"My colleagues, Mrs Laguiller and Mrs Bordes, and I condemn the breaking up - planned by the Commission - of this public service in preparation to hand it over to private greed."
"The shareholders of the airlines, of the aeronautics industry and the information technology sector are already calculating the profits that they will make from the break-up."
"If you strip the draft text of the pretexts put forward by the Commission, the reality of this project becomes all too evident."
"We therefore reject the project outright, and we shall vote against the Fava and Sanders-ten Holte reports as privatisations and the pursuit for profit are harmful and incompatible with progress, with the concern for safety, with the possible and necessary renationalisation of human activities, on land as well as in the air."
"Mr President, when my colleague spoke about the Single European Sky in July 2000 he thanked the then rapporteur, Sir Robert Atkins, for providing a gift to the Eurosceptic movement in the United Kingdom."
"Since then, the Europhile British press, particularly the national Sunday newspaper The Observer, has made great capital over the recent tragic collision between the Swiss and the Russian airliners."
"One journalist even suggested that the lack of a unified system was in part responsible for the incident."
"However, this issue is not about controlling airspace."
"A unified system through Eurocontrol already exists. It has been doing the job of coordinating air movements in 30 countries, half of them outside the EU, for 42 years."
"The real issue is the battle as old as the Communities themselves: the battle between supranationalism and intergovernmentalism."
"The Eurocontrol system is based on intergovernment control; the Single European Sky framework directive is naked supranationalism."
"The Community wants to bring a portion of the system under supranational control."
"It wants to take over relations with Eurocontrol from Member States, bringing it closer to achieving its ambition to be what Monnet described as a European government."
"That is the real agenda."
"I remind my British colleagues particularly, therefore, that if they vote for this measure they are voting for political integration."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the Commission and congratulating it on its initiative, as other Members have done. I would also like to thank the rapporteurs and the Parliamentary bodies and congratulate them on their work on this very complex subject, with regard to which I feel it is right to apply the principle of flexibility we cite so often."
"I must also thank the Commissioner and Commission Vice-President because, in this case, making a minimal, formal change to procedure, she has anticipated the line the Commission will take at the end of the debate on the amendments too."
"This has given us the opportunity, the subject being so complex, to specify some of the reasons for the importance we attach to the amendments and, precisely, to bring out crucial, sensitive points of the debate."
"The Single Sky initiative is positive, for the reasons already mentioned by all the speakers, which I will not go over again so as not to waste time or space."
"The guiding principles are safety, efficiency and punctuality, to quote the Commissioner herself."
"For this very reason, although we have chosen not to make an explicit, isolated reference to the economic side of things in some amendments, that does not mean that we do not realise its importance but that we want to avoid playing into the hands of those who have viewed this process in a negative light right from the very beginning."
"We often say that we must not throw the baby out with the bath water but, in this case, there are some people who have been trying, right from the beginning, to make the bath water dirty precisely so that the baby will then be thrown out, and we would like to avoid this."
"The same applies to the issue of cooperation between civil and military authorities."
"The solutions we are proposing will not resolve the problem but, if there is one way of ensuring that it is never resolved, it is not even to address the issue."
"The problem will arise again with regard to relations with Eurocontrol and respect for national sovereignty when we come to redefine functional airspaces too, and there are potential solutions which can enhance the positive work already achieved hitherto."
"Mr President, I should also like to thank the rapporteurs for their work and remind colleagues that the real issues, the three guiding principles against which we should test these proposals, must be safety, environmental sustainability and consumer rights."
"The current systems of air traffic control in Europe are living on borrowed time and the tragic events this summer only go to prove that."
"Mrs Maes is absolutely right that in 20 to 30 years we could well be witnessing a major aviation tragedy every week unless we take action now."
"The Single European Sky and the proposals for checks on non-EU aircraft are important contributions to making our skies safer."
"But we must also take account of the environment, particularly in this week of the Johannesburg Earth Summit."
"Every day millions of litres of fuel are wasted and unnecessary emissions are produced because of aviation delays and aircraft in transit across Europe's skies."
"A Single Sky will be a major contribution to reducing pollution, emissions and wasted fossil fuel."
"Finally, let us not forget consumer rights."
"One in three flights in Europe is delayed."
"The human cost is incalculable: thousands of family holidays were ruined this summer with people kept waiting in hot and antiquated airports."
"Business is disrupted and delayed."
"I hope that this proposal will be widely supported."
"I am pleased that the Commissioner is ambitious enough to say that we must see a significant breakthrough in 2004."
"Like Mr Fava, I remain optimistic that we will meet that deadline."
"It is just a pity that the Council is not here to respond to our concerns and our calls for immediate action, because the Commissioner has done her work."
"We have done ours."
"Now it is up to the Council."
"Mr President, we have nothing against a Single Sky that is designed, as is proclaimed, to increase safety levels in European airspace by coordinating guidelines and actions and by harmonising rules."
"But this is not, objectively, the real reason for this Commission proposal."
"Incidentally, issues of safety or even delays do not fall within the main scope of airspace control."
"And, in fact, the proposal adds little in the field of safety."
"Some of the guidelines it contains could actually even call into question the high safety standards they claim to want to achieve: this applies to the opening up of the auxiliary service market, given the priority attached to improving results, which could lead to lower spending on staffing and equipment."
"It is at other levels, however, that this proposal concerns us most, as well as some of the amendments that were introduced in the competent parliamentary Committee."
"I am referring specifically to the intention to transfer the definition of 'functional blocks' from the Member States to the Community sphere."
"Since this issue has been and still is a matter for the forum on territorial management, in accordance with the Treaties and the constitutions of some countries, specifically my own, it falls within the exclusive competence of the Member States."
"There is, therefore, no legal base for proposing what is being proposed, especially not in the terms adopted in the parliamentary Committee, which strengthen the Commission's role as the authority of last instance."
"In fact, this matter takes on particular importance given the involvement of the military sphere."
"It is, therefore, unacceptable that attempts are being made to subordinate control of military airspace and, in general, to define new 'functional blocks' in the absence of a competent decision by the Member States."
"We feel, therefore, that the approach with which the Council has been studying this issue recently is a sensible one."
"These concerns - but also others, such as those regarding the mobility of controllers - have deserved our full attention and have led to the submission of a set of proposals for amendments, which, if adopted, could be added to other amendments that have already been adopted in Committee and which have improved some aspects of the Commission's initial proposal."
"These are the idea that air traffic control services were a matter of general interest; the previously missing participation by the social partners in the process; the now accepted possibility of the use and management of air traffic control services remaining in the public sphere; and finally the commitment to improving cooperation with Eurocontrol."
"I repeat, however: the questions that I mentioned at the beginning are crucial to the final evaluation of this proposal."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these three reports - by Mr Fava, Mrs Sanders-ten Holte and Mrs Maes - were adopted by very large majorities in committee."
"Members have therefore rightly drawn attention to what the present legislative process will achieve as we move towards a Single Sky."
"All that, including the thanks to the Commissioner and to the rapporteurs, merits nothing but agreement."
"As several Members have already said, though, ideal solutions are still a long way off."
"Those who are unwilling to admit that should put themselves, for a moment, in the position of the public."
"Our citizens take a far less rosy view of the topic of 'flying in Europe', above all when, as frequently happens, they are obliged to travel by air."
"They regard flying in Europe as safe."
"That is a good thing, and may it stay that way, even though, here too, there is still room for improvement."
"Above all, though, they regard flying as extremely expensive."
"For what I pay to fly from Graz, my home town, to Brussels, I could just as well fly to Los Angeles or Kuala Lumpur."
"Quite clearly, something is out of proportion here."
"More delays are occurring."
"Flying at high speed as we do, we spend more time sitting around at airports, and it happens all too often that we do not fly at all."
"Strikes, especially just before public holidays, keep reminding us to what an extent some people, when the issue of safe air travel comes up, consider their own interests rather than the public interest alone."
"Looked at in that light, we should not only laud what has been achieved, but we should also, and especially, work on the basis that what we are taking the first steps to get moving today might well need further improvement, so that, setting ourselves higher standards, we may ensure greater safety in the air, and also proper transport conditions in Europe."
"There is still much to be done."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this proposal sums up our approach quite neatly."
"Our point of departure is a known problem, the delays of 1999, even though this year was exceptional due to the war in Kosovo and the changes to flight paths."
"When a problem arises, we quite spontaneously turn to Parliament's favourite topic, namely competition. We will sooner or later have to build an effigy to competition."
"The limits of competition are reached very quickly when the safety of passengers is at stake, and these limits, which fortunately appear, for the most part, in the draft texts, are a matter of responsibility for Member States."
"Air-traffic controllers are, essentially, equivalent to a policeman on the side of the road, to a ship's captain steering a vessel into port, and we can never do deals at their expense."
"In addition, each Member State is free to select its air navigation providers, and the regulation must provide for cases where public or private businesses concern missions of general interest."
"An amendment has been tabled to this effect."
"Airspace is not only used by civilians but also by the military and cooperation between the two is therefore necessary."
"I would point out that this cooperation, for the army, falls under the intergovernmental rather than the Community pillar, and in this case, the Single Sky Committee is not answering the question."
"Moreover, the Fifteen are not alone; there are other countries."
"You told us that they are to join Eurocontrol next month and this is a positive step."
"We must now wait for the next developments."
"There are more limits - and I shall end on this point - since control is a single entity that we cannot carve or cut up into slices."
"The services involved in providing control cannot be disassociated."
"I hope that the outcome of our vote will take into account all this information."
"Having said that, our fellow Members have done a good piece of work and I thank them for listening carefully to what we have said."
"Mr President, there is a danger that the open skies which the proposed directive is designed to create will turn into a safety nightmare for millions of passengers."
"Problems in air transport, competitiveness and efficiency are being used as a cover for the total liberalisation of the market in this sector, for bumping up the profits of big business and, at the same time, for a rude assault on the safety of aircraft and on the national independence and development potential of the Member States, especially the less developed Member States and more remote areas."
"And that is not all."
"The proposed open skies will, it is openly admitted, be used to serve the militaristic, anti-grass roots plans of the warmongers in ???? and the European Union."
"At the same time, the very nature of the transport service will change from a service for the benefit of the people to a way of raking in profits for big business."
"The adverse effects of this directive will be many and varied, especially for Greece, a country with hundreds of islands, with areas which are among the least developed in the Union and with serious defence and security problems."
"That is why we, the workers and consumers oppose this directive."
"We are fighting for nationalised airlines which meet high quality and safety standards and which are integrated into a national development programme designed to serve the people, not big business."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I, on the other hand, welcome the adoption of this raft of measures today with satisfaction, and if we have any cause for regret at all, it is that it has taken so long to achieve: we have wasted 10 years over this dispute between Spain and the United Kingdom - which was not even based on historical fact - but it cannot be helped."
"Today, at last, a new horizon has opened up before us."
"I have to say that, in any case, a great many difficulties arose because the dossier was and still is genuinely complex, and its passage has certainly not been smooth."
"The effects of this complexity have been felt even today in this House, although it is clear to everybody that there are many economic, safety, environmental and consumer protection justifications for producing this package: we have seen the amount of delays, the level of air traffic congestion, the costs of this congestion and the difficulties of creating new airspaces in terms of safety."
"Despite the fact that we can all see that there are more than excellent reasons why we need this raft of measures, objections have been raised even today and have taken a number of different forms: the rather unusual reference to the States' sovereignty, cooperation with the military authorities, which has suddenly become so vital - I am particularly surprised to see the far left showing such deference towards the military authorities - and the confusion between liberalisation and privatisation."
"These are all objections which, in my view, in actual fact conceal a certain resistance and the desire to maintain the status quo, the desire not to change, which is the exact opposite of what our citizens are demanding from us."
"Commissioner, there are many areas in which Europe needs to take a step backwards rather than forwards, where it must not take over the functioning and competences of the individual States, but this is not one of them."
"Our citizens are demanding this initiative, and so you must press ahead resolutely and give us a Single Sky through which everyone can travel safely and without concern."
"Mr President, this issue demonstrates beautifully the need for something like the European Union."
"No Member State on its own can effectively resolve the problems of air traffic control or safety in the air."
"We have a Union where we not only cooperate as states but we also share our sovereignty and our law-making in the best interests of ourselves as individual Member States and the total population of the European Union."
"This is a good example of how we can do that effectively."
"That is not to say that this is a perfect proposal, but it is a good step in the right direction."
"There is no doubt that we need interoperability between our air traffic control systems; we need better integration and better and more common equipment and training of staff."
"We need to try to restore not only the pleasure of flying but also the sense of safety that people have when they board an aircraft and go from place to place."
"As Members of this Parliament we fly as part of our work; we are constantly in the air."
"I know that, certainly in the last number of years, the pleasure of going to an airport and boarding an aircraft has deteriorated, not only because of delays for reasons of air traffic control and lack of space, etc., but also because of delays at airports, baggage retrieval and security - it could be argued that security is necessary."
"I also welcome the public service character of Eurocontrol."
"It is important to bear in mind that this is an issue that cannot be regulated by private enterprise."
"Regulation has to be maintained by having a strong public service element."
"Finally, in terms of the principles I would apply to this area, safety is the first priority, environmental sustainability the second and efficiency the third."
"It is important to bear them in mind and we should move on with this proposal."
"Mr President, Mrs de Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, here once again we have been hearing all kinds of reasons why we might not be able to switch to a single European solution with regard to the use of airspace."
"The reasons given have often been what would appear to be concerns about safety but in fact this is all about selfishness and the fact that we want to preserve the status quo."
"It is hard to imagine a more sensible and more logical project than the rational and coordinated use of European airspace, especially as its use and the number of passengers are set to increase from here on."
"Why should an aircraft travelling from Helsinki to Athens or from Warsaw to Dublin zigzag over Europe with the pilot having to do the same things many times over?"
"This should be seen as just one exercise."
"The result of the current practice is delays."
"Finnish Members of Parliament no longer fly from Helsinki to Strasbourg via Paris because the flights are always late or cancelled, or luggage goes missing."
"Now we fly to Frankfurt or Zurich direct and then travel by car for three hours."
"That is better than using European air traffic services."
"This is also a very expensive system."
"In the United States of America, as we well know, they can operate double the number of flights for the same amount of money."
"Who pays the bill in society when we act inefficiently?"
"It is always the poor."
"The rich can afford to look around for some alternative."
"It is also vulnerable."
"The tragic accident that happened in Switzerland was certainly not due to the fact that the equipment there was poor or that there were not enough people on duty."
"We have to put this question: why must Switzerland, a small country, have its own airspace?"
"If a modus operandi based on international borders is the right one, we ought to establish centres in Andorra, San Marino and the Vatican."
"Actually, the Vatican is already is a sort of heavenly air traffic control centre - a spiritual one."
"There they remind us that the heavens belong to us all, as something we all share."
"Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur and draftsmen, the need for regulation to make European airspace truly integrated is widely acknowledged."
"The current situation is characterised by the existence of various service provision systems, implemented by fifty or so air traffic control centres, with two dozen different management systems and 70 computer programming languages."
"This is absurd!"
"There is a genuine need to amend and regulate, bringing about the necessary harmonisation, which can also be extended to the training of air traffic controllers."
"I should like at this point to make an aside: I was an air traffic controller during my military service and am well aware of the difficulties caused by the lack of any coordination between airspace controlled by the military and airspace controlled by civilian authorities."
"The issue of regulation is of the utmost importance and, in this proposal for a package of four regulations for the Single European Sky, the need for the power and independence of Eurocontrol, one of whose main functions is that of a public service designed to ensure the safety of airspace, is, therefore, undeniable."
"The question inevitably arises, however, of the issue of creating functional blocks of cross-border airspace. It is also worth making crystal clear what these are and what purpose they serve."
"These must be created with the agreement of the countries involved; otherwise, the constitutions of some Member States would certainly be infringed."
"To conclude, safety must be the primary concern of all parties involved in establishing the Single European Sky, followed by environmental and effectiveness issues."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, I would like to start by apologising for my absence from the beginning of the debate, having arrived in Strasbourg only this morning."
"All the things that have been gone through in detail should actually, I think, give us cause for rejoicing this morning, for we have come a long way, even if it took us three years to do it."
"The Commission said in its first speech - which was in the summer of 1999 - that a single system of air traffic control is a typically European problem, and one that we must deal with in a European way."
"The Vice-President then set up the high-level working party."
"We MEPs were not entirely happy with that, but it was the right thing to do in that she was trying to take on board the concerns of the Member States, which feared ill-founded centralisation."
"It was therefore right to set up the high-level working party, which submitted its report in 2000."
"Then, in 2001, the Commissioner set out the proposals for directives."
"Today, having had good debates in Committee, Parliament is to complete the First Reading stage, which means that we have come a very long way in three years and we should just rejoice in that."
"Secondly, some philosophical differences remain, and that is only natural, but let us just give them some thought."
"I believe that there are sufficient examples to demonstrate that military and civil air traffic control can be integrated and linked up, thus becoming more effective, including in the interests of military security."
"This antithesis between military air traffic control and its civil counterpart is something we should overcome."
"For another thing, we should emphatically reiterate that we are democrats and that democracy means that it is the government, monitored by Parliament, that has to come to a decision."
"That is why Eurocontrol is, at the end of the day, something which we cannot get into bed with."
"Eurocontrol is a board of civil servants whose technical expertise and function of providing services in specific sectors we acknowledge, but it is the European Union, the Commission, that must exercise a regulatory function, and be monitored in doing so by us, as it is we who are responsible for regulations enacted by the State."
"Madam Vice-President, perhaps you could tell us in your response with what success the Council has met."
"With the high-level working party you gave the Council every opportunity, and yet it was able to conduct negotiations in parallel."
"Can we be certain that the Council will finalise the dossier with a Common Position by Christmas?"
"Only if it does will we be able to achieve the objective by 2004."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to say that I am personally committed to implementing the Single Sky project for three reasons."
"The first is related to the rationalisation of capacity and everyone agrees on this point given the explosion in air traffic."
"The second is the introduction of safety standards of a high level, particularly prior to enlargement - and this, in my view, is a very important point. The third and final reason is the transformation of the Eurocontrol consensus into Community regulation."
"These three factors are of quite major importance."
"This matter is difficult because it got off to a poor start, due to two initial mistakes made by the Commission, which first of all wanted to present it as a power game between the Commission and Eurocontrol and which has probably also bowed down excessively to pressure from airlines in view of the commercialisation of control services."
"But the Commission presented a second proposal which I believe constitutes a considerable shift, with the participation of Eurocontrol, the acknowledgement of services of general interest of air traffic control services, the character of natural monopoly and, above all, the fact that the Member States are integrated in a Single Sky and will have a say in the way the regulation works."
"We also believe that there are still three questions that need to be answered."
"First of all, the auxiliary services are still very vague: at times, there is a restrictive conception, at others, an extensive notion of these services."
"I do not believe however, as shown by the unfortunate example of what was done with the railways in the United Kingdom - and we must learn lessons from this - that we must break up the chain of control by too great a degree."
"Radar, radio and information technology are the eyes and ears of air traffic controllers."
"We have, unfortunately, seen what can happen when they are lacking."
"This does not mean that an integrated service is infallible, but it does mean that there is probably a minimum degree that services can be integrated and perhaps even a maximum that we can preserve."
"Secondly, it appears that the interaction between Eurocontrol and the European Air Safety Agency is not clear."
"The Agency is not mentioned in the draft texts, but it will come into being and clarification will be necessary."
"Lastly, there is fierce opposition to the attribution of blocks of airspace and we must overcome this opposition."
"In fact, if each Member State can appoint its provider and if two Member States do not agree on the provider, nothing is said about how to resolve the issue."
"We shall therefore propose amendments to address this point, and hopefully they will be adopted."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my great satisfaction at the fact that this debate is being held today and that we have reached this stage."
"I feel that thanks are due, in particular, to Commissioner de Palacio, Commission Vice-President, who is here today."
"This result has been achieved thanks to her perseverance and to the contribution of many others, including the European Parliament."
"As I said, this, for me, is reason for great satisfaction. I hope that, just as she has succeeded in overcoming such great resistance, she will also be able to overcome the resistance put up by the Council and bring the project to a successful conclusion within the set time frame."
"In particular, I would like to tell you that I have called repeatedly upon the Commission in the past not to let itself be stopped in its tracks by a privileged elite such as the air traffic controllers, who, I am sad to say, are more interested in preserving their privileged conditions than making a practical contribution to the safety of the entire population of the European Union."
"Sadly, we have had proof in the past of the negligence and laxity of air traffic controllers, which have claimed many victims, and the fact that this is due partly to the lack of a single airspace shows how important and necessary it is to resolve the matter without delay."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank the people responsible for the reports and all the speakers in this debate, which I have found extremely interesting."
"I would like to thank Mrs Maes for her report on the control of third-country aircraft, which has received the practically unanimous support of this House, and which will lead to an increase in general safety in the European Union, safeguarding not only the situation of the aircraft of the Union but also of those of third countries, especially those of the closest countries, of Eastern Europe, which are the ones we have the closest relations with."
"In relation to the other reports, by Mr Fava and Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, on the Single Sky, I would like to conclude by making a few comments:"
"Firstly, the 'Single Sky' proposal is clearly not going to put an end to all delays."
"But 50% of delays in the air sector are the result of problems in air traffic management, and the 'Single Sky' proposal is clearly going to improve the management of air traffic and is therefore going to improve on that 50% of delays."
"Secondly, the intention is simply the rationalisation of airspace, harmonising rules, harmonising systems, introducing interoperability and simply creating a network - since these days everything is on a network - of air control systems in all the countries of the Union."
"In that way we will put an end to a compartmentalised and fragmented system, which, far from increasing safety, actually reduces it."
"The creation of a network, the integration of systems and offering industry greater possibilities to make technological progress will contribute to an increase in safety."
"I do not want to indulge in demagoguery or take advantage of tragedies, but I would like to say one thing to you: in the case of the terrible accident that took place this summer, the German air traffic controllers realised what was going to happen, but they were not on the network, nor were they integrated with the Swiss air traffic controllers, and they had to resort to a telephone to call Swiss air traffic control and could not connect."
"I cannot guarantee that with the Single Sky in operation this accident would have been prevented. We do not know."
"What I can assure you of is that it would have been easier to prevent it."
"And that is what we have to bear in mind."
"We are not just introducing greater rationality but also greater safety, and that is the objective of this initiative."
"After 2004, we must maintain that objective and - to take up what was said by Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Ripoll and certain other speakers - we must demand a rapid solution from the Council."
"I trust in the Danish Presidency to provide impetus for this issue, which I know is one of the priorities in the field of transport and in particular air transport."
"Eurocontrol."
"Ladies and gentlemen, nobody intends either to duplicate the actions of Eurocontrol or to cancel it out."
"But we must be aware that Eurocontrol does not have the capacities offered by the Community method to carry out its activities."
"I would like you to be aware that all Eurocontrol does is coordinate flights a priori."
"When it comes to operation, when aircraft are under way, the air control operation for these flights falls to the corresponding national authorities on the basis of a generic coordination which has been carried out previously by Eurocontrol."
"What we are saying is that in real time, during the actual flight, there should be this integration and harmonisation of systems which increases control."
"Therefore, what we are doing is increasing safety and not taking competences away from an existing body."
"Because that body, I insist, does not have those capacities, it does not have the Community method which means that what we agree here (Commission, Council and Parliament) becomes an obligatory rule with which the courts can demand compliance on the part of all the countries of the Union."
"Privatisation."
"I am rather tired of repeating the same thing."
"I do not know if there is a lack of knowledge or a lack of trust here."
"Read what the text says rather than the pamphlets of certain trade unions."
"There is no privatisation here."
"Air traffic control is a natural monopoly which must be regulated."
"There is a Court of Justice judgement which clearly establishes that this control is outside the competition rules."
"It is also laid down in the Treaties that the specific carrying out of that activity and the formula adopted for carrying it out should fall to each Member State."
"What we are not going to do is change the Treaty by means of a Directive."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we should keep in mind what our limitations are."
"Clearly it is a natural monopoly and clearly the Court of Justice has given its opinion and nobody intends to change the status quo."
"On the contrary, what we are proposing is to strengthen the situation of the public service and the common Community framework for this management of air traffic control."
"Civil-military."
"This is the most thorny and delicate element of the whole debate."
"There is an extremely important report of the Legal Service of the Council, which firstly confirms the suitability of the legal basis on which the Commission's proposal is based; therefore, if any of the honourable Members have any doubt, read the report of the Legal Service of the Council which, as you well know, goes into great detail on this."
"Secondly, we are looking into how we can overcome the difficulties resulting from the simple fact that the Union has limited competences; on the one hand, we cannot go beyond the competences attributed to us, and on the other, in no way is it our intention to reduce the defence capacity of any country of the European Union or to get into areas of sovereignty beyond what is laid down in the Treaties."
"I would therefore like Members to be aware that all of this will be carefully safeguarded and that, furthermore, the Council's report provides a basis for clearly resolving this problem."
"In this context, the question is raised of supra-territorial blocks."
"I would say to the honourable Members that they should look carefully at this, that there are only cross-border blocks insofar as there is an agreement between the two States of the Union."
"It is true that they do not exist in the event that there is divergence."
"In this case there is no shared block, each country controls its territorial area and that is that."
"I therefore believe that this premise will allow us to overcome this difficulty."
"Thank you very much, Mr President, I would like once again to thank Mr Fava, Mrs Sanders-ten Holte and Mrs Maes for the magnificent work they have done on this air package which will increase safety and rationalise the air sector in the European Union."
"The next item is the report (A5-0269/2002) by Mr Blokland, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the establishment of a Community framework for noise classification of civil subsonic aircraft for the purposes of calculating noise charges [COM(2001) 74 - C5-0001/2002 - 2001/0308(COD)]."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, once again for the magnificent report he is presenting us with today."
"We are discussing the possibility of providing companies with economic incentives to take account of the noise nuisance caused by certain aircraft, in accordance with the principle of compensating the best and punishing the worst."
"Although aircraft noise is already integrated into certain Community airport charging systems, the criteria used for the differentiation and quantification of noise nuisance vary widely amongst the different Member States."
"It is therefore difficult to compare one system with another."
"The present proposal deals with this issue, providing a common framework for the classification of aircraft noise which increases convergence and transparency, and allows us to anticipate the situation in each specific case."
"The proposal is restricted to the minimum necessary to achieve its objective and leaves the Member States with sufficient possibilities to adjust to the specific parameters of particular airports, such as the level of the unitary noise charge, the characteristics of the fleet using a particular airport, or the variation between the highest charge and the lowest charge."
"The responsibility for deciding whether to impose noise charges is left to the Member States."
"There is no obligation to impose charges in all airports, since it is not necessary to establish them in airports with no noise problems."
"I would like to thank Parliament for its support on this issue and at the end of the debate I will comment in more detail on some of the amendments, I will say in advance once again they we will accept the majority of them."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I should like to speak about the report on noise charges at airports."
"Although we have been contending with aircraft noise for years, noisy aircraft are still able to land at European airports."
"One thinks of the so-called marginally conforming aircraft, which are equipped with hush-kits that only marginally comply with the standard for Chapter 3 aircraft."
"Other aircraft too can generate a great deal of noise nuisance, certainly at major airports where many aircraft take off and land."
"In order to counter the adverse impact of these noisy aircraft, measures are to be taken around airports, such as moving runways, installing noise barriers, moving residential areas, insulating houses and so on."
"Clearly these measures will require considerable expenditure and effort, and it is such costs that noise charges are intended to cover."
"Aircraft noise is already an element in some Community airport charging systems."
"The aim of the report before us is to harmonise noise charges at airports."
"It is, obviously, also the intention to promote the use of quieter aircraft."
"Within the present common European framework, noise charges are calculated in a readily understood format, which enhances transparency, fairness of treatment and predictability and avoids arbitrariness."
"I should like to underline that noise charges on the basis of measurements are impossible because there are also other noises sources and aircraft that land or take off simultaneously at airports."
"This directive is therefore based on a calculation method, since this is the only option."
"In order to prevent distortions of competition, the Environment Committee has decided to make noise charges compulsory at all airports."
"There is, however, more room for flexibility."
"The maximum variation between the highest and lowest noise charge within a given part of the day may be a ratio of 40 instead of 20."
"Moreover, it is stipulated that the noisiest aircraft should pay more for the greater nuisance that they cause."
"The Commission's proposal namely specifies that the noisiest aircraft should not have to pay a higher noise charge than the somewhat quieter category."
"I am of the opinion that sufficient flexibility has now been built in."
"It is therefore not necessary to make exceptions for airports that pursue a strict policy in the field of noise charges."
"Within the framework which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has outlined, a very strict policy is possible."
"I do not believe that airports exist whose polices are so strict that they fall outside of the framework."
"If we give some airports special treatment, then this will generate arbitrariness."
"As already indicated, the proceeds of the noise charges will be used to make investments intended to reduce noise nuisance."
"However, the Environment Committee is of the opinion that other costs too, such as environmental costs as a result of noise nuisance, should be covered."
"In addition, not all effects of noise nuisance can be expressed in money terms down to the last penny."
"Examples of these are disturbed night rest or psychological effects of noise nuisance, which may be financially compensated."
"In the final analysis, we should realise that the aim of the noise charges is to promote quieter aircraft."
"Finally, I should like to make a comment on the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens."
"The use of noise standards to calculate the noise charges is wholly incompatible with this directive's approach."
"Moreover, we are yet to see whether these standards will ever be drafted."
"For these reasons, I would advise against these amendments."
"With the present report, I hope that noise charges will become fairer and more transparent."
"However, far more important is that noise nuisance will decrease for our citizens."
". (NL) Mr President, I am speaking as a guest speaker on behalf of the actual draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, Mr Josu Ortuondo, who is, as you know, in Spain for political reasons."
"The step from the European airspace to noise is naturally a simple one."
"If we simplify this procedure, then we should put a whole ream of conditions and measures in place."
"I would thank the Commission and the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, for the work they have done, but the problems are clear and evident."
"Also, years of work have already gone into this topic."
"I myself attended the debates on hush-kits in the previous session."
"In principle, noisy aircraft should mainly be forced to become less noisy, in other words Chapters 3 onwards should apply."
"This is, in fact, the object of the whole exercise, and the enforcement of this via these measures is of major importance."
"Needless to say, comments have been made on the Commission's report."
"This should first and foremost address noise charges, the expenses involved and the relationship between the two."
"It is about harmonisation, and these noise charges must naturally be the result of noise classification."
"It is the noise charges, though, that matter most."
"The problem with the Commission proposal is - and this is why amendments have been tabled in a number of committees - that it remains non-mandatory up to a certain point, because there is only a tenuous link between noise pollution on the one hand and levies on the other."
"It is pretty well left up to the Member States how they want to deal with these levies and, as Mr Blokland has already pointed out to a certain extent in his report, this can have a distorting effect on competition in practice, but mainly fails to motivate the aviation industry in the sense that I referred to previously."
"Also, it is very important, in my view, to stipulate - and this has been incorporated in a number of amendments - that better practices, insofar as these exist, which fall outside the scope of the directives and are simply better, should be maintained, and I therefore recommend supporting a number of amendments, mainly from the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"There is too little differentiation between the levies, and the link between the noise charges and the expenses is, in my view, an ambiguous one."
"Allow me to make a brief comment on this."
"As Mr Blokland already indicated, night rest, psychological effects and some of the environmental effects are difficult to verify, and there is room for improvement in this respect."
"Once again, I do recommend the amendments on this point tabled by the Group of the Greens, namely Amendments Nos 18, 19 and 20."
"I would state very clearly that we will certainly be retaining their amendments."
"I am not saying this on behalf of the Regional Policy Committee, but I would, however, recommend them warmly."
"Mr President, legislation addressing the noise nuisance experienced by many citizens around civil airports is of major importance."
"At present, we see that there are still major discrepancies."
"What is not possible in Maastricht is allowed in Bierzet, which is only 10 km down the road."
"Day and night times vary."
"Whenever night begins in Düsseldorf, we in the Netherlands only fly at dawn and dusk."
"It is therefore high time we brought about harmonisation - albeit cautiously - by introducing a system of noise charges applicable to all European airports to promote the use of quieter aircraft and ban noisy aircraft."
"I can inform you that most of my group will, in the plenary, be endorsing the amended proposal, as approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"We welcome the amendments tabled with the aim of making the Commission proposal more binding and, as a result, removing the inappropriate competition element."
"Mr Blokland's proposal to double the ratio of 20 as an upper limit for the levy to the ratio of 40 is also excellent, for indeed, by expanding the range from 13 to 16 dB, the noisiest aircraft will also be paying more for their nuisance."
"I therefore support the rapporteur and all the effort he has made in order to reach agreement with everyone."
"Since the Commissioner is here, I would like to make a different comment, still in connection with this debate."
"I therefore venture an observation of a different nature, although it is related to aircraft noise."
"Commissioner, although I respect the way in which you are trying to tackle aircraft noise, I should also like to hear from you - and if you were unable to respond straight away, you may be able to do so in writing - how we can prevent new sources of noise nuisance from emerging."
"I would quote the example of Laarbruch at the German-Dutch border, in respect of which many questions have already been asked."
"In Laarburch, a military airport is being converted into a civil one, and any input from outside is being categorically rejected."
"In addition, there is no transparency in the conditions under which this airport will be established, the way in which the licences are granted or the question whether the daytime and night-time scheme is being maintained."
"Commissioner, I would like to find out from you what concrete action you intend to take in order to reduce the incidence of this sort of thing."
"Mr President, I am pleased we are now one step closer to achieving noise restriction in Europe."
"I should like to single out four points of significance."
"First of all, it is valuable to establish one basis for applying a system of noise charges which will prompt airlines to use quieter aircraft."
"In our view, the proceeds should be ploughed back into infrastructural changes to restrict noise nuisance."
"The introduction of one system would give the currently ambiguous system a dose of clarity."
"Secondly, it is not compulsory to introduce this system at all airports, which is useful, since some airports may have natural noise barriers that could be exploited economically."
"Thirdly, certification in accordance with the ICAO standard should be introduced."
"It is important, to my mind, not to start using other standards, but it is certainly worth investigating whether this could be developed in future and it is useful to translate the actual noise pollution as experienced by the public into a noise classification."
"Working with noise classifications is very complex as it is."
"As Mr Blokland has already pointed out, there are always external effects intruding."
"In future, I would like to see this further investigated, and this should then also be possible to implement and measure, but not now."
"My final point concerns the ratio, in respect of which we, as the ELDR Group, adopt a different position."
"In our view, the ratio of 1 in 20 on top of the other systems and on top of the landing rights already has sufficient impact on pricing and on the challenge on the part of airlines and industries to implement the tariffs."
"A good balance has been struck, in our view."
"Let us therefore introduce it."
"Mr President, noise pollution has a significant effect on the well being of very many European citizens."
"Noise in the areas close to airports often reaches a level that is unbearable for millions of our fellow citizens."
"That is why it is absolutely essential to combine regulatory methods with economic instruments in order to minimise noise pollution."
"The first measure that should be taken is to withdraw the noisiest aircraft."
"This measure has only been partially implemented so far."
"We are aware that many aircraft, which only just meet the standards described in Chapter 3, continue to use airports in Europe."
"It is now imperative that we supplement the regulatory measures with economic instruments."
"Therefore, using charges and applying the polluter pays principle is certainly a good initiative."
"We therefore welcome the Commission's proposal, which seeks to introduce a system of charges in a harmonised Community framework."
"The aim is to encourage airlines to use the quietest aircraft and, in addition, to avoid dumping between airports."
"Noise dumping of this kind is obviously very harmful to citizens living close to these airports."
"That said, although the Commission's proposal is sound in principle, when it is examined in more detail, it can be seen that it is not sufficiently rigorous or effective, as the rapporteur has already pointed out."
"According to this proposal, then, the introduction of charges is optional, which will inevitably bring about a dumping policy."
"Moreover, the differentiation between types of noise pollution is insufficient."
"Since the proposed ratio of 1:20 between the highest and lowest noise charge was insufficient, the rapporteur suggested increasing this ratio from 20 to 40, which is wholly acceptable."
"By and large, we agree with the proposals made by the rapporteur, but we added one element to these proposals that the rapporteur unfortunately rejects, namely to take into account the level of noise at night and the level of noise during the day/night/evening, which are two extremely important indicators of noise pollution which allow us to differentiate between charges."
"We hope that the rapporteur reviews his position and takes into account the problem of noise at night because it is obvious that this problem is certainly the most harmful nuisance that one can encounter."
"We are not going to solve the problem with charges alone, but in any case, this measure will help to improve the situation."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, in principle, we transport experts among the Christian Democrats also support the Commission proposal on noise charges, as we have to use higher charges for noisy aircraft to give the airlines a practical stimulus to use quieter aircraft, and thereby protect the public from a needlessly high level of perceived noise."
"Those of us who sit on the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism are not very happy with the Committee on the Environment, Health and Consumer Policy, as the Environment Committee has simply rejected the proposals that the Transport Committee had adopted by a large majority."
"The Commission should reconsider how it might reintroduce our proposals, as the Transport Committee's proposals were aimed at giving airports a far more sophisticated framework within which to calculate noise charges."
"We want to make it clear in law that it is possible to spread the burden more widely and that aircraft are, as an alternative, to be liable to charges either according to certification or in accordance with the noise levels as actually measured."
"We take the view that what we proposed in the Transport Committee is more environmentally effective, and that it maintains a higher standard."
"In the EU, we have in fact always acted according to the principle that, where extensive and effective environmental protection systems are already in place and we lay down a minimum standard at European level, the countries and groups with more highly-developed systems do not have to reduce their standards."
"You, Commissioner, are in a position to set at nought my concern that we might be using European law to lower existing noise standards, and you can do it right now."
"A broad majority of us in this House has agreed on Amendment No 11, which is to be added to the Blokland Report, by which we seek to make it clear that existing, more effective, noise charge systems may be retained, and thus that European law does not mean a step backwards for the protection of the environment."
"To that extent, Commissioner, I look forward to your comments on Amendment No 11 with great expectation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Directive is a constituent part of a strategy to combat the noise nuisance at airports and in the areas around them - an issue very close to the public's heart."
"The strategy's objective is that quieter aircraft must be brought into service and noise charges must become more effective in environmental terms."
"That is already happening at many airports in the Community, but not by a long way at all of them."
"The Commissioner is right to say that each Member State has quite different criteria for differentiating between charges and measuring the amount of perceived noise."
"There is a real need for harmonisation."
"Thus far, the Directive makes sense."
"It will at one and the same time make for greater transparency and more equal treatment, and make the charges payable by the airlines more predictable, so that, as well as of course markedly improving protection against noise, it will have an incidental effect on competition."
"The proposal for a directive does, however, have one grave defect, and now I want to sound the same warning note as Mr Jarzembowski in saying that it makes for downward harmonisation, albeit involuntarily."
"For the proposal for a directive forces the progression to tail off to such a degree that it can no longer be called a perceptible incentive, and that cannot be the objective of our policy on noise and the environment."
"Frankfurt, London, Paris, Munich, Amsterdam, Hamburg, Rome, Madrid, and Stuttgart have other systems of charging for noise, which result in markedly better protection against it, and these must be retained, yet it is precisely that which the Commission proposal would prevent if not amended to some degree."
"Why is this so?"
"There is no effective economic incentive unless noise charges increase markedly and progressively - and, I emphasise, markedly and progressively - in line with the increase in noise volume."
"Quiet aircraft must therefore benefit and loud aircraft must incur substantial charges."
"Whatever harmonisation is needed, our objective must still be to keep Europe's standards of noise prevention as high as possible."
"My group has therefore reintroduced three amendments, which make it clear that charging systems that are already in existence and are more effective in environmental terms, are to be retained."
"I ask the whole House to support these amendments."
"It would indeed be absurd to penalise airports that provide far better protection against noise than that which has hitherto been proposed."
"Mr President, I would like once again to thank Mr Blokland for the work he has done."
"The Commission cannot accept all the amendments proposed, amongst other things because, when it comes to regulating this type of issue, we have to ensure that there is a balance between the necessary harmonisation, which prevents everybody from going off in their own direction, and the room for manoeuvre of the various States of the Union and competent authorities, in other words, the principle of subsidiarity."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot accept the following amendments: Amendment No 3, which proposes using noise measured at airports as a basis, rather than the certified noise of the aircraft, because that would significantly reduce the transparency of the charging system and also because it could cause discrimination as a result of the considerable differences between the noise measurement systems used in the different airports."
"Amendment No 4, which does not make it sufficiently clear that the concept of modulating charges must be applied, both in the case of a neutral framework, from the point of view of revenue, and when revenue is used to fund measures to alleviate environmental effects."
"Amendment No 8, which would oblige the Commission to prepare a report on the possibility of replacing the system proposed in the long term with a system based on noise measurement."
"Since the Commission believes that this methodology would not guarantee sufficient transparency, as I said in relation to Amendment No 3, we believe that it does not make sense to carry out the said study."
"While we are saying that these amendments would increase the differences and therefore reduce the harmonising effect sought by the Commission's proposal, I must say that nevertheless, we must reject Amendment No 9, which establishes a minimum noise charge, because airports without noise problems should not in principle be obliged to impose noise charges."
"Amendment No 10 cannot be accepted since it would not make it sufficiently clear that increasing revenue from noise charges is an option and not an obligation."
"The same can be said of Amendments Nos 11, 15, 16 and 17, because they are contrary to the main objective of the proposals, which is to achieve a minimum degree of harmonisation."
"In this regard, I would like to say to Mr Jarzembowski that, if we leave what has been done already, I am afraid to say that we would have a much lesser degree of harmonisation."
"Amendment No 13 cannot be endorsed, because it would oblige all airports to apply a system of noise taxes and Amendments Nos 18, 19 and 20 are not only ruled out because the inclusion or reference to harmonised European objectives is outside the scope of this proposal, but also because they are completely incompatible with the method proposed for the calculation of charges on noise emissions."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there are a series of amendments which are acceptable, but there are others which we cannot accept, either because they propose an excessive degree of harmonisation or because, on the contrary, they would excessively reduce the degree of harmonisation proposed."
"I would like to thank the various Members once again for their speeches."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0253/2002) by Mr Beysen, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on sales promotions in the Internal Market [COM(2001) 546 - C5-0475/2001 - 2001/0227(COD)]."
"First of all, Mr Bolkestein will speak on behalf of the Commission."
"I would warn everyone that, given the number of speakers scheduled, we will obviously be unable to conclude this debate before the vote."
"On behalf of the Presidency, I would like to apologise to those Members who will have to return this evening to speak."
"Mr President, it is a great pleasure to introduce, albeit briefly, the topic of today, indeed of the moment, in the knowledge that I shall have another opportunity to explain the Commission's opinion on this matter at the end of the MEPs' interventions."
"I should like to say the following by way of introduction."
"The draft regulation on sales promotions aims to establish an internal market in the area of discounts, free gifts, premiums and promotional contests and games."
"The Commission has established that the current regulatory fragmentation in this field hinders the cross-border provision of these services."
"Parliament has, in this connection, requested swift measures."
"The proposed regulation aims to respond to this request by harmonising information requirements and lifting obsolete national restrictions in this field."
"I am delighted with Parliament's motion for a resolution drafted by Mr Beysen."
"Although quite a few amendments have been tabled on the Commission's text, the result is in line with the planned modernisation and the internal market's goals."
"The proposal's objective is to lift a number of limits on the value of sales promotions and to harmonise a series of information requirements at the same time."
"This balanced approach must be retained."
"In fact, the need for this is recognised in most of Parliament's amendments, but the Commission is less impressed with the amendments in which a limit on the value of sales promotions is re-introduced, as in Amendment No 29, or the amendments in which the information requirements are deleted, as in Amendments Nos 49 and 54."
"This proposal has caused concern in the following four areas: the handling of national bans on below cost resale; the connection between this proposal and the Commission's current activities concerning a much wider initiative with regard to fair trading practices; the provisions governing promotional games, in which connection the Commission has been accused of encouraging illegal gaming activities; and finally, the Commission was also criticised for making too much use of mutual recognition as a basis."
"I should like to confine myself to these introductory remarks."
"As I already mentioned, at the end of the MEPs' interventions, the Commission will be given another chance to discuss these four major objections in more detail."
"Before the Commission does this, it would like to hear MEPs' opinions."
"This would enable the Commission to give better responses this evening."
"Mr President, Commission, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to say a word of thanks to all my fellow Members of this House, and particularly the shadow rapporteurs, with whom I have worked closely in order to pilot the report on sales promotion into the plenary."
"It has been a long journey with many obstacles along the way, which started in 1996 with the first publication of the Green Paper, followed by the Commission's follow-up communication in 1998."
"Further to extensive consultation, the Commission introduced a pragmatic and clearly defined proposal in October 2001, for which I was appointed rapporteur in November 2001."
"In the field of sales promotions, this draft regulation aims to eliminate obsolete measures and major discrepancies in the relevant legislation of the fifteen Member States."
"These many discrepancies prevent particularly small and medium-size enterprises from breaking through on the various European markets."
"It goes without saying that when enterprises cannot communicate across their borders, they cannot do any business at international level."
"In addition, sales promotion has many facets and can be tailored to different circumstances."
"It can be used to launch innovative products onto the market, to promote customer relations, to stimulate short-term campaigns by giving them a competitive edge, to react promptly to falling sales figures and as a means of effective stock management."
"Furthermore, this regulation will also put the consumer in a considerably stronger position."
"Not only will consumers receive far more information, but they will also, via the development of the internal market, be able to take full advantage of better pricing."
"After all, a bigger internal market increases competition, which leads to lower prices, partly brought about by the euro."
"This is why I consider this proposal to be a very important initiative for the internal market's future development."
"It is also a first step towards translating the fine words spoken at the Lisbon Summit into action."
"After all, nobody can deny that two years after this much-debated summit, disappointingly little progress has been made."
"Did Europe not want to become the most competitive knowledge-based economy?"
"I believe that the time has come to make another step in the right direction with a regulation of this kind on sales promotion."
"Its far-reaching consequences and the many interests involved have meant that this proposal has spawned quite a reaction, to which the Commissioner referred earlier."
"I should like to underline the key challenges."
"As far as the legal basis is concerned, I have always taken the view that a regulation, thanks to the swifter entry into force and its direct applicability, is a much more effective legal instrument than a directive."
"The issue of sale below cost is being temporarily deferred because the positions in the different Member States vary too widely."
"I have tabled a compromise amendment on this, in which I ask the Commission to carry out a thorough investigation into the subject."
"The reason for tabling such an amendment is that I do not want the liberalisation of sale below cost to have a detrimental effect on small and medium-size enterprises."
"I have therefore tabled an amendment with regard to the latter, which contains the explicit request to protect them."
"In this proposal, mutual recognition or - in other words - the principle of the country of origin, is of major importance."
"This principle is also the internal market's keystone."
"It simply means that Members have to recognise that they cannot apply their own national legislation to incoming promotions."
"This mutual recognition of each other's legislation is a flexible means of avoiding overregulation."
"In addition, it is already a commonly used form of legislation in our Community legislation."
"The television without frontiers directive and the e-commerce directive are two cases in point."
"Finally, I should like to comment on the stipulation of an age limit for children."
"I have always been in favour of the age of fourteen, unless specific products require other age limits."
"Following extensive bilateral consultation with fellow MEPs from the various committees, I have managed to resolve these challenges in a pragmatic manner."
"I am pleased with the outcome, even though I realise that further adjustments will need to be made in the course of further discussion on the motion for a resolution."
"I hope that Parliament has bowled the Council an important first ball, and I look forward to this debate with great interest."
"Mr President, the regulation on sales promotions is a problematic and controversial dossier, as has been made clear by what Commissioner Bolkestein and Mr Beysen have had to say."
"I would like to thank Mr Beysen for such a useful result having emerged from such lengthy considerations."
"That was really difficult, as the discussion was dominated by consumer protection, completion of the internal market, the bureaucracy that is to be found in the Member States, and the concerns of smaller enterprises."
"The European treaties established the principle of an open market economy with free competition."
"It is functioning markets rather than bureaucracy that best ensure the public interest."
"Enforcing these competition rules is a matter for the Member States on the one hand and for the European institutions on the other."
"It is precisely the introduction of the euro that makes it so necessary to harmonise in this area."
"All but a very few of the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs welcomed the basic line of the Commission's draft regulation and delivered itself of an opinion that is more concerned with the Internal Market than is the final draft from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"It was particularly with regard to the country of origin principle that we were more frank."
"Admittedly, we wanted to retain the national cartel rules and the rules against unfair competition, but also to go one step further."
"It is right that the provisions on cartel law in the Treaty establishing the European Communities and the essential national provisions on bargain sales should be maintained, as they protect smaller businesses against big groups of companies."
"Derogations for specific areas such as lotteries, members of the professions, and medicines are to be laid down, and they are justifiable."
"The explicit adoption of customer loyalty schemes alongside the customary discounts is likewise right and necessary, but the Commission did not take it into account."
"The deletion of the rule prohibiting sales below cost price, as demanded by the Economic Committee and taken up by the Legal Affairs Committee, is right and proper."
"On this, I want to expressly contradict Commissioner Bolkestein's remarks."
"The Commission proposed transparency obligations as a precondition for the planned prohibition of sales below cost price, and these bear no relation to current practice, are questionable from the point of view of competition law and would lead to agreements to fix the resale price."
"That cannot be our objective, and so, Commissioner, I do not believe that you will find a majority in Parliament in favour of this scheme."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the least we can say is that the vote on this proposal for a regulation to liberalise sales promotions is taking place prematurely."
"Once again, the Commission has put the cart before the horse without waiting for the European Parliament's point of view."
"The Commission has already favoured the open option in a Green Paper on consumer protection, which will not be examined by the House until several weeks' time."
"Therefore, in addition to the slightly incoherent character of the approach taken, one cannot fail to condemn the lack of attention paid to Parliament's point of view, which has been reduced to a mere rubber-stamping of the policies that have been predetermined by the Commission."
"The choice of legal instrument that makes up the regulation plays a significant part in this."
"A framework directive leaving a margin of flexibility for Member States could have been better adapted, but it would certainly have sparked off debates at national level once again, debates that had been concluded by the choice of regulation, which is something that the Commission did not desire."
"I would particularly like to emphasise the issue of mutual recognition, a principle recommended by the Commission to improve the way the internal market works."
"The practical difficulties posed by applying this principle should be highlighted."
"The consumer has no knowledge whatsoever of foreign law, just as a judge in a national court has difficulty when it comes to applying the legal rules of one country other than his own."
"Secondly, there is a risk that mutual recognition will lead to deregulation that is harmful to both economic operators as well as consumers."
"Operators that are put at a disadvantage by this principle will evidently be tempted to put pressure upon their government to align their national legislation with legislation that is more liberal."
"This will therefore lead to a downward alignment of consumer policy throughout the European Union."
"That is why I proposed replacing this principle, which, incidentally, has been worded in an extremely vague manner in the proposal for a regulation, with a formula which is, in fact, that used in the established case law of the European Court of Justice."
"As for the rest, I believe that the text, as it appears following the votes in the relevant committees, still contains the vital part of what the Member States consider necessary for the protection of their consumers."
"Nevertheless, the debate on a genuine European consumer policy has not been held and we certainly hope to hold this debate in the near future, when the Green Paper is presented to the House."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 10% more for the same price, a second pair of glasses for 1 extra euro, three for the price of two, a free gift with any purchase?these are the usual signs of so-called sales promotions."
"When you take advantage of this type of opportunity, you probably do not realise the subtlety of a phenomenon that is as economic as it is cultural."
"The differences in the definition of free gift, bonus, discount and promotional game are extremely subtle, and what the French will consider to be fair will be unthinkable to a German, whilst the English will not understand why their neighbours are sticking to so many rules and will consider the consumer to be naive."
"This report is a good example of how economic and cultural issues overlap, which partly explains the passionate response that it has evoked."
"The initial response was to reject the report."
"However, given Mr Beysen's determined attitude and following a conciliation process that was no less determined in nature by my colleagues in the PPE-DE, we opted for a position that is in line with our commitment to the Community."
"We therefore came out in favour of regulation which, in a market regulated by the euro, liberalises and makes uniform sales promotions, whilst ensuring, however, that the same regulation protects both consumers as well as small and medium-sized businesses."
"From this perspective, we dismissed sales liberalisation and below cost resale, by asking the European Commission to carry out a more detailed study on this specific subject."
"For the management of this Community promotion, we could only refer back to the principle of mutual recognition, which is fundamental and underpins the entire internal market infrastructure."
"That said, in this specific case, we had to clearly redefine the scope of the principle, since there are significant differences between the various national legislations."
"The proposed text originally contained more than 300 amendments."
"These were finally cut down to 58, which not only represents a considerable effort but also a Community will to forge ahead."
"Do not forget that, at Lisbon, the Heads of State and Government made the commitment to make Europe the world's most competitive nation."
"We all needed to keep an open mind, to show great willing and to listen carefully to others, and a clear sign has thus been sent to the governments of the Member States."
"That is why we recommend adopting the text in the form that was approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs and to reject the amendments tabled in plenary."
"The internal market has enormous potential and we can overcome any difficulty if we have to will to succeed."
"Mr President, we all agree on the need to allow companies across Europe to run the EU-wide sales promotions."
"Sales promotions are key tools to marketing goods and services and we need to get rid of restrictions and barriers so as to allow business and consumers to exploit the opportunities of the internal market."
"In the UK it is commonplace that consumers can and do benefit from sales promotions, for example coupon vouchers."
"In 2000, for example, 531 million coupons were redeemed in the UK; between 1999 and 2000 there was a 122.5% increase in consumer use of Internet coupons and promotions."
"So they are popular and we need to regulate and open up this area for consumers and business."
"It is, however, important that the Commission addresses some of the concerns of Members of the European Parliament and of my political group on the issue of sales below cost in particular."
"We also tabled the amendment to require the Commission to come forward with a study in this area."
"There are legitimate concerns, because sometimes sales below cost can be abused to squeeze out competitors by means of predatory pricing; this does not help small business, nor does it help the consumer."
"That is why, in the spirit of better legislation called for by Commissioner Prodi recently, my group will give the Commission conditional support for the regulation if it agrees to carry out an evaluation study to examine exactly how sales below cost can benefit both small businesses and consumers."
"This study should also address the need to strengthen competition policy instruments to prevent predatory pricing and its unwanted side effects."
"The internal market should not be a free-for-all for big business, leading to SMEs being squeezed out of markets with the result that consumers have less choice."
"We must also make sure that the information requirements in the annex are clear."
"It is important that business is clear about its obligations to provide information on promotions."
"It is also important that consumers have sufficient information and legal redress, either through the law courts or through ADR systems."
"The PSE Group has therefore tabled an amendment asking the Commission to work in consultation with consumer groups and industry to ensure the clear and unambiguous execution of the information requirements."
"As they are currently drafted, they are misleading and have led both to business lobbying MEPs and complaining about the lack of clarity and to consumers letting us know that there are information gaps."
"If this regulation is to achieve legal certainty then the requirements must be clear."
"However, I agree with the Commissioner that the answer is not, as the PPE-DE Group has proposed, to delete those requirements and, like the Commission, we will be voting against those deletions."
"The PSE Group has taken a strong line to protect minors against harmful promotions relating to alcohol and tobacco."
"I hope those will be taken on board."
"Finally, a very brief point on mutual recognition."
"I personally believe that mutual recognition already works."
"Every day on the Internet, cross-border sales and business are alive and thriving, using the principle of mutual recognition."
"We cannot bury our heads in the sand and deny the fact that this is already happening."
"Mr President, this is an important piece of legislation which will really help to improve and consolidate the single market by ensuring that we do not have excessive cross-border differences about sales promotion rules."
"It is justifiably a regulation because it simply removes certain sorts of bans on sales promotions while leaving it to the states to pursue their own particular legal, economic and political preference in other cases."
"So in this sense it is an important contribution to the consolidation of the single market and my group will support it in much the same spirit and also support much the same amendments as Mrs McCarthy has just done on behalf of the PSE."
"I would like to stress a few points."
"First of all, this is not an attack on consumer protection."
"Indeed some of the amendments make it absolutely clear that we want to see the maximum liberty of sales promotions that is consistent with proper consumer protection laws."
"Secondly, there is a degree of concern about the fate of small businesses faced with large retail organisations whose forms of sales promotion may be thought to encourage the closing down of the corner shop and the aggrandisation of the supermarket."
"We are certainly against that and we underline in the amendments we support and in those we supported in committee that the sales promotion laws must be seen to be wholly in conformity with competition law and with the avoidance of abuse of dominant position in markets."
"Given these safeguards, including the safeguards for minors, my group will with great goodwill vote for this measure today."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's proposal for a regulation shows that the obsession to make everything uniform with no regard for subsidiarity will affect those on the lowest incomes."
"The elected representatives of the CPNT [Chasse Pêche Nature Traditions] group are not prepared to abandon small retailers and smallholders to the sharks of the mass distribution sector, which is free to embark on the anti-competitive practice of sales below cost."
"Several national laws forbid this type of underhand behaviour."
"The consumer will actually suffer on two counts."
"Below cost sales is not an act of charity, but the taking over of a market share, which will have to be compensated elsewhere."
"Citizens will also suffer from the closure of local facilities, which are already in great difficulty in rural areas and town centres."
"The quality of the work carried out by our fellow Members in the Committee on Legal Affairs is not in question and many negative details have been eliminated, but there is a risk that the Commission, as on many other matters, will ignore this work and will, for the most part, stand by its original position."
"To sum up, we believe that the only appropriate and responsible political option, as has been proposed to you, is to reject the Commission's proposals, as this will be in everyone's interests."
"If you agree to let the rot set in, you should not be the first to complain when all goes wrong in the future."
"Mr President, every freedom is based on a balance."
"Economic freedom is based on a balance between the interests of consumers and that of entrepreneurs and distributors."
"This freedom will certainly be lost if we establish an inequality that will benefit one or another party."
"This is what the Commission has quite simply attempted to do under the misleading pretext, once again, of forced harmonisation."
"By attempting to remove restrictions on sales promotions put in place by the Member States, the Commission is removing the essential safeguards that the national legislations had put in place in order to protect both the interests of consumers, of small producers and retailers."
"Dangerous and irresponsible commercial practices would come about from resale below cost or the deregulation of sale periods and conditions, and our economies would eventually suffer."
"Furthermore, the changeover to the euro should not serve as an excuse to increase prices."
"Therefore, I can only welcome the amendments which were adopted in the various parliamentary committees that were involved in this text and which continue to observe national legislation in this respect."
"Downward harmonisation, which is what the Commission appears to desire, runs counter to common sense and to healthy business for economic players, and in particular for the most fragile players."
"Local businesses and small businesses are the driving force behind our economy."
"I think it is necessary to emphasise this and to reiterate that, without them, the diversity of supply and the guarantee of quality would disappear."
"However, they also play a role in providing a social and economic balance in our society."
"Be careful not to disrupt this balance, this would not be in anyone's interest, not in our capacity as consumers, nor in our capacity as politicians."
"Thank you very much."
"The debate is adjourned. I shall now give the floor to Mr Harbour to move a point of order before we commence voting time."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I am sure I speak on behalf of all my colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, some of whom are still here."
"Can I protest to you on behalf of all my colleagues working on this dossier about the quite unacceptable way in which this debate has been scheduled?"
"We started this debate at 11.30 a.m.."
"The session services knew it would not be finished and there are other debates scheduled later which you know from your computer system could have been slotted in there."
"We now have to adjourn the continuation of this debate until 9.30 p.m."
"Mrs Montfort and my colleague from the EDD have spoken under quite unacceptable circumstances."
"This is not the right way to run a chamber that is supposed to be having a serious debate on these subjects."
"It is not necessary to do this; there is no reason to split debates."
"You have the information and I suggest that it is not right to allow proper contributions while people are coming into the chamber."
"I hope all colleagues will support me in saying we should seriously get a grip on how business in this chamber is run."
"Mr Harbour, I have taken careful note of your complaint, which will be forwarded to the services responsible for scheduling our order of business."
"Whilst you have been talking, your fellow Members have taken their seats and we shall now proceed to the vote."
"Mr President, we have taken over ten minutes to get from the ninth floor down to the Chamber."
"The lifts are absolutely useless - either that or the architects who planned them are."
"(Loud applause)"
"My fellow Member sitting next to me has made a very good comment."
"He said, 'We have the safest lifts in the whole of Europe."
"They are so safe because they no longer work."
"That way, nothing can go wrong.'"
"But perhaps they should do the job they were designed to do."
"Mr President, on a point of order, the reason why the lifts did not appear to be working was that the security guards were standing at the bottom with about three of them blocked off, apparently for some delegation that is visiting Parliament!"
"Because this building is so badly designed, the lifts barely have enough capacity for Members as it is, without the security guards taking over two or three of them at precisely the time when everybody is coming down to vote."
"The sessional services should get themselves better organised."
"Mr President, I would like to say that I was stuck in a lift for 15 minutes, so the lifts really are not working."
"We will have the services look into all of that."
"The only assurance I can give you is that the President was not blocking a lift."
"The next item is the vote."
"Request, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, for consultation of the Committee of the Regions on the role of the regions in the process of European integration."
"(Parliament approved the request)"
"Report (A5-0268/2002) by Michel Rocard, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision amending Decision No 253/2000/EC establishing the second phase of the Community action programme in the field of education 'Socrates' (COM(2002) 193 - C5-0188/2002 - 2002/0101(COD))"
"(Parliament adopted the text)"
"Report (A5-0260/2002) by Salvador Jové Peres, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision amending Decision 96/411/EC on improving Community agricultural statistics (COM(2002) 080 - C5-0064/2002 - 2002/0044(COD))"
"Before the vote:"
"Mr President, I will be brief."
"Since 1996, this Parliament has been arguing for the use of the administrative documentation resulting from the EAGGF-Guarantee payments for statistical purposes."
"The Community policy which absorbs the most funds generates an enormous amount of information, which we do not currently take advantage of."
"That information could provide a much more up-to-date result, and a much more up-to-date and reliable picture of Community agriculture, than many much more expensive and less reliable investigations."
"Today we are dealing with the mid-term review of Agenda 2000, and it would be desirable to confront it with more and better statistical information."
"The reason why the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has withdrawn its amendments is that, during the debate, the Commission published a report on the creation of a database on payments made by the EAGGF-Guarantee, in other words, on the distribution of agricultural aid."
"The Agriculture Committee believes that that report satisfied our demands since the Commission had committed itself to transparency towards Parliament and the whole of society."
"The second point of the conclusions of that report lays down that the said database will begin to operate after 1 January 2003, although this will not prevent the presentation of indicative figures before that date."
"While repeating to the Commission that we need that information for the purposes of the mid-term reform of Agenda 2000, I would like the Commission to answer a simple question: on what date will the database in question begin to operate, and when will the indicative figures be presented?"
"The sooner this is, the better will be the work of our committee and the work on the review of Agenda 2000."
"Mr President, the answer to this question is that, as Commissioner Fischler has already indicated in various letters to Members of this House, in early autumn he intends to publish statistical information on the recipients of direct payments, classified according to the amount."
"The statistics will cover 14 Member States, because figures for Greece are still not available."
"This will, of course, be statistical information only and it will not contain any personal information on those recipients."
". (FI) Mr President, the Commission proposed that the European Community should approve the Joint Convention, but it wanted to put forward a reservation with regard to Article 27."
"The Article is important as it allows the signatories to the Convention to unilaterally ban the import of foreign spent fuel and radioactive waste."
"Why, then, should there be a reservation?"
"The Committee having deliberated on the matter, the following can be stated: an EU Member State may categorically and unilaterally ban the import of spent nuclear fuel from a non-EU state."
"An EU Member State may also ban the import of spent fuel from another Member State when it is no longer intended for reprocessing but disposal in another country."
"A country cannot unilaterally impose a ban on the import of spent fuel meant for reprocessing."
"The reservation with regard to Article 27 that the Commission is proposing would not clear the way for an EU single market for the disposal of nuclear waste; it would instead allow the EC to amend Directive 92/3/Euratom to ensure compatibility with the Joint Convention."
"Mr President, I propose to the House to adopt the text of Amendment No 33 without the words 'and training': this is because we have already added the case of rapid mobilisation to the many cases in which the Single Sky rules can be suspended."
"Adding 'training of their armed forces' would mean rendering all the legislation we are adopting on the Single Sky totally unusable."
"This is why I am calling for the two words 'and training' to be removed."
"So far, the Socrates programme has made an important contribution to educational exchanges, but it is costly to run and smothered in red tape."
"Technically, the Commission proposal responds to Parliament's proposals for less red tape, but far more needs to be done before the smallest, remotest institutions will find it easy to take part in the programme."
"The CAP accounts for almost half of the EU budget and it is only correct that every euro spent should be accounted for."
"I fully support the need for efficient databases."
"However, let us remember what the aim of such data collection is."
"It should allow for a more efficient administration of the CAP and more efficient use of public funds."
"Simplification is the key: not complication."
"We do not need to create even more paperwork and administrative hassle for already beleaguered farmers."
"If we want to encourage people to stay in farming - in particular young people - we must not turn farming into a career that is more to do with mountains of paperwork than producing food and taking care of the land."
"We must take particular care to avoid duplication of effort."
"There are a lot of data available, supplied by farmers in meeting the requirements of various programmes and schemes, available to national and European authorities."
"Let the efforts be at an administrative level in terms of sharing information and statistics, making information systems compatible and so on. Those who, like myself, represent large agricultural constituencies will surely oppose seeing any further administrative burdens foisted on farmers."
"As can be seen in its explanatory statement, this report appears, in substance, to be trying to keep everyone happy: the Commission, which is implementing the deregulation; the Member States which are - for the time being - responsible for ensuring safety; the major airlines, upon whom there is no question of imposing overly restrictive - and, above all, excessively costly - regulations; the low cost airlines, upon whom the report is seeking to impose certain minimum standards, as long as these do not affect their profits?"
"This is undoubtedly an example of what the European authorities can do in this area: they are setting standards for work, rest and time on board for crews and commercial flight personnel."
"These EU-wide standards may offer personnel a minimum of guarantees and that is why we did not vote against the report."
"But this minimum is so minimalist that it is certainly the most that we could expect from the European authorities, which, above all, do not want to cause difficulties for employers in the air transport sector."
"Today it is widely recognised that cabin crews bear a huge responsibility and are of increasing importance to passenger safety, given the current climate in civil aviation."
"It is crucial that we harmonise flight times, working hours and rest requirements for cabin staff, not only in view of future enlargement but also, and especially, because we feel that there is an urgent need to protect these workers in light of the expansion of low cost airlines in the European Union."
"This is why we support this report, which seeks to remedy a shortcoming on the part of the Commission in not including this matter in its proposal for a Regulation, which we can only deplore, all the more because various Members States still have no legislation on this matter."
"Nevertheless, we wish to stress the importance of maintaining existing national legislation that is more favourable to workers than the proposal that has now been approved."
". (PT) This is a proposal concerning a very technical and detailed regulation, which is intended to harmonise, in the name of air safety, the rules governing flight times and crew rest time, in order to ensure that all operators enjoy similar working conditions and common safety standards."
"Despite the broad support of the airlines, the pilots' unions have not backed the rapporteur's proposals, taking the view that the flight times are exaggerated."
"The concerns of the rapporteur, who stated that he was happy to have concluded negotiations that had been dragging on for a considerable time, had the almost unanimous support of his colleagues in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"Consequently, it is considered that the solution that has been reached is the best and perhaps the only one possible. I therefore share the rapporteur's conclusions."
"The eleventh UNRWA convention on improving the situation of refugees in the Middle East, who include some 4 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan, is ultra urgent given the tragic situation facing the Palestinian people today as a result of Sharon's policy."
"The increase in the EU contribution from EUR 120 million to EUR 237 million is also important, although this sum should be enhanced when the budget is drafted."
"But most important of all, the ?U and the international community as a whole should call on the Sharon government in Israel to bear the full cost of restoring the infrastructure which its military action has destroyed, causing a sharp drop in the standard of living of the Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip and occupied territories."
"We voted in favour of this report because, of course, we are not opposed to aid from European countries being granted to Palestinian refugees."
"There is nothing, however, to boast about when you see the increase in the amount of this aid."
"If you take the number of Palestinian refugees crammed into the countries of the Middle East, the sum being proposed only represents approximately EUR 40 per year at the most."
"Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the full amount will go directly to refugees, and that, along the way, it will not grease the palms of European companies and suppliers."
"Above all, however, how can we fail to mention the hypocrisy of the report which criticises the fact that 'refugees' living conditions are becoming increasingly difficult' and which has the gall to blame, in particular, the 'high population growth' but which does not even mention the war conducted by the State of Israel against the Palestinian nation? The report does not condemn the fact that, although thousands of Palestinians are forced to live in refugee camps, this is because the State of Israel, with the support of the most powerful nations, Europe included, is opposed to them being able to return to the land from which they were driven?"
"The question of safety of nuclear fuel shipments is an urgent one."
"At this very moment two shipments of nuclear fuel which were rejected by Japan because of the falsification of safety data by BNFL are approaching the shores of Europe, and will enter the narrow confines of the Irish Sea."
"The movement of this dangerous cargo at this time is spitting in the face of the victims of September 11."
"These ships are not capable of withstanding a terrorist attack, and they are not capable withstanding a fire."
"They are an invitation to terrorists to hijack material for the making of a nuclear bomb."
"We now have the ludicrous situation of the nuclear industry shopping dangerous radioactive material around the planet."
"The convention should not be seen as giving a green light to the nuclear industry for such trafficking of deadly material."
"I urge the Irish Government to take action under the Convention to stop these shipments."
"The Convention recognises that any State has the right to ban imports into its territory of foreign spent fuel and radioactive waste."
"This should also apply to the coast waters of the Irish Sea which are already dangerously polluted with radioactive waste."
"Mr President, Mr Deva's report concerns the eradication of poverty and food security."
"It contains many important proposals on how to eradicate poverty and guarantee food security, proposals which I fully support and which I was pleased to vote for."
"However, Mr President, how many pensioners are there in the whole of the developed world who would still be able to teach and work in poor, developing countries, who could help to improve the economic situation?"
"How little do we ourselves do in the European Union to help these pensioners, these elderly people who still feel able to be useful to society and would like to go and work in these developing countries?"
"I hope that more will be done in future."
". (NL) There are various reasons why the Deva report has not received my support."
"First of all, the proposal to abolish all subsidies in the EU is one-sided."
"I am all in favour of removing barriers for products from poor countries, but there are also good reasons for retaining regional production or environmental subsidies."
"The impact on the developing countries is, although essential, not the only consideration."
"Accordingly, it would make sense for the WTO to make allowance in the trade rules for the extent to which the consumption of a specific product affects nature, starting with the production process and including transport to the country of consumption."
"A second point of criticism concerns the implementation of ethical investment."
"The report is making a step in the wrong direction."
"It concerns itself with the internal organisation of the management where it prescribes the establishment of an internal committee and the sections of the company to which this is accountable."
"It would be preferable to look into strategies which would allow ethical investment to be introduced on a larger scale."
"There is particular room for improvement in measurability and reporting."
"Finally, the plea to review the common policy on public health is inappropriate since the health policy does not fall within the Community's remit."
". (NL) Mr Deva's proposal is the best we can expect from a British Conservative."
"He believes in capitalism, but also has consideration for the way in which the difference in welfare between Europe and the developing world has developed over the centuries."
"He knows that our industry owed its rise to protectionism rather than to a laissez-faire attitude, and realises that the WTO Agreement on investment measures hinders the developing countries in their attempts to develop a local industry by promoting local products."
"His views on a reliable legal system, the fight against corruption, transfers of technology, health care, women's emancipation and land reforms, as expressed in his initiative proposal, receive my support."
"I also endorse the EU's tasks: a different contribution to the WTO, a reduction in export subsidies, no sale of unsafe food or of insecticides that are banned here, a ban on the trade in firearms, cancellation of debts and concrete measures against European companies and people involved in illegal trading in diamonds, oil and gold."
"On the other hand, I do not share the rapporteur's optimism about ethical investments by entrepreneurs and about the contribution of trade liberalisation to development, because the cheap acquisition of resources in the developing world remains an important ambition for many entrepreneurs."
". (PT) The Deva report acknowledges a universally positive aspect of the phenomenon of globalisation, which is that it contributes to the creation of economic, social and cultural wealth for the entire world."
"He emphasises, however, that the poorest do not participate in this 'benefit gain' which results from technological progress and the growth of international trade."
"In order to free ourselves from the blind pursuit of globalisation, the rapporteur suggests emphasising the concept of 'maximising the advantages of the least advantaged section of the global community'."
"The report seeks, therefore, to reconcile the global principle of the positive aspect of trade liberalisation with the need to force multinational companies to adhere to the same types of regulatory, stabilising, and legitimising functions that are binding at national level, which is why I have voted in favour of the report."
"Mr President, of course I voted for the report on recycling and on the recovery of packaging, which it discusses, but I have to say that, when I was discussing the report with a pensioner, Mrs Caterina Rossi, from Bergamo, she said to me, 'What a good report!"
"So packaging can serve some purpose!"
"Even the paper which surrounds packages, even wood and plastic can be reused and are good for something!"
"Why is it, then, that it is sometimes said that we pensioners are no longer any use?"
"Do you mean we are less useful than packaging, than the paper which surrounds all the products sold?"
"I hope that Parliament will pay more attention to pensioners and the elderly, at least as much attention as it pays to packaging, which - and this is good news - the European Parliament sees as so useful: let us hope that the pensioners and elderly people of all the individual States as well as the European State will be considered to be this useful."
"Every year, the European Union produces more than 60 million tonnes of waste packaging."
"And, despite the objective of stabilisation in the Fifth Environment Action Programme, despite the fact that waste prevention is the first priority of European environmental policy, the situation is more or less the same: the amount of packaging continues to increase in the European Union."
"In the light of this growing mountain of waste, it is high time that we developed an ambitious strategy."
"This strategy must involve enhancing the Commission's modest proposal; in other words, by introducing prevention and producer responsibility."
"The European Parliament has already expressed itself in favour of raising recycling targets and improving prevention by introducing producer responsibility."
"The Commission's proposal has not taken this on board."
"Yet, prevention is a genuine priority in the area of waste management, and could even become the cornerstone of the European environmental policy."
"We have before us a real opportunity to move forward in terms of an integrated product policy and the thematic strategy of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme."
"I shall support the report, which also emphasises two concepts that are key to a successful environmental policy: cooperation, which we need from everyone, and the fact that the impact we have on the environment should always, in future, guide our action."
". (NL) Packaging is what the consumer is left with when he buys a new product."
"It has become more bulky over the years, not only to protect the content of boxes, but also, and particularly, to catch the eye of potential buyers."
"Packaging material has become increasingly colourful, and contains, more than the simple cardboard boxes before, material that is harmful to the environment, including heavy metals."
"It was high time that the European Commission proposed altering the Directive on packaging and packaging waste introduced eight years ago, but the proposed change leaves something to be desired."
"The emphasis on generating energy by incineration is wrong, for this only allows the producers and processors of polluting packaging to carry on as before."
"Attention should instead be directed to the prevention of waste and the reuse of material."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is right to want to recycle at least 65% of the weight, completely ban the use of lead, cadmium, mercury or hexavalent chromium from 2007 and to subject new packaging material to stricter requirements from 2004."
"I also welcome the initiative to produce 10% less packaging waste in 2006 than in 1998 and to reassess national and European rules concerning the obstacles they constitute for reuse."
"I wholeheartedly support this report which addresses the need to tackle the growing mountain of waste in the EU."
"The original Commission text should be upgraded and tightened up to ensure a more ambitious strategy for countering this mountain of discarded packaging materials."
"As such, I welcome the concepts of prevention and producer responsibility; these will go some way in ensuring that the onus for implementing these measures is evenly spread across European citizens."
"I also welcome the call for producers to have taken 'all necessary measures to minimise its environmental impact', whilst at the same time I recognise that it may be difficult to standardise such a measure."
"Finally, placing this Directive into a broader context, to ensure that it is compatible with the Sixth Environment Action Programme, makes good sense and demonstrates that the EU is capable of joined-up thinking and a sensible approach to this matter."
"Mr President, I would like to talk about Mr Fava's report on the creation of the Single European Sky."
"My colleague and right-hand man, Giuseppe Italia, from Cremona, an elderly pensioner, said to me as I was preparing to come here to Strasbourg, 'I advise you to vote for the report on the Single European Sky."
"I am an elderly pensioner, and I will not take offence, Mr Fatuzzo, if you say in your explanation of vote that we pensioners are nearer to the sky than the other citizens."
"Would it not be appropriate, given that we are already near the sky, for us to be eligible for discounted aeroplane tickets and for pensioners to be encouraged to travel by air with less expensive tickets in this way?'."
"I voted against the 'Single Sky' initiative, which resembles more of a manoeuvre by the Commission to increase its power (with, as usual, the unconditional support of the European Parliament) than an initiative that is genuinely designed to improve air safety and increase the flow of air traffic."
"During yesterday's debate, I drew attention to a major difficulty that is still to be resolved, that of relations with Eurocontrol."
"I must now mention another: that of relations with the military."
"The Commission has declared its intention, as soon as it gains the powers conferred by the 'Single Sky' project, to alter the distribution of airspace between civilian and military use."
"The objective is perfectly clear: to make inroads into military zones or even withdraw them, in order to facilitate civilian air traffic."
"We are doubly shocked by this method, which essentially seems to assume that military uses are less important today in Europe, an idea which in turn assumes that we are enjoying a period of lasting peace."
"This is a naïve and dangerous assumption."
"As far as the procedure is concerned, let us reiterate that the Commission has no military responsibility (which is fortunate, as is evident here)."
"This responsibility belongs to the sovereign States and Community procedures have nothing to do with this area."
"- (DA) The June Movement does not agree with the entire content but has voted in favour of the report because airspace is a cross-border problem requiring common European solutions."
"That is something we want to signal by means of our 'yes' vote."
"Although we cannot deny that some progress has been made with regard to the rules governing air traffic control, the will, re-stated by the Commissioner responsible for this dossier, to speed up the liberalisation of air transport services entails risks which have been clearly expressed by the relevant trade unions."
"Unfortunately, they have not been heard sufficiently, not to mention listened to, except by a few left-wing Members."
"We cannot, however, believe that the effects of liberalisation are solely positive."
"We need only observe the sad deterioration of rail transport services in certain Member States since their liberalisation."
"What was initially proposed was the introduction of competition separating service providers (operators) and regulators (establishment of and compliance with rules)."
"Under pressure, the Commission has fortunately had to review its text, which is still mediocre and dangerous."
"Air navigation services will, therefore, be liberalised, resulting in real safety hazards."
"The Commission proposes, in connection with its efforts to achieve harmonisation at Community level, the introduction of a system of authorisations for the provision of air navigation services."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
". (FR) I am bound, in the end, to lend my support to this report, which emphasises the importance of the Commission proposal to create a Single European Sky by 31 December 2004 at the latest."
"Creating a Single European Sky seems to me to be imperative if we want not only to optimise the use of our existing airspace, to establish more stringent aviation safety conditions, and the safe and effective management of projected increases in traffic, but also to create conditions allowing European airlines to compete with others."
"This proposal, which must allow a certain amount of harmonisation and interoperability of air navigation systems, is not, however, without its problems."
"The definition of cooperation between Eurocontrol and the Community is one such problem, as is the definition of cooperation between civil and military authorities."
"I am supporting this report to emphasise that the creation of a Single European Sky must not be delayed in any way."
"A reduction in costs relating to air traffic control, fewer delays and increased system capacity are all at stake, as well as, in particular, a considerable improvement of the safety conditions."
"On the pretext of wanting to create 'an integrated airspace governed by the same principles and rules', the Council, the Commission and the Fava report are actually proposing the establishment of a means of air traffic control in Europe based on economic criteria, in other words, a Single Sky market."
"Was the air disaster in Germany last July an example of what we can expect from the Single European Sky?"
"The air traffic control company Skyguide was a private company."
"It operated in a functional airspace in which operator and regulator were separate."
"Skyguide was so lacking in human and material resources that safety was affected."
"Is this the path we should follow, as the Commission recommends?"
"In any event, this accident should make Members of Parliament extremely prudent pending the results of the enquiries, and also in light of the consequences of the effective liberalisation of other means of transport such as rail transport in the United Kingdom."
"That was the message of the major European strike by air traffic controllers on 19 June 2002."
"Instead of swearing by the market alone, we should favour cooperation, such as exists within the organisation for air safety, Eurocontrol."
"We should pay more attention to public service and safety."
"We should think globally about the intermodality of transport."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
". (NL) There is a noticeable tendency to scale up in all areas in which the EU is involved, and it often results in a decrease in the democratic involvement of the people and a lack of sound, custom-made solutions."
"This is why I generally view scaling up in a negative light."
"I would make an exception for aviation, which, in most cases, involves cross-border connections and long distances."
"To maintain national navigation systems and fragment the airspace into small areas would not be conducive to safety."
"It would therefore seem obvious to hand over this task as a whole to the existing Eurocontrol that has monitored the airspace of the Benelux countries and western Germany for a long time."
"This should also apply to military air traffic, which, particularly in France, is still able to occupy an unacceptably large part of the airspace."
"It is a pity that, now of all times, we are missing the opportunity of having clear and safe management of the airspace."
"The letting of airspace blocks for a fixed period of time will only perpetuate the old fragmentation in a different form."
"Geographical fragmentation will make way for economic fragmentation."
"This is something on which I shall expand when I speak on the report by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte."
"."
"(FR) The Commission proposes, by means of these regulations, to dismantle the existing systems, the better to serve economic interests."
"The sky is to be divided into functional blocks that will be sold separately to service providers."
"All the services will be liberalised (control, radio, radar, search and rescue and meteorological)."
"This 'Single Sky market' goes against common sense and the principles of safety and public service."
"The British rail service has clearly shown this."
"Multiple operators and competition between service providers have been detrimental to investment in maintenance, to increasing safety and to improving staff working conditions."
"What is needed is quite the opposite."
"More cooperation is required between air navigation services, and safety must be ensured by means of integrated systems."
"More public control over air transport is needed at European level, to make way for intermodal passenger and freight transport schemes."
"The Commission proposals and the report under examination are not a step in this direction."
"That is why we have voted against them."
". (NL) I have already indicated, in my remarks on the Fava report, that scaling up may be inevitable, but that unfortunately, the wrong choices are once again being proposed."
"Mandatory tendering, for a limited period of time, for public tasks by private companies that compete among themselves - something which has been suggested before for public transport and ports - is now also being applied as a solution to organising air safety."
"This means that each airspace block can end up with a different company, although in the long run, a near-monopoly is bound to emerge and will control the lion's share of the airspace."
"The neo-liberal ideology will then triumph over safety."
"In this model, safety has given way to cost-cutting as a primary concern."
"It is believed that costs can be reduced by the use of fewer staff, and under poorer working conditions."
"Since these people are dotted around various companies with different interests, which are continually concerned about their chances of winning or losing the next tender, workers get the feeling that their work is no longer as vital as before, and this will inevitably lead to a drop in its quality."
"Moreover, the military are still not ending their occupation of the airspace."
"This approach gets no support from me."
". (FR) Naturally we are in favour of maximum air safety."
"We have, however, abstained on this report as it only addresses this matter from the point of view of the airlines and airport management bodies."
"As the rapporteur points out, it is also significant that the directive does not put forward a single measure with regard to the safety of communities living near airports."
"The European Parliament and Council consider this to be a question, principally, of establishing a unified system that will allow the European Union to exclude less safe aeroplanes from its airports and also to prevent certain Member States from being tempted, for commercial or other reasons, to be less strict with regard to the necessary controls."
"All well and good."
"The rapporteur, however, sees this as a means of restoring a feeling of safety among passengers, which will greatly benefit the airlines."
"At the same time, the European authorities are preparing to take serious safety risks with their Single Sky Project."
"These same European authorities can take all the steps they like - that may well exclude African, Latin American or Eastern European planes - but with the Single Sky and their privatisation projects, conditions in the European sky are going to end up more like a third-world sky."
". (PT) Air accident rates vary from region to region, since aircraft built in Western Europe are amongst the safest in the world."
"Eastern European airlines have a high accident rate, as do those from Africa, Asia and South and Central America."
"Under the Convention on International Civil Aviation, responsibility for aviation safety is assigned to individual States."
"The European Civil Aviation Conference applies the SAFA procedure (Safety Assessment of Foreign Aircraft) as a means of monitoring aircraft and, consequently, of increasing aviation safety."
"I therefore support the European Commission's proposal for a directive intended to formalise the SAFA procedure in the Community."
"It is seeking thereby to guarantee coordinated action, together with an exchange of information that enables the early identification of possible problems, which I believe adequately reflects concerns about guaranteeing air safety."
"In conclusion however, I should like to emphasise the importance of the proposal before us to restoring the safety profile of the aviation industry, in a period post 11 September 2001, in which this profile has been and is still fairly depressed and whose restoration is crucial to the sector's survival."
". (NL) Transport links with countries outside Europe mean that means of transport which do not comply with our environmental and safety requirements are travelling on our roads, in our ports and in our airspace."
"I am talking about single-hulled oil tankers, ramshackle lorries and poorly-maintained noisy aircraft."
"Smaller regional airports, which are the only ones willing to accept old, noisy planes carrying freight from Eastern Europe and developing countries, are particularly badly affected at the moment."
"There is every reason for banning such means of transport from the territory of the EU, though we can of course understand that countries with a lower standard of living and less advanced technology still have no choice but to use them."
"We would do better to help them achieve safer transport standards than to allow them to cause problems here."
"Unfortunately, the proposal on the safety of aircraft from third countries does not go as far as this."
"That is why I support the modest improvements proposed by Mrs Maes for the first reading."
"She is right to emphasise the need for tighter random checks, even in cases where no suspicions exist, and to call for a ban on the transport of radioactive material on passenger flights."
"Taking the complaints of people living near airports seriously is just as important."
". (FR) The Maes report should in fact be called the committee report."
"The rapporteur's work is not evident."
"I do not think this report deserves to bear Mrs Maes' name."
"In fact, all the credit for the amendments and the coherence and reliability of the report belongs to the committee."
"I have therefore voted for all the committee's amendments (which are logical and appropriate) and I did not take part in the final vote."
"That would amount to giving credit to the rapporteur when in fact this is the work of the committee."
"'Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's'."
". (FR) We support the broad lines of the Stevenson report, which advocates promoting the cultivation in the European Union of plant proteins necessary for animal feed (soya, but also peas, beans, field beans, sweet lupins, and also, to a lesser degree, legumes, cereals, grasses, etc.)."
"It would appear in fact that we are currently highly dependent on imports (more than 77%), while the production of plant proteins is increasing in the world and we could do much better."
"This reliance causes us serious strategic problems, but also public health problems, since it is difficult under these conditions to establish product traceability, which could lead us, for example, to buy GMO soya whether we want to or not."
"What, though, has limited European production in this area?"
"The Blair House agreements, which have also had another disastrous effect since they have in return led to the use of animal meal, which was the cause of mad cow disease."
"These agreements must be urgently revised or circumvented."
"Unfortunately the Commission does not seem prepared to do this."
"Once again, we wonder which side it is on, and if the Community system is in fact, once again, going to make us weaker."
". (FR) Why not, when we are aware of the consequences of feeding bovines on animal meal, develop the production of plant proteins for animal feed instead?"
"The report, however, is only concerned with the trade war against the United States, on which animal feed in Europe today is heavily reliant."
"The real needs of the world's population are not even addressed."
"The basis of the food production system, however, is morally bankrupt, as it aims only to satisfy the needs of countries and social classes with high purchasing power."
"In order to sell foods with a high added value that make the most profit to those with high purchasing power, we are wasting what could be used to feed the poorest."
"Several kilos of fishmeal, for example, are needed to produce more expensive fish in fish farms."
"This is a revolting system, because it contributes to raiding the resources of the poorest countries and starving part of the world's population."
"It is also in the name of profit that Europe funds set-aside land in order to prevent a fall in prices."
"We did not want to support this entire system by voting for one option."
"We have chosen to vote against Mr Stevenson's report in its entirety."
"There is no justification for the committee's taking the ban on processing animal protein in animal feed as a pretext for demanding EU subsidies for lupins - would you believe - and other protein-rich crops."
"Equally unjustified is the demand for a 'safety net' or income-insurance scheme to benefit producers of oilseed and protein crops."
"According to the committee, the Commission's solution of using the world market almost exclusively, would make the EU vulnerable, 'particularly to climate change, harvest failures and even price increases from the main global suppliers (USA, Argentina and Brazil)'."
"We see nothing wrong or unnatural about that. On the contrary."
"As liberals, we believe in globalisation, free trade and international solidarity."
"We cannot therefore support Mr Stevenson's report."
". (FR) While the EU is heavily reliant on certain suppliers of plant proteins, the Commission proposes continuing to depend on imports, prioritising a market opportunity over rationalising its various policies."
"In doing so, it ignores the difficulty that farmers have already experienced in this type of situation and deprives the agriculture sector of new prospects."
"The development of protein-rich oil plants would comply with the need to develop a diversified, sustainable agriculture sector, in response to consumer demand for traced products and consumer rejection of GMOs."
"It would also provide farmers with new opportunities through the development of non-food prospects such as biofuels."
"Lastly, these crops have an essential role to play at an agronomic and environmental level."
"We must not sell this agricultural sector short."
"Let us provide it instead with the means to realise its ambitions by establishing conditions for profitability comparable to those of cereals, by favouring the diversity of species, and more particularly those not affected by the Blair House agreement."
"These efforts will be in vain, however, if our negotiators do not commit themselves to defending our agricultural production with conviction on the international scene."
"Mr President, the British Conservatives today reluctantly voted against the Blokland report on the establishment of a Community framework for noise classification of civil subsonic aircraft for the purposes of calculating noise charges."
"This is because Amendment No 8 was adopted, reintroducing the concept that Parliament rejected last year - setting noise target values and charges for airports rather than just for aircraft."
"Whilst aircraft move around the European Union, airports clearly do not and therefore airport noise charges and related land planning issues are matters for Member States under the principle of subsidiarity."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.10 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on floods in Europe."
"Mr President, in recent weeks we have witnessed a terrible natural disaster in Central Europe which has led to damage the scope of which is almost beyond comprehension."
"Both Member States and candidate countries have been affected."
"Particularly in this six-month period as we face enlargement, it has almost symbolic significance in reminding us that the Member States and the candidate countries have a common destiny and share the same problems which we shall do better to solve through joint efforts."
"I should like to thank the European Parliament for this opportunity on behalf of the Council to express deep sympathy with the victims of the disaster."
"Many millions of people are affected."
"Some have lost relatives, and many their homes."
"The material destruction will make itself felt in everyday life for a long time to come."
"We must all do our utmost to help."
"It is important, especially in the light of the importance of enlargement for the European Community, that the EU, which is also a community of values and of solidarity, should help deal with the extensive damage."
"That was also emphasised in the letter received on 21 August by the President of the European Parliament and the Heads of Government of the Member States from the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, Chancellor Schröder and Chancellor Schüssel."
"The Presidency was closely involved in the deliberations which led to the letter's being sent."
"I should also like, on behalf of the Council, to thank the European Parliament and the President of the European Parliament for the commitment and good will which Parliament has shown in ensuring a rapid and effective response on the part of the Community."
"The Commission is, in the same way, to be commended for the considerable vigour it has shown in regard to this difficult matter."
"The Commission deserves praise for the fact that the EU has quickly been able to take the initiative regarding decisions that will benefit the affected regions in Germany and Austria, as well as in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, as candidate countries."
"A number of actions have already been set in motion, and it will be possible to make a start on others in the very near future."
"It is my understanding that there is broad support within the Council for making flexible use of existing instruments such as Structural Funds, agricultural aid and Trans-European networks, as well as for making exemptions and more rapid procedures available to the affected areas when it comes to state aid and invitations to tender."
"The Council had a first opportunity to discuss the Commission's statement at a meeting of the Permanent Representatives Committee on 29 August."
"The Commission proposes, for example, that an EU disaster fund be established of which it will be possible to make use in connection with the floods in Central Europe and future disasters."
"I should like most gratefully to thank the Commission for the proposal, which is being debated by the Council."
"I am pleased to note that there was political backing for setting up the fund at the informal meeting of foreign ministers in Elsinore last weekend."
"That is a good starting point for the intense discussions between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament over the next few weeks."
"The matter will be put on the agenda of the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council to be held between 30 September and 1 October when we shall take stock of the matter and, if possible, arrive at some practical decisions."
"The Danish Presidency is very keen that the Community should play its part in solving the problems created for our fellow citizens, both in existing and future Member States, by the severe flooding."
"We must act quickly and effectively, and we look forward to constructive cooperation with the European Parliament on this important matter which cannot help but affect many of Parliament's rules and procedures."
"Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, we were all both concerned and moved by the extent of the flooding that so badly affected Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia a few weeks ago."
"On 18 August, in the company of President Prodi and my colleagues Mrs Schreyer and Mr Verheugen, who are here today, I was able to see for myself the scale of this disaster in the region of Dresden in particular."
"President Prodi and Mrs Wallström went with Mr Verheugen to Prague, and Mr Fischler was also able to observe the extent of the damage in his own country."
"Ladies and gentlemen, today, first of all, I would like to offer my deepest sympathy to all the families affected, but I also wish to recognise in particular the civil defence forces, the thousands of volunteers we saw, and the local, regional and national political and civil leaders who have shown such admirable dedication in this situation."
"On 28 August, the Commission announced a series of initiatives under the various Community policies to help the countries and regions concerned to cope with this disaster."
"Not only has the Union shown its solidarity with the communities concerned, but it also intends to demonstrate its capacity to act and react quickly."
"Mr President, all the Commissioners present were particularly affected by the proposals you made at the beginning of this part-session, and by Mr Haarder's speech a few moments ago."
"I would like to point out, with regard to natural risks, that two subjects always go hand-in-hand, prevention and repair."
"Allow me, first of all, to say a word or two about prevention."
"I know that prevention requires both funding and political courage."
"For example, the desire to control land use planning, to avoid waterproofing excessively large areas, in short, to manage rather than to develop land use planning."
"I also know, however, that prevention always costs less than having to repair the damage."
"At Community level, it is clear that the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds act as a financial lever for prevention."
"Allow me to give just one example. Many countries were affected by the Rhine and Meuse floods during the first half of the 1990s."
"We then mobilised over EUR 140 million under the Interreg programme, and that money made it possible to develop flood-monitoring and warning systems, and identify risk areas, build flood control reservoirs and facilitate water run-off."
"For the current period, 2000-2006, many programmes also contain risk prevention actions."
"This, for example, is the case of the objective 1 programme for Brandenburg, which lays down the construction of flood protection."
"More than forty projects will be implemented within a budget of EUR 230 million."
"This, for example, is also the case for the Austrian Tyrol."
"Following the Galtur disaster of February 1999, in which 31 people lost their lives, almost EUR 10 million are to be allocated to an avalanche prevention measure."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that these efforts, in their current form, are not equal to the risks we face."
"Together with you, we have held discussions on the future of regional policy after 2006."
"When the time comes, I shall propose that natural, technological and environmental risk prevention should become a high, almost inevitable priority of future regional policy programmes after 2006."
"We can see that the frequency of these disasters is increasing, even if they are not all such serious ones."
"Furthermore, regions such as Germany, which, with the support of the Structural Funds, have made considerable efforts to boost their economy after reunification, to restore towns and villages, have now seen their work wiped out in a few short hours."
"That is why regional development cannot take place without natural, technological or environmental risk prevention."
"The Commission, mainly on the initiative of Mrs Wallström, will propose a European risk prevention strategy by the end of this year."
"To conclude this point, I would like to say that it is quite appropriate that we are discussing this subject at the moment, today, while the Heads of State and Government are meeting in Johannesburg."
"It is plain that our planet needs global thinking and collective courage, as advocated by the Brundtland report at the end of the 1980s, before the Rio Summit."
"It is also clear that global thinking, either at world level or at European level, must be implemented in practical and local terms, in the field."
"That is the ecological challenge, the sustainable development-meets-regional policy challenge to which we have the obligation to respond."
"Mr President, I am now going to talk about the urgent need to rebuild, to prove swiftly our solidarity with the German and Austrian Länder, but also with the Czech and Slovak regions that have suffered damage."
"First of all, we need to mobilise all the instruments already available to us to address this challenge."
"That was the commitment given by the Commission on 28 August, a commitment that led immediately to decisions in the first area, the agriculture sector, under the impetus of Mr Fischler."
"The existing instruments, of course, include the Structural Funds for the Member States affected and the pre-accession instruments for the candidate countries."
"For eligible areas and regions, Structural Fund credits may be reallocated among the various priorities of the regional programmes, and we are prepared to increase the cofinancing rates as much as possible."
"Meetings will be held over the next few days with the national and regional authorities to specify the amounts that can be reallocated according to requests from the Member States."
"We shall be as flexible as the regulations allow, in particular with regard to State aid."
"I would also like to confirm that the disaster areas will not be penalised by the application of the N+2 clause if, due to the floods, the credits are not used within the period stipulated by the regulations."
"Here again, however, the instruments available to us have their limits."
"The Structural Funds cannot be used outside the eligible areas."
"Although most of the disaster areas in Germany can benefit from these Funds under objective 1, this is not the case in Austria."
"Furthermore, these instruments are governed by provisions with which you are familiar, which do not always allow the necessary aid to be quickly released."
"That, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is why the Commission proposes the creation of a disaster fund for the regions and States in case of a major natural disaster."
"I would emphasise that this solidarity fund will be available to benefit both current and future Member States."
"We considered it preferable to call upon a new, flexible instrument that could mobilise at least EUR 500 million in 2002, and EUR 1000 million in future, which would be added to the Fund in case of a disaster."
"The aim of this Fund would be, on the one hand, to help normal public life to resume, for example by repairing energy, transport and telecommunications networks, rebuilding or building temporary accommodation, and, on the other, to limit damage by consolidating preventative infrastructures, for example dikes and dams."
"As you can see, this proposal is, therefore, different."
"Both in the amounts in question and the type of interventions envisaged, it differs from the emergency victim aid system that existed between 1977 and 1996."
"I believe, however, that this Commission proposal fulfils the wishes I have heard here myself, in this very Chamber, over the past three years, for example following the disasters that affected Greece, the Azores, the Canaries, France and the United Kingdom."
"In a few days, on 18 September, we would like to adopt a proposal for a regulation specifying the conditions and implementation methods for this disaster fund."
"This tight deadline shows the Commission's determination to act swiftly, just as you yourself, Mr Cox, clearly expressed your desire to act."
"On behalf of the Commission and my colleagues here present, I would therefore like to thank the Committee on Budgets, its Chairman, Mr Wynn, your rapporteurs Mr Colom i Naval, Mr Podestà and Mr Färm, for the quality and speed of their cooperation."
"This support and understanding are essential as our joint objective is to make this fund operational in the next few months."
"The Ministers for Foreign Affairs, as you said, Minister, reacted positively to this proposal at Elsinore."
"In conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say once again that prevention is always more effective and less expensive than repair."
"Sometimes, however, as is the case at the moment, urgency is paramount and it is important for the European Union to be able to provide help and practical solidarity to the affected communities and regions of Germany, Austria, Slovakia and the Czech Republic."
"This shows that European solidarity, in conjunction with local, regional and national solidarity, is far more than just words. For the past fifteen years it has been the basis for cohesion policy."
"It has a purpose."
"And today, we are showing that this purpose is being confirmed, pursued and even consolidated."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Barnier and the other representatives of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has experienced one of the most catastrophic floods in its history, and we express our sympathy to the families of those who have died in it."
"Many people are still missing."
"Not only in two Member States of the European Union - Austria and Germany - have we seen great destruction and devastation, but also in two candidate countries, Slovakia and the Czech Republic."
"Mr Haarder and Commissioner Barnier - representing the Commission - and also our Parliament's representative, have already had occasion to give expression to the present need for European solidarity."
"Clearing up the flood damage is primarily, of course, a task for the regions and nations, but the events with which we have had to deal here have has such a dramatic impact that people have looked to Europe to give an expression of solidarity, and so, even though Mr Romano Prodi, the President of the Commission, is unable to be here today, I would like to express loud and clear my heartfelt gratitude to him for having been to the disaster zones with other representatives of the Commission, and for having represented the European Union there in a way that was right and fitting."
"I attached great importance to this."
"I have not been to the disaster zones and have only been in telephone contact, but many have told me that Mr Prodi's presence - and the humanity he personally embodied - enabled them for once to perceive the Commission and Europe in a quite new way, and not as the distant bureaucracy they had always thought it to be."
"His quite personal human presence on the spot meant a very great deal to all of us."
"I kept in touch with President Prodi during this time and, on behalf of our group, told him - he was, I believe, in the Czech Republic at the time - that I supported him in so far as I could, and assured him that any commitments he might make would have our group's support."
"I want my expression of thanks to include the whole Commission, including Commissioner Barnier, who has just spoken, Commissioner Fischler, Mrs Schreyer, Mr Verheugen and all who have played their part, but also especially to the Danish Presidency of the Council under Mr Haarder, whose government, in its capacity as the Presidency of the Council, has shown such an open-minded attitude to this matter."
"We are all of course aware that there is a constant tension between solidarity and subsidiarity, but, in this instance, it is solidarity that has had a challenge thrown down to it."
"If the follow-up measures are now completed as promptly as they should be - and what the Commissioner has said gladdens my heart - then we have done our duty as the European Union."
"Before turning to a number of somewhat practical matters, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to those who gave assistance on the ground."
"Mention of, for example, the fire brigade, often raises a smile in our society, as people think that the things fire-fighters handle are toys."
"In a situation like this one, though, experience teaches us just how important it is to have a fire brigade, how vital are the soldiers who are deployed in a domestic emergency situation, how important the police are, how important civil defence is."
"At any rate, I have seen, in Germany, the country from which I come, innumerable young people getting stuck in and giving help, and, at a time when anonymity and egoism often seem to be predominant, it is a good sign that it is young people who manifest this solidarity."
"Turning now to certain aspects of the emergency aid, on which Mr Ferber will also have something to say, we take the view - admittedly in contrast to the Commission - that EUR 1 billion should be allocated to emergency aid."
"I would like to express my gratitude to the six groups who agreed on this document - Mr Karas and Mr Ferber did so on our group's behalf - for being willing to come to an understanding about a joint text."
"Aid for agriculture had already been under discussion, then came the Structural Funds' efficiency reserve, followed of course by the disaster fund that now has to be set up for the future, and there will of course have to be a flexible approach to the rules on competition."
"Commissioner Monti and the Commission as a whole have committed themselves to this."
"What people now expect of us - and here I am particularly addressing Mr Wynn, the chairman of the Budgets Committee - is that we now implement all this without delay."
"If we now hesitate and spend weeks disputing among ourselves, we will be throwing away the goodwill that the European Union, especially in the person of Mr Romano Prodi, President of the Commission, has garnered."
"I therefore ask that we act with decisiveness and commitment in setting the follow-up measures in motion."
"Let me make an observation with only indirect relevance to this issue."
"Deliberations are in progress on the subject of the Stability Pact."
"Even in a catastrophic situation such as this one, the Stability Pact must not be jeopardised, for this is an issue of confidence in the European currency, of confidence in the ability of the European Union as a whole to deliver the goods."
"I therefore urge us all - Commission, Council and Parliament - not to shake the foundations of the Stability Pact, but - to return to the catastrophe - to do our duty by the people who have been hard hit."
"This European Union of ours will then enjoy far more popular acceptance than we often take to be the case."
"In this spirit I commend cooperation to all the institutions concerned!"
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, this summer we have seen a genuine environmental, economic and cultural disaster in Central Europe."
"On 14 August, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I expressed our solidarity and the need for the Commission to act, and please allow me to mention the fact that President Prodi and the Commissioners not only put their boots on and walked around in the mud, but that, furthermore, Mr Prodi accepted the invitation from Chancellor Schröder, who took action from the outset to hold that extraordinary Berlin Summit, which I believe was a strong sign of will and action."
"Other colleagues of mine will speak more extensively about the situation in Germany, in Austria, in the Czech Republic, in Slovakia and in Hungary."
"But please allow me, on behalf of the Socialist Group, firstly to express our condolences, our concern for the victims and also our sincerest thanks to all the volunteers who have taken action, not only those who come from the regions in question, but also those from many others."
"I have had the opportunity to see volunteers in my country from the Canary Islands, which are rather far away, who were on their way to Central Europe to lend a hand wherever necessary."
"This demonstrates that there is a common spirit amongst us."
"I believe that this is the time to point out that we must change our past behaviour."
"Solidarity must be expressed equally towards everybody, and that is a lesson we must learn from the Azores."
"We also learnt a lesson, for example, from the Greek earthquake and that is that joint action by Greeks and Turks allowed past barriers to be overcome."
"It is at times of difficulty that will must be shown."
"With regard to the decision taken by the House - I am glad that it is unanimous and that the Committee on Budgets has acted seriously - I believe that there must be decisive support."
"Clearly disasters cannot be planned for in the budgets, but what we can do, as we have with ECHO and as we are now going to do with the fund, is try to create a system of safeguards which allows us to act."
"I would like to point out, now that the Convention is under way, that the time has come to remove this absurd distinction between obligatory and non-obligatory spending."
"It appears that we have to pay what goes towards cows and wheat but not what goes towards disasters."
"I believe that this is an important political lesson."
"This also applies to the stability pact."
"The application of the stability pact can be discussed when there is a disaster, but what is not acceptable is that the stability pact is being discussed in countries which have not suffered disasters."
"I believe we must be very firm about this."
"Finally, Mr President, I believe that, in terms of our approach to sustainable development, we must be humble and respectful towards nature, which has a memory and may return to haunt us."
"We must act more firmly on the way towards a policy of sustainable development and, above all, of strengthening solidarity between us."
"Mr President, the floods that put Central Europe under such immense strain this summer were a huge natural catastrophe."
"The financial losses were colossal."
"The floods caused fatalities, injuries and distress."
"In such circumstances the European Union also has an obligation to help."
"For that reason, my group, the ELDR, supports the Commission's actions and plans to help flood victims and help finance reconstruction, and is calling for a vigorous programme of further action."
"The distribution of competence means the EU's responsibility is greatest in the area of agriculture."
"Thus, the measures the Commission has taken to bring forward payments of direct agricultural aid are right, as are their other plans."
"The ELDR Group furthermore believes the following measures are also the right ones: the partial reprogramming of the Structural Funds, a temporary increase in Community funding, and channelling the performance reserve to the flood area."
"There is also every reason to use the TEN funds for the reconstruction work."
"Action to help candidate countries also has the support of our group."
"It must be made possible to use the emergency aid reserve in the budget to repair the damage."
"Our group is in favour of establishing a European emergency aid fund."
"Technically it may be appropriate to establish it in accordance with a flexible instrument."
"Its purpose would have to be clearly defined and the rules made clear."
"Compensation would mainly have to come from the Member State's national share and insurance companies."
"Our group is prepared to promote the fastest possible implementation of legislation and technical preparation concerning this fund."
"It is important that the European Union should make a more intensive effort to overcome climatic change, implement the Kyoto agreement and reduce greenhouse gases."
"It is important to promote the use of renewable energy sources."
"At the same time, we need to consider the risk of natural disasters, such as flooding, at different levels of the social structure, and try to reduce them."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Madam Commissioner, Commissioners, my group welcomes the discussion on the measures required at European level to cope with the unparalleled damage wrought by the disastrous floods in the Federal Republic of Germany, in Austria, in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia."
"I would like to again express our dismay and our grief over the victims and express our sympathy to their families."
"The immense material damage and the destitution of thousands of people call for extensive and coordinated aid on the part of the European, national and regional forces and institutions."
"The members of the public, communities, businesses and faring installations that have been affected expect the European institutions to provide immediate and tangible aid to alleviate their need and also to deal with the extensive consequences of the emergency."
"The European Union can do a great deal to polish up its image and reputation in the eyes of the public by acting speedily and without bureaucracy."
"The remarkable wave of solidarity and unselfish mutual assistance that showed itself in the struggle against the floodwaters, must be supplemented by clear and substantial indications of the European Union's solidarity."
"The Commission has taken the right step in proposing the possible reallocation of European resources within the European funds, but this is not sufficient."
"Alongside the Community Disaster Fund, which the Commission has proposed and which will mobilise aid money in the long term, there is a need for emergency aid supplied from the margin of as yet unused European budget resources."
"Over and above that, we propose that, in the event of disasters, it should be possible to examine the legal option of reducing the share of national cofinancing, at the same time suspending the putting of contracts out to tender in order to mobilise local and regional enterprises."
"This would make an effective contribution to supporting and promoting small and medium-sized enterprises in the region or local area affected by the calamity."
"We welcome the European Investment Bank's initiative, under which EUR 1 billion is to be made available in the first instance for the purpose of granting credits under special conditions, with the option of topping them up at a later date."
"Making these interest-free would be a greater help to the recipients."
"This brings us to the proposal that the European Union, using a specially created fund, could take on the cost of the interest incurred."
"I would like to point out by way of conclusion that these disastrous floods are not an isolated and extreme natural occurrence; the incidence of natural disasters in various parts of the world is increasing."
"For us, this should be - indeed must be - a clear warning signal, calling on us to give environmental issues, in all relevant areas of Community policy, a far higher priority than we have done to date."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it was with horror that we watched as the rivers of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Bavaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria, both great and small, became rivers of destruction."
"Never before had the Elbe, the river that runs through Dresden, my home town, broken its original banks with such brutality."
"It destroyed much of the reconstruction work of Germany's post-reunification period, destroyed new homes, and, above all, took all the possessions of young people starting businesses and homes - they will be in debt for generations - and largely wrecked the newly-renovated city centre to a truly massive degree."
"No words of mine could be equal to the task of describing the losses, the suffering and the despair of the victims."
"When I refer to my home town, let it be taken as a symbol representing the many small towns that have also been affected as much as the great cities of Germany and its neighbouring countries."
"For my own part and on behalf of my group, I would like to express my deep sympathy with all of them."
"My desire is that this discussion may become a real sign of solidarity and that a disaster fund may come into being, founded in a spirit of solidarity with all regions rather than with only a few of them and including the candidate countries."
"Both residents and visitors always had a healthy respect for the Elbe."
"The city has come to terms with the spring floods, but now the newly-emerging plans for the trans-European networks will make it into a basin with fast currents endangering the people on the riverbank."
"So I call on the Commission to reconsider whether their plans for the development of the Elbe and also of the Danube are still justified in the light of current experience."
"There is a development plan for the Danube, one that is sustainable and will preserve the alluvial forests."
"It is now for the Commission to deal with the question of whether they will finance this plan alone or enter into some sort of arrangement for the financing of dams."
"As regards the Elbe, it is still an open question to what extent the Commission will take on responsibility for the plans that exist to develop it, which have been shown to be unworkable."
"That they have not yet been implemented - which was a great good fortune, as the flood would otherwise have been even more torrential - is due to the initiatives emerging from civil society that have to date prevented these plans from actually coming to fruition."
"The coming weeks, though, will see the question raised of whether it will be possible to preserve the important alluvial forests and their resources, and hence also to keep the waters back, or whether the Elbe development will proceed."
"The same is true of the Oder, for which there are similar plans; there are nature reserves near the Oder as well, and it threatens to flood villages."
"The question facing the Commission is whether a new plan can be successfully drawn up and whether all existing plans can be reviewed, so that the Commission, too, may take full responsibility in this area."
"Mr President, the motion for a resolution tabled by the UEN Group and the motions tabled by the other political groups seek essentially to create a credit line in the Union's budget to help to deal with the damage caused by the natural disasters which have occurred recently in a number of Member States and in the candidate countries."
"Moreover, the need for emergency Community action was blatantly obvious if we consider the exceptionally widespread effects of the atmospheric phenomena which have affected the whole of Europe."
"When he visited the disaster areas, President Prodi himself could only, in expressing the Union's condolences, declare its ready availability to intervene with both exemptions and financial aid."
"In our opinion, there are other considerations which point to the need for the creation of a stable credit line."
"Although many would not admit it, I am afraid it is becoming obvious that our world's climate is changing, and it is not necessary to subscribe to the theory of alarmism to see this."
"Of course, meteorological statistics through the years have consistently done their best to show us encouraging comparisons, making the scale of disasters seem less large, but it is not their - still large - scale which is disturbing now so much as the increasing frequency with which they occur, on the one hand, and the fact that they repeatedly occur out of season in Europe, on the other."
"The creation of a stable credit line in the Union's budget would, therefore, help the States to take the necessary action to address the damage caused by these events."
"There is no doubt, however, that the other, more important part of the Community's action must relate to prevention."
"It is certainly useful to reconsider at both national and Community level agricultural production policies, forestation policies and policies for managing hydrological risk areas."
"In any case, the key issue, the essential consideration, is certainly the greenhouse effect and its harmful consequences , which, I am sad to say, have been scientifically proven beyond all reasonable doubt."
"We must reflect on the fact that the issue of the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions - addressed for the first time as early as 10 years ago in New York and for the second time six years later in Kyoto in the famous Protocol - is still far from being resolved in any significant way because of the failure of a sufficient number of States to ratify the Protocol."
"The call for Russia to ratify the Protocol is certainly an important step, but it falls within the scope of the political and economic relations which are being established with that country."
"We still have an unquestionable duty to insist more firmly that the candidate countries ratify the Protocol, starting with Poland."
"Mr President, my group, the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, would also like to convey its condolences to the relatives of the victims of the severe floods in Europe, and we must find effective methods of helping the many people who are now in need of help."
"I would, however, warn against having the EU take part in the aid work."
"The victims of the hurricane in Latin America did not receive the money we had allocated."
"The EU often contents itself with accepting the public relations benefits of a major appropriation but is in no position to take effective action."
"That could also easily happen this time."
"It would be wiser to pay a portion of the bill for the aid programme that has now to be undertaken by the local, regional and national authorities, and I personally am prepared to go a very long way down this road, for it is in times of need that friends show their worth."
"We are wealthy in the EU, much wealthier than, for example, the badly affected Czech Republic and Slovakia."
"We should now be resolute in showing our solidarity in practical, cash-down terms."
"We ought also, however, to look at the causes and take the greenhouse effect and other human assaults upon the environment seriously."
"France's President Chirac is right, of course."
"He deserves great praise for his speech in Johannesburg."
"I am not yet in a position to assess the Danish Presidency of the Council's contribution to Johannesburg, but it is scandalous both that we should continue to dump EU-subsidised goods on developing countries' agricultural markets while refusing fully to open our own markets to those countries' products and that it has not even been successfully agreed that 15% of energy should come from sustainable energy sources by the year 2015."
"It is presumably by means of this absence of decision-making that we are laying the foundation for the natural disasters to come."
"Thank you, Mr President, even though there is not a very great deal to express thanks for."
"Mr President, it goes without saying that we welcome the Commission's initiative to help those who have sustained damage in the flood disaster speedily and without bureaucracy."
"We believe, though, that the aid measures put forward by the Commission at the present time will, unfortunately, prove to be inadequate to help the victims to a sufficient extent."
"Moreover, the funds are to some extent granted on the basis of unequal criteria."
"We are deeply affected by the extent of these disastrous floods."
"In Austrian regions alone, over 10 000 homes have been destroyed, innumerable bridges and roads have been destroyed or have sustained major damage, with the infrastructure of communities and regions suffering serious consequential damage."
"Hundreds of businesses were seriously affected by the floods, their plant and buildings badly damaged or wrecked."
"In Upper Austria alone, thousands of jobs have been affected or put at risk by the flood disaster."
"The overall extent of the damage is increasing on a virtually daily basis, as we get a better overview of the degree to which the regions have been adversely affected."
"It is currently assumed that the total damage will amount to over EUR 800 billion, which means, as has already been frequently said, that the sum of EUR 500 million proposed by the EU as emergency aid will not be sufficient."
"We are therefore working on the basis that at least EUR 1 billion will be allocated to emergency aid measures."
"In this context, we would also remind you that a surplus for the year 2000 totalling EUR 11.6 billion has just been repaid to the Member States."
"If billions are again repaid to the Member States in respect of 2002, it will not look good from where we stand, as the people affected by the floods will take it as read that the EU honours the concept of solidarity more in word than in deed."
"So I do believe that the Commission should indeed make up the cash and that this year's surplus should be cut back accordingly."
"It cannot be, or rather it should not be, the case that Europe's poor are treated unequally."
"I do not consider it right and proper for aid measures, in the final analysis, to be allocated according to the region for which they are destined."
"The situation in Upper Austria is that many businesses are not in the target region at all and certain aid measures are therefore denied to them."
"It goes without saying that we must also spare a thought for farmers, who should, speedily and unbureaucratically, have funds made available to them for the purchasing of feedingstuffs, be enabled to use set-aside land and should have cereals in intervention provided for them at cheap rates for feeding purposes."
"It is obvious that we have to think of the thousands of private citizens whose homes were destroyed, and we should also, in a spirit of solidarity, make funds available for them."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me express my gratitude to the Commission for the initiative that they launched at the end of August, inaugurated by a visit to the affected areas and then by last week's special session of the Commission to fire the starting shot for the creation of the legal basis for aid to deal with this grave calamity."
"Let me specifically mention in this connection Commissioner Fischler, who has rather less of a problem with budgets."
"Not only does he have to make proposals, but he can at the same time take decisions via the Austrian Upper House."
"It is a great help to the farmers affected by the floods that this has been done so quickly in the aftermath of the events."
"Three things are needed."
"Firstly, we must make emergency aid available, and do so quickly."
"To do so is an expression of European solidarity."
"I will deliberately emphasise that this must be quick and, indeed, immediate."
"It will not be enough for people in the affected regions to be sitting in houses and dwellings that they have laboriously decorated, having put up a rough-and-ready Christmas tree, while we in this House are still discussing issues such as legal bases, reallocations and more of the same old thing. Rapid emergency aid means that the procedure by which we act must be the speediest available - we in the PPE group propose that this be based on the procedure used in the 2002 Fourth Supplementary Budget - so that, by the end of October at the latest, funds of the order of EUR 1 billion can be on their way."
"Secondly, the legal circumstances need to be created."
"The Structural Fund - Michel Barnier has been mentioned - the law on subsidies and public procurement; all this has to be taken into consideration."
"What we have to implement here is a complete package of legislation, in order that European law does not stand in the way of rapid reconstruction."
"Thirdly, we have to equip ourselves to face the future."
"How can we set up a disaster fund for the future? That is the question."
"We ought to do that calmly and unhurriedly, in order to get everything right in budgetary and legal terms."
"If we do these three things, aid will get to people fast, and Europe will discharge its long-term responsibilities to its people."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, representatives of the Commission, this House has already seen lengthy discussions of whether or not there ought to be an institution or fund with the specific purpose of giving aid in times of catastrophe."
"It must be said in all honesty that many of us were sceptical, believing that it would prove to be a drain on our resources, but the great disaster over the past few weeks has, I believe, convinced us that solidarity is a proper response to such calamities."
"This is not just about financial support for countries that suddenly find themselves faced with a gigantic task; it is also - as already mentioned - a spiritual and moral issue, and also one on which this European Union of ours, which no longer evokes great enthusiasm, can gain added public support if it shows that it is acting in a spirit of solidarity."
"My group is therefore unambiguously in favour of the creation of a new financial instrument with all the precautions that honesty requires that we take in a disaster situation."
"Firstly, the disasters concerned must be of major dimensions, and we must not encourage the delusion that we can supplant the efforts of the nation states; we can and must supplement them, but that is no substitute for effort at a national level."
"I would like again to underline what Commissioner Barnier said with reference to prevention."
"Not only must we - where this is possible - provide for a return to the natural state, but we must also put preventive measures in place using all our technical knowledge, as for example happened in my home city of Vienna, where we have again been spared disaster."
"What this means is that the states cannot take it for granted that they will keep getting money when disasters strike, and then, for years on end, carry on with planning and population policies that have failed utterly."
"The last point I would like to make has already been mentioned a couple of times, but it cannot be too clearly emphasised, namely, that we must help speedily."
"I know we all have certain time limits to keep to and so on, but I see some plans which state that the present is perhaps to arrive before Christmas or only after it, when it is too late."
"It is too late for people to have an experience of the European Union as a real help."
"So I am asking everybody in Parliament, but especially the Commission, to prepare matters as speedily as possible and in so efficient a manner that both the Council and Parliament can give their prompt agreement."
"If we can tell people that this has been done, then, I believe, it will be with greater enthusiasm that they will be able to say 'yes' to this European Union of ours."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, first of all, I wish to express my and my group's sympathy for everyone hit by the disaster."
"The disastrous floods in Central Europe have been, and remain, appalling."
"Something has happened to the climate."
"Imbalances in the frequency of drought and rainfall are becoming more and more common, and winds are becoming more and more violent."
"In Johannesburg, an attempt was made to find global solutions."
"The country which causes the most pollution per head of population - the United States - does not wish to participate. The way the world is at present, it is the EU which must now assume the leading role in bringing about a sound environmental policy."
"The President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Haarder, stated that this will affect our processes and decisions."
"I believe that that is the case."
"Major issues have arisen within the EU which have required common solutions and have welded countries and peoples together."
"That has applied in the cases of the Coal and Steel Union, agricultural policy, the internal market and Economic and Monetary Union."
"I am convinced that we must pull ourselves together in order successfully to cope with the world's future environmental problems."
"The next major project for the European Union should be to create a common environmental policy that is both tough and directly binding upon countries and individuals."
"In that way, it might be possible to raise the standard without anyone's being able to lower it again, and the EU would be given the opportunity to play a leading role when it came to improving the global environment."
"That is the most important issue for humanity and the EU combined."
"Mr President, the most disastrous floods in living memory to strike those who live on the Elbe and on some of its tributaries have also had a grave effect on farmers and their businesses."
"Although there is as yet no definite account of the damage, provisional reports from the Federal States of Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, which have been particularly affected, give some indication of the colossal extent of the flood damage, the present position being that the damage done by floodwater to agriculture and forestry amounts to around EUR 287 million."
"In Saxony alone, some 1 900 farms have been directly affected by floodwater, and another 640 in Saxony-Anhalt."
"Far greater, though, is the damage done to residential property in the villages, to the infrastructure of rural areas and to the dikes on the rivers."
"My home area, Prignitz, lies right on the Elbe, and damage there has been great; even though it was possible to prevent disaster itself in the form of flooding or the breaching of the dikes on the Elbe, the inhabitants of thirty-eight Prignitz villages had to be evacuated, with some 20 000 head of cattle being rescued from the flooding - a massive achievement for neighbourly aid in the sparsely-inhabited Prignitz."
"A massive amount of work was done in Havelland, where many thousands of helpers did their best to counteract the artificial flooding of Havelland even though the polder dikes had been burst."
"The environmental and financial effects will become apparent only in late 2003 and 2004."
"It is my express demand that the advance payment of the EU's 50% per-hectare premium be proceeded with speedily, but I do ask Commissioner Fischler to review its payment to businesses, even though this is not within his remit."
"The application forms that have come into my possession are drafted in the language of bureaucracy rather than that of solidarity."
"There is, then, a need for additional money."
"Special credit facilities and guarantee programmes may well be helpful, but many farmers no longer have it in them to get into debt again, as these programmes all have the characteristic that they become effective after a time delay."
"We know that this year, EUR 1 to 1.3 billion of the EU's budget will be left unused."
"I ask as a matter of urgency that consideration be given to the possibility of the unused funds being used as non-repayable subsidies to benefit the farmers in all the affected areas which have suffered severe damage, rather than being repaid to the Member States."
"When the EU implements its measures, it is subjected to intense scrutiny by its citizens."
"What is needed, and in short order, is money, not sleight of hand or political evasive action."
"With that in mind, I hope Parliament, and all of us, will be able to do the right thing."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, as an Austrian MEP, to start by expressing my gratitude for the possibility of prompt and speedy help."
"These sad events have brought us closer to achieving the proximity to our citizens for which we have often longed."
"It has been possible to give Europe a slightly better image."
"Brussels, that bureaucratic monster, seems to embody solidarity, and may that not remain merely an outward show."
"Disasters have more than a merely national dimension."
"European solidarity is called for, and the EU has come up with the right response."
"Alongside the countless victims, whom we mourn, there are so many individuals and families on the brink of ruin; we have businesses both small and large, farmers, the environment, agriculture, public services, historic buildings, art treasures, including in the candidate countries, in need of prompt and speedy aid, given on a joint basis and without strings attached."
"It is of little interest to the public whence the money comes and how we do all the restructuring."
"We have to tackle this promptly, speedily and swiftly."
"Aid must be visible."
"Turning to the follow-up measures and to the long-term measures, I would like to underline what my fellow-Members have said, namely that climate change has become a brutal reality."
"Man-made climate change has arrived."
"Mr Barón Crespo said that we must have greater humility where nature is concerned, but to do so demands more effective action, more effective political action, on our part."
"Commissioner Barnier repeatedly emphasised the need for preventive measures."
"Not only are these necessary and cheaper, they also take greater care of the environment."
"I hope - and it is in these terms that I appeal to all the Member States, to the Commission and to this House - that these do not merely express pious aspirations, but will be implemented in all relevant policy areas."
"It is in the light of this that we should give ourselves time to engage in detailed discussion of the Disaster Fund."
"There is not much point in simply blundering into the rebuilding of what has been destroyed if we have not previously gathered all the available information we need, especially in environmentally sensitive areas."
"We simply have to rebuild in a sustainable way."
"Public expectations of this EU of ours, of this community of solidarity, have grown and will carry on growing."
"So congratulations on these ad hoc measures; we should be equally zealous in identifying the structures for the future, for our solidarity should be not only with those who are the victims now, but with everyone, and not only today, but also tomorrow."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my very heartfelt thanks for all my fellow-Members' solidarity and sympathy, as this is a really difficult time for people in the affected areas of Central Europe."
"The last time Austria experienced a flood disaster of this magnitude was over a century ago."
"We are especially grateful to the Commission and the Presidency of the Council for their prompt action in response to this catastrophe."
"I would also like to thank all the Austrian MEPs for the solidarity and cooperation which have been manifested without regard to party political boundaries, and also all the voluntary aid workers, the voluntary fire brigades, the Red Cross, the Austrian Federal Army for their tireless endeavours."
"I am myself from an affected area in Lower Austria and have personal experience of their superhuman efforts."
"It took no time at all for many livelihoods to be destroyed, with, for example, over 20 000 hectares of Austrian arable land inundated."
"The damage done has been enormous, meaning, among other things, that harvesting cannot be completed in the areas where threshing is done late, and that many fields and meadows cannot be mown as they are still under water as a result of the continuing high groundwater level."
"Machines and equipment are sinking into the fields, and shortages of animal feedingstuffs are to be reckoned with."
"The Commission's immediate authorisation of measures to help farmers is therefore a matter of life and death for us, and for it they have my heartfelt gratitude."
"In a study, the Austrian Institute of Economic Research puts a figure of over EUR 7.5 billion on the damage."
"The destruction of many businesses and of the infrastructure in these regions has set the areas' development back by years."
"Parliament and the EU as a whole must give aid, actively and with all speed."
"The time has come to demonstrate this."
"I see this as a chance for the Europe in which we share to prove itself."
"I really do welcome the emergency aid that the EU gives, one of the most important features of which is, as many of the previous speakers have already said, the transparency of the process and the absence of bureaucracy involved."
"This is an area where - to speak very frankly - the governments of the affected areas also need to make the necessary funds available without delay."
"Emergency aid must find a place in the Supplementary Budget."
"We have to set up an efficient disaster fund, give it sufficient funds and define criteria for it."
"It must be possible to give this fund an endowment of a billion euros."
"Disasters will happen over and over again, but our society is distinguished by the way we treat nature and live in harmony with it, and by our solidarity with those visited by misfortune, for we can all be in their position."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I myself am from Saxony."
"It pains me to even think about what has happened there and two minutes is far too little time in which to do so."
"12 August marked the start of one of the worse natural disasters this country has ever known."
"To give you just one statistic: on 12 August, the Erzgebirge had 360 litres of rain per square metre within 24 hours."
"I think many a Member State would be quite happy with just a fraction of that rainfall in summer."
"The swollen streams and rivers carried off everything in their path."
"Thousands of people lost everything they owned within a few hours."
"Retailers and tradesmen lost not just their shops and businesses but all their stock and materials."
"21 people are thought to have died in the floods."
"The floodwaters have receded and what are we left with: devastation and mud."
"Initial estimates put the damage to infrastructure and public buildings in Saxony Free State at EUR 16.5 billion."
"By way of comparison, the annual budget of Saxony Free State is around EUR 15 billion."
"Saxony-Anhalt is complaining of damage in the region of EUR 2.1 billion, although I think that the final bill will be higher."
"Emergency help is urgently needed."
"The federal government has already reacted and will shortly be providing EUR 10 billion for reconstruction."
"However, the European Union is also being called on to help."
"It too has already reacted and this reaction has been welcomed."
"But may I point out that, even if we single out the Structural Funds and give priority to certain measures, we cannot stop there."
"There must be no let-up in subsequent Structural Fund support for Objective 1 areas in eastern Germany and I urge you to bear this in mind."
"May I take this opportunity to thank everyone who has helped clear up and helped fight the floods."
"I should also like to ask the Commission not to leave the Czech Republic and Slovakia out of its emergency aid plans."
"They have suffered enormous damage and are perhaps not as well-equipped as Germany or Austria."
"Mr President, Commissioners, President-in-Office of the Council, my greatest sympathy at this time is with the families badly hit or otherwise affected in the disaster-struck areas."
"Respect and admiration are also in order for the huge response to the disaster and for the way in which thousands of people stood shoulder to shoulder in combating the masses of water."
"It was unprecedented."
"There must be no doubt that the EU Member States should pull together in dealing with a disaster like this."
"It is therefore important to remember that aid is twice as valuable when it is offered promptly."
"I would also draw attention to the fact that many people are looking to see how we help the Czech Republic."
"The Czech Republic is a candidate country, and it is therefore very important that we deal with it in such a way that it, and thus the other candidate countries too, feel secure."
"I would finally draw attention to the fact that agriculture in the affected areas is suffering losses twice over: firstly, this autumn's harvest of coarse fodder has been lost and, secondly, the harvest of sown winter crops will not be ready for next year."
"Mr President, on the evening of 12 August, my daughter bought a camera in my home town of Döbelin, population 28 000."
"Three hours later, the shop no longer existed."
"The same applies to 1 425 homes in the district and 711 businesses."
"And of course, schools, scientific establishments and, above all, public infrastructures were seriously affected and, to put it bluntly, agriculture is staring ruin in the face."
"As we have already heard, 220 000 hectares were flooded and the provisional estimates of flood damage to farming are enormous."
"Mrs Fiebiger has quoted the figures."
"Worst of all is the loss of animal fodder, mainly as the result of the grain lost."
"Governments and the European Union have already given a considerable sum of money in initial emergency aid."
"And quite apart from that, the Commissioner responsible, Franz Fischler, with whom I am in constant personal contact, and again may I express thanks to him for that, has ordered EUR 560 million to be paid in the form of direct payments to farmers, although the final figure will be higher because, according to my information, regions in Mecklenburg and Vorpommern have now been included."
"As you have already heard, set-aside areas have been provided, together with cheap grain for animal fodder."
"My request, or rather my question is this: have these EUR 560 million really been available since 1 September?"
"To hear that from you in person, my dear Mr Fischler, would be music to the ears of the victims."
"Because make no mistake."
"This is a national emergency and, although the regions affected must make every effort to deal with it, they will be stretched beyond their financial limits."
"Dealing with this disaster in the short-, medium- and long-term is therefore the job of these regions, the national governments and the European Union."
"And action must be taken quickly because the people affected are in urgent need of financial support."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to add my voice to the messages of condolence and thanks to the honourable Members."
"Europe has been affected in an incomparable way by the problem of flooding and must be part of the solution to this immediate problem we are facing."
"Therefore, the urgency demanded by the honourable Members and assistance which goes beyond mere words are the two elements that are absolutely essential for this Parliament to demonstrate."
"Mr President, fresh money is needed to provide aid; not just the money planned for, but new contributions."
"We must bear in mind that this House has contributed for many years to the 1.27 limit of the European Union's budget never having been used and therefore a substantially smaller proportion than that has been used."
"I believe that Mr Barnier has introduced some absolutely essential considerations and details."
"I am a member of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and it is clear that flexibility is fundamental in reprogramming, that the efficiency reserve must be used for this task, revitalising small and medium-sized businesses, which are the driving force for normalisation and recovery and that prioritising the defence of our infrastructures must be an essential element of the new priorities."
"Mr President, I will end by saying that, while we have been able to save for many years, solidarity now requires that we be generous."
"Mr President, honourable Members, as a member of parliament from one of the regions affected by the floods, I am very grateful that this debate is being held here today."
"Here we are, worrying about how to get money to the victims."
"That shows that, as a community, the European Union basically functions on the principle of solidarity."
"I should also like to make a point of thanking Commission President Prodi for having visited the damaged regions in person."
"His visit clearly demonstrated that the European Union is alive and well and ready to help and did much to raise the stock of the European Union."
"The local citizens saw that Europe is a dynamic force for help."
"I visited some of the damaged areas last week in preparation for today's debate and spoke to citizens and those in charge."
"The devastation is immense and the people are in deep despair."
"But they draw hope for a new beginning from the overwhelming sense of solidarity already shown in Germany and from the support coming in from further afield, including from the European Union, because they cannot cope with these problems alone."
"The bottom line - I have been told time and again - is that money is needed, and needed fast."
"Apart from replacing personal property lost, we need, first and foremost, to ensure that infrastructures are restored as quickly as possible, so as to minimise the losses to business."
"Apart from cheap loans, which the Commissioner has already mentioned, I think we need to do more to ensure the money flows quickly."
"One way would be to provide funds from the supplementary budget or from the disaster fund which has already been discussed here today."
"This money needs to be provided in the short term."
"The second way of providing funds is through the Structural Funds."
"I think both channels are important and are the right approach."
"However, in the case of the Structural Funds, we need to bear in mind that, under current legislation, the Structural Funds can only be implemented if there is 50% cofinancing."
"This cofinancing is entered in the countries' budgets in annual tranches and the corresponding funds are then earmarked."
"Additional funds cannot be provided in the short term."
"Which is why using the Structural Funds only makes sense if cofinancing is altered."
"What we need is a reduction, and I do not mean by a couple of percentage points; we need a drastic reduction just for this period, i.e. while funds are being used to repair the damage."
"Nonetheless, the question of providing more money from the Structural Funds over coming years needs to be reviewed, as Mrs Krehl has already said."
"I think that if we take this on board, we shall have a huge opportunity to help people and win their confidence in the European Union."
"Mr President, with a peculiar sort of local chauvinism, I too must start by saying that my home region of Upper Austria and, more importantly, my home district of Perk have been devastated by the floods."
"In my home district of Perk, we had a total of three flash floods and mudslides of unprecedented magnitude within a month."
"The first, which, relatively speaking, was the mildest, hit my own house."
"The time of trying to persuade ourselves that this is a one in a millennium occurrence - an unhappy combination of circumstances - is past; we are sure that this is a catastrophe brought about by climate change and could strike again at any given moment."
"It could strike again anywhere in Europe or the rest of the world at any given moment; in other words, even as we deal with the emergency and repair the damage, we need to focus on prevention and on protecting the climate."
"I am very grateful to everyone, including the Commission, which has put a really impressive package together and shown us how we can help at European level."
"All of us from the regions affected have already said that this is a message which has been very well received by our citizens."
"I also believe - which is why, of course, we are lobbying here for increased support - that help from the European Union should be in proportion to the damage."
"The total bill in Upper Austria will probably be in the region of EUR 3 billion."
"I have a special request to put to the Commission on behalf of my region, which is neither an Objective 1 nor an Objective 2 region and the places worst affected do not qualify for aid. It is a request for support in implementing restructuring measures within Austria, including these areas."
"I should like to thank you, President Cox, for having taken an early initiative on behalf of the European Union and agreeing to open an exhibition of the damage in Germany, the Czech Republic and Austria which I have organised at 5 p.m. this evening, because I think this sort of solidarity is important."
"I can also report that, in my region, even people who lost everything or almost everything are saying, the poor Czechs, they are even worse off, they will probably find it even harder to cope."
"I believe we have seen an upsurge in cross-border solidarity."
"I should like to use this platform to thank everyone who has helped in Austria, the army, the fire brigade, the Red Cross and all the volunteers."
"Many agencies have been overwhelmed with offers of help."
"In Austria, African asylum seekers have been helping and young Muslim associations have volunteered to help."
"There has been a wave of solidarity, the like of which we have never experienced and which has taken many people by surprise and I should be glad to pass the message of heartfelt sympathy expressed here to the victims in my home region."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the reason for my intervention is, of course, the various disasters that have recently befallen the Member States of the European Union - the devastating floods, droughts and fires."
"This summer, the torrential rains that lashed Germany and Austria as well as the Czech Republic and Romania, have caused incalculable damage."
"In human terms, first of all, with the loss of dozens of human lives and thousands injured or missing and families made homeless. There has been material damage too, with considerable damage to infrastructures, with roads and bridges destroyed, fields of crops flooded and the destruction of centuries-old cultural heritage."
"First of all, and I feel sure that I speak on behalf of all my fellow Members, I wish to use this forum to praise the total commitment and the mobilisation of the emergency services, fire brigades, police, soldiers and volunteers."
"On the eve of the gloomy conclusions of the Johannesburg Summit, the European Union is already facing the consequences of climate change and of the failure to comply with the Kyoto Protocol."
"For me and for my country, the European Union means solidarity, both with the Member States, and with the candidate countries."
"The European Union must, therefore, bring into play all the mechanisms and financial means at its disposal to help the affected areas."
"Aid must be direct and immediate, because the victims will not be sympathetic to bureaucracy and administrative delays."
"I wish, therefore, to state my unequivocal support for establishing, in the short term, an exceptional budget line to deal with this type of disaster, redirecting Structural Funds that have already been allocated, bearing the new situation in mind, and for freeing up credits granted under the pre-accession programmes."
"In the medium term, I am also in favour of the Commission proposal to create a special assistance fund for natural, technological and environmental disasters with a value of no less than EUR one billion."
"This fund would enable us to provide a rapid response in the event of disasters in the broadest sense of the term."
"I suggest that the sums in this fund that are not spent during the current budget year be added to those of coming years, so as to strengthen it. There would consequently be a greater year-on-year ability to respond."
"Furthermore, the size of the freed-up funding should take account of not only the extent of the disaster, but also of the prosperity of the regions affected."
"Mr President, honourable Members, large-scale disasters such as that which struck a month ago are indeed ill winds of sadness, anxiety and pain but they often also bring some good."
"That good may be that people feel closer, feel drawn together and that we are all pulling in the same direction."
"Cooperation experienced in a European context does more in hard times than endless lofty speeches and we have seen here - and my congratulations first and foremost to the Commission on how it has kicked into action - that the European Union, which is often perceived as inflexible, is keen to show how flexible it can be by earmarking Structural Fund resources, by paying out aid to farmers, by implementing rules for funds available from Europe, by applying a flexible aid regime, i.e. where funds are not channelled directly, and by being flexible in its competition requirements."
"And this sends out a good message, a message that, when it has to, Europe can get moving."
"We have our work cut out for us."
"The Council and Parliament now need to hand out fast, solid aid."
"Fast aid because the dikes which have been inundated will not hold up forever."
"Help is needed."
"And solid aid because permanent help is needed and, may I say here loud and clear, that the proposed aid fund, which has our full and unwavering support, is clearly not designed to be a quick fix for a few months or a one-off incident."
"Anyone who has witnessed how two countries which, economically, are usually among the strongest in Europe, have received expressions of solidarity from countries which are not among the strongest will never again be able to refuse these regions help if disaster threatens in the future."
"I say that in the light of what we have done in the budget in previous years."
"Unfortunately, there was never enough money available to really be able to help."
"Basically, all we did was to raise hopes and then dash them again."
"This must not happen with the aid fund and we shall need to act accordingly."
"We need, however, to address a number of issues which go beyond these emergency measures."
"We need to deal with these issues in the Committee on Budgets and we shall be looking here for close contact and close cooperation with the Commission and the Council in order to get things moving as quickly as possible."
"But we also need to take account in our calculations of experience in formulating policies in other areas."
"Satellite data on flood management need to be included in the framework research programme, as does seismic research, because we are not just talking water here, we are also talking earthquakes - think of the Azores."
"We need to think about how to impose mandatory specifications to ensure buildings are stable."
"We also need to think very carefully about straightening rivers and about flood plains."
"And urgent help is needed."
"In the medium term, we need to create a solid basis for future help from the European Union - including financial help - and take preventive measures across the whole of the political spectrum which concerns us."
"Only then will help be credible, because only then will people take us seriously and, even then, we must not promise more than we can deliver."
"I should like to thank everyone who has helped and I trust we shall pull together over the coming weeks and months in order to carry out the work in hand."
"Mr President, members of the Commission, honourable Members, as you have already heard, my homeland, Austria, has suffered damage to the tune of EUR 7 500 million."
"I personally have cleaned up, evacuated and shovelled in Upper and Lower Austria, as have many of us here and thousands, literally thousands outside this House."
"Together we have witnessed the material need and mental anguish caused by this disaster, which has pushed people to the brink and wiped out houses, streets and businesses."
"Many only realised just how bad things were once the fire brigade, the army and the emergency services had left."
"I should like on behalf of a great many people to thank the authorities, the communes, the Länder, the governments of the Member States, the European Union and the volunteers and, as the chairman of a social organisation, the Österreichisches Hilfswerk, which is one of the eight organisations distributing donor money, to thank the thousands, or rather hundreds of thousands of donors."
"Civil society has proven its worth and has come up trumps."
"But its job is not yet done."
"The Austrian Chancellor, Dr. Schüssel, estimated yesterday that 70% of the damage has been recorded and EUR 65 - 70 million paid out directly."
"The leader of the Austrian delegation, Ursula Stenzel, took the initiative of tabling a joint resolution by Austrian members, which has been included in the joint resolution by the European Parliament."
"There is no need to define this disaster; it has already taken place, which is why the European Parliament is calling for emergency aid of EUR 1 billion for the flood area."
"We are calling for flexibility in the aid regulation, we are calling for Structural Fund resources to be reallocated, we are calling for the national cofinancing portion to be reduced, we are calling for national limits on aid to be lifted and we are calling for emergency aid to be paid out quickly; we want specific dates, not just promises."
"May I close by thanking all the honourable Members for the tone of this debate."
"There has been no playing victims off against non-victims, north against south, Member States against candidate countries, budget figures against each other, projects against new plans."
"It is clear from the debate that we need to act because we are all in the same boat."
"It is a good example of political maturity and of a willingness to demonstrate that actions speak louder than words, to help ensure there are no delays, that action is taken in the short term and that a new approach is taken in the long term."
"Mr President, I wish to say two things: the first is to express the profound and genuinely heartfelt solidarity of the Autonomous Region of the Azores; the second is to praise the words and specifically the action of Commissioner Barnier, who, for several years now, has dedicated considerable attention and commitment to the problem of natural disasters."
"What is needed now is to transform this commitment into a draft regulation that will ensure that these phenomena are dealt with objectively and impartially so that all citizens are treated equally, wherever they may live, be it in the mid-Atlantic or at the centre of Europe."
"This must be done, furthermore, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and bearing in mind the spirit that has been demonstrated in this House; the spirit that European solidarity is being built right now, in these times, which are extremely difficult for us all."
"Mr President, it has been a quiet but stirring debate."
"I am thinking of the eye-witness reports we have heard and also of the many expressions of sympathy and willingness to offer prompt assistance."
"I think it can be concluded that Parliament, the Commission and the Council are united in wanting to help the hundreds of thousands of people affected, and not only help them but help them quickly."
"We are looking forward to the Commission's presenting practical proposals."
"We think the Commission has acted well in this respect."
"The Presidency should do everything to ensure that the Council deals with the matter promptly and, judging by what I have now heard, I am certain that matters can also proceed very quickly here in Parliament."
"It is important to act speedily. As one MEP said, aid is twice as valuable when it is offered promptly."
"I am convinced that, both in the short and longer term, we can establish an effective tool for helping all the people affected."
"As I said in my introductory speech, the Foreign Ministers have given their support this weekend to our establishing a tool of this kind."
"Our task now is one of reconstruction following the extensive damage but, as many MEPs have mentioned, we must not forget the work of prevention either, for the damage could have been less serious if we had been more far-sighted in the way in which we had dealt with European rivers."
"A friend in need is a friend indeed, says an old proverb to be found in many languages."
"I think it important that the solidarity of which today's debate has been an expression should also extend beyond the existing or present Member States to include the candidate countries which would, in that way, be given a signal that they too were being considered in the context of what we were working on."
"It is that spirit of community and solidarity with the new Member States which, later in the year too, we shall be using to carry through one of the most important decisions in the history of Europe."
"Thank you Minister."
"I want to thank all colleagues who have participated in the debate."
"The tone of the debate and its content very much speaks for itself."
"Owing to the different executive responsibilities of our colleagues in the Commission, it is important that we should profit from their presence at the end of this debate by inviting each of the Commissioners to make a short statement pertaining to the college in general and, specifically, to their own portfolios."
"Mr President, honourable Members, fellow members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to thank you all for your speeches and for the tone of this debate."
"I think this really was one of the European Parliament's finest hours."
"I have no wish to speak at length; I merely wish to answer the questions addressed directly to me."
"The main question here is, how will the measures decided for farming now be implemented?"
"The first measure decided was to use set-aside areas."
"This measure is up and running."
"These areas can already be used in the regions in question."
"The second measure decided was to provide grain for fodder from intervention stocks in Austria."
"This measure is also up and running."
"Applications are already being received from the Austrian authorities."
"The third and most comprehensive measure is to give priority to advance payments of 50% of the area premiums in the current budgetary year."
"Mr Goepel asked what the state of play is here."
"The decision has been taken and will be processed, the money will be allocated using the normal allocation procedures used for premiums."
"This is the quickest method."
"In other words, the sums in question are released by the executive in each Member State."
"May I add that this has since been somewhat extended and that these advance payments already total over EUR 900 million."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members, I think that once again today's debate has sent out a clear signal, a clear signal of solidarity and a clear signal that the European institutions are working very well together and are being supportive of each other in this situation."
"I think this too is highly significant."
"The Commission decided what help it could give in its executive capacity, what measures we could take directly, at its special meeting after the summer recess."
"There is financial aid for farmers, pre-accession aid and, most importantly of course, the Structural Funds."
"But we can also offer greater flexibility."
"On this point, I should like to stress that we decided, as far as tendering rules are concerned, to allow maximum flexibility in the regions affected, so that swift action can be taken."
"My colleague, Mr Monti, has made it perfectly clear that no objections under aid regulations will be filed against national aid to compensate up to 100% of the damage sustained by businesses and that this aid may even include loss of earnings or orders."
"I think this is a very important signal to the businesses affected in these areas."
"As regards the question of setting up a fund to provide direct aid in the event of natural disasters, I am most grateful for the huge consensus in the House, a consensus which cuts across the party political divide and is in step with the Council."
"As you know, we have had no such instrument, no aid fund for natural disasters in the past."
"We need to set this fund up first."
"That means we need agreement and a special contract between Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"The Commission will be tabling a proposal on this in the next few weeks."
"We shall then have to create the corresponding legal basis, so that money from the fund can be disbursed."
"I have a direct request to make of the European Parliament and the Council here: please remember the devil is in the detail when you formulate this legal basis; bear in mind that we want to get the money to the regions affected quickly."
"We should give the regions affected a lump sum in aid and, instead of waiting for projects to be specifically formulated, we should declare the aid as such for the region."
"It would appear from the debate that the whole House agrees that we shall need aid of at least EUR 500 million to 1 000 million per annum."
"We need to come to an agreement with the Council here, because the fund will obviously have to be financed by the Member States, even if we want to provide aid this year without calling up new funds."
"However, we should also make it clear that aid from us is subsidiary aid. It is solidarity aid on the part of the European Union and we should not raise false hopes."
"I also understood from today's debate that the House agrees that the decisions in question, the regulations in question need to be passed post haste."
"This being so, we shall have to set ourselves an ambitious timetable so that the decisions needed to set up this emergency aid fund can be taken by the end of October."
"Thank you for your support."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members, I should like to pick up on just one thought that has run through the whole of this debate, namely the fact that, in the midst of such awful disaster, comforting moments occur, especially when humanity suddenly shows its face where it was least expected."
"I am delighted that we have been able to show the human face of European politics."
"That applies not just to the disaster areas in Germany and Austria."
"I can assure you that it was highly prized in the Czech Republic."
"The speed with which we acted and the fact that we took it for granted that action was needed have left behind a far deeper impression than much we have done for the Czech Republic over recent years."
"To know that, in your hour of need, you are in the same boat as your neighbour and to see help given in a spirit of solidarity has answered the question raised by a lot of people in this country: why exactly do we want Europe and do we need it?"
"I am very grateful to the European Parliament that, like the Commission and the Council, it has not wasted time worrying about distinctions between Member States and future Member States when it comes to aid from the new emergency reserve."
"We can choose our contracting partners, but we cannot choose our neighbours."
"If it rains cats and dogs in Austria and Saxony and in the Czech Republic, which is in between the two, we cannot say we shall help Austria and we shall help Saxony, but we shall not help the Czech Republic."
"And people in Prague noticed that this is the general view."
"I was there on Thursday."
"It seems to me - and I say this in all caution - that the flood has also washed away a number of recent political problems between the countries affected."
"Mr President, as we reach the end of this debate, I would like to add a few thoughts to those of my colleagues."
"It is telling that several Commissioners wanted to be present throughout this debate as we have worked together, and each of us, in their own sector, must contribute to a swift, effective response."
"In particular, I would like to say to Mr Ferber and Mr Markov that we are really going to use all the margins for flexibility available to us on the cofinancing rate, invitations to tender and State aid."
"What applies to the Structural Funds for EU Member States also applies to pre-accession instruments for the Czech Republic and Slovakia, as Mr Verheugen has already said."
"I would reply to Mrs Krehl that we have no intention of excluding these two candidate countries from our solidarity."
"Earlier, Mrs Schroeder spoke of the villages or regions bordering her home town of Dresden."
"I personally will not forget the sight of the town of Wiesenstein, which profoundly affected me. This small town had only just been rebuilt and restored after the fall of the Berlin wall, and, tragically, it has now been destroyed."
"We must not forget that aspect, in addition to the large towns concerned."
"I would also like to respond to Mr Virrankoski, who mentioned the Fund's methodology."
"Very shortly, on 18 September, we shall present a proposal: speed, effectiveness and fairness for the distribution methods of this new Fund."
"I am currently working on criteria that will make it possible to characterise a major disaster."
"A major natural disaster, in my opinion, is a disaster that seriously affects a significant proportion of the population in one or more regions, in one or more States."
"It is also a disaster that severely compromises the economy of that region, group of regions, State or group of States."
"That is clearly the case of the floods that have recently affected many regions and four States."
"It is in this spirit that we are working."
"Mrs Berger has mentioned the regions that do not fall within the scope of objective 1 or objective 2."
"The point of this exceptional aid Fund that we are creating together is that it will be able to fund regions outside the objective 1 and 2 areas that have been affected or which could be affected in future."
"Lastly, I would like to say to Mr Swoboda and Mrs Echerer and others who have spoken about sustainable development, as I myself did in my first speech on prevention, that there is no European competence for land use planning."
"Town and country planning falls within the competence of local authorities, regions, or even the Member States."
"The Commission is not claiming new competences, either now or within the scope of the Convention."
"We do, however, have a responsibility."
"I am consciously using this word in the same way as the expression 'political courage'."
"Our responsibility is to ensure, as in the case of the credits managed within the framework of the Structural Funds, that the credits we are going to allocate within the framework of the total appropriations under this Fund, are used in the field, pursuant to the directives on the environment, with the requirement for sustainable development and perhaps with an additional requirement from now on, concerning prevention."
"This may be the case of the credits allocated within the scope of Agenda 2000-2006."
"I promise you that in the proposals I shall make on behalf of the Commission for future regional policy after 2006, the emphasis will be placed on this obligation to take account, with regard to prevention, of the risk of natural and ecological disasters for the future programming documents in each of the regions that are to receive credits."
"That is the commitment I am giving."
"In conclusion, as Mr Karas said earlier, I have been struck by the tremendous dignity and high quality of this debate."
"That is to be expected and basically demonstrates the action, rapid reaction and solidarity that must exist within the European Union and the neighbouring candidate countries - one big family facing their misfortune together."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"For the past two hours this has been a debate marked with a very particular character."
"For all of the European institutions it demands the speediest and most substantial response we can deliver."
"As mentioned in the debate, in times of crisis it shows that the European Union is indeed a union with a human face."
"That is something perhaps more fundamental in its totality than the sum of all its individual parts."
"I thank those who have contributed to the debate."
"I received six motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 42(5)."
"The next item is the presentation by the Council of the 2003 draft general budget."
"Minister Haarder will now speak on behalf of the Council."
"I have the honour, on behalf of the Presidency of the Council, to present the 2003 draft budget of the European Communities, prepared by the Council on 22 July."
"Both as Minister for European Affairs and former Member of the European Parliament, I am very pleased to note that the budget procedure for 2003 has so far been characterised by sound cooperation between the Council and the European Parliament."
"In the draft budget I am about to present, account has already been taken of a series of agreements and common understandings resulting from the consultation meeting between the Council and Parliament on 19 July 2002."
"During the preparatory three-way discussion and consultation meeting in July, some single-minded work was done by the Danish Finance Minister, Thor Pedersen, Committee Chairman Terry Wynn and your fellow MEPs in the committee."
"I am certain that this work has created a sound basis for the budget authority's two branches being able to reach agreement on a satisfactory budget for 2003."
"I know that some MEPs have previously been disappointed about the fact that the European Parliament and the Council have had difficulty reaching agreement, but that has not been the case this year, which is something I am very pleased about."
"I shall presently touch upon a number of challenges which have already been debated by the European Parliament and the Council and in connection with which agreements and common understandings have been reached."
"I shall then provide a general survey of the main features of the draft budget prepared by the Council on 22 July."
"I should first like, however, to refer to the debate we have just had in connection with the tragic floods."
"We are all agreed that this new challenge requires prompt action to be taken."
"It is heartening that the individual Member States have already, on their own initiative, been contributing to the reconstruction."
"At the same time, the Commission has implemented a series of initiatives, which have just been discussed, and the Council is now to debate what further measures can be implemented."
"I shall now return to the results of the meeting of Parliament and the Council on 19 July."
"A common understanding and agreement were reached to the effect that the administrative preparation for enlargement is a key priority which the institutions must be given the opportunity to discuss from now on and right through 2003."
"A common understanding was reached to the effect that work must be done on securing funding for the common foreign and security policy in the light of important new tasks."
"A common understanding was also reached to the effect that the restructuring of the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets should be financed and that the growth rate for the global appropriations for payments should be kept as low as possible."
"Allow me firstly to say a few words about the administrative expenditure for 2003."
"The agreement reached by the two branches of the budget authority in July is a sound one."
"The Council and the European Parliament acknowledge that the institutions must prepare themselves for enlargement of the EU in 2003."
"This will involve additional administrative expenditure."
"For example, there will be need for more staff and more space."
"By means of the agreement entered into, we have attached importance to securing funding for the pre-enlargement measures that are necessary for the individual institutions."
"At the same time, there is agreement that the ceiling for the administrative expenditure in 2003 should be retained."
"The flexibility instrument must not be used."
"The two branches of the budget authority have agreed that, in particular, pre-enlargement expenditure intended to be applied in 2003 may, as far as is possible, be applied as early as this year."
"This will make it easier for the institutions to prepare for enlargement."
"For the moment, the purpose of this frontloading exercise is to finance the publication of the Community's body of laws in the languages of the new Member States."
"In this connection, there will, among other things, be a need to adopt an additional supplementary and amending budget for 2002."
"By means of an agreement reached as early as in July, the institutions will acquire the best possible basis for planning as they prepare for enlargement."
"The agreement will secure a calmer atmosphere surrounding both the European Parliament's and the Council's budgets for 2003."
"Moreover, it is a good thing that we are agreed about following up the opportunities for increased interinstitutional cooperation indicated by the secretaries-general of the institutions in a series or reports."
"A solution has also been found to the issue of the early retirement of employees of the European Parliament's political groups."
"Both Parliament and the Council accord high priority to the EU's participation in external actions, that is to say the common foreign and security policy."
"The European Union should have adequate resources for being able at any time to carry out the tasks consequent upon our position in the international community."
"As I am quite sure MEPs agree, it is a question of the EU's credibility."
"At the consultation meeting in July, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed that, when required by the circumstances, the emergency aid reserve for humanitarian aid may also be used for civil crisis management."
"It was also agreed that an attempt should be made to enter into an agreement concerning the appropriations to the common foreign and security policy."
"This must happen as part of an overall agreement concerning the 2003 budget."
"We must secure the appropriations to the CFSP in 2003 in the light of new and essential tasks."
"We also concur about seeking an agreement concerning how best to involve Parliament in CFSP arrangements within the framework of the Treaty."
"It is heartening that such good results have already been achieved in this field."
"In its draft budget, the Commission has set aside an amount of EUR 40 million to the CFSP."
"In this way, preparation has been made for taking over the policing mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"The Council welcomes this appropriation but believes that the overall appropriations are inadequate."
"The Council therefore proposes a total appropriation for the common foreign and security policy of EUR 47.5 million for 2003."
"Above and beyond the policing mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Council foresees, for example, measures involving specialist assistance to third countries in the fight against terrorism."
"Moreover, there is a need for more appropriations for non-proliferation and disarmament measures."
"I hope we can reach agreement on something corresponding to the Council's proposal."
"I shall touch briefly upon the Commission's proposal to use the flexibility instrument for providing funding to the tune of EUR 27 million for restructuring the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets."
"In this area, both the European Parliament and the Council have undertaken to find a solution before the close of the budget procedure."
"In the Council's view, the flexibility instrument should only be used in extraordinary circumstances."
"On the issue of providing EUR 27 million by way of funding, the Council believes that all possible methods of funding should be investigated before consideration is given to the Commission's proposal to use the flexibility instrument for this purpose."
"Finally, a couple of words about the growth rate for the global appropriations for payments."
"In this connection, I am pleased that Parliament agrees about the need to exercise budget discipline and sound financial management."
"During the consultation in July, Parliament declared that the growth rate for the global appropriations for payments should be kept as low as possible."
"At the same time, account must be taken of the Council's first reading of the 2003 budget."
"As politicians, all of us in this Assembly are well aware that significant refunds to the Member States of unused EU funds present the public with a poor picture of the EU."
"We must show the surrounding world that we are in a position to engage in realistic budgeting."
"The Council would like to request the Commission to state the anticipated surplus for 2002 so that this can be factored into the 2003 budget via a letter of amendment."
"Allow me to go on to mention a number of key features of the Council's draft budget."
"The global appropriations for commitments amount to EUR 99 548 million, which constitutes an increase of scarcely 0.9% on the 2002 figure."
"Special account has been taken of the possibility of the appropriations in actual fact having been used up."
"The global appropriations for payments amount to EUR 96 992 million, which constitutes an increase of 1.4% on the 2002 figure."
"This low growth rate must be seen in the light of the limited use of appropriations for payments in preceding years."
"The first reading of the 2003 draft budget took place:"
"with due account being taken of the interinstitutional agreement of 6 May 1999 on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure"
"within the framework of the Council's conclusions of 5 March 2002 concerning the budgetary guidelines for 2003, and"
"with account being taken of the conclusions from the consultation meeting of 19 July 2002 between Parliament and the Council."
"Particular care was taken"
"to maintain the annual expenditure ceilings established in the financial perspectives for 2000-2006"
"if possible, to leave adequate margins below the ceilings for the various areas of expenditure, except in the case of the categories relating to Structural Funds and pre-accession aid, in which the ceilings include expenditure targets"
"to set adequate funds aside for the EU's various priorities."
"I should like to emphasise a couple of the main points in the Council draft budget within the various areas of expenditure."
"With regard to agriculture, the Council proposes an adjustment downwards of EUR 288 million."
"Experience has shown that the appropriations for the common agricultural policy have often been set too high."
"The Commission is now being given the opportunity to re-evaluate its estimate in connection with the autumn letter of amendment."
"Due account can be taken in this context of the latest information concerning, for example, market conditions and the changing rate of exchange of the dollar."
"In this connection, the Council joins with Parliament in noting that the Commission will also look more closely into whether the amount it has proposed for eradicating animal diseases is adequate."
"When it comes to the appropriations for the development of rural districts, the Council has accepted the Commission's preliminary draft budget."
"Where structural arrangements are concerned, the appropriations for commitments have been fully charged to the budget."
"This has happened in accordance with the conclusions from the European Council meeting in March 1999 in Berlin."
"The Council has accepted the Commission's proposals almost in their entirety."
"There has nonetheless been a downwards adjustment of EUR 525 million in the appropriations to the Structural Funds in the light of previous years' underutilisation of the appropriations."
"Where the internal policies are concerned, the Council has accepted the amounts about which agreement was reached in connection with already adopted multiannual programmes."
"In the case of programmes under discussion, the Council has adjusted the appropriations so that they reflect the Council's common position or the result of the discussions in the Council."
"These downward adjustments do not affect projects in connection with regions bordering on the candidate countries."
"Allow me also just to mention that the Council has slightly increased the appropriations for funding the special Olympic Games in Europe in 2003."
"A margin of EUR 122 million has been left under the ceiling for expenditure area 3, enabling the European Parliament to fund various priorities, at the same time as making it possible to cover future needs."
"Where expenditure area 4 - external policies - is concerned, the Council has accepted the appropriations in the Commission's draft budget almost in their entirety."
"It is important, for example, to finance the efforts in Afghanistan."
"Under expenditure area 4, the Council has agreed to accept the appropriations to international fisheries agreements proposed by the Commission."
"I have already mentioned the Council decision concerning the budget for the CFSP."
"A margin of EUR 80 million under the ceiling for expenditure area 4 has been left, enabling the European Parliament to fund various priorities, at the same time as making it possible also to cover future needs."
"I have already mentioned the administrative expenditure under category 5."
"I shall conclude my report on the various expenditure areas with expenditure area 7, relating to pre-accession aid."
"The Council draft budget makes no changes to the Commission's proposals concerning the appropriations for commitments."
"The appropriations for payments have, however, been adjusted downwards by EUR 300 million."
"This must be seen in the light of the preceding years' underutilisation of the appropriations."
"All in all, I am pleased to be able to state that the Council draft budget for 2003 contains sufficient funds to cover the EU's various priorities, as well as taking account of the agreements and common understandings we reached at the first consultation meeting in July."
"You all know that this budget procedure is only just beginning and that there is still a way to go before the final adoption of the 2003 budget."
"The prior conditions are present for our being able to obtain a satisfactory budget by the end of the year."
"The draft budget prepared by the Council offers a sound basis for this."
"The agreements and common understandings we reached at the meeting on 19 July are a positive sign that we have the will to reach agreement."
"In conclusion, I would point out that I am certain that all three institutions present here today will do their best to contribute to a careful prioritisation so that the challenges of next year can be met."
"I am also certain that we shall not forget that, in the last analysis, the EU budget is funded by the citizens of Europe."
"That is why budgeting must be realistic and responsible - for next year too."
"Thank you, Minister."
"It is always interesting to hear a former Member of this House speaking as a minister."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members. The previous debate on aid in the event of natural disasters clearly demonstrated what people's expectations of the European budget are."
"But if we look at the real national quotas, i.e. the ratio between the European budget and the European national product, then the picture looks slightly different."
"It is almost the reverse, because the national quotas account for just over one per cent."
"The Commission proposed 1.03% of the European national product for the 2003 budget."
"The Council cut this back slightly."
"According to the financial perspective, i.e. the financial forecasts we have all agreed on, it should in fact be 1.08%."
"I think this should in fact be taken as a guideline, even though I am in favour of keeping certain reserves back for contingencies, just to be on the safe side."
"The Council has now made across-the-board reductions, for example in the agricultural sector, but has disregarded the fact that we need to revalue in order to take account of the current value of the dollar."
"But we are agreed that a new presentation of the necessary agricultural expenditure needs to be made in the autumn."
"The Council has accepted a great many of the Commission's estimates for the draft 2003 budget."
"We welcome that."
"We also generally welcome the fact that a consensus has been reached in the foreign policy area and that the so-called emergency reserve can also be used to fund civil crisis management."
"I think that this should give us more chance to react quickly to crises and that this is an important step on the road towards a clear, efficient common foreign and security policy."
"However, I must also seriously criticise the outcome of the Council reading."
"For example, the question of how funds to restructure the fisheries fleet in Spain and Portugal or measures needed to support sustainable fisheries reforms shall be financed has still not been answered."
"This question was broached but then put on the back burner."
"And the Council has reduced funds to cofinance the trans-European transport and energy network by 15 million."
"Member States already have high hopes in precisely this sector, which will now be discussed in connection with natural disasters."
"I think this reduction should also be reversed."
"I must also heavily criticise the Council decision on personnel expenditure, i.e. its approach to the personnel costs of the individual institutions."
"The financial perspective allowed a 3.6% increase for all the institutions."
"And yet the Council has awarded itself a much higher increase."
"Taking personnel costs alone, the Council has awarded itself a twofold increase."
"And if you add in all the Council's administrative expenditure, the Council has awarded itself an 11% increase."
"I must state quite clearly here, to paraphrase the words used with such gusto by the Ecofin Council, the Council of Finance Ministers, on another occasion: this Council decision on its own administrative resources does not fit into the budgetary landscape."
"It has helped itself, at the cost of others, to be precise at the cost of the Commission, where the Council has suggested swingeing cuts."
"Obviously, the Commission's administrative expenses for the year 2003 will be very high, because this is the year we shall be preparing for the biggest enlargement in the history of the European Union and the Commission will need to start preparations in 2003 so that we can control new members right from the start."
"For example, we shall need to control how environmental laws are being transposed, if competition rules are being complied with, what the situation is in the food law sector or the veterinary sector and whether European Union legislation is also being implemented."
"These are just some examples of the Commission's work."
"Obviously, there is no point in starting to negotiate structural assistance or agricultural aid programmes with new members once they have already joined."
"Preparations need to start now and that takes staff."
"The Council has allowed itself 236 new posts in order to prepare for enlargement."
"By contrast, it has questioned and reduced the funding of current posts at the Commission."
"Parliament drafted a model here which was then enshrined in an agreement."
"This model requires efforts to be made to frontload certain administrative expenses in 2002, so as to have funds available for Commission staff costs in order to prepare for enlargement."
"That only works, however, if all the institutions consider the model binding."
"I must therefore insist on the Commission's behalf that we take stock in October in order to ascertain whether this frontloading model is working or, if it is not, whether new decisions need to be taken."
"Enlargement needs to be prepared so that it works right from the start."
"The Commission is counting on the European Parliament, it is confident that the European Parliament will not state that it is satisfied with the resolution passed in July alone and will check to ensure the Council is also making an effort to implement this frontloading model."
"I repeat, the Commission needs personnel resources in order to prepare for enlargement."
"Otherwise we cannot guarantee that the work needed to make a success of enlargement will be carried out from the start."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, I welcome Mr Haarder and it is good to see him again in his new role."
"He knows he is always welcome in this House."
"Please send our regards to Mr Pedersen; it was good working with him."
"I do not want to go into detail on many of the issues because I will leave that to both rapporteurs, who have mentioned several items."
"I would like to concentrate on one or two specific political issues."
"One concerns the agreement that was reached at conciliation on Category 5."
"Whilst it left the Council very happy, we in Parliament realised that we had probably made an enemy of the Commission by agreeing to that deal."
"But let me reiterate why we did so."
"We were convinced that in no way, shape or form would the Council ever agree to the flexibility instrument being used for Category 5."
"Therefore we agreed to a deal that would bring benefits for Parliament and the other institutions and a sensible approach to Category 5, not as the Commission wanted."
"The things we have proposed about frontloading, the use of ramassage and so on are there to ease the pain of the Commission."
"We know the Commission is going to suffer but we are trying to ease the situation slightly."
"If there are problems with enlargement because of what has occurred, then the Commission needs to convince the Council, not us, of its needs regarding staffing levels, because some of us are actually convinced."
"Having said that, we cannot be criticised for the help we have given the Commission in its staffing needs over the last two years."
"Against the wishes of the Council, we have helped the Commission to increase its establishment plans by several hundred members of staff."
"So any criticism can only apply to next year."
"Please bear in mind that we have stood side by side with the Commission."
"This is an attempt to make the reform a success and to ensure that the Commission has the right people to do the jobs that we expect it to do."
"I say that because the deal was quite unique."
"However, Mr Stenmarck and Mr Färm on our committee now have to determine what will constitute the global ramassage for this year."
"That is the task of both our rapporteurs, certainly Mr Stenmarck, who will look at the other institutions to see what money there is left over in their budgets to be put into the pot to ensure that the Commission is not disadvantaged to any great extent."
"We are aware that what we can find this year will be acceptable, but this leaves the problem of staffing next year, so whatever we can save for next year's budget we will."
"My other political point concerns the common foreign and security policy."
"The President-in-Office mentioned it in his speech."
"Let us be clear on our position."
"We did not make an agreement on what the amounts are for the CFSP."
"The amount in this year's budget was EUR 30 million; the amount in the PDB was EUR 40 million and the amount entered in the Council's first reading is EUR 47.5 million."
"We made no agreements on that and, as far as we are concerned, we stick by Article 39 of the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"That figure as it stands right now should be EUR 30 million."
"That is not to say that, come our second reading, the figure may well be EUR 47.5 million but, for the sake of this debate and to clarify issues, our argument is that the Council put the wrong figure in: it should be EUR 30 million."
"There may be a legal interpretation as to when that disagreement was confirmed but, as far as we are concerned, it was confirmed at the conciliation meeting."
"Let us not forget that there are problems in other categories also."
"In Category 2, the EUR 27 million entered for the restructuring of the fleet is not going to appear by magic."
"We must be serious when we say we must find a way of solving that."
"It would seem that the only way we can do so is by using the flexibility instrument."
"The Council may have to have a rethink on that unless it comes forward with a better idea which we have not yet thought of."
"That is all I want to say on the political aspects."
"I will leave the rest to the rapporteurs."
"Mr President, thank you ladies and gentlemen and, especially, a big thank-you to the Danish Presidency."
"Just as Mr Wynn said, we really appreciated the constructive attitude we encountered at the July conciliation when, for the first time in many years, we in actual fact produced an agreement of genuine substance."
"Why, then, did we come to this agreement where category 5 is concerned?"
"Mr Wynn touched upon this."
"We were subjected to strong pressure from the Member States and the Council and finally decided to agree to the flexibility instrument's not being used."
"There was one further reason, however, for we believe we must make the fullest possible use of all the available means for rationalising and prioritising what we do, moving resources about, increasing efficiency and creating modern management in the European Union too."
"We must use the opportunities to the full, especially when we face so incredibly important a task as enlargement."
"I nonetheless share the Commission's view when it comes to a rather longer perspective."
"It would be difficult in the long term to impose a lot of major new tasks upon the Commission without also providing the necessary resources in terms of staff and administrative resources."
"This will probably become a source of conflict in the future, but I believe it was necessary this year to do things in the way we have."
"How does the general budget situation look prior to the autumn budget procedure?"
"Above all, we must discuss what Parliament has been calling attention to for quite a few years, namely the poor implementation in many areas."
"Every year, the budget allocates major resources which are subsequently not used."
"Mr Haarder drew attention to this July's agreement to the effect that we must not increase the payments more than is necessary, and he even wants us to leave margins."
"The problem, however, is that, through the commitments made in the budget, we have also decided upon a certain level of ambition to which we must try to rise."
"That must also be a goal for the Member States and the Council."
"The finance ministers cannot just sit and applaud when they are given back money that has not been used."
"We have a political responsibility actually to realise the ambitions and implement the programmes we have decided upon in the European Union."
"That is why Parliament repeatedly increases the payments."
"We wish to signal that more must be done, and we must invest greater resources in order actually to fulfil the promises made."
"I believe that we shall be conducting a debate along these lines in Parliament this year too."
"It is not, however, certain that it is enough just to increase the payments, and we have had certain examples of its not being so."
"Sometimes, increased payments do not after all lead to the Commission's being able to use those resources."
"As I have already mentioned, we must therefore discuss the Commission's staff resources in a slightly longer term perspective."
"We must also perhaps begin to discuss cutting back on our commitments."
"In certain areas, where we see the Commission not at all implementing what we have demanded, we must perhaps even begin to discuss whether we should cut down on staff or, at least, hold them in reserve."
"In the long run, staff resources intended for commitments of a certain level cannot be maintained when such commitments are not being met."
"This problem of payments and implementation also looms very large when it comes to foreign policy and aid policy."
"Year after year, we have seen how the Council has acquired more ambitions."
"In 2000, Kosovo was added to the list, and there was subsequently a slight loss of interest in fulfilling the earlier promises concerning Africa and Latin America."
"In 2001, Serbia was the new concern, whereupon there was slightly less interest in the former priorities."
"New concerns for 2002 included the Global Health Fund."
"This year, we are discussing Afghanistan, the Middle East and the police force for Bosnia."
"In fact, we cannot add new tasks every year and simply forget the old ones."
"There is a limit beyond which further resources must be provided if all our priorities are to be met."
"This year, we shall have a lot of difficulty meeting our priorities where the Global Health Fund is concerned."
"There are already huge cut-backs in the budget in connection with Kosovo, humanitarian aid etc. That is unsustainable in the long term."
"If new priorities are to be added each year, further resources must also be provided."
"Allow me finally to say a few words about simplification."
"We have studied Structural Funds and a series of different political programmes."
"I have travelled around - most recently in Finland, for example - and learned that regional organisations and universities etc are giving up applying for funds from the EU budget because the process is so terribly involved."
"That, I believe, is one reason why EU money is not in actual fact being spent."
"It is time to take this state of affairs seriously."
"Within the EU, we must sit down and go through our methods, documents and bureaucracy so that the process is made a little simpler for all those who need to use EU resources."
"Mr President, I believe these are some of the most important aspects we shall be continuing to discuss in Parliament, in the Committee on Budgets and in future budget debates."
"Mr President, allow me also to begin by thanking the Danish Presidency for its splendid cooperation so far."
"Ever since early last winter, when we began work on the 2003 budget, my objective, as rapporteur and as a person responsible for next year's budgets for eight of the EU institutions, has at any rate been to find a solution in which the EU's administrative budget is balanced and in which we do not have to ask for extra money by making use of what is known as the flexibility instrument."
"That has not been an easy task because we had predicted a very large deficit in this budget at the beginning of the year."
"With the agreement made on 19 July by the EU's two budget authorities - the Council and Parliament - it has nonetheless proved to be possible."
"I would maintain that our having now achieved this objective is a very great success for Parliament."
"We have obtained support for reforms that are necessary, especially in an enlarged EU."
"The flexibility instrument must not be used for the EU's administrative budget."
"We must respect the ceiling for category 5."
"Following the conciliation, there is now a common commitment to solve the remaining problems in category 5 by means of what is known as frontloading."
"Doing so is important in that a number of problems remain to be solved during the last months of the year."
"I am nonetheless convinced that we shall also be able to solve them."
"In this context, it would be very easy to allow one's vision to be clouded by all the details, and the budget work is certainly extremely detailed."
"Together, we have nonetheless created better basic conditions for proceeding further with the historic task of, in a few years' time, welcoming MEPs from perhaps ten new Member States to this Parliament and to the EU's other institutions."
"As I see it, that is absolutely the most important outcome of the conciliation."
"As early as the beginning of next year, these countries will be able to send observers to what will also become their own Parliament."
"With the result of the agreement, we are complying not only with our commitments but also with the priorities decided upon by the Committee on Budgets and Parliament at the beginning of this year."
"It is firstly a question of ensuring that the EU institutions are given the opportunity to prepare for enlargement."
"Secondly, it is a question of implementing the necessary reforms."
"Thirdly, the intention is that both objectives should be attained within the budgetary framework."
"I want to direct my concluding comment concerning the agreement between Parliament and the Council to the Danish Presidency which, in my view, has worked in an extremely effective way and with the clearly defined objective of reaching an agreement."
"The Danish Presidency has focused upon this task and been constructive and ready to compromise in a way that has made an agreement possible."
"It has shown a readiness to listen that has not always been characteristic of the Council in this context."
"I, and no doubt many others too, are grateful for this."
"The Council has for a long time been criticised for not having always made the same demands of itself as of others."
"The Council has not itself been prepared to implement the reductions forced upon others."
"When the Council has cut back on jobs in other institutions, it has not cut back on jobs within the Council itself."
"A rather more humble attitude may in actual fact be necessary in the future."
"I hope and believe that, in this respect, the Danish Presidency has played a positive role which will have lasting effects in the future."
"Thank you very much, Mr Stenmarck."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0257/2002)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Commission."
"Part I"
"Question No 35 by Francisca Sauquillo Pérez del Arco (H-0541/02):"
"Subject: Specific immigration strand for the MEDA programme"
"Judging from the information furnished in connection with the interview between Commissioner Patten and Prime Minister Youssoufi of Morocco on 27 June, the European Commission is in no doubt as to the scale of the problem of illegal immigration."
"Does the Commission propose to devote a specific strand of the MEDA programme to immigration?"
"Do any concrete projects exist in this respect?"
"Are there any projects devoted to women immigrants?"
"Mr President, the Commission pursues a global and balanced approach to immigration from Morocco."
"Given the importance of the subject, migration is one of the five priorities of the country strategy paper covering the period 2002 to 2006 for financial cooperation with Morocco."
"It is also covered by the Association Agreement between the EC and Morocco."
"Our approach to migration is comprehensive."
"Attention is paid both to legal and illegal migration and to the socio-economic dimension."
"This comprehensive approach is also reflected in our MEDA programming."
"Within this framework we will aim to help the Moroccan authorities to better organise legal migration."
"A project to set up a migration centre is currently being prepared."
"Morocco and the EC have also agreed to cooperate in preventing and combating illegal migration."
"As a first step, a border management programme will help the Moroccan authorities to establish greater border security and to fight trafficking in human beings."
"This programme, which is worth about EUR 40 million, will be committed in 2003."
"Furthermore, we are addressing the socio-economic causes of migration, in particular in the northern provinces of Morocco, which account for about 35% of total emigration from that country."
"This region also benefited from substantial MEDA funding and another EUR 70 million are programmed for socio-economic development in 2004."
"The majority of the existing projects in the northern provinces help improve the economic situation of migrant as well as non-migrant women, in particular through basic education for girls in rural areas, maternal and child health services, promotion of productive activities for women and provision of basic infrastructures."
"In addition to MEDA, the Commission is financing projects under the budget line 'cooperation with third countries in the area of migration'."
"EUR 3.3 million have been committed for projects in Morocco, in particular in the areas of co-development, intergovernmental migration dialogue and the fight against illegal immigration."
"Mr President, I simply wish to thank the Commissioner for the information he has given me and say to him that - in terms of the co-development he has mentioned, which could resolve the problem of immigration - I will be closely monitoring all these projects and programmes he has proposed throughout north Africa, including the north of Morocco, which I believe to be very important if we are to prevent emigration."
"I should like to make three brief points in response to that."
"Firstly, it is manifestly the case that one of the best ways of preventing illegal migration is by promoting economic and social development."
"I have no doubt about that."
"Secondly, Morocco and other countries face real problems, given that they are themselves the targets of illegal migration from the south and often find themselves the route through which illegal migrants pass on the way to Europe."
"We must help them deal with that problem."
"Thirdly, obviously it would help Morocco if we were to be able to move from informal discussions to formal negotiations about a readmission agreement. We recognise that Morocco has some concerns, which we hope can be satisfied, so that we can move on to that sort of formal agreement as soon as reasonable."
"We sympathise with the problems that Morocco has to face; we want to help Morocco deal with those economic and social problems, and we support the efforts it has made, not least in the area of gender."
"Question No 36 by Emilia Franziska Müller (H-0570/02):"
"Subject: Relaxation of the ban on using meat-and-bone meal in animal feedstuffs"
"What does the Commission intend to do to ensure that any remaining stocks of meat-and-bone meal do not re-enter the animal feedstuffs circuit and, hence, the human food chain?"
"What has the Commission done to date in order to have at its disposal at the earliest possible date validated and secure analytical procedures which could establish the presence of meat-and-bone meal in animal feedstuffs and the presence of risk material in meat-and-bone meal?"
"How will the Commission ensure that, should the ban on using meat-and-bone meal in animal feedstuffs be relaxed, every possible danger to consumers from any remaining stocks of meat-and-bone meal and from risk material in meat-and-bone meal will be excluded?"
"Mr President, the extended feed ban remains in force as a transitional measure until 30 June 2003."
"By that time, the feed ban should be reviewed."
"The review will take into account the forthcoming animal by-products regulation, the correct practical implementation of measures to control the feed ban, evolving scientific evidence and the availability of control methods."
"The Commission services are already carefully examining the potential impact of different options for revising the feed ban but it is too early to predict the outcome of that exercise."
"The implementation of the feed ban in the Member States is being monitored systematically by regular inspections carried out by the Food and Veterinary Office."
"The FVO reports highlight the considerable efforts made by Member States to implement the rules."
"However, where any weaknesses are identified specific recommendations are made after each inspection to further improve the controls."
"The Commission has on several occasions expressed its concerns about the safe transport, storage and destruction of meat-and-bone meal."
"For this reason the adoption of the animal by-products regulation will be much welcomed."
"It creates a legal framework for the safe disposal of meat-and-bone meal by incineration, burial or landfill."
"It also lays down the rules for the safe use of meat-and-bone meal as fertiliser, in biogas production and in animal feeding."
"At present, meat-and-bone meal can only be used in pet food or in feed for animals."
"The new control framework created by the animal by-products regulation opens up the possibility of revising the present prohibition on the use of meat-and-bone meal."
"The animal by-products regulation includes provisions on channelling and traceability which will ensure that the present stocks of meat-and-bone meal cannot fraudulently be reintroduced into the feed chain."
"Specified risk materials must already be marked as soon as they are removed from the carcasses, stored separately and finally destroyed."
"The Commission is co-financing a research programme with two main objectives: firstly, harmonisation of the feed ban controlled by classical microscopy as well as improving its efficiency and secondly the development and validation of new methods based on alternative techniques."
"The Commission is following the results of this research programme as well as private initiatives in this field closely and will take the results into account when reviewing the feed ban."
"Whatever the outcome of the revision of the feed ban may be, I can assure you that the Commission will not reauthorise the use of meat-and-bone meal in animal feed unless every possible risk to consumers and animals can be excluded and the provisions can be controlled properly."
"Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, your main argument for relaxing the feed ban is the cost of disposing of animal by-products."
"Now that is more of an economic argument or an environmental protection argument."
"To hear this argument from you, the Commissioner for consumer protection, comes to me as something of a shock."
"Should we not be setting the cost of disposing of animal by-products against what it will cost European farmers if there is a renewed outbreak of BSE in their herds or - worse still - if people start falling ill?"
"If you could answer me that, I would be most grateful."
"I still take the view that we need a total feed ban on meat and bonemeal at least until we can determine how infectious the prions responsible for the outbreak of BSE are and until we can define different types of bonemeal for each type of animal."
"Only then will we be sure that the bonemeal in poultry feed, for example, does not come from poultry."
"It is important that I make it absolutely clear that the primary consideration in the imposition of the ban on meat-and-bone meal is public health."
"It is also the protection of animals, but essentially the scientific evidence available to us shows that the transmission of BSE disease to animals is through the consumption of meat-and-bone meal."
"Ultimately that would put at risk humans eating the meat."
"That is why we put legislation in place to remove this specified risk material from the food chain."
"So there are two blocks."
"The first is the question of meat-and-bone meal."
"As I said, the fundamental consideration in putting in place the ban on meat-and-bone meal is public health and the protection of animals."
"However, as you probably know, this is a controversial issue."
"Some MEPs and others take the view that the ban is too extensive and should be revised."
"I do not agree, because I believe that it is by no means clear from the tests undertaken and the research done at the instigation of the Commission in Member States, particularly the work being undertaken by the Food and Veterinary Office, that the controls in place in respect of meat-and-bone meal are sufficiently secure."
"The need for these controls arises in circumstances where there might be a relaxation of the ban on meat-and-bone meal, but not for feeding to ruminants."
"There can never be a relaxation of the ban on meat-and-bone meal for ruminants."
"It might be relaxed for pigs and poultry, which cannot contract BSE and therefore the consumption of meat-and-bone meal is not a danger to them."
"The problem is that if the rule on the feeding meat-and-bone meal to poultry, for instance, is relaxed, there is a risk that meat-and-bone meal intended to be fed to poultry or pigs might ultimately reach ruminants, creating the very danger that we are trying to obviate."
"Therefore I do not see the ban on meat-and-bone meal being relaxed in the short term."
"However, this can be reviewed in the context of the TSE regulation, in particular Chapter 4, where an amendment can be made by comitology."
"I indicated to Parliament when discussing the TSE regulation on a previous occasion that, although this amendment can take place by comitology, I have given an undertaking that I will come back to Parliament and, even though it is not strictly required under the legislation, discuss with Parliament what is the best way forward."
"I want to make it absolutely clear to Mrs Müller that cost is not the consideration."
"I am sorry if you have been led to that conclusion because I have not made myself clear."
"The primary considerations are the protection of animals and public health and the ban can never be relaxed for the purposes I have identified unless we can be absolutely sure that the controls in place in Member States do not create the risk instead of obviating it."
"Question No 37 by David Robert Bowe (H-0583/02):"
"Subject: Crohn's Disease"
"As the number of incidents of Crohn's disease increases, does the Commission support a recommendation that all pasteurised milk products in the Union require a minimum of 25 seconds of pasteurisation in order to decrease the risks of bacterium MAP which is thought to be a triggering factor for Crohn's disease? And if the Commission does not support this recommendation, why not?"
"The current EC legislation lays down a minimum of 71.7 degrees centigrade for 15 seconds for the pasteurisation of drinking milk and/or pasteurised milk products."
"This combination is known to be effective for foot-and-mouth disease and other known animal health, public health and zoonosis risks."
"However, Directive 92/46/EEC allows any equivalent pasteurisation time/temperature combination, provided it offers the same level of food safety."
"The issue of possible links between Crohn's disease and paratuberculosis was reviewed by the Scientific Committee of Animal Health and Animal Welfare in its report adopted on 21 March 2000."
"It concluded that insufficient data were available to determine epidemiological links between both diseases and no specific time/temperature combination for pasteurisation of milk which would inactivate the agent of paratuberculosis was recommended."
"The scientific data available to the Commission indicate that no precise time/temperature treatment has been identified which would completely destroy MAP in milk."
"In addition, the Commission has funded a project, SACROHN - improvement of prevention, diagnosis and treatment of sarcoidosis and Crohn's disease, which commenced on 1 October 2000."
"The total cost of the project is EUR 3 million."
"The Community contribution is EUR 1 639 151."
"The project duration is 36 months."
"It is funded by the Life Quality Control of Infectious Diseases programme."
"No concrete results are available from that source to confirm any link between MAP and Crohn's disease."
"However the consortium is heavily involved in developing new detection methods based on new molecular technologies and culture techniques."
"Such technologies are being used by the research consortia to facilitate the detection of MAP in milk and intestinal biopsies of Crohn's disease patients."
"Efforts are also focused on using molecular typing techniques to establish any possible links between ruminant sources of MAP and the aetiology of Crohn's disease."
"The project continues until October 2003."
"Results will be made available at regular intervals."
"More information can be found on the website."
"In the event of new scientific data coming to light, the Commission would of course be prepared to take any necessary measures in response."
"I should like to thank Mr Byrne for his very comprehensive and thoughtful reply."
"This is an important issue, which is affecting more and more people."
"It is a chronic health issue and has considerable effects on the quality of life of those who acquire this disease."
"There is increasing evidence - though I agree, for the moment at least, with Commissioner Byrne that it is not conclusive - that there is a link between the presence of these bacteria in pasteurised milk and the incidence of Crohn's disease."
"I would ask the Commission to consider all the evidence, when the studies are completed, and perhaps hold a seminar or a wider discussion on what measures might be taken, as this is a disease which is increasingly of concern and it is spreading."
"The most obvious step would be for the Commission to extend the period of pasteurisation from 15 seconds at the appropriate temperature to 25 seconds."
"This may be the most simple and effective method."
"I wonder whether the Commission would agree that those steps might be taken at the end of the studies?"
"I am sure Mr Bowe will remember that previous discussions on these issues always centred around the need to have sound scientific evidence to enable us to justify decisions that are taken here and, in particular, to justify legislation requiring compliance."
"As I have indicated in my previous statement, the project that is being undertaken at the moment will continue until 2003."
"It is quite clear from this that the issue is being kept under review and scientific evaluation is continuing."
"Ultimately a report will be published and then will be the time to consider what further action can be taken."
"The issue that Mr Bowe puts his finger on - the question of temperature - will obviously be seriously considered, but we should await the scientists' advice."
"However, it will be possible to look at the matter again at that time."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"We are now going to start the second part of this Question Time."
"You know that we dedicate twenty minutes to each Commissioner."
"The more we speak on each question, the fewer questions can be put and the fewer answers given."
"There is a very well established relationship here."
"Part two"
"Questions to Mr Bolkestein"
"Question No 38 by Bart Staes (H-0525/02):"
"Subject: Refinement of the rules governing motor-vehicle insurance in the internal market"
"In early June, Commissioner Bolkestein presented a proposal for a directive designed to refine the four existing directives relating to motor-vehicle insurance."
"As a result of the previous directives, and in response to repeated calls from the Commissioner with special responsibility for the internal market, what is known as the 'bonus-malus' system was abolished in Belgium."
"That also spelt the end of the agreements on premiums concluded among the various Belgian insurers."
"The possibility of being able freely to determine premiums undoubtedly constitutes good news for good drivers."
"On the other hand, this will also increase rather than decrease the serious tensions caused by fragmentation."
"The result thereof is the likelihood that we shall find more and more uninsured vehicles on our roads."
"Will the Commission take into account that adverse effect during the further stages in the drafting of this proposal for a directive, or will it conversely authorise the Member States to take whatever steps they deem necessary to prevent any undesirable effects on premiums caused by fragmentation?"
"As the honourable Member is aware, the principle of contract freedom applies to companies offering financial services."
"In the field of insurance, the Third Non-life Insurance Directive put an end to the system of prior or systematic government approval of tariffs and pricing policy."
"Compulsory no-claims bonus systems violate the principle enshrined in the directives."
"I believe that free trade in insurance products is in the interests of the vast majority of motorists, as this allows them to choose insurance companies that reward good drivers with lower premiums."
"Turning to the question raised by the honourable Member in connection with the possible increase in the number of uninsured vehicles, I should like to draw your attention to Article 3, Paragraph 1 of the First Motor Insurance Directive."
"That article states that all motor vehicles in the Community are required to have statutory liability insurance."
"It is up to the national authorities to ensure that this obligation is respected."
"The Commission's recent proposal for a Fifth Motor Insurance Directive, to which the honourable Member refers, does not alter this provision."
"This new proposal, the Fifth Directive, does not infringe the fundamental principle of tariff freedom."
"Its main purpose is to revise the four existing directives on motor insurance."
"The main objectives are to update and improve the framework of compulsory insurance to protect the victims of car accidents, to plug gaps and to clarify some of the provisions in the directives."
"The Commission is doing everything it can to improve the efficiency of the internal market for insurance."
"Its plans are set out in the Plan of Action for Financial Services."
"The Commission is convinced that greater competition will lead to lower prices and a wider choice of products for the consumer."
"Thank you Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for answering at such length and in such excellent Dutch."
"We are not always used to hearing you speak like that in this Chamber, so thank you once again."
"You correctly stated that the Commission was aiming to abolish the Belgian no-claims bonus system and move towards a free tariff structure."
"I have recently spoken to some representatives of insurance companies, who agreed that the new free tariff system could be beneficial to good drivers."
"But they make the point: what about those who are more clumsy?"
"What about young people who are often persuaded to take out high premiums?"
"The insurance industry is convinced that the new regulations will increase the general level of premiums, and that accident-prone drivers in particular will want to slip out of the system, leading to a rise in the number of uninsured drivers."
"I should therefore like to take this opportunity to ask the Commissioner once again, in the light of his proposals and current legislation, what the Commission can do to prevent insurance tariffs rising too high, excessive discrepancies in pricing and accident-prone drivers being squeezed out of the system."
"What might the Commission be able to do?"
"Is the Commission considering introducing a system based on ranges around a mean, where for instance the standard rate would be 100, with good drivers paying 50 and bad drivers no more than 150?"
"Can the Commissioner give me an answer on this point?"
"Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Mr Staes for complimenting me on the quality of my Dutch."
"It would indeed be strange, Mr President, if I could not speak my own language well."
"Secondly, I should like to make the point that the very function of competition is to ensure that prices are as keen as possible."
"On the one hand this rewards good drivers in the form of low premiums, which Mr Staes seems to welcome, while on the other hand it makes bad drivers pay for their own errors."
"No one other than the person who causes damage should have to pay for it."
"Then competition between individual insurance companies should ensure that the rates everyone pays are in line with the insurance products market, and this has nothing at all to do with the Commission."
"If the Commission were to do as Mr Staes requests, it would eventually encroach on the powers and responsibilities of the private sector, which it not at all its proper role."
"Question No 39 by Michl Ebner (H-0549/02):"
"Subject: Derogations from the rules on competition for pilot projects"
"The operating concession for the A22 Brenner motorway between Modena and the Brenner Pass has not yet been granted by the Italian authorities, apparently because of reservations expressed by the Commission."
"If, instead of concentrating on the measures generally required to combat distortion of competition, the Commission - and, in particular, the Commissioner with special responsibility for competition issues - were to study this matter in greater depth, it would become clear that a pilot project is involved here and not the normal granting of an operating concession."
"Is it not therefore imaginable, and would it not be in the EU's best interests in a sensitive area, for a pilot project, which would be limited in time to the duration of the operating concession and whereby some of the revenue generated from motorway tolls would be used for the upgrading of the railway line, to be promoted and supported rather than hampered on the grounds that it might distort competition?"
"Mr President, the fact that this is a pilot project, as was rightly said, does not prevent the general rules on concessions from applying."
"Indeed, the doubts which my services and I raised on the subject of the aforementioned project concern exclusively the extension up to 2035 of the motorway concession for the Brenner in the absence of any competition."
"The Italian authorities themselves have recently taken a similar position while committing themselves to proposing solutions which could at the same time meet the requirements for development of the project and the need to comply with Community law."
"With the aim of not disrupting the implementation of this project, the competent authorities and my services are in close contact in order to find an appropriate solution."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this pilot project affects three countries, Germany, Austria and Italy and operates in a sensitive zone through the ancient Hauptkamm, where the Brenner motorway operators on the south side of the Brenner pass and now the equivalent organisation on the north side of the Brenner pass want to use the road to subsidise the railways, so as to prevent ecological damage and set up a pilot project."
"But the project needs to run until 2035. 2005 is not long enough, i.e. the Italian concession needs to be extended by thirty years."
"The Italian Government sent a message of support through Minister Buttiglione, until recently a Member of this House, and it is to be hoped that this pilot project, which could set an example and which your colleague, the Commissioner for transport, thinks is a positive move, will be seen as such and an exception will be granted."
"Though I have heard you make positive points I have not heard you say you are in complete agreement."
"Could you perhaps comment on that?"
"I have discussed this matter on various occasions with Minister Buttiglione and also with some Members of this Parliament."
"May I add that this concerns an extension for quite a long time - about 33 years - and thus this project falls under the rules of public procurement and thus competition must play a role in the award of the contracts."
"After all, competition means that prices will be lower than would otherwise have been the case and also that advantages will accrue to, I assume, the Italian public or at least the Italian State and therefore indirectly to the Italian public."
"Therefore we should all be in favour of more competition in the award of such immense contracts."
"The fact that there is a possible cross-subsidisation in favour of rail transport is an aspect which is perfectly defensible."
"Therefore, when the terms of the contract that is to be awarded are framed and formulated, that condition will have to be included in the contract to be awarded."
"Anybody who wants to obtain that contract will have to satisfy that condition."
"There is nothing wrong with that."
"The Commission firmly believes that public contracts must be awarded subject to the rules on public procurements and they basically amount to the fact that competition must be allowed."
"Otherwise we open the door again to awarding contracts in an underhanded fashion and it will be the public who will suffer."
"I am sure no one in this House wants that and, therefore, the Commission is right to follow this line."
"Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I agree with the Commissioner; obviously, the routes across the Alps are in competition with one another."
"But, as we all know, these routes are in a highly sensitive zone."
"If one motorway company has saved money over a number of years in order to be able to offer a better solution, then my question is, why can we not leave it to the motorway companies to decide if they wish to offer technical alternatives in order to improve traffic across the Alps?"
"I would be interested to know what you think about this and whether we should leave it to the companies involved to decide the technical alternatives."
"Mr President, the Commission does not have the knowledge to enter into the details of any public contract and moreover that is not part of the Commission's role or responsibility."
"We must leave it to the awarding authority, which it is assumed is the Italian State or part of the Italian State, perhaps provincial authorities, to formulate a contract."
"The Commission's only responsibility is to see to it that, whatever the nature of the contract, whatever it may say about, for instance, new technical solutions or cross-subsidisation, competition is allowed and other economic actors have the chance to bid for the contract."
"If the present contractor were allowed to continue his concession until the year 2035, there would be no competition and that would damage the true interests of the Italian people."
"Mr President, I am very pleased to inform the House that a particularly important personage, not just for Italy but for Europe as a whole, is in the public gallery: the national chairman of the Italian association of persons incapacitated or injured as a result of accidents at work, who are calling upon Europe to provide security, preventive measures and rehabilitation and to ensure that structural obstacles are removed."
"This morning, we had a meeting with Mr Medina Ortega and other Members, Vice-President Podestà and President Cox."
"I hope that their presence will lead us all to reflect seriously on the matter."
"Mr Ferri, although I hope your point of order does not serve as a precedent for other speeches, I would reiterate your greeting on behalf of the whole of Parliament."
"President."
"Mr Ebner, you know that the question cannot be put again, but, since it is a point of order, I would ask you to be brief."
"Mr President, I thought we were allowed two supplementary questions?"
"Mr Rübig has asked one."
"We are not."
"Thank you."
"Not even an explanation as to whether or not I am satisfied with what the Commissioner had to say?"
"No, since you are asking me, I suspect that you are not entirely happy, but in any event you still have the opportunity to speak to the Commissioner in the corridor."
"Fine."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"I am not satisfied with what the Commissioner had to say."
"Question No 40 by Paul Rübig (H-0579/02):"
"Subject: Non-recognition of European standards relating to solar thermal collectors and systems"
"Uniform European standards for the testing of solar thermal products have been in force for about a year now."
"For solar thermal collectors and systems manufactured in other countries to benefit from public solar energy subsidies in France and Spain, they must be tested for compliance with the respective national standards and verification procedures, despite their having already been certified in accordance with European standards."
"The national verification procedures are not exactly in line with the European standards."
"What is more, such double verification involves significant costs and bureaucratic obstacles and requires additional time."
"Verification certificates issued by accredited institutes in other EU Member States are not recognised."
"That makes market entry considerably more difficult, and undertakings in other EU Member States are put at a considerable competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis domestic manufacturers."
"What is the Commission's opinion of the situation outlined above, and what will it do to remedy it?"
"The Commission would like to stress that solar thermal collectors and systems are not regulated at Community level."
"The EN standards applying to these products are voluntary standards."
"Any national regulations that require compliance with national standards and testing procedures if subsidies are to be granted must be assessed in the light of Articles 28-30 of the Treaty."
"It follows from these articles, as interpreted by the Court of Justice, that the principle of mutual recognition applies not only to technical manufacturing specifications, but also to any testing procedures to which products may have been subjected in another Member State of the European Union or in a state that is a signatory to the agreement on the European Economic Area."
"This principle also applies to any certificates issued for products following these testing procedures."
"Here I refer to the judgment of 17 December 1981, concerning biological products."
"There is another judgment dated 28 January 1986 concerning type approval for woodworking machines."
"Then there is the judgment of 11 May 1989 known as the Bouchara judgment."
"The jurisprudence is consistent and clear."
"This means that Member States may not needlessly require technical or chemical analyses or tests if the same analyses or tests have already been carried out in another Member State and the results are available or may be obtained on demand."
"On the basis of the information which the honourable Member has provided, the Commission will launch an enquiry into this matter and, if necessary, will initiate proceedings against the states in question under Article 226 of the Treaty."
"Should an infringement be established, the Commission would also examine what conclusions should be drawn in the light of Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty."
"Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I think making the principle of mutual recognition our focal point in Europe sets a good example."
"I thank the Commissioner for his clear analysis and for clarifying the intention of the Commission, in its capacity as Executive, to really assert itself here and help this principle gain acceptance."
"During the course of harmonisation, we do of course come up against limits which people are not always willing to accept."
"We have also spent a great deal of time discussing test marks issued by independent certified institutes which test products."
"Is there pan-European recognition for products tested in one country?"
"Are these test marks recognised as such in other countries?"
"If they were, that would increase the safety of products considerably in the future."
"Does the Commission have plans for any initiatives here?"
"I hear that Mr Rübig is pleased with the attitude of the Commission."
"That is a good thing."
"Once again, the essence of this problem is mutual recognition."
"The jurisprudence is completely clear and consistent."
"The Commission will initiate an investigation of these cases which have been brought to its attention by Mr Rübig."
"If necessary, the Commission will initiate proceedings."
"Since the time allotted to questions to the Commissioner has elapsed, Questions Nos 41 and 42 will be replied to in writing."
"If anybody has a point of order, they can put it."
"Do you have a point of order, Mr Savary?"
"Mr President, I am sorry not to be able to ask this question, as Mrs Bérès asked me to put it very directly to Commissioner Bolkestein."
"With regret, however, I accept the constraints of the Rules of Procedure."
"Yes, and lack of time."
"The twenty minutes for the Commissioner have passed and we have no option but to move on to the questions for Mr Verheugen."
"Questions to Mr Verheugen"
"Question No 43 by Alexandros Alavanos (H-0537/02):"
"Subject: Cyprus - expiry of the deadline for a political solution to the problem"
"In June 2002 the deadline that had been set for a political solution to the Cyprus problem, to be achieved by means of talks between the two Cyprus communities under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the UN, expired without producing a result, because of Turkish intransigence."
"Could the Commission assess any results attained by the talks so far?"
"Could it outline the next steps leading up to the accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union, together with the nine other applicant countries?"
"Mr President, since direct talks began on 16 January 2002, the leaders of both communities have tabled proposals on the four core issues."
"However, the parties have been unable to broker a comprehensive solution in keeping with the relevant United Nations resolutions."
"As the direct talks are confidential, the Commission is unable to evaluate the results and has to rely on regular evaluations carried out by the United Nations Security Council."
"The talks have reached a watershed now that the parties' self-imposed deadline of the end of June 2002 has passed."
"Accession negotiations with Cyprus are proceeding as planned."
"The Commission will be tabling its regular reports on 16 October of this year."
"They will contain a detailed analysis of what progress the candidate countries have made in meeting the accession criteria and will be the basis for the Commission's recommendations on the countries which meet all the accession criteria."
"These recommendations and any outstanding issues arising out of the negotiations will be examined at the European Council in Brussels at the end of October this year and accession negotiations should be concluded on the basis of these recommendations before the European Council in Copenhagen in December 2002."
"Accession agreements should be signed in the spring of 2003 and ratified by the national parliaments in the following months."
"Before accession agreements are signed, the Council will decide on the accession of the candidate countries after consulting the Commission and after receiving the assent of the European Parliament, as required under Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union."
"I thank the Commissioner for his reply and the stand which he has taken on this matter."
"I should merely like to point out that, with the Commission reports just a few weeks away and enlargement just a few months away, this huge question mark still hangs over the Republic of Cyprus."
"I would be grateful if the Commissioner could confirm to us that, while the European Union and the Commission will support every effort to find a political solution, the main stumbling block to which, as we all know, is the intransigence of the Turkish and Turkish Cypriot side, the Republic of Cyprus will not be barred from the first wave of new countries to join the European Union if no solution can be found."
"I agree with the honourable Member that time is now of the essence and that it is most regrettable that no decisive progress has yet been reached on the Cyprus question."
"The honourable Member is also right in stating that the European Union is doing everything in its power to help bring about a solution and it shall continue to do so in the future."
"We shall endeavour to reach a solution right up to the last day."
"It is very difficult to answer your question about the attitude of the Turkish Government, especially now the political climate has changed in Turkey."
"I shall be speaking to the Turkish Foreign Minister this week and perhaps then I shall have a better idea as to whether we can expect a decisive and constructive attitude from the Turkish side in the time ahead."
"For the moment, all I can say is that I am no more able than you to predict how Turkey will act on this question, but I should like to take this opportunity once again to make an urgent appeal to Turkey to recognise that it is the Turkish Cypriots who stand to suffer if no solution can be found to the Cyprus question."
"They stand to gain the most from a political solution and the accession of Cyprus."
"But they stand to lose the most if no political solution can be found."
"I would say to the honourable Member that my reading of the situation is slightly different from yours."
"I agree that I have said nothing new."
"But that is because there is nothing new to report."
"Which is something we both regret."
"Responsibility for the political process, i.e. the process which should resolve the whole problem of the future, lies with the United Nations."
"Neither the Council nor the Commission nor the European Parliament has any competence in this matter."
"You should be very careful not to undermine the authority of the United Nations here."
"Which is why it is the established policy of the European Union - and that applies to everyone, Council, Parliament and Commission - to support the efforts of the United Nations with every means at our disposal."
"The most important instrument which we can give the United Nations and which we have given them is the accession process."
"The fact that it has come to direct talks at all is only because Cyprus has accession prospects and because the Turkish side now understands that the European Union intends to keep to its enlargement timetable."
"So I think that the best way of exerting pressure on Turkey - and believe me we shall do so - is to ensure that it knows that the enlargement timetable is non-negotiable."
"Question No 44 by Konstantinos Hatzidakis (H-0574/02):"
"Subject: Cyprus and accession negotiations"
"What is the Commission's view of the progress of negotiations on the accession of Cyprus, and how might the inter-community dialogue on the Cyprus issue influence them?"
"My dear Sir, Cyprus is at an advanced stage of accession negotiations."
"Of the 31 chapters, 28 have been provisionally closed."
"No more can be done at this stage of the proceedings."
"As far as discussions with the aim of finding a political settlement under the aegis of the UN Secretary-General are concerned, I have just expressed full support for this process, as has the EU on numerous occasions."
"As for the question as to how the dialogue between the two ethnic groups may affect accession negotiations, the Commission's approach is dictated by the conclusions of the European Councils in Helsinki in 1999 and in Seville in 2002."
"The Union has stated that it wishes a united island to accede."
"However, it has also pointed out that a political solution is not a sine qua non to the accession of Cyprus to the Union, if the Cyprus question has not been settled by the time negotiations come to an end."
"The decision will be taken by the Council, taking account of all the relevant factors."
"There is still a chance that we shall achieve our objective of political solution before accession, which is why the European Council has called on the leaders of both ethnic groups to step up the talks."
"If a political solution is reached, the accession agreement will reflect the agreement reached."
"As the European Council in Seville recently declared, the European Union is prepared to include the terms of a comprehensive settlement to the Cyprus question in the accession agreement."
"We have emphasised that we feel that Cyprus should be able to speak with one voice and that Cyprus needs to be able to apply Community law throughout the island."
"If a settlement is reached and Cyprus accedes as a united country, the European Union is prepared to make a huge financial contribution towards the rapid development of the northern part of the island in the run up to accession."
"Mr President, Mr Hatzidakis, you are quite right."
"The Commission will table a report on 16 October containing its appraisal of whether the candidate countries with which we are currently engaged in negotiations are ready to accede."
"As you know, ten countries have been named, including Cyprus, with which we hope to complete negotiations by the end of this year."
"The Commission will then state on 16 October whether or not this judgment still applies."
"Naturally, this will include a clear statement on Cyprus by the Commission."
"Question No 45 by María Izquierdo Rojo (H-0538/02):"
"Subject: Enlargement, women and fundamentalism"
"With regard to the enlargement countries and with a view to averting situations where religious organisations encroach upon areas that are the competence of the public authorities, what measures will the Commission apply to prevent human rights being restricted as a result of pressure from fundamentalists and to ensure that women can exercise their rights freely?"
"Mr President, as the honourable Member knows, meeting the Copenhagen political criteria is the sine qua non not just for concluding but even for starting accession negotiations, which is why no country can join the European Union unless it meets all the political criteria."
"The question which you have put refers to religious organisations which you, Madam, say are usurping powers which belong to the state or that there is a danger that they will do so and that, as a result, the human rights of women in candidate countries might be restricted."
"The Commission takes the view that future Member States have achieved a good level of democratic stability and that human rights, and that includes religious freedom, are respected in future Member States."
"Religious freedom is guaranteed in all future Member States, meaning that religious communities do of course have the right to take part in social debate in their countries."
"That is perfectly normal and it happens in every Member State."
"Religious communities are part of civil society and, like every other social organisation, they are entitled to take part in social debate."
"In some countries to a greater degree and in some countries to a lesser degree."
"Governments, the state authorities, are required to watch very closely to ensure that social groups do not exercise powers to which they are not entitled and which, for example, might have an adverse impact on fundamental rights."
"In theory, as far as equal opportunities for women are concerned, we have made considerable progress from a legislative and institutional point of view in all future Member States, but obviously more needs to be done to foster economic and social equality for women."
"But that does not just apply to future Member States; it also applies to the majority of current Member States."
"We cannot say that all the deficits have already been rectified, which is why the Commission will of course continue to monitor developments closely in this area and will include an up-to-date appraisal of the situation in the report which I have already mentioned and which is due to be published in October 2002."
"Mr President, has the Commission ascertained on which issues and in which countries these invasions of the public sphere by ecclesiastical powers are taking place?"
"Secondly, I would also like to ask the Commissioner whether he would be prepared to schedule information campaigns to increase awareness of the advantages and benefits of the Community acquis for women."
"I have also heard references, Commissioner, to the existence in certain Parliaments of departments in which ecclesiastical powers carry out controls and monitoring of the activities of parliamentarians."
"I would be grateful if this could be verified."
"Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, no knowledge such as you have just described has come to the Commission's attention."
"I would therefore be most grateful if you would let me have a copy of the information which you obviously have at your disposal."
"However, I must reiterate that the Commission does not consider it unacceptable interference for religious communities to join in political debate as part of civil society."
"I know of no cases in which human rights are being violated as a result of action by religious communities."
"If you have specific examples of this, we shall of course be glad to look into them."
"As far as the information campaign is concerned, I can confirm that we are conducting such campaigns, especially on the subject of equality for women."
"It is part of the communication strategy which we are implementing together with Parliament in order to make citizens in future Member States aware of all aspects of future Community law, especially human rights and the rights of individuals and groups."
"Question No 46 by Jonas Sjöstedt (H-0543/02):"
"Subject: Future accession treaties for new Member States"
"It is possible that the Irish electorate will vote against the Treaty of Nice for a second time, which would also render the new breakdown of votes on the Council and seats in Parliament under that Treaty null and void."
"Would it not then be possible for the Union to act as it did at the time of the accession of Finland, Sweden and Austria, i.e. negotiate and reach agreement with each of the applicant countries separately on seats in Parliament and votes in the Council in the treaty of accession?"
"The Treaty of Nice would not then be needed as a basis for the accession of new Member States."
"Is this not an appropriate procedure to use for the enlargement of the Union should the Irish people vote against the Treaty of Nice once again?"
"Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission sees no point in speculating on what will happen in the hypothetical event that the Treaty of Nice is not ratified."
"As you know, bringing about the ratification of the Treaty of Nice is the common aim of the European institutions, as the European Council made perfectly clear recently in Seville in June 2002."
"The Treaty needs to be ratified because, otherwise, it will be very hard to conclude the enlargement process by the planned dates."
"The Commission would remind the House that the European Council in Seville in June 2002 welcomed the Irish Government's determination to get the Treaty of Nice ratified in Ireland."
"This issue was aired this weekend at the meeting of foreign ministers in Denmark, the main item on the agenda of which was enlargement."
"The Member States and the Commission again agreed that we should not interfere in the opinion-forming exercise in Ireland by making statements about what we would do if the second referendum again had a 'no' majority."
"Mr President, Commissioner Verheugen, I note that I was not really given an answer to the question asked because it was of a hypothetical and speculative nature."
"At the same time, it is, anyway, surely the case that those who think in political terms must always think of different possible scenarios."
"We are not, moreover, concerned here with the distant future but with something that will take place quite soon and that will have a major effect on the development of Europe as a whole."
"It therefore surprises me that the Commission really is not thinking rather more about alternative courses and reflecting upon what might happen if the Irish people were to vote 'no' once again."
"I am certain that the Commission must be thinking along such lines."
"I also believe that this is a question of practical importance."
"If the Irish people vote 'no', that cannot be allowed to be decisive for the whole EU."
"There must be a practical solution."
"In my question, I pointed out that Finland, Sweden and Austria in actual fact negotiated their way to a practical solution to the problems before these countries were Member States."
"The same method could no doubt be adopted with the new candidate countries."
"Might that not after all be a possibility, legally and practically?"
"Mr Schmid, once again please read my lips. There is no plan B and we are expressly prohibited from engaging in this sort of deliberation."
"It is perfectly straightforward. If I were to say here and now that the Commission is considering an alternative or that the Commission has an alternative, before we knew it Irish voters would be asking, what is the alternative?"
"We should very much like to know what it is because then we might not need to ratify the Treaty of Nice at all."
"So if we say there is an alternative, then all we are doing is making sure the Treaty will never be ratified."
"And we do have a reason for insisting on the ratification of the Treaty of Nice because, not only does it contain the technical requirements for concluding enlargement negotiations in the institutional section, it also contains political requirements for concluding the enlargement process which are indispensable to a whole series of Member States."
"The reason why we did not opt for the simple procedure in this enlargement round and simply write the institutional rules into the accession agreements was that most Member States felt that both institutional and political changes were needed before this very radical change in the nature and state of the European Union."
"These changes are enshrined in the Treaty of Nice and I advise you to take account of them."
"For a whole series of Member States, the Treaty of Nice has to be taken in its entirety."
"The seemingly convenient alternative, whereby if there is no Treaty, then we simply lift out the institutional sections and write them into the enlargement agreements, is unacceptable to a whole series of Member States and, as far as I am aware, to the majority in the European Parliament."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are completely out of time for questions to Mr Verheugen."
"In any event, various Members have raised supplementary questions and I am going to give the floor in chronological order."
"First Mr Crowley and then Mr Seppänen."
"Mrs McKenna, I am very sorry, but you are neither the first nor the second to have asked."
"Do you have some special right and can you explain it to me?"
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"This issue relates to the Irish referendum."
"I indicated that quite clearly, so it would be extremely unfair to discuss the Irish referendum and not to allow speakers to put both sides of the argument on this issue."
"On this occasion it is crucial."
"I must be very brief: you must realise, Mrs McKenna - and I would ask you to be reasonable, as I intend to be - that we have Rules of Procedure for Question Time, and we are allowed two supplementary questions."
"This is not a debate on the Irish referendum."
"If you propose a debate in plenary session we will probably have one."
"They are two supplementary questions, and not for or against."
"I have the Rules of Procedure in front of me and furthermore we all know them very well."
"The first supplementary question is for Mr Crowley, and I do not know whether he is for or against."
"I know that he asked to put a question."
"If Mr Seppänen will allow you to speak in place of him, then that is another issue, but he has the right to speak."
"Mr Crowley has the floor."
"I just want to ask Commissioner Verheugen whether he could reaffirm what I believe he said through the interpretation: that it is absolutely necessary for enlargement to be completed under this process, that the Treaty of Nice will have to be ratified by Ireland."
"A yes or no answer will do."
"Yes, it is absolutely necessary for the Treaty to be ratified by all the Member States."
"Since Mr Seppänen has very kindly given up the floor, Mrs McKenna has the floor."
"Commissioner, I am very interested in what you said."
"You said, first of all, that you should not get involved in telling people what you will do if the Irish people vote against and that, if there was an alternative, the Irish people would want to know what that alternative was."
"So you are saying you would keep the Irish people in the dark and bully them into voting 'yes'."
"It is interesting to hear the Commission say that they should not get involved."
"We have already had Commissioners such as Patten, Byrne and others telling the Irish people they must vote 'yes'."
"Mr Prodi said that the Treaty of Nice is not legally necessary for enlargement."
"Giscard d'Estaing said the same thing and that if the Irish people vote 'no' other solutions will be found."
"But really the strategy here is to pretend that there is no alternative and to try to force the Irish people into saying 'yes' to something they have already said 'no' to."
"As you said yourself, you do not want to propose alternatives because you do not want the Irish people to ask what those alternatives are."
"How democratic is that?"
"My dear Madam, it seems to me that you are trying to draw something out of me for political reasons which is not there to be drawn."
"I repeat, the Commission knows of no legal or political alternative to the Treaty of Nice."
"As the time allocated to the Commissioner is at an end, Question No 47 will be answered in writing."
"Questions to Commissioner Vitorino"
"As the author is not present, Question No 48 lapses."
"Question No 49 by Manuel Medina Ortega (H-0546/02):"
"Subject: Measures to restrict illegal immigration into the Canaries"
"On the basis of the agreements adopted at the Seville summit, what measures does the Commission propose to restrict the massive influx of illegal immigrants into the Canary Islands."
"In particular, what measures are proposed to curb this irregular form of immigration at the places of origin, in order to ensure the safety of the immigrants themselves?"
"Mr President, the June European Council in Seville was particularly important to the debate on combating illegal immigration, establishing deadlines for the implementation of the most significant operational measures in this fight laid down in the global plan proposed by the Commission and adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 28 February 2002."
"Of particular importance to the Canary Islands is the recent effort made to contain illegal immigration by sea."
"The Justice and Home Affairs Council asked the Commission to undertake a viability study on this matter, in order to work out how to improve monitoring of the European Union's maritime borders."
"The main objective of this study will be to provide an exhaustive analysis of the legislative and/or operational measures to adopt."
"The results of the study will be available at the beginning of 2003."
"It should also be pointed out that the Community is supporting various projects in third countries, intended to combat illegal immigration."
"Of particular interest to the Canary Islands is the major programme designed to assist the Moroccan authorities in better controlling their maritime borders on both the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts."
"The Community has contributed EUR 40 million of funding to this objective, to which the Moroccan authorities will add a further amount."
"It should, furthermore, be mentioned that the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 13 June approved an integrated approach in this field, which means that all the relevant instruments of the European Union's external relations structure will be used."
"It has been decided to implement a series of operational measures, including systematic cooperation and joint investigation teams to fight against organised trafficking and contraband networks."
"The Danish Presidency attaches particular importance to progress in the field of illegal immigration with regard to relations with third countries and to repatriation policy."
"This will certainly help to speed up the implementation of future measures in this area."
"Mr President, I am aware of the efforts being made by Mr Vitorino to achieve concrete measures for the control of illegal immigration throughout the European Union and especially in these outermost regions such as the Canary Islands."
"The problem is that the situation is deteriorating, it is getting worse all the time, and an increasing number of immigrants are entering our regions."
"And not only are they entering illegally by sea on boats, but they are also coming by air, in other words, many immigrants are coming to our region from other countries without any control whatsoever."
"I have taken note of his observations."
"He referred to Morocco, but he said absolutely nothing about Mauritania; and I do not know whether the Commission is aware, for example, of the discovery of an illegal immigration network operating in Mauritania and on Spanish territory, and acting jointly."
"My concern is that, while I think it is right to carry out studies, I have the impression that the Council is not currently supporting the initiatives of Commissioner Vitorino, aimed at a rapid solution to this problem."
"I fully share the honourable Member's view that the entry of illegal immigrants into European Union territory is not only taking place by sea, but also by land and via airports."
"We have therefore collaborated with the Italian Government to produce a viability report on the control of European Union land and air borders."
"The current study on sea borders is specific, since it complements the other one which has been produced by the Italian Government."
"My hope is that, when the study phase is completed, the governments will feel that they have more support in terms of the application of concrete measures and the action plan to combat illegal immigration."
"The Commission Communication on the control of external borders contains a very long list of concrete actions."
"Finally, I would like to say that we are naturally prioritising the issue of Morocco, but I have taken good note of the information the honourable Member has given me on the issue of Mauritania and I am going to investigate that as well."
"Question No 50 by Esko Olavi Seppänen (H-0565/02):"
"Subject: TEAM experts"
"At the beginning of July, the Commission adopted a large information programme which included a plan for continuing and developing the activities of the network of TEAM experts."
"How were these people selected, and how much is spent per annum on their training, expenses and appearance fees?"
"TEAM Europe was created by the European Commission in 1989 with the aim of providing a network of independent conference speakers whose expertise covers all fields of activity of the Union in all working languages."
"Currently TEAM has about 550 members who can participate in conferences, seminars, debates and training sessions on issues relating to the European Union."
"They speak in their own name and not on behalf of the Commission."
"The members of TEAM Europe are selected by the representations of the Commission in each Member State on the basis of criteria that include experience, in-depth knowledge of European issues, languages, media training and availability."
"They are organised in national groups."
"The members of TEAM Europe are not paid by the Commission."
"However, they can accept expenses from the organisers of the event in which they are participating and even some appropriate payment."
"The Commission does, however, provide them with regular training sessions."
"In 2002 the Commission organised three training seminars in Brussels specifically for members of TEAM Europe. There was a two-day seminar on the external relations of the European Union in which 80 TEAM members participated; a three-and-a-half-day seminar on enlargement in which 60 TEAM members participated; and a two-day seminar on the future of Europe, the post-Nice process and the European Convention, in which 103 TEAM members participated."
"This training is provided in the Commission, using speakers and interpreters from either the Commission or the other institutions and occasionally outside speakers who do not receive payment."
"Question No 51 by Bernd Posselt (H-0588/02):"
"Subject: Visa exemption for Macedonia"
"Has the Commission any plans to introduce a visa exemption for Macedonian citizens who wish to enter the EU, particularly since in answer to a similar question the Council has said that without a Commission proposal it is unable to take a decision on this matter, which is of such vital importance for the stabilisation of Macedonia?"
". (PT) Mr President, Regulation No 539/2001, adopted by the Council on 15 March 2001, includes the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia amongst third countries whose nationals must have a visa if they wish to cross the external borders of the Member States."
"The introduction of a visa exemption for Macedonians would require the regulation to be amended, which only the Commission can propose, pursuant to the provisions of Article 67(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Communities."
"The criteria for the inclusion of a country on the list of third countries for whose nationals a visa is mandatory or on the list of those nationals that are exempt from visa requirements are defined in the fifth recital of Regulation No 539/2001."
"These are criteria covering the dimension of illegal immigration from these countries, reasons of public order and security, external relations, regional coherence and the principle of reciprocity."
"These criteria are not immutable."
"The extent and the persistence of certain developments with regard to one particular country or another can lead the Commission to propose that the regulation be amended."
"In this field, the Commission makes an ongoing effort to detect such changes and to make a precise assessment of their relevance."
"In order to undertake this task, the Commission makes use of a range of information from very diverse sources, paying particular attention to the data and statistics from the States Members that it collects from actions undertaken by certain specialised working groups in the Council."
"In this context, it should be pointed out that the Seville European Council of 21 and 22 June asked the Council and the Commission, within the scope of their respective competences, to give absolute priority to certain measures in the fight against illegal immigration."
"Amongst these measures is the re-evaluation, before the end of the year, of the list of third countries whose nationals are required to have a visa and of those that are exempt."
"In this exercise of revising the regulation, the Commission will certainly take account of all information relevant to the situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in light of the criteria laid down in recital 5 of the aforementioned Regulation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, my question refers back to Question Time with the Spanish Presidency, when the Spanish Presidency told me that the Council could not address this issue because the Commission had not taken an initiative."
"This may be a game of pass-the-parcel between the Council and the Commission - I have no idea - but that was what the Council told me."
"Hence my question to you."
"Of all the new states to come out of the former Yugoslavia, which never needed a visa, there are three countries with which the EU has association agreements, namely Slovenia, Croatia and Macedonia, of which Macedonia is the only one which has to have a visa."
"Even the neighbouring states of Bulgaria and Romania do not need visas, despite massive security problems, which is why this would be an important message for this country."
"They feel humiliated, being at a disadvantage to the other associated countries."
"It is the only associated country which has to have a visa!"
"I understand Mr Posselt's concerns perfectly."
"There is, however, a difference, in that Romania and Bulgaria are both candidate countries for accession to the European Union, while Macedonia is not."
"In any event, I acknowledge, on behalf of the Commission, that Macedonia has made a considerable effort to improve its external border control and the quality of its travel documents."
"I even believe that Macedonia is currently adopting legislation on visas that is very similar to the legislation in force in the European Union, which is a significant and positive factor."
"In order to gauge the progress made by Macedonia, however, we sent a delegation of experts last June as part of the regional CARDS programme."
"The conclusions of this delegation and the report on the regulatory framework and its implementation with regard to granting visas and the control of Macedonia's external borders will be available in October 2002."
"It is then that the Commission will assess the situation in Macedonia, in light of this report and the criteria of recital 5."
"Only then shall we be able to take a decision on our initiative to review EU legislation on visas."
"This is not, therefore, a game of table tennis, but it is essential to observe procedures."
"For now, I am unable to tell you what our assessment will be after receiving the report by the group of experts, which will be sent to me next month."
"Question No 52 by Camilo Nogueira Román (H-0599/02):"
"Subject: Visa requirements for people entering the EU from countries which have a special relationship with the Member States of the Union"
"A significant proportion of the EU Member States have a special relationship and cultural ties with countries outside the Union, for example Portugal and Spain with the Latin American countries."
"Many people have dual nationality, which means that this relationship forms part of their character, alongside their belonging to the Union."
"How is this situation to be dealt with in view of the decision of the Council of Europe in Seville to revise the list of countries whose citizens will require a visa to enter the countries of the Union?"
"How will the citizens of Latin American countries be treated as far as Spain and Portugal are concerned?"
"Mr President, Mr Nogueira Román, each Member State of the European Union lays down its own conditions for granting nationality."
"Any citizen holding nationality of a Member State has the right to move and settle freely throughout the territory of the Union's Member States, under the provisions laid down in Community law."
"In the case of dual nationality, citizens can invoke laws arising from citizenship of the Union."
"The Commission takes the view, therefore, that the existence of cases of dual nationality in relations between Spain, Portugal and various Latin American countries is covered by existing legislation."
"With regard to visa policy towards Latin America, Regulation No 539/2001 lays down the lists of third countries whose nationals are subject to visa requirements or who are exempt from such requirements."
"Following up the conclusions of the Seville European Summit, the Commission sent a questionnaire to the Member States, in the aim of re-examining the lists of third countries annexed to the aforementioned regulation."
"The Member States' answers can provide a number of suggestions, on the basis of which the Commission will perhaps be able to present a proposal for an amendment to the regulation."
"The criteria used to determine the lists are defined in the first phrase of the fifth recital of the regulation."
"Determining which third countries' nationals are subject to visa requirements and which countries' nationals are not is undertaken by means of a detailed assessment, on a case-by-case basis, using various criteria, particularly concerning illegal immigration, public order and security and the Union's external relations with the third countries. At the same time, account is taken of the implications for regional coherence and of the principle of reciprocity."
"Any decision by the Council in this field is adopted by qualified majority, once the European Parliament has been consulted."
"Mr President, Commissioner Vitorino, I cannot imagine that one day, in Spain and in Portugal, and even in the European Union, Brazil could be considered to be a third country for the Portuguese or Argentina a third country for Galicians or the Spanish."
"Although many people with dual nationality live in these countries, many children and grandchildren of Portuguese, Spanish and Galician citizens are not considered to be European."
"I consider, however, that this extremely close family link that exists between Portugal, Spain and Galicia and Latin America must be given very special treatment in the solutions that the Commission proposed for the visas discussed at the Seville Council."
"I hope that the Commission does not forget our family in Latin America."
"Thank you very much, Mr Nogueira Román, but I could not agree with you more, for all of the reasons you have given and for one more, which explains why we are speaking almost the same language."
"In any event, I wish to draw your attention to the fact that the countries you have mentioned already enjoy exemption from visa requirements and that the only countries in Latin America that are subject to these requirements are Colombia and Peru."
"As the time allocated to Question Time is at an end, Questions Nos 53 to 81 will be answered in writing."
"That concludes Questions to the Commission."
"(The sitting was adjourned at 7.15 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Mr President, the Commission has today adopted a communication on the rationalisation of the coordination of economic and employment policies."
"This coordination, at Union level, creates a framework within which the Member States define their own policies."
"It also contributes to progress on the ambitious Lisbon objectives."
"We all know that the general coordination framework has become an increasingly more complex framework."
"Too often new elements have been added as they became necessary and this situation has helped neither the coherence of the guidelines for the different policies nor the understanding of them."
"You, as Parliament, have presented us with various proposals to improve the situation and, while working on the basis of existing legislation, we have tried to take them into consideration."
"Rationalising coordination is not restricted simply to improving timetables and organisation, as it may seem at first sight."
"We have tried to fundamentally change the coherence of policies and the evaluation of their implementation, thereby contributing to progress in the increase in growth potential, the creation of more and better jobs, an improvement in social cohesion and sustainable development."
"With all of this in mind, the Commission makes concrete proposals in its communication to increase efficiency and coordination, to improve coherence and complementarity amongst the different processes and instruments, to stimulate our commitments and our 'ownership' in relation to a greater involvement by Parliament and social partners, and increase the transparency and understanding of policy coordination and therefore its visibility and effects."
"These important political improvements will increase the Union's capacity to achieve its ambitious economic and employment objectives."
"I would like to mention two key points: firstly, the Commission proposes a better structure for the cycle of policy coordination based on three points: execution, political orientations and guidelines."
"These will be the key points which will make the coordination cycle more transparent and improve its effects."
"The cycle will begin with the preparation of the spring European Council."
"At the beginning of each year the Commission will present a package on the evaluation of implementation which will accompany the spring report and that package will present both the development of progress in the various areas involving the implementation of the broad guidelines of economic policy and the draft joint report on employment."
"The spring report will therefore focus on the points on which progress must be speeded up and will propose key political guidelines for the spring European Council."
"On this basis, in the middle of March the spring European Council will produce some general political guidelines and at the beginning of April the Commission, with these guidelines in mind, will present its guidelines which will include both the broad guidelines of economic policy and the employment guidelines."
"Finally, the competent departments of the Commission will adopt this raft of guidelines once they have obtained the support of the European Council in June."
"The second key point of the proposals presented today by the Commission is improving the efficiency of coordination."
"In this respect, we suggest that we focus more on the medium term when it comes to drawing up guidelines."
"The raft of guidelines will adopt a more differentiated medium-term perspective and will be reviewed in their entirety just once every three years."
"In the intervening years the changes will be restricted to those necessary to take account of the most significant events during that period."
"The more strategic approach will give stability to the guidelines on the different policies and allow them to be better monitored."
"Furthermore, coherence will be improved by greater clarity in the contents of the respective instruments and their synchronisation."
"This better complementarity will strengthen the basic political messages."
"The Commission suggests that this rationalisation be implemented quickly and the first raft of new guidelines should be updated at the spring European Council of 2003, with the Commission presenting its first implementation assessment package at the beginning of 2004."
"Consequently, the new cycle will be completely under way before the elections to this Parliament."
"In addition to these improvements which will begin to operate by the 2003 cycle, the Commission has proposed a series of amendments relating to the law currently in force in the Treaties, aimed at the coordination of economic policies."
"I am not going to get into this issue today;"
"I simply wish to point out, as I said at the beginning of my speech, that these issues are linked to the process of streamlining we are discussing today, since, as I said, we are working on the basis of existing legislation."
"I would like to end by stressing that the Commission appreciates Parliament's contribution of policy coordination and we eagerly await your suggestions on the guidelines we are going to propose and on this rationalisation process."
"Your contributions and participation are a sign of your commitment to the common guidelines for the different policies and to an improvement in economic and social results."
"My colleague Anna Diamantopoulou will comment on certain further elements relating to this coordination process which we have both presented jointly today."
"Commissioner Diamantopoulou, Commissioner Solbes, thank you both very much."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission for today's communication."
"I do, however, remain concerned about two points."
"The Lisbon Summit foresaw a key coordinating role for the European Council itself."
"Although it remained unspoken, one of the main reasons for that was to avoid the whole procedure being dominated by Ecofin."
"In the procedure in this communication there is a fundamental breakdown, following the June Council."
"We then have the separate competitiveness, employment and Ecofin Councils making the final decisions in their respective areas."
"It is at that point that Ecofin will become dominant and will hamstring the other two Councils."
"That is a fundamental flaw in the whole procedure."
"My second concern is that the first and last mention of Parliament is in May, in relation to the employment guidelines."
"If the Commission as an institution is serious about the involvement of Parliament, it should be joining with us in calling for an interinstitutional agreement to give Parliament a formal say in the preparations for the spring Council."
"Mr President, thank you for that information we have received from the Commission."
"It was brief, as it presumably needs to be in this context."
"I should nonetheless like to address two more matters."
"First of all, it would be interesting to know more about the way in which the European Parliament and the national parliaments are to be able to arrive at a joint position."
"Mr Hughes has already addressed this matter, but it is important for it to be clarified."
"The point might be made that it is at present quite unclear how the European Parliament and the national parliaments are to participate in this process."
"The second matter I want to mention is the processes."
"I support the idea of these processes needing to be coordinated."
"Two processes are discussed, but I believe that three processes need to be talked about, namely the economic process, the employment process and the process of social inclusion."
"All three have their particular value and something special to contribute. It is therefore extremely important for these distinctive features to be retained when the processes are coordinated."
"Otherwise, there will be a decline in their overall value. I wonder therefore what thought has been given to the way in which, when the processes are coordinated, it might be possible to retain the special character of each particular one."
"Mr President, Commissioners, a couple of brief comments."
"On a number of occasions - most recently during the informal Council of Ministers in Kolding - we have, on behalf of Parliament and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, made the point that we would welcome coordination of the employment and social policy cycles."
"We want this to happen for a reason: because it is very clearly stated in the Treaty that employment policy guidelines must to some extent be aligned with economic guidelines."
"I hope that we will see interaction between these two elements."
"That we do not focus exclusively on employment."
"That we do not concern ourselves merely with the quantity of jobs, but also with their quality."
"That we do not think just about jobs and phrases like labour market flexibility, but that we also give some thought to security on the labour market and the social implications of this."
"In other words, all the elements that could contribute to interaction, and my question is whether that is the intention of this entire policy mix event."
"Mr President, I am going to try to respond quickly to the problems that affect me most directly and leave to Anna Diamantopoulou the problems which fall more within her competence."
"Firstly, is there a split in relation to Lisbon and is there a lack of coordination in terms of the decision making at the spring Council?"
"I believe that there is not;"
"I believe that the situation is precisely the opposite."
"In fact, we will go to the spring Council with a position on guidelines for the different processes."
"The Lisbon Council will take this decision - which of course must be consistent in all the guidelines - and subsequent Councils will then have to work on that basis."
"Therefore, what we are achieving is the opposite: that the various Councils work in a direction which has already been previously defined."
"Not only are we acting coherently with Lisbon, but I believe we are going further than what had initially been foreseen."
"Secondly, something which concerns many of you: what is the role of Parliaments - European and national - in the process?"
"From the point of view of the broad guidelines for economic policy, we are working with existing laws, as I said before."
"We are not therefore talking about a modification of the Treaties or other aspects which can be raised in the Convention."
"Nevertheless, we believe that the new procedure allows Parliament to take two types of action."
"Firstly, the debate on the report on implementation of the broad guidelines for economic policy."
"Parliament will have much more time than it did previously to hold that debate, and will also have more opportunity to take its own positions on the broad guidelines of economic policy, as we have been introducing into practice over recent years."
"In this respect, we believe that the situation is clearly improving."
"The position of national parliaments must be decided by each Member State, although the Commission advocates the idea that, both in the broad guidelines for economic policy, and in issues relating to the stability programmes, the national Parliaments should be involved."
"Finally, it is true that there is basic coordination between the broad guidelines of economic policy and employment, but also with the Cardiff Process and the other processes which can affect economic policy."
"These are the essential issues I wanted to comment on."
"Mr President, I should like to respond to two points. ?he first concerns distinct policies and whether we can achieve them."
"Without doubt, this proposal sets specific objectives, together with procedures and dates for achieving them."
"One clear objective, as I said, is that these two policies should be independent."
"So that we have clear, specific guidelines on employment, within the framework of the general guidelines, with objectives and procedures attached to them."
"I do not know if anyone can say for sure that we shall achieve this objective."
"But one thing is clear and that is that the political will is there and that the procedures are being designed so that we can move in this direction."
"I think that we now all have a political responsibility to achieve this both for political reasons and because we need distinct employment policies in the European Union as a whole."
"The second question concerns Mr Bouwman's position on employment, which of course means more than just job numbers."
"Within the framework of the guidelines and in Parliament we have said time and again that we need to include directions and guidelines on the quality of employment and this is what we are working towards."
"My initial reaction is rather positive, as I believe that the Commission proposals are along the right lines."
"We cannot ask for better coordination of the Member States' economic policies without also calling for an improvement in the coordination process for economic, social and sustainable development policies at European Union level."
"I believe that all processes relating to the BGEP, namely the Luxembourg, Cardiff, Cologne, Lisbon and Stockholm processes, and any others, for that matter, need to be rationalised."
"The experts are beginning to lose the thread, and the citizens are completely lost."
"Rationalisation is therefore required, provided, of course, that the European Parliament and the national parliaments are involved in the said processes."
"If I have understood Mr Solbes correctly, in future we will have coordination for the medium term, with a complete review every three years."
"Three years is a long time, however, for a Parliament with a five-year mandate and a Commission that also has a life expectancy of five years."
"Some legislatures would, therefore, only hold one major debate on the broad guidelines."
"In addition to this, three years is a very long time in economic terms."
"Three years ago, Mr President, the world stock markets were all bullish. Two years ago, however, the bubble burst, causing substantial collateral damage."
"Therefore, and this is my question, can you envisage not adapting the guidelines to the development of the economy and of life in society?"
"Mr President, Commissioners, you started, Commissioner Solbes, by mentioning that you are working on getting the Treaty changed."
"I should like to ask you straight up: exactly what changes are you working on?"
"How will the European Parliament and codecision and joint competence fit in with these changes?"
"And for my second question."
"We all talk about growth and employment."
"We have the stability and growth pact."
"We have the internal market."
"We have the Lisbon process."
"What potential for coordination in these three agreements has still not been exhausted and how does the Treaty prevent these orders from being fulfilled?"
"Mr President, I am pleased to hear that Parliament will be receiving documents before we are supposed to be drawing up our reports - that is something positive."
"The question I want clarified is: where does sustainable development fit into this?"
"In his introduction Commissioner Solbes talked about sustainable growth, which is not the same as sustainable development - some growth can destroy the environment and jobs and is not particularly sustainable."
"So where is the sustainability element going to come from?"
"How is this going to be determined through a qualitative analysis of growth, and how is this going to fit into this coordination which we are hoping to see in future?"
"At the moment this is a missing element and yet it is supposed to be a key element of the spring summits as decided at Göteborg?"
"Mr Goebbels, in order to clarify the position we have presented the issue very quickly."
"We produce broad guidelines every three years, but this will not prevent us from having an annual modification and an annual debate."
"I will give you an example: at the moment, the broad guidelines for economic policy have the essential aim of strengthening growth within a framework of economic stability in order to increase productivity and employment."
"This type of principle is going to be general for a long period."
"Clearly, the results produced each year, and the modification we will have to introduce bearing in mind what is happening in the economy, will have to be debated each year, and we will have to make annual modifications, but on the basis of a fundamental model which will be in force for three years."
"Mr Karas, I believe that either I did not express myself well or the translation has not been entirely correct."
"I have said twice that our intention with this Communication is to rationalise and coordinate the instruments of economic policy without changing the law."
"Therefore, this document contains no modification of the Treaties."
"We are talking about how to take better advantage of the possibilities offered by the Treaties."
"I would like to make two comments in this respect: the European Parliament's participation is clearly defined in the Treaty in relation to the general employment guidelines and we are implementing a system for participation by Parliament - not in a co-decision procedure since we are not talking about legislative regulations - which, since there will be more time to work on the application reports of the previous year and - Parliament's cooperation will be necessary here - the times for decision making on the broad guidelines for economic policy will be improved, will allow Parliament to increase its participation in the process, which is what we all want to see."
"The third element: to what extent can Lisbon be improved and applied further?"
"I believe that that it was what we are trying to do: to achieve the best possible result from Lisbon."
"A final comment in relation to sustainable development: sustainable development is included this year as an objective of the broad guidelines for economic policy, and these include certain elements relating to sustainable development."
"Mr President, I think that the Commission has made a laudable attempt at achieving greater continuity and coherence, but please allow me to say that I do not think the attempt goes far enough towards the optimum goals."
"I should first like to say something about continuity."
"I think working in the context of the longer term is fine, but adjustments must remain possible from time to time."
"The communication from the Commission takes account of this."
"I have a question on the timetable."
"The timetable now provides for new guidelines to cover a period of three years: 2003 to 2006."
"This would take us beyond the Commission's and Parliament's mandates;"
"I had hoped that this would be more of an induction programme, linked to the political mandates of the Commission and Parliament."
"Can the Commissioner comment on this?"
"Secondly: the global economic guidelines are mentioned as key implementation instruments, as they also contain the lines of force of the employment strategy."
"My fellow MEP Stephen Hughes has already commented on this in the context of the Ecofin Council."
"Employment is part of those economic guidelines, but it had already been decided that they would also contain the consensus view on matters such as coordination of pensions and healthcare."
"I should like to know what has happened to these topics, as I see nothing about them in the notification."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank the Commission for its proposals, but I would also like to draw attention to a subject which is inextricably linked to the improvement of economic and employment policy coordination, and that is the debate, which is quite heated in some Member States, on the Stability Pact and the flexibility thereof."
"I would like to ask the Commission how it intends to respond, to distinguish between the attitude of certain Member States, of certain governments, which would like to revise the Stability Pact and make it less rigid - in some cases for the simple reason that they are having difficulty keeping their public finances under control but want to keep promises they have made to cut taxes at such a difficult economic time - and the attitude and position of others, which are putting forward what I believe are sensible proposals to turn the Growth Pact and investments to good account, making good use of the golden rule that the most fruitful public investments have to be incorporated into and integrated with the Lisbon strategy."
"Lastly, how will this be coordinated with the proposals the Commission has presented this evening?"
"Mr President, I should like to ask the Commission how it intends to guarantee that economic, social and employment policies will be coordinated, as defined in the Lisbon process, and pursued in a democratically legitimate manner if it rejects changes to the Treaty within the framework of the Convention."
"I would firstly like to answer the question on the relationship between the processes of the Commission and of Parliament."
"Of course we could consider a long-term programme - five years - but, in our opinion, this period of time is excessive."
"If we do not talk about five years, the problems the honourable Member mentions will always exist."
"It is either one year or any figure greater than one year presents us with these problems."
"However, I believe that the concern is that two or three years raises the problem, as does four years."
"It is either five or one."
"Five is too much, one means that we have less room for manoeuvre."
"In any event I believe that it is a false problem."
"Because the necessary modifications can be discussed annually and therefore this does not cause any difficulty, as I said earlier to Mr Goebbels, and if a change in circumstances or an institutional change requires the problem to be reassessed, this can clearly be done."
"The second point: what happens with the Employment Ecofin and to what extent may contradictions arise?"
"Contradictions in the process are precisely what we are trying to prevent, for a very simple reason: the process starts with the Commission, with a position which must be consistent; that position must be decided on or approved by the European Council; the Ecofin Councils and the Employment Council will have to work on the guidelines produced by the spring European Council, and it will be the June European Council that finally accepts guidelines which must be consistent amongst themselves and consistent with what the European Council itself has proposed."
"Therefore, this type of incoherence should not arise."
"An issue which I believe to be totally outside today's debate is the Stability Pact."
"I am not going to say too much about this."
"The Stability Pact is part of Community legislation."
"My position is very well known: I believe that the legislation has to be complied with and therefore my position is that the Stability Pact must be applied as laid down in the legislation currently in force."
"This does not mean that the Commission is insensitive to the experience which the Pact has provided us with and that it has not proposed - the Commission itself - a series of interpretative elements in accordance with economic developments, including such important elements as, for example, taking account of the cyclically adjusted budgets in order to assess the reality in terms of the possibility of achieving the nominal objectives laid down in the stability programmes."
"I still believe that the Stability Pact is an excellent instrument and that we must naturally draw the best possible conclusions from the reality of the situation so that the Pact may function better, but not so that the substance of the Pact is affected."
"My final point: the legitimacy of the process, raised by Mrs Randzio-Plath."
"I believe that the process has all the legitimacy available at the moment; in fact it has even more, given that not only the sectoral Councils are involved in these decisions, but also the European Council at the beginning and the end of the process and, secondly, not only is the current commitment maintained, or the current participation of the European Parliament, but the intention is to increase it."
"The honourable Member raises another problem: what type of modification of the Treaty can be considered in the future with a view to greater participation by the European Parliament in this process?"
"This Communication says nothing about this issue."
"This is an issue under discussion in the Convention, and the eventual result will depend on the negotiation at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Mr President, I should like to comment on three points."
"First, as we have already pointed out, the whole proposal comes within the framework of the current Treaty, which does not need to be interpreted differently or more widely or changed in any way."
"Secondly, this proposal is just one step."
"We cannot update the Lisbon procedures in one fell swoop."
"So, to come back to what Mrs Van Lancker said about other policies, such as pension schemes or policies on other social issues or the problem of exclusion which we discussed recently, I have to say that all these procedures are in a state of flux and that our final objective is to coordinate them within a common framework."
"The third point raised by a number of honourable Members is just how medium-term or short-term the timetable should be."
"I think that the success of this proposal lies in the fact that it sets medium-term objectives - I mentioned 2010."
"This is very important because, with employment in particular, policies have to be structural."
"They leave cyclical changes out of account, which is why medium-term objectives are much more significant and help governments to focus their efforts and apply specific objectives."
"At the same time, however, we propose that procedures should be monitored annually, meaning that a debate will be held in Parliament once a year on the basis of the Member States' reports and, as Mr Solbes Mira just said, if specific incidents occur or unexpected circumstances arise, we can obviously review the new proposals."
"Thank you Commissioner Diamantopoulou and Commissioner Solbes."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on sales promotions in the internal market."
"Does Mr Harbour wish to speak on a point of order?"
"Mr President, I wanted to catch your eye before Mr Folias started, because I believe that all of us here would like to write into the record before the debate that we are recommencing this debate ten hours - I repeat, ten hours - after it was first started."
"I, and I am sure my colleagues, in particular the rapporteur, consider this is a quite unacceptable way of planning our business as a serious parliament on this most important subject."
"I shall look forward to contributing later, but I wanted that on the record now, because it is very important that you as President understand how seriously we regard the way this has been handled."
"I have taken good note of what you have said, Mr Harbour."
"Mr President, I should like to endorse what my honourable friend Mr Harbour has just said."
"I feel that the legislative work of this House is not properly reflected in the order of business and that we are still prone to the resolutionitis which we suffered from in 1979."
"The PPE group had a really hard time with this Commission proposal, in part due to the fact that the Member States have very different approaches to competition law."
"We took great pains to broker a compromise, including with the rapporteur in committee, and I should like to report to plenary today that the PPE group firmly backs this compromise, which is identical to the report by the rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. I think this is a remarkable announcement to plenary by so big a group."
"There was not one dissenting voice within the group."
"This compromise includes a statement to the effect that we agree with the compromise and that we agree with the Commission's idea of using a regulation."
"We believe that, in principle, a regulation is the right way to tackle the problems addressed here."
"However, the Member States will need time to adapt, so we have suggested a later starting date, namely 1 January 2005."
"Mr Folias has addressed the problem of small and medium-sized businesses."
"They were in fact a crucial factor in our debate."
"To give just two examples: numerous Member States have banned below cost selling in their fair trading legislation, partly in order to protect their small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We have amended the Commission proposal by expressly allowing for such an eventuality."
"We have also ensured that tariffs for fees for the liberal professions can be maintained without restriction."
"On the other hand, we have achieved the required degree of harmonisation."
"I think that excesses in competition law such as we saw at the start of the year in Germany, when a firm wanting to offer a 20% discount was prohibited from doing so by a court order, will be a thing of the past."
"Thank you for listening."
"I am afraid I must leave now."
"I have another meeting at 9 p.m. and trust that the honourable Members and the Commission will excuse me."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Beysen, very much for his thorough work and for his attention to all the issues which, as the previous speaker, Mr Lehne, pointed out too, have been the subject of a great deal of debate in the Commission."
"I believe that it was a good idea to present the proposal in the form of a regulation, for I feel that a regulation is genuinely the most suitable vehicle for laying down uniform rules on specific, clearly-defined issues, for guaranteeing price transparency and for increasing legal certainty, and that it is the best way to meet the need for uniform rules now the euro has been introduced."
"Above all, the regulatory approach makes it possible to create a legal framework on the basis of which the consumer and other market actors can obtain sufficient information to be able to make informed decisions."
"The text before us, which we are to vote on tomorrow, is, in any case, the result of thorough analysis in committee and in the committees responsible for drawing up opinions."
"It amends and improves many important aspects of the original proposal relating to the provision of protection and guarantees for consumers, minors, small and medium-sized enterprises and healthy competition, and the introduction of the subsidiarity mechanism."
"Indeed, an amendment introduces the principle of subsidiarity, on the basis of which the Member States can partially limit trade communications on grounds of consumer protection, safeguarding competition or the protection of providers."
"I feel that the provision adopted in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market - increasing protection for minors, particularly as regards personal data and potentially dangerous free samples and premiums - is especially important."
"In addition, the consumer is also safeguarded as regards the court or out-of-court settlement of claims."
"All in all, I feel this is a well-balanced proposal which takes into account both the need to make the international market fully functional and the need to protect the consumer."
"Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, I believe that the draft regulation currently before Parliament is to be welcomed because, although it is true that promotional sales are a topical issue and represent a very considerable share of the market, it is also true that there are still national laws in force imposing restrictions on promotions, particularly on discounts, which, in actual fact, jeopardise the consolidation of the internal market."
"I feel that the Commission has presented us with a well-balanced text which will provide an appropriate solution to the problem of the absence of a genuine internal market for promotions and promotional sales and of the market being governed by a variety of different laws which ban in some countries behaviour which is permitted in others."
"I fear that some of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market are in danger of diminishing the effectiveness of this text."
"I refer, in particular, to Amendments Nos 29 and 32, which, although intended to safeguard the principle of subsidiarity, are, in actual fact, in danger of rendering the regulation's provisions and proposals on the specific case of discounts ineffective."
"I believe there is one thing that must be made clear first of all: competition authorities exist at both Community and Member State level."
"Competition laws and laws on all cases which can be classed as unfair competition exist, and so cases of discounts which would appear to be an example of fair competition are prosecuted via this channel too."
"Competition authorities do exist but, in all other cases, not only are discounts not negative, they are positive."
"They are clearly positive for the consumer, who can buy goods and services at a very advantageous price, and it does not matter whether for a limited period of time or not."
"It is not true, in my opinion, that discounts are necessarily harmful for small businesses: quite the opposite, small businesses often offer discounts to launch a product or a commercial activity, not having a great deal of financial resources available for large-scale or even, often, small-scale promotional campaigns."
"I feel we are in danger of doing consumers and businesses a bad turn here."
"Another brief point: the issue of inflation."
"I am thinking of Italy, but other countries are in the same situation: penalising discounts until it is impossible to offer them in practice, as has happened in Italy, has contributed in equal measure to the creation of the conditions for a less competitive market and, therefore, a market which is at greater risk from price inflation."
"Mr President, I warmly welcome, on behalf of my colleagues in the United Kingdom Conservative Party, this very elegant and simple proposal for reform of the single market."
"It will perhaps surprise colleagues that the regulatory content of this regulation before us occupies eight clauses and three pages and yet we had 200 amendments."
"Part of the problem - I say this particularly to the Commissioner because I know he is sympathetic to this - is that despite the fact that the single market is at the centre of economic reform of the Lisbon goals, when a simple proposal for reform is put forward we are in the extraordinary position that a significant number of Member States oppose it and, indeed, Members seek to change and dilute it."
"We have reached an acceptable compromise, thanks to the heroic efforts of Mr Beysen."
"I am confident we will get a strong majority for this tomorrow and it is absolutely right that we should."
"How can we justify in the single market today a position where people shopping in Antwerp will get entirely different deals, offers and conditions to people who shop in Rotterdam, only a few miles away?"
"That story is repeated across the European Union."
"The purpose of this regulation is to empower consumers to make choices in the single market, by giving them information and allowing them to exercise their choice."
"A lot of the proposals and a lot of the amendments by the Socialist Group, which I am sure we will reject tomorrow, reflect the old mentality of trying to tell consumers what is best for them."
"That world has gone!"
"We are talking about an Internet world where people can shop all over the European Union and where businesses can put out offers to them."
"This is a crucial measure."
"In conclusion, I want to thank the Commissioner for the remarks he made in the commercial communication, where he said Parliament comes to rescue the internal market."
"This side of the House and this committee shall continue to do that."
"We shall also rescue Europe's consumers from the over-interference that some colleagues are proposing."
"Mr President, we must welcome the courageous study that the Commission has undertaken on sales promotions in the internal market and the legislative approach it has chosen and most of the solutions found to the regulation we are now considering."
"However, no fine intention to improve the functioning of the internal market and to make best use of competition rules - as the Commission would like to see, and rightly so - can hide the irrationality of allowing sales below cost."
"As has already been said in this debate, no one gives anything away for nothing and there is no such thing as a free lunch."
"Nevertheless, selling below cost is a commercial stratagem which will, sooner or later, be tolerated by consumers."
"The fairness of commercial practices is an essential and absolute value for the construction and development of a healthier, fairer and more cohesive economy."
"The predatory practice of pricing below cost is incompatible with these values."
"Indeed, when this practice is widespread, it imposes unacceptable pressures on the production system in a field with a dominant position, destroying legitimate profit margins to an unimaginable level and, consequently, the survival of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are thereby bound to make all types of concession and are subject to every type of moral pressure. This practice is also responsible for promoting impulse purchases, which obviously present no advantages for consumers, and instead threaten their interests and change their scale of priorities."
"The ban on irresponsible selling must, therefore, be maintained as a principle crucial to fair commercial practice."
"Furthermore, we have seen that the commercial strategy of predatory pricing is not controllable simply by applying the general rules on unfair competition."
"The European Parliament must, therefore, table amendments to the Commission regulation, respecting the principles that I have mentioned."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by warmly congratulating the rapporteur on his report."
"The text approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is the result of skill and a spirit of dialogue, which has allowed broadly accepted compromises to be reached."
"The result is a text which has been rebalanced in order to increase consumer protection, especially with regard to the information they are to be provided with, complaint procedures and the situation of minors, amongst others."
"Also excluded are practices which are not of a commercial promotional nature, such as the operation of games of chance in the apparent form of sales promotion operations or sales at a loss or below cost."
"I repeat that the latter is not a genuinely promotional practice, since its aim is not so much to protect the consumer as to eliminate market competitors, which at the end of the day benefits neither consumers, competition nor the good operation of the market."
"For this reason, it is considered an illegal practice in the majority - not in the minority - of Member States."
"Furthermore, several of them - since the competition rules are insufficient - have had to reintroduce these provisions."
"And this, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, must be taken into account when the Commission produces its article 7 report and when we try - as we are trying - to implement the common market."
"Because the common market cannot be a means for extending practices which the majority of Member States consider to be prejudicial, for good reasons."
"The impact of a liberalisation cannot be measured in purely economic terms, but we have to take account of all the factors that affect the common good, and consumer protection is something which cannot simply be left to the predatory practices of certain large companies."
"We therefore feel that the solution adopted is appropriate and consequently the enormous majority of our Group - which is not ultra-liberal but rather is in favour of a social market economy - is going to support it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, if our aim is to produce both legislation providing full legal certainty and, at the same time, rules which will allow the citizens to derive maximum benefits from the internal market, then the regulation before us is certainly a step in the right direction."
"We have worked hard on this regulation, and the number of amendments cited by my colleagues and the debate in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market too are evidence of the importance of what we consider to be a road that Europe must take without fail and which we want to build."
"The internal market needs rules, and the rules must be evaluated in the context of everyday life."
"The regulation broaches a number of extremely important issues."
"I will not go back over those which have already been mentioned by my colleagues."
"There is one point, for example, on which we would like there to be greater reflection and that is the settlement of disputes."
"We would also like to try experimenting with self-regulation in this new world in which consumers enter into dialogue with the market."
"Still on the subject of the disputes which are never absent from commercial relations, we call upon the Commission to expand this pilot stage of the European Extra-judicial Network."
"Moreover, once again as my colleagues have recommended, we would like to see an increase in the activity of the Expert Group on Commercial Communications."
"This group, set up in the dim and distant past in 1998, now needs to be adapted to deal with the increasingly urgent development of the internal market."
"Then there are a whole series of points already mentioned which we fully support."
"In conclusion, we feel that this is the right way to promote our ideal of Europe through the internal market."
"Mr President, I should first like to thank Mr Beysen for agreeing to act as rapporteur."
"He gave our group sufficient opportunity to express the essence of our views in the report."
"As a consequence, not only did we gain the support of 90% of the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, but we were also able to ensure that the proposal as a whole is now more balanced and shows the human face of the internal market."
"I have two questions for the Commissioner."
"I should like to hear the Commissioner's opinion on the amendment in which we want to maintain the national provisions banning sales below cost, or in any case giving the Member States the opportunity to do so."
"I wonder whether the Commissioner understands our preference for preventive action over ex-post appeals to national or other competition authorities."
"I wonder whether the Commissioner is fully aware that not all Member States have a legal culture that facilitates appeals to the competition authorities in order to resolve such problems."
"I wonder whether the Commissioner comprehends that sales below cost are an instrument that can not only be abused by a dominant player to vanquish its rivals within competition law, but that it also enables an integrated distribution company to exploit its stronger financial position vis-à-vis specialised SMEs that have less financial clout."
"The other question I should like to put to the Commissioner relates to consumer protection, on which a number of announcements have been made."
"Are we to expect anything more?"
"If so, what?"
"What else does the Commission have up its sleeve?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I too should like to start by extending my warmest thanks to the rapporteur of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mr Beysen, and congratulating him on his report."
"It was thanks to our excellent working relationship that we were able to put what started out as a highly disputed Commission proposal on sales promotions to bed."
"Advertising in the individual Member States and, more to the point, cross-border advertising in Europe, is a difficult and tricky business nowadays."
"One hardly dares launch an advertisement nowadays without checking with a lawyer first."
"There are all sorts of restrictions and bans on advertisers in the Member States."
"To bring you up to date on what is happening in Germany, which Mr Lehne also used as an example, the euro discount offered by a clothing chain at the beginning of the year was prohibited by the courts, early riser price discounts have been prohibited by the courts and classic customer loyalty schemes such as Air Miles have been banned under German law."
"Consumers are treated like ignorant, uninformed children."
"We have to put a stop to this, which is why I and my honourable friends in our group welcome in principle the Commission proposal to help out here."
"With the amendments by the Committee on Legal Affairs, it will certainly do a great deal to help the cross-border marketing of goods and services in Europe."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs has proposed important amendments to the scope of the regulation."
"A number of sensitive areas need to be exempted, especially national advertising bans for members of regulated professions such as lawyers and notaries, and bans on the advertising of pharmaceuticals."
"In addition, national rules on aggressive advertising practices or the exertion of psychological buying pressure need to stay in place."
"Seasonal and clearance sales are also exempted from the regulation, as are fixed-prices for books and, last but not least - and this has already been addressed - the thorny issue of below cost selling."
"We were right not to include this in the scope of the regulation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, this proposed Regulation on sales promotions in the internal market will allow European companies to take better advantage of the removal of borders in order to carry out their economic activities."
"I therefore believe that the proposal is very appropriate in order to humanise the national provisions on the communication of sales promotions."
"This proposal has given rise to a very important debate in this Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on a very specific aspect, namely, once again, sales at a loss."
"I am glad to see that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has included the views of the Environment Committee in its amendments, and I therefore congratulate Mr Beysen, rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and Mrs Patrie, draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"It is reasonable that sales at a loss should be regulated at national level."
"At the moment, the majority of Member States prohibit this practice: Germany, Austria, France, Ireland, Greece and Spain, amongst others, and it is not an arbitrary prohibition."
"I am going to be the last speaker to say that sales and re-sales at a loss cannot be considered commercial promotion practices, because these practices distort the principles of fair competition and in particular prejudice small retailers, who do not have the margins to compete in such a situation."
"Furthermore, they create a false alarm in terms of consumer information, harm the image of the brand and seriously alter the planning of manufacturers and suppliers."
"Specifically I support Amendments Nos 27, 28, 29, 30 and 32 and I trust that the majority of this House will approve them and that the Commission will accept them."
"Mr President, in my introductory remarks this morning I explained that the objections of this Parliament and of other groups in society concentrated on four different sectors, four different aspects of this subject."
"On behalf of the Commission I should now like to address those four aspects."
"Almost all MEPs who took the floor this morning and this evening have mentioned sale below cost."
"In discussing national provisions banning sale below cost, Mr Beysen, Mr Langen, Mrs Fourtou, Mrs McCarthy, Mr MacCormick and many others expressed concern at how SMEs would be affected if these national provisions were to be abolished."
"I think the resolution before us offers an acceptable solution as it asks the Commission to undertake further investigation before proposing a Community-wide solution to this problem."
"The authors of the resolution agree with the Commission that varying national rules in this area make cross-border purchasing and price strategies more difficult, and that action at European level is necessary for this reason."
"The Commission finds the compromise acceptable."
"I should also like to emphasise that the Commission does not agree that such prohibitions on sale below cost are needed to maintain clearance sales."
"After all, seasonal clearance sales of this kind operate well in the seven Member States that do not have such provisions."
"It is for this reason that the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 30 tabled by Mrs Thyssen."
"I am happy to clarify, though, that the study which the Commission has promised to carry out into selling below cost will take proper account of the consequences of deregulation for SMEs."
"I should now like to turn to the second topic which I mentioned this morning."
"With regard to the comments made by Mrs Patrie on consumer protection and the link between this initiative and our activities on fair trading practices, Mr Beysen's report fortunately does not take the view that this proposal will have a negative impact on our ongoing study into the need for an initiative on fair trading practices."
"That confirms the statements made by my fellow MEP Mr Byrne and myself on a number of occasions, namely that these two initiatives are entirely complementary."
"The Commission therefore regrets that it is unable to accept Amendment No 28 tabled by Mrs Ghilardotti and the second part of Amendment No 12 tabled by Mrs Niebler."
"The information requirements in the proposal offer a high level of consumer protection, which is why the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 41 and 50, which would undermine the level of consumer protection."
"On the issue of alcohol, the Commission does not consider Amendment No 80 to be proportional since the Member States restrict the sale of alcoholic products to minors."
"On the third point, promotional games, I can tell you that in view of Parliament's strong opposition to the Commission's present approach to this subject, the Commission accepts the compromise solution put forward in Mr Beysen's report."
"For that reason the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 8 as it is currently worded."
"Amendments Nos 20, 21 and 22 tabled by Mrs Patrie and Mr Lehne are now redundant since the link between taking part in a promotional game and the sale of a product is no longer possible."
"Fourthly, I should like to address the issue of mutual recognition."
"I should like to point out that this principle serves to allow free movement in sales promotion activities even without excessive harmonisation."
"As Mrs McCarthy and Mrs Fourtou have clearly indicated, the principle of mutual recognition is the cornerstone of all our work in the area of the internal market."
"As we already know, this applies to the Internet as well."
"Amendments designed to remove this principle from the proposal, such as Amendment No 72 tabled by Mrs Patrie or Amendment No 79 tabled by Mr MacCormick and Mrs Hautala, are therefore unacceptable to the Commission."
"The same applies to Amendment No 73 tabled by Mrs Patrie which makes the application of this principle dependent on further cumbersome notification procedures."
"The Commission also rejects amendments that undermine the internal market, such as Amendments Nos 28 and 12, and amendments that aim to exclude certain sectors from their advantages, such as the first part of Amendment No 13 tabled by Mrs Niebler."
"The Commission is also unable to accept Amendment No 39 on language requirements."
"Finally, I should like to inform Mr Fiori that the Commission certainly agrees that the opportunity to obtain redress must be used as quickly as possible, but the Commission thinks that in most cases this is best done by the promoter itself."
"The Commission will propose a certain number of rules ensuring that the promoter acts in this regard."
"Mr President, those are my replies to the questions and comments presented this morning and this evening."
"The only task remaining to me is the pleasant one of thanking Mr Beysen and his shadow rapporteur for the outstandingly positive contribution they have made as rapporteurs to our discussions on this important topic, which has aroused such lively interest."
"The Commission knows that Mr Beysen has devoted a great deal of time and effort to this task, which presented many difficulties to him and his committee."
"The Commission is very grateful that we have finally managed to reach a satisfactory compromise, and hopes and expects that it will be passed when it is put to the vote, which I believe will take place tomorrow."
"Thank you Commissioner Bolkenstein."
"I too, along with the rapporteur and the Members, regret the way this important debate has been managed."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0249/2002) tabled by Mr Berenguer Fuster, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the draft Commission regulation on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to state aid for employment [C5-259/2002 - 2002/2126(COS)]."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Council Regulation (EC) 994/98 contains the provision that the Commission should approve regulations on block exemption which exempt certain aid from the obligation to notify the Commission, employing a technique already used successfully in the field of anti-competitive behaviour."
"So far, the Commission has approved the Regulations on SMEs, training and minimums, and now it is proposing a Regulation on employment aid."
"I would like to start by making a series of observations."
"Firstly, that the proposal we are currently analysing, although it is not being modified, improves the existing system."
"There is currently no regulation on block exemption in this field and the guidelines on this type of aid are based on a series of diverse communications which are not regulatory."
"The fact that certain aid with clear criteria is being exempted from the obligation to notify, although those criteria may be insufficient, represents considerable progress in terms of transparency and legal certainty, which we must not fail to recognise."
"Secondly, I would like to insist that this does not mean that aid without the characteristics included in the Regulation will be considered illegal."
"Not at all."
"All it implies is that such aid will have to be subject to notification, in order to analyse whether or not it contradicts the objectives of the Treaty."
"And we must not forget that these objectives do not just include maintaining a system in which competition is not distorted, but also the promotion of employment."
"Thirdly, certain possible scenarios should be stipulated in order prevent the administrations who grant the aid - particularly the regional authorities in the case of Spain and also in other Member States - from being subject to long procedures involving notification when granting aid aimed at promoting employment, especially in sectors in which workers are most affected by unemployment."
"To this end, and in line with the objectives of the Lisbon strategy, we must propose support for the transformation of employment contracts into permanent contracts and greater flexibility in defining the different groups of workers who will benefit, as well as adapting them to the particular characteristics of each region, and the inclusion amongst the exempted aid of aid aimed at promoting the employment of women and, finally, extending the age range, so that young workers - or those who are in the final stage of their working life - can benefit from aid without the need for modification."
"All these criteria, included in Amendment No 1 from the Group of the Party of European Socialists, are aimed directly at promoting employment in the least-favoured sectors, and their inclusion in the Regulation in no way distorts competition."
"The comparison of the anti-competitive effects of this aid with other types of aid, if we analyse it soberly, is something of an insult to the intelligence."
"We are not going to get into a debate here on public aid and its effects on competition, but, if there is any public aid worthy of being seen as compatible with the objectives of the Treaty, then that is the aid aimed at promoting employment."
"It would not be good to give the European citizens and workers the impression that the Commission shows signs of flexibility when allowing other types of aid, while being extraordinarily strict when it comes to employment aid."
"Furthermore, it would be appropriate to include the social economy sector - in a general sense - as an exempt sector."
"As all the honourable Members know, social economy companies provide a significant cushion in terms of maintaining employment when there is crisis in a sector, and that reality should be reflected in the Regulation."
"Finally, in the report adopted certain paragraphs have been introduced in relation to the preference for employment flexibility measures over aid for the promotion of employment."
"I am not going to get involved in refuting this idea, which - like all ideas expressed in such emphatic terms - reflects a rigid and distinctly conservative approach, which I cannot agree with."
"But, quite simply, the honourable Members will have to recognise that whatever the ideological position they hold, this is a strange and extravagant idea at this time, which should not appear in the report, since it relates to other issues."
"To insist on it would imply an excessive interest in sending messages in favour of a certain action, which cannot be shared by important sectors, both in Parliament and in European society."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Berenguer Fuster, and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the quality of the report."
"Given the employment situation in the Community, every aspect of employment represents, and must represent, an essential political priority."
"I welcome Parliament's comments on this proposal, which seeks to reduce the administrative burdens on national authorities which employ State aid measures to respond to the challenge represented by employment."
"I am all the more pleased to note the generally very favourable tone of the report."
"As you are aware and as the rapporteur has just pointed out, the proposal concerns a fourth exemption regulation in the field of State aid, which follows on from the exemption regulations already in force in the areas of training, aid to small and medium-sized enterprises and de minimis aid."
"The main aim behind all these regulations is to reduce the administrative burdens upon national authorities, exempting them from the obligation to notify measures which are clearly compatible with the internal market."
"The proposal concerns the relationship between two essential Community objectives: employment and competition."
"The need to find the right balance between these two objectives is clear - and let it be understood that in saying this I am in no way trying to suggest that competition and employment are two objectives which are incompatible."
"On the contrary, we are convinced that, worldwide, sustaining a dynamic market economy in which the forces of competition are free to express themselves will contribute greatly to increasing employment levels."
"There are, of course, countless measures that the Member States can and, indeed, do take to promote employment."
"Many of these do not constitute State aid, particularly when they are not selective but cover the entire economic activity of a Member State."
"The draft regulation does not relate to these measures."
"It must also be pointed out that, in many cases, State aid with different primary objectives also has the implicit objective of promoting employment."
"This is the case of regional investment aid, for example, and aid to certain sectors."
"The regulation before us only concerns aid which is formally and explicitly linked to the achievement of employment objectives."
"The text does more than just streamline the administrative requirements: it clarifies the fundamental rules which apply to employment aid too."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur."
"He has worked very hard on this report and it is a good one."
"The report and the underlying regulation seek to establish clearer and more transparent rules for state aid for employment."
"Streamlined procedures for Member States wishing to aid employment schemes are to be welcomed and sensitivity to local circumstances is also desirable."
"The report welcomes and expresses support for the state aid register, which the British Conservatives have made a priority."
"It is vitally important that we keep track of the various Member States and their record on state aid."
"In terms of general principles, we believe that it is vitally important to restrict the areas where state aid can be given."
"I am not sure whether we would go as far as Mr Monti - I believe he has referred to state aids in the past as evil - but we certainly believe that it is necessary to restrict state aid in order to maintain economic efficiency and economic prosperity and a level playing field between companies in different Member States."
"Having said that, this report and the regulation acknowledge that certain state aids are acceptable and indeed desirable in relation to employment schemes."
"We are, however, very wary about the degree of extension that can be accepted even in this case, because of our suspicion of state aids."
"But we believe the Commission has drawn the line at a sensible point. That is also reflected in the report."
"I would not go as far as Amendment No 1, as put forward by Mr Berenguer Fuster."
"In particular paragraph (a) of Amendment No 1, which seems to specifically condemn temporary as opposed to permanent contracts, is not appropriate and should not be supported by the House."
"I ask the House to remember that state aid, in this context, is rather like a Band-Aid or a sticking plaster being applied to a gaping wound."
"State aid for employment, where it is permitted, as appropriate, by this regulation, can never actually solve Europe's unemployment problems."
"It is appropriate to permit government state aid for employment schemes in restricted circumstances, but the real way to tackle the 18 million unemployed in Europe, to give people genuine job opportunities, is by labour market reform, by producing structural and economic reform and labour market flexibility, making it easier to hire people."
"That is the way to deal with the serious and unacceptably high level of unemployment in the European Union."
"So we accept this as a pragmatic and sensible measure."
"Both the regulation and the report make sensible proposals, but it is vitally important that we address the key issue, which is labour market flexibility and economic reform."
"Mr President, I should like to endorse the rapporteur's positive appraisal of the Commission's proposal for a regulation."
"It is precisely because the private economy is failing to live up to its responsibility and create secure jobs that we need more aid to promote employment in the European Union."
"You only have to think about current mass unemployment and the different situations in the regions to realise that this regulation is crucial, because it creates greater transparency, cuts red tape, provides legal security and improves comparability and, with it, we shall soon be in a position to judge how effective aid is."
"It is interesting to note that national employment policies in the European Union have changed, gearing towards the common objectives of the employment strategy, with action plans being used as levers."
"But what struck us in this context is that the current employment guidelines make no reference to growth or to the desirable or undesirable effects of employment aid."
"We need to call for finishing touches to be put to the employment guidelines in the interests of mainstreaming and the coherence of European employment policies."
"We need to clarify that the contribution of both sides - employment policy and competition policy - to the European employment strategy can be guaranteed."
"I think that, in the proposal before us, the Commission rightly recognises the need to allow state measures in the form of employment incentives for companies, especially for certain disadvantaged groups."
"This is not just a logical consequence of the objectives set in Lisbon."
"Full employment is and always will be one of the most important objectives of the Lisbon strategy, Barcelona confirmed that."
"Which is why we must call for finishing touches in the form of a more flexible definition of which groups are to benefit."
"I think that the age limit of 25 should be raised to 30 and that the age limit for older employees should be dropped from 55 to 50, because society relies on both, young people entering employment and older people remaining in employment."
"I should also like to call for special care to be taken to ensure that the differentiation which the Commission rightly makes in its proposal between small and medium-sized enterprises and large companies does in fact apply when this proposal is implemented."
"Mr President, the point I should like to make is that we simply want to cooperate better with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"We have not reached a view on this report as we would normally do, partly because we received it far too late."
"The same may also be true of other committees."
"Against the background of the matter we have just been discussing, namely the Commission Communication on policy coordination between economic policy, which involves competition policy, and employment policy and other areas of social policy, we need to consider to what extent we can achieve a number of things that are very important in the fight against unemployment."
"One example of a very important issue is a fourth exemption regulation."
"If you are in a region suffering from severe problems and pressure, where subsidies are needed and the procedure for obtaining them is very bureaucratic - I myself come from such a region, but I know countless others - then this is very irritating."
"In these circumstances it is great to see the social aims in existing legislation being given a chance, and that is what I meant just now when I was talking about exchange."
"I hope that this base will broaden in the future, and that starting from the Spring summit in Athens we will pursue exchanges in an attempt to achieve common social and sustainability goals, considering what economic policy can contribute to this process rather than bringing matters which the Treaty describes as subordinate in line with economic policy."
"Briefly, against that background I think that this is an excellent proposal and believe it important for competition rules in general - I am thinking for example of services of general interest, which I could list - to be re-evaluated and tested against what we want to achieve through social policy."
"Looking at the Lisbon process as a whole, I think that a number of the assumptions contradict what we are trying to achieve with our employment objective."
"Some objectives, such as the new economy for example, were quite unjustly selected in the Lisbon process."
"We can see that now and realise the far-reaching consequences."
"State aid based on those Articles 87 and 88. Those articles are very important in rechanneling back to the objectives of social policy, and that is why we must avoid any misunderstanding."
"Perhaps we now need to go a step further."
"I believe that we must not only ensure that existing regulations are properly translated into social objectives but must also look at what social objectives we need, as formulated in the Treaty among other documents, and consider whether we should revise the Treaty, for instance to put social policy and economic policy on an equal footing."
"Against that background, and considering the proposals contained in Mr Berenguer Fuster's report - and I should like to thank him and his committee for their work - I call on members to support Amendments Nos 1 to 4."
"Support by the whole of Parliament for these amendments could well sway us to vote for this proposal as a whole."
"Outsiders find European regulations a great and impenetrable mystery."
"Many different regulations, varying requirements and conditions, masses of provisions and long texts create a forest of rules."
"Citizens and companies are lost without expert help."
"Thus, European regulations are not shining examples of clarity and comprehensibility."
"Legal action taken and legal queries raised by local authorities, businesses and affected citizens shows that this can cause problems when it comes to applying for aid."
"Parliament should therefore support the proposal to simplify and clarify the rules on granting aid in the context of employment promotion."
"Simplification and clarification does not mean adding numerous new objectives and ideas that are difficult to implement."
"It is in this context that I should like to make a brief comment on the first amendment."
"The additions proposed in Amendment No 1 really belong to employment policy, and have no place in a resolution on granting aid on the basis of the EC Treaty."
"As I see it, the Commission's regulation deals primarily with the financial side of granting aid."
"After all, aid is granted only when necessary and when justified by the circumstances."
"The additions mentioned in the first amendment are in my view also too broad for specific application in the context of granting aid."
"I support this resolution, except for Amendment No 1."
"I also agree with Mr Bouwman that the procedural handling of this report has been somewhat bizarre."
"Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I think that the Commission's draft regulation illustrates perfectly that the view held by many members that employment policy always plays second fiddle to economic policy is simply not true."
"We need both, one presupposes the other."
"There is no contradiction between competition policy, growth policy and the need to grant aid to certain sectors, as this regulation clearly illustrates."
"We realise that aid has to act as an incentive and help bridge the way to self-help."
"Aid is no substitute for economic policy and a well-ordered employment policy."
"We still think the best way of creating jobs is to have a functioning internal market, to implement the stability and growth pact, to pursue the Lisbon objectives and to introduce the four freedoms, a deregulated and more flexible employment market and an education system which encourages lifelong learning, diversification of skills and continuing learning."
"We welcome this regulation because it says yes to systemisation, simplification and bundling, yes to control and transparency, with the help of the aid register, yes to regulated employment aid for small and medium-sized enterprises, the pillars of European economic and employment policy, and because it says yes to greater coordination between the Commission's policy and the policies of the Member States and between ministries in the Member States."
"We have already moved in this direction in Austria, for example, by successfully merging the ministries of labour and the economy into a single ministry."
"I should like to thank you, Commissioner, for sending out a clear signal in your statements on aid and the floods that your aid policy takes account of regional differences in economic, competition and employment policy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I have to disappoint you."
"Unlike some of my colleagues, I am not very enthusiastic about the regulation before us."
"I am quite sure that if no changes are made to the regulation during the consultation process many Member States will have the greatest difficulty in achieving the ambitious objectives of the European employment strategy to which they committed themselves in Lisbon."
"If we are to see 70% of the population of working age in employment by 2010, this also requires helping older workers, giving people without good educational qualifications access to employment and getting disabled people into jobs, all of which means that supportive measures will be needed."
"I am sure that greater flexibility and structural reforms will not suffice to solve these problems."
"However, Commissioner, the regulation focuses so much on competition that it will be almost impossible to achieve these objectives."
"Just one example: the ceilings for support for vulnerable workers are set so low that from one day to the next all Flemish social insertion firms that provide meaningful work for the unskilled long-term unemployed will have to close down, unless we reclassify the workers as disabled."
"Another point: I am still concerned that the Commission fails to recognise the institutional reality of some Member States."
"In my country and in others, it is the regions that set support for employment programmes."
"As the regulation is currently drafted, this responsibility comes under the specific measures, not the general measures, and must therefore be notified by the regions."
"Commissioner, I think that we have found a number of arguments for the Convention to limit competition policy, but I do hope that when the Commission applies this regulation it will be able to show that, even without amending the Treaty, it is able to reach a balance between employment objectives and competition objectives."
"And I should like to ask you whether it would be possible to ask the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in charge of monitoring the Lisbon objectives for its views on this regulation."
"Commissioner, we support the draft regulation and also this continuing project of the Commission, which appears to be working on a sort of general initiative, of which this could be the fourth part."
"You might wonder, since I support the regulation, why I am speaking at all, but I have taken the floor because we are confused about one fundamental matter."
"This is my question: why is it that, in a regulation which seeks to reduce bureaucracy through a series of measures - and we have already mentioned the specific sectors - was it decided to exclude the transport sector?"
"I am taking as an example - most exceptionally - the domestic situation in Italy, where decisions have been taken over the years which have had debatable consequences, although it is also true that Italy is a country whose environmental conditions are very different from the rest of Europe."
"In a regulation which regulates employment measures in sectors which already have a great many problems and which need to diversify and to retrain their workforces, singling out the transport sector for absolute exclusion from the measure would appear to be something that the Commission might want to reconsider."
"Mr President, I want to welcome Articles 5 and 6 of the draft regulation, which give a positive signal to Member State governments to support special arrangements for so-called reasonable accommodation to promote the employment of disabled workers."
"However, I want to ask Commissioner Monti, in replying to the debate, to address the 400 000 disabled workers, such as those at Remploy in Southend in my constituency - and in other workplaces throughout Europe - where the company employs more than 50% of disabled workers unable to work in the open labour market."
"This is known as sheltered or supported employment."
"I know the Commissioner has received representations from the General, Municipal and Boilermakers Trade Union and many others that the actual organisational, administrative and transport costs of such companies should also be exempted from the state aid rules."
"I understand that the advisory committee on state aids has given an initial sympathetic response to this proposal."
"Tonight I hope the Commissioner will reassure this Parliament and those many disabled people who are unable otherwise to attain a job in the open workplace that Europe will fully recognise their rights and their aspirations in its competition rules."
"Mr President, it would seem from today's speeches that there is wide support for the rationale underlying the regulation, which can be described as follows. First of all, there is a basic coherence between competition policy and employment policy, as Mr Karas quite rightly pointed out."
"There are two reasons for this coherence."
"Firstly, in the long term, a competitive economic environment will certainly contribute to the creation of sustainable employment, and, secondly, competition policy is sufficiently flexible - as is shown by the regulation - to combine overall rigour with the possibility of state aid where there are sufficient grounds for this."
"State aid - this is another aspect of the rationale which I feel today's speeches have picked up on very well - is, by definition, selective."
"Our goal is to ensure that it is selective in a way which benefits enterprises and groups of workers which are encountering particular difficulties."
"Aid for the creation of new jobs should, therefore, be granted to small and medium-sized enterprises - as Mrs Randzio-Plath pointed out - and to businesses located in assisted regions."
"Further aid should be allocated to fund the employment of disadvantaged groups of workers."
"This explains, amongst other things, why large companies located in non-assisted regions are excluded from the possibility of receiving aid for job creation."
"This is not to be interpreted as a lack of appreciation of such enterprises: we are simply acting consistently with the desire to support other enterprises which are in situations which justify aid."
"The rules are now clearer and the amount of aid granted no longer depends on complex criteria such as whether or not jobs are linked to an investment project, and, moreover, they are now consistent with the rules on regional aid and aid to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"A number of speakers - Mrs Villiers, in particular - have also mentioned the value of transparency in the state aid register too."
"I have to say that converting such a philosophy, which appears to be widely supported, into detailed, directly applicable provisions, is by no means a simple task."
"There may be some room for negotiation as regards the precise provisions, and I note the amendments tabled in this respect."
"I can tell you, for example, that we are considering the possibility of extending the definition of disadvantaged worker - I am addressing Mr Howitt, in particular - beyond that contained in the proposal published in the Official Journal in April."
"That text already included a provision on women in regions where unemployment among women is higher than the regional average, as mentioned in Amendment No 1."
"To move on to the subject of transport, raised by Mr Fiori, I have taken note of your suggestion, Mr Fiori, although, as you are aware, in terms of internal Commission responsibilities, this matter falls within the sphere of competence of Vice-President de Palacio, of course."
"I will just say that there are specific concerns regarding the excess of capacity in certain parts of this sector, particularly in the area of road transport, and we are, in general, of the opinion that where there are problems of overcapacity, it would not make sense to grant state aid, which could, indeed, exacerbate these problems."
"We will, however, give all due consideration to your comments."
"I would also like to say - and here I am addressing Mrs Van Lancker, in particular - that we are considering providing the explicit possibility for Member States to notify measures benefiting workers who are not covered by the definition of disadvantaged workers."
"Moreover, we intend to make provision for the special case of sheltered employment for workers with disabilities."
"There may also be other cases in which we might be able to consider increasing flexibility too."
"I would like to end by thanking the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the rapporteur, Mr Berenguer Fuster, once again for their very valuable contribution."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0233/2002) tabled by Mrs Avilés Perea, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the mid-term review of the 2000-2003 Daphne Programme [2001/2265(INI)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in this report we are analysing the DAPHNE programme, its implementation, its achievements and its failings."
"It is a programme to combat violence against women and children, essentially in the domestic environment."
"This violence is a serious violation of their fundamental rights."
"Violence against women results from the unequal relationship between men and women and the sex discrimination which exists in society."
"The fight against violence requires an integrated approach which combines prevention, dealing with aggressors and support for victims."
"The European Commission has carried out an exhaustive and rigorous mid-term assessment report on the programme, which allows us to make proposals for the future with a view to achieving the objective of 'zero violence'."
"Violence against women and children takes place in all countries, regardless of class, race or level of education."
"This violence is an obstacle to achieving equality and perpetuates inequalities."
"We must point out the insufficient budgetary contribution to this programme, which has only allowed a third of the projects presented to be funded."
"We must pay special attention to the prevention of violence, but also to the treatment and rehabilitation of aggressors in order to prevent re-offending."
"It is essential to create teaching programmes aimed at preventing violence, to be used in schools and adult education centres."
"We must involve all sectors of society in the fight against violence, and in particular the media, as opinion formers and instruments for the transmission of values, so that, by means of the media, a non-stereotypical image of women may be transmitted, also of children and of victims in general."
"The way news about acts of violence is transmitted is also essential to the subsequent evaluation of them."
"The NGOs have played an important role in the fight against violence, but the public institutions must also be involved - so far only 10% of the programmes have been implemented by them - as well as universities and study and research centres."
"We need more information on real violence, since we only have knowledge of a small proportion of it."
"We must have common indicators and a common database."
"The Member States should update their legislation so that they have more appropriate instruments for combating violence."
"In certain countries there already exists the right to remove the aggressor from the shared home, with the corresponding accompanying measures."
"The victims must be protected and we must ensure that it is not they who have to flee and hide."
"Better police training in this field would be of great help."
"The DAPHNE Programme should continue after this one ends, since the problem unfortunately persists and we know that it is difficult to eradicate, and therefore actions taken to increase awareness in society and try to change the sexist mentality which still persists must be welcomed."
"Amongst these measures we propose a European Year for combating violence against women and children."
"Finally, I would like to point to the need to change the legal basis of the Programme."
"This is the right time to do so, since the European Convention which is reviewing and updating the Treaty has the opportunity to modify it, and I would therefore affectionately ask Commissioner Vitorino, whose sensitivity towards all these problems we are well aware of, to insist, to apply pressure, to do everything humanly possible to introduce into the Treaty a legal basis which facilitates the fight against violence towards women and children throughout the European Union."
"I am aware of the difficulties involved in this, but I trust in your ability to achieve it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her broad-based approach to the problem of violence and its many expressions and for proposing that we continue and make better use of this programme."
"Our mid-term report assesses how far we have come in raising awareness of the problem of violence and how to deal with it."
"However, the painful truth is that violence persists in our society, forcing us to adopt more radical and efficient measures, such as introducing a legal basis in the Treaty or organising a European year on this topic, as the rapporteur suggests."
"I, for one, am very keen to see a wide-ranging information campaign using every possible means and involving every agency in the overall campaign in the European Union and the candidate countries, which will reach small, particularly remote societies where, as we know, violence persists in the family, in schools and on the streets."
"And, over and above this objective, we need to encourage the whole of local society to get involved, as the Commissioner has already said."
"Taking stock so far, we can see that, although the programme is open to regional and local authorities, their level of involvement is only somewhere in the region of 10%, while non-governmental organisations working at local and regional level are prevented from taking part by the need to create internal links by finding partners in other Member States and by the complicated management of the programme."
"It is therefore vital, I think, that the final report contain an in-depth analysis of the quantitative and qualitative involvement of the various agencies and the mechanisms they use to cooperate and of the impact which the programmes have on local society."
"This will help us study and propose new ways of ensuring small agencies join the programme and areas in which little action has been taken so far, such as reviewing educational programmes which generate violence and educating teachers and journalists."
"Similarly, if we are to make better use of the programme, we need to look at it in relation to other, similar programmes, especially national programmes to reduce violence and help victims."
"Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists welcomes the Commission's mid-term review of the Daphne programme."
"This programme has proven to be highly effective in combating violence against children, young people and women, even though it has had very little funding."
"Daphne was born of an initiative by Commissioner Anita Gradin and the European Parliament and it is a perfect example of how, with huge personal commitment on the part of everyone involved in the programme and in implementing the project and clear political will, results can be achieved and new policies developed."
"Because violence is such a massive phenomenon, it has been hard to narrow the Daphne programme down."
"This is a taboo subject in the twilight zone."
"There is a lack of unequivocal data."
"But we know from studies that every third woman has experience of some form of gender-related violence."
"One in five women suffers violence at the hands of their spouse or partner."
"According to IOM estimates, 500 000 people are caught up in trafficking in the European Union every year, mainly women and children, while other women are at risk of genital mutilation."
"We were only able to support 73 projects under Daphne in 2000 and 2001, just 12% of the projects proposed, causing some frustration among NGOs."
"Four million euros a year - hardly enough to move mountains - but enough to raise expectations and then dash them."
"But what is important is that Daphne was a multi-disciplinary tool and the Commission should continue to demonstrate flexibility here."
"For example, the violence monitoring centre in Dublin overseen by the European women's lobby provides excellent data."
"It also has managed to draft a good overview of the measures introduced and the legal instruments in the Member States."
"It brings synergies between players and projects at national, European and international level together."
"Unfortunately, the central and eastern European countries are still not involved enough."
"Only 6% of organisations even have any resources to put into projects."
"We found out during our delegations' trips to the candidate countries that there is a tremendous need here; they are hugely willing but financially unable and these two factors need to be reconciled in the NGOs."
"It is important not to stop at the external borders of the European Union."
"Russia, the Ukraine, Belorussia, nowhere is safe from this phenomenon, which also affects us here in the European Union."
"We need to open up more and include other Community programmes in the Daphne programme."
"I and my group think it is important that we build on our experience from the first half of the programme to strengthen synergies in the second half of Daphne."
"This is stated in item 12 of the resolution."
"We must continue with the campaign against violence and with preventive measures."
"There are excellent examples of this on the external borders in the form of warnings to young women."
"We have achieved good results with our networks, with the NGOs, and these now need to be implemented in the Member States."
"What we really need - and this has been pointed out and called for on several occasions - is a European Year against Violence."
"Commissioner Reding, who is responsible for communications, has already given the go-ahead."
"Now we must push in the Convention for a clear statement to the effect that, from the point of view of the legal basis, this is not just a public health issue; internal security is also at risk if violence against women continues."
"Mr President, violence against women and children, despite having been condemned in successive UN and European Union resolutions for constituting an unacceptable and intolerable breach of their fundamental rights, is still a reality in our society, including in Portugal."
"Especially domestic violence, one of the most common forms of violence, although one of the least visible, and which involves huge human, social and economic costs for all of society, in addition to being a threat to the safety, the physical integrity, the freedom and the dignity of women."
"Hence the importance of an integrated approach enhancing the measures, actions and financial means which the Daphne programme provides for, but which are insufficient, as has also already been emphasised."
"Furthermore, as the report states - and I must congratulate the rapporteur - in the European Union around 500 000 people per year, the majority of whom are women and children, are victims of trafficking in human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation, which also requires more effective measures in the fight against all forms of violence and in supporting victims, including increasing the financial means that are currently earmarked for this purpose."
"I should also like to draw attention, however, to the field of prevention, by creating more high-quality employment, better social provision and support and by paying greater attention to education against violence, by providing more information and improving promotion of women and children's rights."
"I therefore urge the Commission, the Council and the Member States to take account of the proposals put forward by Parliament, capitalising on the experience gained since 1997 and presenting a new action programme with appropriate financial appropriations, and also counting on the full participation of the candidate countries and the creation of a common database to eliminate violence."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you know that this report has been unanimously accepted without amendments."
"There are no contradictions in this report and in this revision of the Daphne programme."
"Everyone is in agreement."
"This initiative, instigated by the European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, has been a great success."
"Not only in Europe but also in many distant regions of the world, as my fellow MEPs have already mentioned."
"Sadly, it cannot be regarded as an unqualified success, as the Commissioner has already indicated."
"This programme may be drawing to a close, but I have heard many positive indications that it could continue although there may not be sufficient funds in view of all the associated problems."
"One of the questions I should now like to raise is whether, in the case where certain projects have been approved by the Commission but cannot be funded, the Commission and your Commissioner could not recommend that the Member States, who are after all responsible for the projects, should take over a project."
"This would mean that a project would be funded by a Member State instead of the Commission, encouraging the Member States to undertake high-profile activities in their own country, perhaps also involving NGOs and public bodies such as local councils."
"The Spanish Presidency has selected violence against women as one of its priorities."
"This led to a major study into the measures taken by various Member States and an examination of best practice."
"The Danish Presidency continued along this path, but I should like to take this opportunity to draw your attention to one particular aspect which I think deserves more funding: violence within the family."
"Why?"
"A survey conducted among the Antwerp police showed that 70% of all police work related to events directly connected with violence within the family."
"This includes incest, attacks by children on their parents and vice versa."
"Violence against elderly relatives, psychological problems, physical and mental violence before and after divorce, when exercising visiting rights or in the case of a newly formed family unit."
"I am not just talking about children who grow up in a violent family and so see this behaviour as normal, but also of a general blurring of moral standards."
"Sometimes the reverse occurs: one of the parents grew up in a disruptive or violent family and wants to spare their children this experience at whatever cost."
"This parent becomes over-protective and exerts too much discipline."
"The other family members either accept this situation or feel oppressed and rebel."
"In situations like this children may run away from home or attack their parents."
"Or girls growing up in circumstances like this later on unconsciously choose a tyrannical partner and often become the victim of domestic violence."
"Making all these problems a fit topic for discussion in our society opened up a Pandora's box."
"We cannot abandon the victims to their fate, failing to provide support or a way out."
"I'm thinking here not just of the traditional activities like helplines, reception centres and safe houses, but also of training projects."
"Training and educational projects for people when they first come into contact with a possible victim and have the opportunity to help him or her out of their isolation: groups like doctors, teachers and police officers."
"Because acting when violence first occurs also prevents escalation and is the most important step in prevention."
"I should also like to stress just how important Daphne is."
"It was a project undertaken by a number of NGOs in various countries together with an international organisation: the International Organisation for Migration."
"They devised a project in the context of cooperation in helping the victims of human trafficking."
"That project was very successful, which is why I see it as so important that the projects can be continued and further refined."
"In fact, on 17 October the European Parliament will be holding a round table presenting a video, a brochure and a website where politicians like ourselves, police officers, journalists, researchers and students can obtain information."
"I should just like to tell my colleagues how important this is."
"Mrs Avilés Perea expressed it very well."
"We need the International Year against Violence, and subsidies."
"Perhaps we should put more pressure on our Member States to get involved."
"Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on her work, on the figures and statistics presented, which, although there is a lack of homogenous data, reveal that violence against women and children is an extremely disturbing phenomenon."
"The most recent data on domestic violence and violence within the home, which reveal how one in five women is the victim of violent acts committed by her husband or partner, are incredible."
"These acts of violence are often never exposed and sometimes even end in the murder of the victim."
"In the face of such tragic figures, we are astounded at the allocation of such an inadequate sum, even taking into account the increase of the 2002 budget by EUR 1 million."
"We are also astounded that public bodies have only accounted for 10% of the participants."
"The role of public bodies is, indeed, decisive, both in terms of training specialised staff and in terms of the provision of information on and prevention of acts of violence and abuse perpetrated against women and children."
"In particular, we need to create or improve counselling and legal advice centres which will be able to guarantee and provide maximum protection for the victims, as well as free psychological and legal assistance."
"It would be desirable to include teaching spaces dedicated to the prevention of child abuse and domestic violence in school curricula."
"Lastly, my group fully supports the idea of a European year of action to combat violence against women and children."
"However, I agree with my colleagues: if the legal basis is not changed, there is little of actual practical, effective use we can do to combat these terrible offences."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Commission because this is the result of perseverance and of having believed in something which had never before been dealt with."
"Therefore, in recent years, during this legislature and during previous ones, a European awareness is being created of the problems of violence against women, against children and in the home."
"I believe we should insist on this working approach despite the fact that it is difficult to introduce the credibility and importance of these ideas into the policies of the countries."
"Let us consider what is happening in many European countries. Organised prostitution, domestic violence, the alarming increase in violence against children and the abandonment of many of them by their families, demonstrate that we are talking about an issue which must be dealt with through a system of shared competences."
"In this regard, I fully support the proposals of Mrs Avilés and I very much agree with what the Commissioner has said."
"To put it another way, Europe must create a minimum referential legal framework both for violence in the home and the obligation of the States to protect the victims and for trying to prevent the irreversible damage being done to children who are witnesses to horrors, minors who live in an atmosphere of fear and who cannot escape violence."
"Furthermore, it is very clear, and I would like to stress this, that the majority of abandoned children and those who suffer horrors in their own homes are in this situation because the family has broken down or has never existed."
"Consequently, their protection and education cannot be dealt with within the family framework."
"Other protection and defence strategies must be put in place since sometimes the family is a repressive environment."
"Furthermore, I have the feeling that we are getting used to so many cases arising."
"In this regard, I would ask for the implementation of a right for children which is binding for the Member States and that this obligation be taken into account when discussing the countries which are to join the European Union."
"It is impossible to carry on working without a basic legal framework, particularly when we know we are not protecting the victims."
"Mr President, at the moment I can do little more than thank the rapporteur and the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities for this excellent report."
"I also thank the Commissioner for his response to the report and his commitment to renew this programme."
"I am a patron of an organisation in Ireland called Women's Aid."
"It is a national organisation which has benefited greatly from the Daphne programme."
"It provides shelter for women and children who are the victims of domestic violence."
"It also provides advocacy and public education and research."
"The problem we are dealing with here is deeply ingrained in our society, not just in far-off, distant societies which have particular religious views in relation to women."
"In Europe also there is a deeply ingrained misogyny in our society."
"It is not going to be rooted out overnight."
"It will require education and addressing the culture that we live in; it requires addressing the attitudes of our media."
"Our hope lies with our children and in trying to ensure that we inculcate in them a respect for the dignity of every human being, male and female, adult and child alike."
"Mr President, I should like, first of all, to thank all the speakers for their contributions to this debate and to emphasise the political visibility given to this issue by the Spanish Presidency, which created a momentum which, I feel sure, will be maintained by the current Danish Presidency, during which I hope that the framework decision on the trafficking of women and children for the purpose of sexual exploitation will finally be approved by the Council."
"We are extremely close to achieving this approval and I hope that it will be formalised during this presidency."
"The only substantial answer that I should like to give at the moment concerns funding."
"I believe that it is sometimes tempting to think that, when an activity is eligible for Community funding, Community monies can be a replacement for national funding. In reality, however, the rules of our conception state that Community funding is additional to national funding in a task of this scale and of this political importance."
"Hence the importance that the Commission attaches to the public authorities of the Member States also being able to apply for the Daphne programme, because this would create a situation that encourages the Member States themselves to participate in projects and to invest financial means in combating violence against women and children."
"There is one problem, however, that I do not wish to ignore: the issue of the debate on funding is very closely related to that of the legal base."
"A clear, explicit and solid legal base in the Treaty would provide another lever for the funding of a project of this nature."
"As long as we have to work within the scope of Article 152 we shall continue to have problems."
"I sincerely hope that, with this debate, we might reach agreement on the joint efforts to be developed in the Convention so that the future Constitutional Treaty of the European Union enshrines the fight against violence towards women and children as an objective of the Treaty on European Union itself."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0256/2002) by Mrs Smet, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Legal Affairs, on the scoreboard on implementing the social policy agenda [2001/2241(INI)]."
"The purpose of the annual scoreboard for the implementation of the social policy agenda is to ascertain how much progress has been made towards the objectives laid down in Lisbon and Nice."
"The essence of these objectives is the creation of a European social model to eliminate poverty and unemployment, create high-status jobs, encourage lifelong learning, modernise the social security system and do away with all forms of discrimination."
"The 2000-2006 period is a crucial time in this respect as changes in the economy, demographics and migration have rarely been as great as they are now."
"It is therefore to be expected that Parliament, as the mouthpiece par excellence of what is of concern to the European population, should keep a close watch on assessment of progress."
"The document put before us by the Commission gives us a first-class overview of the activities which have been undertaken and of what we can expect in the near future."
"But what is missing - and this is my main criticism - is a six-year summary of what has to be done."
"Parliament takes the view that the extent of annual progress can only really be judged in the light of the targets set for the six-year period in question."
"Parliament expects more from the Commission than an annual report."
"It requires a six-year programme containing initiatives to be taken and the instruments to be used for each initiative, such as legislation, open coordination or negotiations between social partners, and deadlines for the completion of these initiatives."
"As part of its interim evaluation in 2003, the Commission must attempt to work out a different type of scoreboard and present it to Parliament."
"Parliament already made this request last year and is repeating it this year."
"This brings me on to my second criticism: the lack of Parliament's involvement."
"The Commission knows full well that the European Parliament is the greatest advocate of the social aspect of European development, much more so than the Council of Ministers."
"We have plenty of examples of this, starting with European legislation which Parliament usually pushes further than the Council of Ministers would like."
"I therefore fail to understand why the Commission took so little trouble to involve Parliament at an early stage in devising the social policy programme."
"The Commission's document is dated 19 February 2002 and was approved at the Spring Summit in March."
"Parliament needs at least 2 months to produce a report through its committees and plenary sessions, and that does not give us much time."
"I would therefore advise the Commission to ensure that it submits its next report by the end of December, so that a useful dialogue with Parliament can be organised."
"It should be possible for this dialogue to progress positively and quickly if the Commission takes account of the comments made in Parliament's two previous reports."
"Finally, a few words on one of the instruments of social policy, open coordination."
"The success of this method lies in the fact that it has given us a way to coordinate the policy of the 15 Member States, to bring the 15 Member States behind a coherent set of objectives and to provide the 15 Member States with best practices to achieve those objectives."
"And all this in areas where binding European Union legislation is not desirable or not possible."
"The difficulty for Parliament is that its involvement is not, or not adequately, regulated."
"The method has a high input from many groups outside this Parliament."
"This raises the question of whether the use of the open coordination method and the participation of the European Parliament can be better aligned in the context of the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference."
"We hope the Commission will support us in this."
"Mr President, I should like to make a point of thanking Mrs Smet for her report on the scoreboard on implementing the social policy agenda."
"As she quite rightly points out, the social policy agenda for the years 2000 to 2006 is the first common commitment adopted, including by the Council, and the first European charter of social commitments and actions."
"The first year, 2001, was a special case which we discussed last year."
"It was the first year we ran it and it had serious shortcomings and problems."
"This year, we have our first detailed scoreboard, containing a step by step analysis of the progress made in this particular policy area."
"The comment last year was that the description only applied to the Commission."
"I think it is clear that, this year, we have a detailed description of all the agencies involved in each action."
"One example is the proposal for socially sensitive restructuring in the business sector, which describes the role of the Commission, the European Parliament, the social agencies, the social partners, governments and civil society."
"Of course I agree with Mrs Smet and her comment in the report that we should always look forward as well as back, i.e. not just to how specific agencies have been involved but also to the objectives they have set for the following stages."
"The following stages will be examined to a certain extent in the first mid-term review in 2003."
"The period from 2003 to 2005 is also important."
"There will be an initial progress report and we shall be able to make any changes deemed necessary."
"I should point out here that the European Parliament will be fully involved in this mid-term review because as Mrs Smet says, and I am sure no-one disagrees, Europe's basic ally in all social policy proposals is the European Parliament."
"It is more often than not Parliament which is the driving force behind the European Union in social policy."
"I should like to comment on three points which I feel are instrumental to the debate."
"First that, with cooperation between the Commission and the European Parliament, most of the social policy agenda initiatives planned for 2000 to 2002 have been brought to a successful conclusion or are under way."
"Secondly, as has already been mentioned, we have found a modus operandi with the method of open cooperation between the Member States and, to a certain extent, a way of including the role of Parliament in this method."
"Of course, this is a first step and what we need to do is identify the basic, fundamental role of the European Parliament and this is something the Convention will need to address."
"The third point is that, as with the European Parliament, we need to find a legal basis for involving civil society in discussions in the Convention."
"I should like to make a point of thanking the European Parliament for its constructive cooperation."
"We look forward to receiving your individual comments."
"Mr President, the scoreboard on implementing the social policy agenda is obviously extremely valuable because it allows us to draw conclusions as to the progress made."
"I have had the honour of drafting the relevant opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights."
"To be perfectly honest, I had little to add to the very detailed report drafted by Mrs Smet, who also happens to be an active member of the European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights."
"The importance and value to women of implementing this agenda is obvious, given that, over recent years, most increases in employment have affected women."
"Around two-thirds of the new jobs which it is estimated will be created between 2002 and 2010 will be filled by women, which is why I was especially pleased, Commissioner, with your communication a short while ago about the new initiatives which you have taken on behalf of the Commission to coordinate economic policy and employment policy."
"The procedure for assessing progress, despite the shortcomings pointed out by Mrs Smet in her report, is without doubt a very useful tool, especially at a time of economic recession, when the pressure is on to relax social policy and to abandon efforts to reduce economic inequalities and combat social exclusion."
"We therefore welcome the initiative taken by the Danish Presidency to highlight the problem of social exclusion and the various repercussions that social exclusion has on the two sexes."
"Mr. President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Smet on her excellent work."
"The scoreboard on the application of the Social Agenda must allow the progress made in terms of the application of that Agenda to be monitored, but it must also act as a rapid alarm call when there are delays in the implementation of the measures announced."
"I believe that the rapporteur has been able to harmonise both aspects in her report."
"Furthermore, in its application, the Social Agenda should not, in my humble opinion, be treated as an unaltered or unalterable programme."
"Designed by people for people, I see it as an evolving programme which demands subsequent adjustments, as the mid-term assessment of the progress achieved, to be carried out in 2003, will demonstrate."
"Commissioner, much has been done in terms of the development of the European social model, but I would venture to say that there remains much to be done, and in different fields."
"Sex equality policy, measures to combat social exclusion and poverty, policies on the integrating of disabled people socially and taking advantage of the capacities they do have, and opting for life-long learning and training and, with it, the need to adapt to the new forms of work and the reconciliation of work with family life."
"In any event, there is a demand which I would like to highlight and draw the Commission's attention to."
"I am referring to the new forms of work, with the new risks inherent in them and therefore the concern about the forms of participation in productive processes by means of productive externalisation or decentralisation - subcontracting, the presence of freelancers, independent workers - in the field of the risks of the contracting company, etc."
"Hence the need for the application of measures aimed at preventing risk - inherent in all forms of work, but sometimes imperceptible and blurred in the context of these new forms of production - being converted into work accidents."
"I believe that these measures would be viable for all workers, employers and society."
"Mr President, I want to congratulate the rapporteur on this report and indeed congratulate Commissioner Diamantopoulou for her very excellent work in this area of social policy."
"A major step forward was made for the European Union at the Lisbon Summit, in its commitment not only to a competitive, dynamic economy but also to a society which is cohesive and based on full employment."
"Too often we hear spokesmen from the various political groups talking purely about the idea of a competitive economy and ignoring the balance we need to ensure within the European Union in terms of modernising and deepening the social model that we have in Europe."
"The Nice Summit also took a major step forward in adopting the new social agenda."
"If we had had a referendum in Ireland on that, rather than on the Treaty of Nice, it would have received 100% support."
"Unfortunately we do not have to vote on these issues at this stage."
"But it was an important advance."
"I have to say, however, that progress seems to have considerably slowed down since then."
"I have no doubt there are forces or elements in the European Union - both in the Commission and in the Council - which are deliberately seeking to slow down progress on this agenda."
"It seems to me to be short-sighted."
"If we are serious about creating a European Union which has the support of the citizens, we must give a balanced commitment to the development of a social Europe."
"Even for the centre right it makes sense."
"If they are serious about Europe and creating a Europe of states and peoples, then we must ensure that equality, cohesion and solidarity rule right across the Union."
"I feel there are inadequacies in the scoreboard itself."
"Not all the progress has yet been measured."
"I welcome the idea of a mid-term review for early next year and I look forward to participating in it."
"I hope that in the years ahead, particularly in the Convention and the subsequent IGC, we can succeed in ensuring that the commitment that began to be developed in Lisbon and subsequently in Nice can be incorporated and deepened in a constitution for the European Union which guarantees that we have not only a competitive Europe but a Europe that cares equally for all of its citizens."
"Mr President, I too should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Smet on having, as usual, done a sterling job."
"In my own country, Sweden, a national election campaign is under way right now."
"Those in Sweden who belong to the same political group as Mrs Smet usually maintain that the social agenda is not something for Europe but that social policy is a matter only for the individual Member States."
"I usually put forward Mrs Smet's view."
"Despite our belonging to different political groups, we are in complete agreement about the need for national social agendas."
"A European social agenda is also needed, however, as something which is becoming more and more important."
"Like Mr De Rossa, I approve of what happened in Lisbon."
"Incredible progress was made, and we succeeded in broadening and deepening the social agenda."
"At the same time, I am rather uneasy about the signals which have been produced in the course of last year and which I see in terms of attempts to throw the Lisbon process off balance."
"The talk now is simply of companies and of competition between companies, and the social dimension is forgotten."
"It is therefore good that there are MEPs who wish to go beyond party boundaries in promoting the social aspects, and I wish again to congratulate both the Commission and Mrs Smet on their work."
"I also share Mrs Smet's views on the scoreboard, namely to the effect that it must be more forward-looking and strategic and be based upon the conclusions from the spring European Councils."
"I hope that the Commission too will take that view on board, as well as the open coordination method, which is something to which we have returned time and again."
"We have debated this on many occasions, and I am myself a proponent of the open coordination method."
"It has meant that we have been able to develop cooperation in new areas."
"If the open coordination method is to be successful in the long term, it must not however be applied behind closed doors."
"If the method is to be employed for a long time, it must be subject to democratic control and be debated both here in the European Parliament and in the national parliaments."
"We must hope that the Convention will get to grips with this issue so that the open coordination method is taken account of in the Treaties."
"The social agenda is important in another perspective too, namely people's willingness to take the EU project to heart."
"The social agenda concerns precisely those questions that people consider to be important - the fight against poverty, together with increased employment and a more just society - and that is why the social agenda is important."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Social Policy Agenda is a dynamic programme and, therefore, likely to be adjusted."
"Hence the importance of the annual assessment panel, enabling the European Parliament to monitor and control the implementation of the Social Agenda, analysing the past and programming the future."
"The rapporteur, Mrs Smet, has presented a magnificent price of work, which criticises the Commission communication and lays bare its weak points, as well as making clear and lucid contributions to the future implementation of the Agenda."
"Employment is the European Union's number one priority."
"In 2000, the employment rate reached 63.2%. Despite the creation of around 3 million new jobs, it is still 7% below the Lisbon Summit objective for 2010 and the number of unemployed still persists, at 14.5 million European citizens."
"The low employment rates of older workers, the disparities between men and women, both in terms of the employment rate and of remuneration (18% and 14% respectively) the high levels of unemployment - around of 8% of the workforce - and regional differences in employment constitute structural weaknesses that require attention and active measures."
"The committed involvement of the social partners is crucial."
"Poverty and social exclusion are other issues that deserve increased attention."
"More than 60 million people are living at risk of poverty."
"This phenomenon varies, as is known, between Member States, but we are not mistaken in considering the fight against poverty and exclusion and their eradication to be the greatest challenge facing us."
"Therefore, the Commission must speed up the works that are underway in the aim of understanding and assessing the phenomenon, paying particular attention to women."
"With regard to promoting equal treatment between men and women, this Commission assessment panel still lacks an overall strategic approach. Consequently, the Commission must propose measures to improve the situation of women and, in parallel, to adopt initiatives to promote their full participation in decision-making in the workplace."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
". (PT) We welcome the fact that on an issue as sensitive and as topical as the definition and harmonisation of operational standards to make air navigation safer, a broad consensus has been reached between the actors involved, resulting in an agreement between the various operators on limiting flight times and crew rest requirements."
"We therefore share the rapporteur's conclusions, because they reveal the urgent need for the gradual adoption of technical standards guaranteeing increasingly high safety standards and in the aim, furthermore, of enabling passengers to have the utmost confidence in European air transport."
". (PT) As the rapporteur states, 'The oversight and enforcement of the implementation of EU environmental law is already very unsatisfactory'."
"In fact, in a field which is increasingly important to Europe's citizens, who are already aware of the importance of managing, rationalising and protecting their environment, we are still seeing on a regular basis, brutal attacks on what is everyone's cultural heritage."
"This betrays an inadequate legislative framework and unsatisfactory coordination between actors and the Community authorities."
"In order to end this state of affairs, better monitoring and practical and firm action are required on the basis of the reports sent by the Member States to the European Commission every three years."
"Incidentally, we are seeing worrying levels of delay in implementing infringement procedures."
"Everything must be done, therefore, to enable the Commission 'to come up with a coherent picture of what is happening over a whole sector of policy - as with waste management', thereby responding to the increasing and increasingly insistent concerns of Europe's citizens."
"Hence my vote in favour of this report."
"Iraq"
"The first item is the Council and Commission statements on Iraq followed by a debate."
"Mr President, I do not simply want to repeat or parrot what the Minister has just said in his comprehensive speech about what has led up to the present situation."
"So I will discard some of my remarks that would otherwise have been rather repetitive, which should allow even more honourable Members to take part in this exceptionally important and, I think in terms of procedure, almost unique debate."
"Over the past few weeks Iraq has figured more and more prominently, as the Minister just said, on the international agenda."
"The situation appears to be evolving day by day."
"What is plain, whatever else may be doubtful, is that the risk of a very grave new crisis is increasing."
"Many important voices have been raised, not least in Washington, about how to deal with Iraq and with the problems linked to its possession and development of weapons of mass destruction."
"Positions have been expressed by many key players, including European governments."
"I note from this morning's papers what was said only yesterday."
"Against the background of this tumult of speeches and articles, I would like today simply to concentrate on the things we know with certainty and on which we should all be able to agree."
"First, as pointed out by Baroness Nicholson's excellent overview of the present situation in Iraq, which we discussed in this Chamber last May - and I agree, incidentally, with everything the Minister said about our concern for the people of Iraq - we can have no doubt about the evil nature of the regime led by Saddam Hussein."
"That was made manifest in the excellent report that we discussed in May, albeit, I have to say, with slightly fewer people in attendance than is the case this morning."
"Terrible events have occurred throughout the 23 years of his rule: wars, aggression and brutal internal repression, including the use of chemical weapons against his own people."
"There is, in his country, a total absence of basic human and civil rights and I have no doubt that the Iraqi people would be better served by new and different leadership."
"Indeed, I would be surprised if anybody thought that they are best served by this leadership, not just the Iraqi people, but the Middle East region and indeed the whole world."
"His is not the only regime that the world would be better off without - there are a lot of others as well - but it is certainly as high on the list as any."
"Secondly, following the departure of UN inspectors in 1998, a UN Security Council Resolution, No 1284, which the minister referred to, was adopted in December 1999, establishing a new arms inspection entity, UNMOVIC, and setting out what Iraq has to do to have UN sanctions lifted."
"Notably, it had to cooperate with the inspectors 'in all respects'."
"This means that Iraq should give full unrestricted access to UNMOVIC inspectors to any site, area, equipment and installation at any moment without any conditions."
"Yet Iraq never complied with this Security Council Resolution - just as it failed to cooperate with the UN throughout the 1990s - there were nine Security Council Resolutions - either refusing entry to UN inspectors, or imposing unacceptable conditions on their operations."
"This House has always been absolutely clear about the importance of the UN in securing better global governance of our troubled planet and I do not think that you can exempt Iraq from those considerations."
"According to the UNSCOM report of January 1999, there are legitimate suspicions that the Iraqi regime is developing weapons of mass destruction."
"It is not the Commissioner for External Relations who is saying this, UNSCOM is saying it."
"At this point in time, no clear evidence has emerged, although it should be noted that the Iraqi Government has not facilitated the task of the UNSCOM inspectors to gather evidence about this."
"Whenever I think about this issue, one question crops up again and again. If the Iraqi regime has nothing to hide, why do they bar access to the UN-mandated inspectors?"
"It is not an unreasonable question to ask."
"I think two conclusions stand out clearly, from whatever point people come to this argument and this debate, which is going to cause a great deal of passionate discussion in the next few weeks and months."
"First, we must continue to press for full Iraqi compliance with the UN resolutions."
"Is there anybody in Parliament who disagrees with that?"
"Good!"
"We have a consensus."
"The situation may not quite exist in other countries yet, but at least we can begin in this Parliament with a consensus on that point."
"The EU Presidency declaration of 20 May reaffirms European Union support for United Nations Security Resolution No 1284 and unhindered access for UNMOVIC inspectors."
"Second, we must recognise that efforts to force Iraqi compliance are more likely to succeed if they are backed by a coalition of concerned parties as broad and effective as that which was put together with great diplomatic finesse in 1991 and which helped to secure the expulsion of Iraqi armed forces from Kuwait after the unprovoked invasion of that country."
"We should also be looking for as broad an international coalition to secure UN compliance as possible."
"Again, that seems to me to be a perfectly reasonable proposition."
"We must all respect the authority of the United Nations and of international law."
"The Security Council has charted the way forward in dealing with this intensely difficult problem and every nation should act within the framework of the decisions and resolutions issued by the United Nations."
"Finally, the plight of Iraq's population - and this was a subject that we certainly discussed at some length on the basis of the honourable Member's report back in May - has highlighted the difficulty of dealing with a regime which is as ruthless as it is reckless."
"Since the Gulf War in 1991 the EC has been the major donor of humanitarian aid to Iraq."
"We have contributed over EUR 270 million."
"Over the last three years we have provided assistance of some EUR 10 million annually."
"In 2002 we shall provide around EUR 13 million."
"Yet the impact of our help is reduced by the limitations placed upon it by Saddam Hussein's regime."
"That is why we strongly welcomed UNSC Resolution No 1409, to which the Minister referred last May and which introduced so-called 'smart sanctions' intended to limit Saddam Hussein's ability to develop weapons of mass destruction while also limiting his ability to inflict hardship on his own population."
"Meeting at Elsinore last weekend, Europe's Foreign Ministers called for full implementation of the UN resolutions and a resumption of inspections without excuses, without prevarication, without 'ifs' or 'buts'."
"That is obviously the best way to proceed."
"I would like to make a couple of personal remarks."
"I hope that, as the debate on how to achieve these shared objectives continues in the coming weeks, it will shed light as well as generate heat."
"We need to consider how we can best limit the production and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"We have to look at how we can continue successfully the international campaign against terrorism on as broad a front as possible."
"We have to promote the end of violence in the Middle East, the restoration of a peace process and the establishment of a Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security with Israel."
"That is what Foreign Minister Møller in the office of presidency is trying to do this week in the Middle East, taking to the region a roadmap which suggests extremely convincingly what Europe thinks is the way to get back to peace talks and to get away from violence."
"We have to prevent a gulf opening up between the democracies of Europe and North America and the Islamic World."
"We have - and this may not be popular everywhere these remarks are heard - to encourage the development of participative democracy, civil society and the rule of law in all countries, including those which comprise the Arab World."
"We have to think constructively about what can and should justify intervention by the international community in the internal affairs of a sovereign state."
"We have to think equally constructively about whether the global rule book that has by and large governed our affairs for the last 50 years is still valid or whether it requires some changes, how it can be reinforced and strengthened."
"It is important that on all these issues, which are going to shape the sort of world we live in for the next decades, Europe's voice should be heard."
"(Applause)"
"I would just like to offer one last thought: it is perhaps ironic that the debate on these far-reaching issues at the beginning of a new century is triggered by the question of how we should deal with a dictator whose rule exemplifies much of what was worst in the last century."
"I just wish I were as certain about some of the answers to these questions as are many of those whose voices are currently raised so loud."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, the reason for this debate here and the debate in the international community is Saddam Hussein's dictatorial and criminal regime."
"The focus of evil is in Iraq, not in the United States."
"As both the President-in-Office and the Commissioner have already pointed out, Saddam Hussein already has a history of using weapons of mass destruction against his own people and against Iraq's neighbours."
"He invaded Kuwait."
"If he is still stockpiling and producing weapons of mass destruction, that is a threat both to the Middle East and to the international community as a whole."
"Anyone who wants to prevent a war must prevent Saddam Hussein from being able to use biological, chemical or nuclear weapons."
"The way Saddam Hussein is flouting international law is quite unacceptable."
"He is obliged to permit unconditional and unfettered checks by UN arms inspectors in Iraq."
"That is what we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats are calling for."
"Saddam Hussein must comply with the demands of the United Nations."
"That is why we must maintain pressure on this Iraqi dictator."
"If we in Europe are not united, he will exploit that."
"That is why it is unacceptable - and I am saying that very calmly - for the Federal Chancellor of Germany to talk about a German approach to this issue."
"That will only encourage Saddam Hussein and weaken Europe's unity and solidarity."
"We in the European Union will only have any influence if we act jointly."
"There can be only one European approach."
"America's President Bush has promised the allies close consultation."
"We call on our American friends to share all the information they have with their European allies."
"The use of force can only be justified if all other means fail."
"The United Nations should have a monopoly when it comes to making decisions and taking action."
"Military means should only be used if all other means fail, but even in that case the following questions need to be answered."
"The first question is whether the coalition against terror that President Bush so impressively assembled after the events of 11 September will survive."
"The second question is what the plan for the Middle East is after that."
"I can only emphatically support what Commissioner Patten said when he told us that we need a peace plan between Israel and Palestine, we need a Palestinian state and an Israeli state that can peacefully coexist."
"The third question is what the consequences are."
"What consequences would military action have for our relations with the Arab and Islamic world, with whom we want to coexist in partnership and - if possible - in friendship?"
"I know just how important an answer to this question is at the moment, because I have just visited Saudi Arabia, Dubai and Qatar."
"These questions need to be answered, and on all of them we need to establish a joint position with the United States."
"People are also wrestling with these questions in America - it is not as if there is only the position of Vice-President Cheney and the position of the Secretary of Defence, Mr Rumsfeld, there is also the position of the Secretary of State, Colin Powell, the position of the former Secretary of State, James Baker, and that of the former Security Advisor to the President's father, Brent Scowcroft."
"That is why there is absolutely no reason for anti-Americanism in this debate, because exactly the same debate is going on in America as here in Europe."
"What is important is for the United States and the European Union ultimately to establish a joint position."
"I want to request and call upon our American friends to resist the temptation of unilateralism and not to act alone."
"This does not just relate to Iraq, it also relates to how we deal with the International Criminal Court."
"I also call on all parties, on all the governments of the European Union, not to take unilateral action, but to follow the lead of the European Union as a whole."
"I also call on our American friends to consistently act in unison with Europe on other issues, such as Kyoto, just as in the present case with Iraq."
"I have the impression that our American friends see their relations with Europe more in terms of their bilateral relations with France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy and other states, than in terms of seeing the European Union as a single entity."
"President Bush made an important speech to the Bundestag in Berlin."
"We can agree with nearly everything he said, but he did not mention the concept of the European Union once in that speech!"
"That demonstrates how important it is to strengthen our dialogue with the US Government."
"I would very much welcome it if in the foreseeable future we could also invite the US President to address this House, because if my memory serves me correctly, the last US President to address the European Parliament was President Reagan in 1986."
"All these things would help to strengthen our relations with America, with our American partners and friends."
"We need to step up our dialogue with America."
"We need to act together to avert the threats posed by Saddam Hussein, and above all we in Europe, the Member States of the European Union, and the European Union itself need to act together and in unison."
"I say that because if we are not united, Europe cannot hope to have any influence."
"That is why the top priority is for us to act jointly on the world stage through the European Union."
"(Applause from the right)"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen. Mr Haarder, I was going to congratulate you on your application of the Spartan rules of European Parliament terseness as a representative of the Council, but you have taken them to the extreme by omitting to tell us what happened in Elsinore."
"Allow me, therefore, to ask you what Mr Patten asked the Members of this Parliament: is the Council unanimous?"
"Do you agree with the account of the Elsinore meeting given by the Vice-President of the Commission?"
"These questions are very important for this debate."
"I say this because we have observed a verbal escalation on the part of the President of the United States over the summer, which, on this highly sensitive subject, comprises obvious risks."
"I think we need to distinguish between two subjects: one is our judgment of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq."
"There is no defence for this cruel, tyrannical dictatorship, which does not hesitate to use genocide against its own people, through the suppression of both individuals and groups."
"We must also, however, take account of something else."
"You mentioned long-term sanctions."
"These are counterproductive."
"Similarly, we must take into account that we in Europe have managed to overcome the nationalism that did us so much harm in the past."
"Here, too, President Mitterrand used to say that nationalism is war."
"We Europeans have overcome it, but the Arab world is in a different cultural dimension, and nationalist sentiment, pride and confrontation, where necessary, make sense."
"We must therefore pay close attention to what President Mubarak said, which is that unilateral intervention without the support of the United Nations would certainly have a devastating effect throughout the Middle East."
"Our progress in resolving the conflict is therefore extremely important and there I believe the Danish Presidency has made an important proposal with regard to the creation of the Palestinian State."
"It would be useful if the Presidency explained this to us."
"We must take this into careful consideration if we are to avoid being accused of applying double standards in this situation."
"With regard to the philosophy of the current American Government, I believe that Bush junior should pay greater attention to what his father did 10 years ago, for one reason: President Bush senior achieved a very broad coalition and acted in accordance with the United Nations mandate."
"I am not going to talk about the debate underway in the United States, but it is odd, and it has already been said, that here civilians seem for the first time to be launching a military coup against the military forces, since those who have had military responsibilities, including in this field, are the most cautious when it comes to dealing with this issue."
"Let us hope that all this remains a purely verbal escalation."
"With regard to our relations with the United States, I think it would be useful for President Bush to come here, but we must also talk to the US Congress. About this, about the International Criminal Court and compliance with the application of WTO Panel decisions and resolutions on such important subjects as the Foreign Sales Act."
"Although these are not the subjects of today's debate, it is important for us to talk to the US Congress, as our interlocutor."
"On the subject of Iraq - and I am anxious to hear your explanations - my group endorse the position voted by Parliament on 16 May 2002, four days before the Council adopted it."
"We think that peace and stability in the region, in a region as fraught as the Middle East, can only be ensured within the framework of the United Nations."
"I hope your explanation on the position reached at Elsinore will be along these lines."
"We think it is very important to maintain humanitarian aid and we hope that the United Nations, under the leadership of Kofi Annan, will be able to make Iraq comply with its international agreements and allow inspectors back into the country."
"We believe this is the best way forward."
"Mr President, Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein poses a real threat."
"He has used weapons of mass destruction in the past to oppress his own people and in seeking to draw Israel into a wider Middle East war."
"The international community has a responsibility to stop Iraq developing weapons of mass destruction."
"Yet the consequences of war are potentially so serious that, for my group, it should be only a last resort."
"Avoiding war does not mean letting Saddam Hussein off the hook."
"Those who urge America not to launch a pre-emptive strike against Iraq are not appeasers, as Donald Rumsfeld implies when he compares George W. Bush to Winston Churchill."
"To my mind that comparison is more absurd than Dan Quayle comparing himself to John F. Kennedy."
"If I may paraphrase Senator Lloyd Benson I would say 'Donald, George W. Bush ain't no Winston Churchill'!"
"The real lesson of history is this: Churchill correctly identified the Nazi threat at an early stage but when he acted it was not unilaterally and pre-emptively."
"He drew a line in the sand."
"He acted with moral authority and international backing when that line was crossed."
"Churchill did not bomb Berlin and try to overthrow the Nazi regime based on his suspicions of Hitler; he acted in concert with his allies when it was clear that he had right on his side."
"For the ELDR Group the issue today is about getting United Nations weapons inspectors back into Iraq, not about George W. Bush settling an old family score with Saddam Hussein."
"The Iraqi Government must comply with UN resolutions and must let weapons inspectors back in unconditionally."
"Once in, those inspectors must be allowed to go wherever they want, whenever they want."
"Only if Iraq refuses to readmit inspectors, if it unreasonably obstructs their work or if those inspectors find evidence of Iraq developing weapons of mass destruction would the international community be justified in taking further action."
"European governments must make clear their support for UN-backed military action in those circumstances."
"If it comes to war it must be the international community that acts together, not the United States unilaterally."
"A UN resolution needs to be approved setting a deadline for Iraqi compliance."
"A broad international coalition must be built and must include Arab countries if we are to convince world opinion that we are not seeking a clash of civilisations."
"Frankly, as the Commissioner said, our task would be a lot easier if the US showed the same focus on resolving the crisis in the Middle East, as it does on removing Saddam Hussein."
"We also need to think seriously about how to rebuild stability in the region after any strike."
"The international coalition, including America, must commit resources to nation-building."
"Unless we rebuild its economy and society and help to develop viable political institutions, an Iraq devastated by war would risk imploding and posing an even greater danger to the stability of the region."
"We cannot postpone the debate much longer by claiming that no decisions are imminent."
"I would say this to the President-in-Office of the Council: Mr Haarder, it is no good saying the European Union's position is clear while referring to a statement of 20 May."
"The Union's position is as clear as mud."
"If it were clear, Ambassador Burghardt in Washington would not lament how Member States are jealously guarding their own access to the American Administration rather than acting as a common front."
"Just as at the UN Summit in Johannesburg, the European Union will have influence only if it acts as a United States of Europe."
"That is your job."
"Consensus needs to be built about how to tackle the threat, evidence of weapons of mass destruction needs to be published and - most importantly of all - any strike needs to be backed by international law and the moral authority of the international community."
"The world cannot afford the instability which would come from a unilateral and pre-emptive military adventure in Iraq."
"Mr President, I am sure we all agree that the regime governing Iraq is without a doubt dictatorial, that it tramples all over human rights, and that in the past it has waged criminal wars using chemical weapons against Iran and Kuwait, and even against its own people."
"Mr Haarder, I find it rather striking and not just an academic question that just now you only mentioned the war against Kuwait."
"Why did you not mention that war against Iran, which involved a far greater number of deaths?"
"I think the answer is obvious: the war against Iran was a war which at the time suited the West very well."
"It was the West that armed Hussein and even paved the way for him to have chemical weapons."
"The war against Kuwait was fought for this dictator's own reasons."
"If I say that this is not an academic issue, I say that that because we are seeking difficult answers in a very, very complicated situation."
"If we want to get to the roots of war and aggression we need to ask ourselves how such situations arise in the first place."
"There is also another point of view."
"Hussein is an unsavoury dictator whose military position has now been clearly undermined."
"There is very little to choose between him and some of our allies in the war on terror."
"In Iran we have a regime that uses torture and has nuclear arms, and a nuclear arms strategy little different from that of the United States. Quite remarkable!"
"Last week President Bush was virtually paying court to Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the representative of one of the most reactionary regimes on this planet."
"Surely it weakens the credibility of our human rights policy and of our security policy if such people are our allies?"
"I anticipate that my group will conclude that anyone who really wants to guarantee democracy, human rights and security cannot call for a war to secure them, and can certainly not indulge in hypocritical power politics that demonstrate the absurdity of our stated objectives."
"That is the key issue for my group."
"We are unreservedly against this war, come what may."
"However, I welcome the fact that - whatever the underlying motives may be - there has been very wide-ranging criticism indeed in this House of these preparations for war."
"That is far more important."
"With regard to the most recent Council of Foreign Ministers, I would like to say that I have come to respect you very much here in this Parliament, but what I have heard from you today demonstrates to me that you are totally trapped in your current position."
"That is unsatisfactory as far as I am concerned."
"I believe that a common European policy in this area would be valuable in its own right in view of the dangers of the present situation."
"I agree with Mr Poettering on that - a policy of this kind is urgently needed."
"But where is it?"
"I believe that we are facing a serious crisis as regards the Common Foreign and Security Policy in what is a vitally important international relations situation."
"However, this community of interest cannot just be arbitrary."
"I think that it involves alternatives to the US approach, to a unilateralism that I find ever more threatening, and which I think is in any case counterproductive for the United States."
"So, as far as I am concerned, putting forward an alternative is anything but anti-American."
"We believe not only that this war should be unreservedly rejected but also that the inhumane and politically counterproductive embargo should be lifted, with the exception of arms exports, so that Iraq's exclusion from democratic development can be lessened."
"Thirdly, the UN inspectors should go back, but on the basis of the existing mandate."
"My fourth point is that we need multilateral cooperative relations and not unilateralism."
"And my fifth point is that we finally need to return to disarmament."
"You cannot say that you are willing to go to war to force others to disarm and at the same time rearm yourself without expecting weapons of mass destruction to proliferate."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nobody has come here this morning to support the regime of Saddam Hussein, and I do not believe there is any point dwelling on the noxious aspects of this regime."
"Personally, I would like to take up two or three points from this morning's debate and I would like to make a point of my own."
"Firstly, I will make my point: common foreign and security policy does not exist at European Union level and, for the moment, we have little or no influence."
"For the time being, only the governments of the European Union are in a position to intervene in order to try to make the United States see sense."
"I notice, however, and I am not alone, that there is currently no unanimity."
"I note in particular that the United Kingdom is systematically aligning itself with the United States, which consequently considerably undermines any initiatives we might be called upon to take."
"Secondly, I will take up the points from this morning."
"I would first like to mention what Commissioner Patten said, which is that if we wish to avoid potential disaster, it is absolutely crucial to promote a very broad alliance so that action by the United States could only be taken within the framework of the decisions of the United Nations and the Security Council."
"Secondly, it is vital to try to acknowledge and take account of the position of Arab countries."
"The United States does not know a great deal about Muslim countries and Muslim reactions, and our fellow Member Mr Barón Crespo reminded us, just a moment ago, of what Mr Mubarak said."
"There is no doubt that unilateral action determined by the United States, outside the framework of the decisions of the United Nations Security Council, with complete disregard for the domestic situation of Arab countries, would lead to disaster."
"President Mubarak said himself, and I believe he is right, that in this situation, no Arab state leaders would be able to contain the outburst of feeling in their own countries."
"It is obvious that we in Europe are directly affected by what could happen."
"I would like to add another point: if you still doubt the will of the United States to take action, just watch CNN and you will be transfixed, because the people of the United States are being systematically conditioned everyday."
"I believe that the decision to take action has been made."
"It is therefore high time the governments of the European Union did something to make the United States see sense, otherwise we will face unimaginable and potentially tragic consequences."
"(Applause from the right)"
"Mr President, one of our objectives is certainly to prevent war, to do everything possible to ensure that war is avoided, but the problem is not just defining our position for or against a possible armed intervention: the problem is seeing what Europe, the European Union, can do not just to try and avoid armed conflict but to try and stop the massacre of the Iraqi people by the dictator, Saddam Hussein, too, to do everything in its power to stop what is, in all probability, Saddam Hussein's build-up towards the development of weapons of mass destruction, with the genuine possibility, the real danger that these weapons will be used."
"This is a danger against which the United States, under the Bush administration, has decided to take a stand, adopting a position which, although erroneous , is quite clear, quite cut and dried."
"If there are alternatives - and we must do everything in our power to ensure that there are - they must be developed vigorously and resolutely."
"In other words, Europe, the European Union, must be the vehicle, the place, the centre where alternatives to conflict are developed: the alternatives of international law, the alternatives of the UN, the alternatives provided by what is known as multilateralism."
"These alternatives must be developed with determination and must not be a smokescreen to hide ambiguities or conceal a policy which is directly or indirectly benefiting Saddam Hussein."
"As the European Union, as the Union which has fought so hard to set up the International Criminal Court and other instruments imposing and promoting the rule of law and democracy, we must, of course, think back to Churchill's Europe and consider what has been said in this Chamber today, but we must also make every endeavour to prevent Europe regressing to the situation under Chamberlain."
"Mr President, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein is a villain who has committed atrocities against his own and the Kurdish people. There is no doubt that we can well do without leaders such as Saddam Hussein."
"It is worth remembering, however, who it was who helped promote him to high office. It was the same country which now wants to take the lead in bringing him down, namely the United States."
"Yesterday's friends are tomorrow's enemies."
"How long is this to continue?"
"In the fight against terrorism, we have now become friends with the mullahs of Iran who still to this very day permit the stoning of women."
"We are friends with the House of Saud, where democracy is a completely unknown concept."
"These are today's friends. Are they also tomorrow's enemies, however?"
"What would be the consequences of a possible attack on Iraq?"
"I know that the American Congress has discussed this in detail, but where is the discussion in Parliament not only of our views and opinions concerning the United States and Saddam Hussein but also of the consequences for the whole region of a possible attack upon Iraq?"
"It is already a very unstable area we are talking about."
"I think the European Parliament should be involved in getting such an inquiry under way."
"Moreover, I should like to ask whether there is agreement in the Council on the policy in relation to Iraq. I should like to know, for example, whether the Danish Presidency is sticking to its own traditional policy, to the effect that we do not say anything until we are asked, irrespective of the fact that the Danish Defence Minister is of the view that we should ideally attack Iraq right now."
"Is the Danish Presidency in favour of a common policy on this issue?"
"Is there agreement about the policy, and does this include demands for a UN mandate and for clear evidence of Saddam Hussein's possible involvement in the attack on the World Trade Centre or collaboration with al-Qa'ida?"
"Mr President, first of all I welcome this debate this morning."
"It has come at an opportune time."
"To a large extent the problem we face in Iraq is the unfinished business of the Gulf War."
"We have to recognise that before we begin."
"Mr Watson referred to the previous President Bush and the fact that to some extent the most recent President Bush maybe hopes to resolve some of his father's failures."
"The truth is, and we have got to face it, Saddam Hussein has effectively made fools out of the international community ever since that time."
"Time and time again he has led them forward by the nose and time and time again they have allowed him to get away with it."
"Yes, the United Nations has done sterling work but with no success for weapons inspection to date."
"I welcome Mr Blair's statement this morning, whatever it means."
"No doubt he will not be able to tell us everything but perhaps he could throw some light on the situation."
"The weapons of mass destruction must be destroyed to protect the free world."
"Yes, Saddam Hussein has ruled Iraq with an iron fist, he is an evil dictator."
"We must ensure that Iraq is approached in a multilateral way."
"There must be no unilateral approach."
"I believe there must be a wide-ranging international coalition supported by the United Nations resolution."
"This is not a resolution for doing nothing, as many Americans would say, but assures widespread support for that action and much of it has been outlined here this morning."
"We must engage Congress as Mr Barón Crespo said, but I have to tell this House in my experience Congress is thinking of the November 5 elections and is not all that much engaged or wanting to engage in discussions with the European Parliament."
"However, we in the European Union must be central to this."
"Mr President, we seem to be very much in agreement on this score."
"Saddam Hussein's regime, which we all regard as dictatorial, is being denounced by the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Party of European Socialists alike."
"For the past 23 years, he has systematically killed his own people and the leaders of his Stalinist regime."
"Moreover, we denounce the US's unilateral action as well."
"In addition, we have noticed that Europe is still not speaking with one voice to a sufficient degree."
"We would, in fact, urge the Council to take an active part in this debate in the United States now, because it is clear that there are different currents in the US."
"What we could do with right now is a display of commitment to the United States that is not anti-America but pro-America by taking part in that debate now."
"But that requires that we speak with one voice and take a clear stand."
"I would like to say to the Security Council that this is not, therefore, a licence to launch into unilateral action."
"We need the UN Security Council if we want to exert pressure on Iraq to reinstate the weapons inspections."
"This also means that if we ultimately want to act and threaten with violence, we must have proof."
"This proof must be clear and public."
"This also means that we must at the same time be prepared to act smartly."
"Mr Lagendijk of the Group of the Greens used the term 'smart sanctions' which are, of course, a reality."
"By using them, we can hit Iraq and its leadership harder and help the population at the same time."
"What Commissioner Patten said here this morning is crucial."
"It could be very detrimental if we unilaterally adopted the same stance in the Middle East, but we can also use this stance to enlist support for a new peace initiative along with the US."
"It is essential that the Council take action in order to decide on the two-state solution."
"Peace in the Middle East now, by addressing the issue of Palestine and Israel, is the key."
"There is a real downside, of which President Mubarak has warned us, in fact, namely that we may head in the wrong direction."
"Europe is playing a pivotal role."
"Instead of neglecting this role, we must take action now."
"I would ask for your support in this."
"Mr President, yesterday, our group held an extensive debate on the situation in Iraq in the presence of the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mrs Ana De Palacio."
"It was striking how unanimous our group was, and Mr Hans-Gert Poettering's outline fits in perfectly with this debate."
"I should like to underline three points."
"We have established that Saddam Hussein is without a doubt one of the most dangerous people of our time, with his chemical and biological weapons, which apparently he is also willing to use."
"After all, he did exactly that against his own people."
"We have also established that if an intervention proves necessary - but a number of conditions will need to be met first - this can never be done without UN support."
"This is truly what our group unanimously believes."
"Thirdly - and this is an appeal to the Commissioner and the Minister - Europe must speak with one voice and must join forces."
"If this ever proved necessary, then surely now is the time."
"I also have a few questions that relate to what Mr Van den Berg said a moment ago."
"It appears that Europe does not have all the information that the Americans have."
"In my view, if Europe is to receive support and resources, it is extremely important for all this information to be available, particularly also to the political forums and parliaments."
"My second point is one of concern."
"In all the comments that we make in this matter, we should also consider the situation of Israel."
"If we treat the entire Arab World in the same way, this could rebound on Israel in a big way."
"We must therefore, as a matter of key importance, also get the Arab world behind us in this matter."
"Finally, a strategy must be developed in order to boost support in Europe, for not all citizens, by a long chalk, are convinced of the need for intervention."
"For this strategy, we need a European plan, and I think that Mr Patten and the Minister will need to play an important role in this."
"Mr President, we run the risk today of fiddling while Rome burns."
"At any moment the current low-intensity aerial defence of southern and northern Iraq - which has been carried out at considerable personal risk by pilots from the USA, originally from France, and also from the UK, to whom I pay tribute as they have saved countless lives - may be stepped up to considerably heavier military action, which I believe will have support from a wide number of countries which are at present silent about their opinions."
"The EU voice must be heard."
"We must no longer stand on the sidelines, wringing our hands and repeating like a hopeless prayer 'Iraq must comply with UN conventions and the weapons inspectors must go in' because this leopard will not change his spots."
"We have ample evidence of the use of weapons of mass destruction."
"I have first-hand personal evidence of the use of such weapons: chemical warfare against the southern Iraqi people in the late 1990s."
"I have talked to the victims who stumbled choking from clouds of yellow smoke that must have been mustard gas."
"We have evidence first hand of the destruction of the environment, the water, the degradation of life in the marshes of the deep south, for example."
"We talk in Johannesburg about the need to bring water to millions more people, yet we have allowed Saddam Hussein to take away the water from over half a million Iraqi people."
"We have stood silent."
"We have first-hand evidence of that."
"We have been overflying the south since 1994."
"On human rights and genocide: as Max van der Stoel said when he was human rights reporter on Iraq for the United Nations: 'Genocide has been carried out against the Marsh Arabs and the Iraqi people'."
"We have evidence of that;"
"I personally have had evidence at first hand."
"On weapons of mass destruction: surely our quarrel is not precisely about having weapons of mass destruction - quite a number of countries sadly have such weapons - it is what you do with them that counts."
"We have the continuing threats of Saddam Hussein to invade Kuwait and Iran."
"I have seen the mined borders and the tanks just over the borders from Iran."
"We have that evidence available."
"What can we do?"
"We can set up the Office of Inquiry for Human Rights Violations that was recommended in our report, which the Commissioner so kindly referred to just now."
"We had a full house - an 85% majority for the vote on that report."
"I call upon the Commissioner and the Council of Ministers to set up that office today."
"(Applause from the centre and the right)"
"Mr President, because time is short I will start by saying what we need to do."
"In the first instance we need to engage with the United States at every level. We need to engage with the Americans on a country-to-country, a union-to-union, a party-to-party, a committee-to-committee basis, at whatever level we can, not only in relation to Iraq, but in relation to the extremely dangerous unilateralist philosophy they are currently developing in regard to so many areas of world concern."
"We should not ignore the fact that the current attempt to undermine the International Criminal Court has implications far wider than simply excluding American forces engaged in international conflicts."
"It is a direct challenge to the European Union and is part of the attempt by the United States to establish superiority in every region throughout the world."
"The only response that the European Union and its Member States can make to this and to the current attempts by the United States to generate a war psychology in relation to Iraq is to stand together."
"I know it is difficult and there are differences between the Member States on this, but there is a much wider concern for the future which has to be borne in mind."
"I was quite impressed by the Commissioner's speech in which he identified the need for reform of our international law in relation to how, when and who should intervene in other states."
"It is a matter which is coming to the fore more and more, particularly now that the Cold War is over and the dust is settling."
"However, as far as our experience with the International Criminal Court is concerned, it is not yet opportune to start dismantling the current protections that exist under the United Nations Charter."
"Mr President, Mr De Rossa can talk about United States unilateralism; perhaps we should better refer to the United States shouldering responsibilities which are ignored by others."
"What a pity it is that other countries have not joined in enforcing the no-fly zone over Iraq over the last ten years, something which has been referred to already."
"Responsibility has been borne by the United States, by the United Kingdom and in the early days by France."
"This is the sort of allied coming together that we should be seeing."
"It seems to me that there is too much speculation about the nature of some sort of attack on Iraq while our concern should really be the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's regime being in possession of weapons of mass destruction."
"It would be a dereliction of duty by any of our governments if they were aware of a threat to our security and chose to do nothing about it."
"We must take effective action against Iraq and it is most important that we show allied solidarity."
"Perceptions are absolutely vital here and it would be fatal if Saddam Hussein misread the intentions of the West, of the European Union and of other allies and if he thought that he was able to create divisions among those allies."
"We must send a very strong signal to Saddam Hussein that we stand together on this."
"This is a signal of solidarity."
"If there are any differences among allies it is time for those differences to be sorted out behind closed doors and not in public discussion."
"We need to send the right message."
"We started to misread the intentions of Saddam Hussein in early 1990."
"We almost made a mistake then."
"We regarded him as a rational man, we rather thought that he would not invade Kuwait at that time."
"In fact he is an irrational leader in control of very dangerous weapons."
"We must show the solidarity to take the necessary action to remove those weapons from his hands."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject we are discussing can basically be reduced to two different concepts."
"Can we respond to international threats by using international law and the mechanisms it provides?"
"Even if these mechanisms are in need of reform, as Commissioner Patten has said, they still exist and they could be implemented in their present form."
"We believe that when it comes to dealing with international threats from states like Iraq - and there is no need for me to repeat what kind of threats we could be talking about - the only way to implement international law is through the United Nations."
"The alternative is to respond to these threats on a unilateral basis, which is the approach currently being adopted by the US."
"Mr Poettering is quite right in saying that there is an urgent need for this process to be completed, because there is also an internal debate, although a consensus is evidently starting to emerge around President Bush."
"The question that needs to be answered next is where Europe stands on this."
"The answer is that we do not support unilateralism, as we have already heard, as Commissioner Patten asked how we could stabilise the international coalition against terror."
"We will certainly not stabilise it if the United States undermines it by adopting a unilateral approach."
"That is where there is a really great danger, because what we are actually fighting - and I would like to remind Mr Van Orden that Mr Brie has already referred to this - is the Iraqi Government, which has been so heavily criticised here, yet where did they get the technology that has enabled them to constitute such an enormous threat today?"
"From the United States - in the days when Iraq was still an ally in the battle against Islamic fundamentalism in Iran, which also demonstrates that the governing Baath Party in Iraq is not an Islamic fundamentalist party."
"We all know that the Muslim Brotherhoods that are persecuted in Iraq have been granted political asylum in Europe."
"I only wanted to remind you about that to make it clear how complicated and dangerous unilateralism is in practice."
"That is why, Mr Van Orden, we in Europe are united in saying 'no' to unilateralism and 'yes' to the implementation of international law."
"Mr President, Commissioner Patten, as you said, we have a consensus and a desire in this House to prevent the crisis that is looming, a crisis that has been triggered by the actions of Saddam Hussein."
"I would like to say to Mr Barón Crespo that no one knows better than the armed forces, both here and in the United States, that the use of force to prevent this crisis can never be clean."
"There is no such thing as a clean war."
"Despite progress in technology, man does not yet have the means to kill all evil people at the touch of a button, if only because it is impossible to separate the good people from the bad."
"In these circumstances, war or the use of armed force may be a lesser evil."
"In that case, all political and diplomatic avenues must have been thoroughly explored with a view to achieving the political objective otherwise to be pursued through the use of such force."
"That is why we fully endorse the Union's current approach which is to maintain pressure on Saddam Hussein to allow weapons inspectors to return to do their work."
"Secondly, if this decision is taken, it must have a chance of achieving its aim, yet it has been made very clear to us that the objective now is to overturn the regime of Saddam Hussein."
"There are two questions being raised here. The first concerns the assessment of the threat."
"Mr Poettering and Mrs Maij-Weggen emphasised that we are eagerly awaiting the details promised by the British Prime Minister, which should arrive in the next few minutes."
"Commissioner Patten said in his speech that he doubted whether any evidence at all would be available. It is very important that we have this evidence."
"Secondly, we must have a chance of winning."
"In Afghanistan, we were sure that the Afghan people themselves were ready to bring down the Taliban regime."
"Is there any chance, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that the Iraqi people will help, in the event of military action, to topple the regime?"
"That is a genuine question."
"Mr President, much has been said of the evil and immoral behaviour of Saddam Hussein and rightly so, but I want to focus on the European Union and indeed on one Member State in particular, my own, the United Kingdom."
"Mr Blair made it clear yesterday that he will support the US in a war on Iraq, without waiting until other options have been explored and without seeking a fresh UN Security Council resolution."
"In a press conference yesterday, he implicitly backed the principle of pre-emptive action on Iraq, saying that the simple restoration of weapons inspectors into Iraq may not be sufficient to avert war."
"We cannot enforce international law by breaking international law."
"A war on Iraq in these circumstances would be immoral, illegal, dangerous and wrong."
"Much has been said about the importance of the EU having a common front and a common voice and I agree with that."
"In that case I urge the Commission, the Council and all other EU Heads of State to do all they can to help us restrain their fellow EU Member State."
"Mr President, UN Resolution 678 and the 1991 US Congressional resolution predicated the whole Gulf War ceasefire agreement on the undertaking that Iraq would dispose of all weapons of mass destruction, but instead UNSCOM inspectors were expelled accused of being American spies."
"Saddam Hussein still possesses huge quantities of biological and chemical weapons and three years ago he attempted to buy weapons-grade uranium from Serbia."
"He has been negotiating with North Korea to acquire ballistic missile technology."
"Therefore he clearly poses a global threat to oil supplies, and, were he to become a nuclear power, could hold the whole world to ransom."
"Let us also be morally consistent."
"Nobody in this House asked for UN resolutions to attack Milosevic's Serbia, and human rights violations alone were deemed sufficient."
"Surely Saddam Hussein's violations of the rights of the Kurds whom he has gassed, the Marsh Arabs and the Shias whom he has tortured and killed, and the Israelis, where he has paid the families of suicide bombers to kill innocent victims, are much worse than any of Milosevic's crimes, - not to mention the British and the Americans whom he has sworn revenge against for our participation in the Gulf War."
"I remain sceptical about neighbouring countries' concerns about military intervention, as some fear democracy in Iraq and others giving the Kurds autonomy in the north."
"I welcome foreign minister de Palacio's support yesterday for the British and American position."
"I also hope that China and Russia will not veto any requests in the UN Security Council for further resolutions on this matter, should America so request."
"In the West, we should support our American allies' quest to complete the unfinished business of ridding the world of this extremely evil man."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, I would like to take the liberty of making a personal comment, because I have worked with you for a very long time and because I have always very much appreciated the open and honest way in which you have expressed your views."
"It seems to me that in the course of the ten-metre journey from here to where you are sitting now you have been struck dumb."
"You have not told us what happened in Elsinore, but instead you repeated what the Spanish Presidency achieved in this area in May."
"I suppose that is better than nothing."
"I would like to comment on Commissioner Patten's two questions."
"I can assure you, Mr Patten, that we are all in favour of observing UN resolutions."
"However, the United Nations is not an organisation where you can pick and choose - we have to comply with the United Nations Charter and we also have to comply with international law."
"The United Nations Charter stipulates the cases in which military means are possible and permissible, and the procedure is also laid down."
"The UN Charter does not make any provision for a pre-emptive war or for a war to remove an undesirable government, and we cannot ignore that."
"Anyone who wages such a war in spite of this is himself an aggressor and is himself in breach of international law."
"The second question was about the broad coalition."
"On that point, I can assure you that that should in fact be the European Union's sole objective."
"But we are not the ones who have split the broad coalition; no, it has been undermined by American unilateralism."
"My question to you is: how can we re-establish this unity, this broad coalition?"
"Mr President, Saddam Hussein is evil."
"His regime is evil."
"His deeds are evil."
"We have seen what he can do to his people, and we fear what he might do to the wider world."
"He is totally defying the international community."
"As Commissioner Patten said, the world would be a much better place without Saddam Hussein and with a different regime in Iraq."
"Achieving this, however, is easier said than done."
"Furthermore, it is fraught with enormous complications and very, very great risks."
"Even the Pentagon has reservations about a possible attack."
"We must, of course, use all diplomatic and political means in order to get Saddam Hussein to comply with UN resolutions and allow the inspectors in and in order to solve this issue."
"There must of course be evidence, to which we all have access, of the existence of weapons of mass destruction and possible collaboration with al-Qa'ida."
"The EU must, naturally, stick together and insist that any attack must be subject to a UN Security Council decision."
"What happens, however, if we fail to find a political and diplomatic solution, if Saddam Hussein continues to defy the international community, if we do obtain proof, and if we manage to get a common decision in the Security Council?"
"What discussions have been taking place in the Council?"
"What forward planning has there been?"
"I do not mean military planning. Rather, I am wondering what preparations have been made to support the forces of democracy, the Iraqi opposition and the Kurds in northern Iraq and to look after our relations with the wider world."
"I am absolutely convinced that these issues were discussed in Elsinore, and I would therefore be grateful if the President-in-Office of the Council could say something about them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if the British and the Americans want to wage war on regimes which do not respect human rights, they certainly have their work cut out for them."
"If they wish to wage war on undemocratic regimes in the Middle East, they must wage war on Saudi Arabia."
"If they wish to wage war on regimes which do not respect the United Nations' resolutions, they must wage war on Israel."
"If they wish to wage war on countries which have acquired weapons of mass destruction, they must wage war on India, Pakistan, China and North Korea, which have - of this we are certain - atomic weapons."
"If they wish to wage war on countries which serve as a breeding ground for terrorists, they must destroy London and Hamburg."
"This is the reality of the situation."
"I am obviously being ironic, because the reason for this military action is clearly not Saddam Hussein's regime, which is an authoritarian regime, of course, but also a secular regime which respects the right of Christians and of women."
"This military action is about weapons of mass destruction."
"So far, we have not yet been given any evidence whatsoever that they exist in a country that is dying on its feet, where light bulbs can no longer be found, where there is no lead for schoolchildren's pencils because these are made of graphite and where even a number of UN observers condemned the role that they were being made to play."
"I shall end with an anecdote: three years ago, my brother, a Catholic priest, visited Iraq."
"Whilst there, he was almost killed by a bomb and, in truth, he does not know if this was an American or British bomb."
"One might well ask which international law allows Iraq - which, it is true, was defeated and which, as a result of its defeat, agreed to visits by UN inspectors for many years - to be bombed on a daily basis and to continue to suffer from sanctions."
"Mr President, there are two extremely sensitive issues of concern to the public of the Arab countries, including what are known as the moderate Arab countries, and they are the Palestinian issue and the impact of the embargo on Iraq."
"It is the international community, not the dictator, which will be blamed for the impact of the embargo on Iraq, we must be quite clear about that."
"I do not feel there is any division here, as has already been said, as regards condemnation of Saddam Hussein and his regime."
"However, the repeated announcements of unilateral action by the United States - which were not the invention of the international press but have been repeated on several occasions by the President himself - are having two, extremely negative consequences: on the one hand, the interests and fate of the dictator are becoming linked to those of his people once again - you saw, even yesterday, Saddam Hussein's declarations, 'we will resist, we will win' - and, on the other, there is a build up of opposition to this action."
"I therefore believe that the European Union must pursue the path of international law, the path of the United Nations, resolutely, and that a much, much clearer link must be established between the readmission of the UNSCOM and the end of the embargo on the Iraqi people, for this will enable us to start to dialogue with the people of Iraq."
"Otherwise it will be extremely difficult to make any impact on Saddam Hussein."
"Moreover, the West's task is hardly to replace Saddam with an ayatollah, for example."
"We must introduce democracy into this and other Arab countries, and I believe that, if Europe genuinely believes in this position and is united, then it will be able to make a contribution."
"Mr President, a speaker on the left side of the Chamber said that we must oblige the United States to act in accordance with Europe."
"I believe it is naïve to believe that we can put the United States under an obligation."
"The United States does not act in order to achieve world domination. It acts only because we are exposed to the threat of a development worse than war."
"If Europe cannot decide, the United States will hopefully act alone."
"It is as if we have forgotten that it was the United States that rescued Europe in the First and Second World Wars and that saved us from Communist takeover."
"It is naïve to believe that the United States would act without evidence."
"The United States would not make large sacrifices if there were less risky alternatives."
"Prime Minister Tony Blair stated clearly yesterday that they had evidence."
"It is Tony Blair's and the United Kingdom's position we should emulate, and I would call upon the Presidency to work towards a situation in which the EU is united in rallying to the cause of combating dictatorship."
"We should not of course be infringing international law by toppling a vicious dictatorship which is threatening its own people and world security, and the approach based on the UN model has of course been fully tried and tested."
"The weapons inspectors were turfed out, so what is the point of bringing them back?"
"Saddam Hussein has been given every warning, but he is quite clearly unreceptive to our demands, and we are merely signalling our own weakness."
"Our duty towards the people of Europe is to stand shoulder to shoulder with the United States in this fight against a dictatorship that is threatening world security."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, the debate about the situation in Iraq and possible military intervention is of course also a debate about the nature of solidarity."
"When some Members of this House, Mr Van Orden and Mr Tannock, talk about solidarity, they chiefly mean solidarity with the United States."
"For me it chiefly means solidarity within Europe."
"That is why I am concerned that the United Kingdom, but also Spain and Italy, are going down a path that suggests that this solidarity could be undermined."
"What particularly concerns me is the yawning gap between the United States' and Europe's conceptions of international world order."
"The US seems to be increasingly drawn to a theory that international agreements and organisations have, as it were, a merely substitutional role."
"For the major powers at least, it seems that national sovereignty and a national view of the world have top priority."
"I have great difficulty with the US view that they can decide when to support an international organisation, be it 'just' the United Nations or the International Criminal Court, and when they themselves should act and when they can carry out pre-emptive strikes, and whereby they can define the danger and make decisions on deployment without consulting the international authorities."
"Lastly, I also have a big problem with the idea that the President of the United States can read a book over the summer that says that you should not trust the military, because the military will hesitate and always see the risk of failure, and that the sign of a true politician is that he distrusts the military."
"Given that the same author, Elliot Cohen, believes that we did not drop enough bombs on Yugoslavia, any country that listens to advisers like that really worries me."
"Mr President, I was not intending to speak but whilst listening to this debate, one cannot help but be struck by, if I may say so, the predominance of ignorance and powerlessness."
"As regards the predominance of ignorance, we know nothing or virtually nothing of the decisions which have been taken by the United States, of the specific information that they have and of their aims."
"What do they want to do with Iraq, what can they do with Iraq?"
"How can we resolve the problem with Iran on the one hand and with the Kurds on the other?"
"We know nothing."
"As for the predominance of powerlessness, which arises from the absolute division and the complete heterogeneity of opinions were expressed here."
"I also feel that we should reflect on the fact that we are not in the middle of a moral or sentimental debate, but a political debate."
"A political debate is based on two pillars: force and law, on the understanding that force must be subject to law and that there is a place where law must be exercised, and that is the United Nations."
"It is indeed premature, I feel, in view of the discussion which has just taken place, to think the European Union might have a seat at the United Nations, because one wonders what opinion it would express there."
"That said, there are members of the European Union that have a seat at the United Nations, and the European Union could perhaps reflect on finding a solution to the current debate."
"Clearly, the United Nations must be involved, clearly, the permanent members of the Security Council which belong to the European Union must adopt a position."
"Which position must they adopt?"
"Which mandate can be given to them, providing that a mandate is possible in this situation?"
"In any case, what position will the countries of the European Union - those that are also members of the UN Security Council - adopt if the latter is invoked?"
"This is the real question which, at the same time, sets out the limit of this debate."
"Mr President, preparations are under way for a war that could have devastating consequences for the population of the whole world ."
"For my part, I firmly believe that a country must be built on the rule of law, and this applies nationally and internationally."
"All countries must comply with international law, including Iraq and - lest we forget - the US."
"All countries must comply with this legislation, and they have no right to take liberties that are not provided for in legislation that has been enacted jointly."
"In answer to Commissioner Patten's question regarding the way forward, I believe the key issue is to bolster our relations with the Arab world and to get it to put pressure on Saddam Hussein."
"There must be a better alternative to making enemies for ourselves in the Arab world."
"Naturally we must demand that the weapons inspectors be allowed back unhindered."
"We want peace in the Middle East."
"We want a Palestinian State."
"That goes without saying."
"The sanctions currently in place against Iraq, and which have been in place for 12 years, have brought enormous suffering to the Iraqi people."
"According to the UN's own figures, one and a half million people, including 600 000 children, have died as a direct consequence."
"Moreover, the country has been subject to low intensity bombing for several years."
"This has strengthened Saddam Hussein's brutal dictatorship instead of weakening it."
"A war such as that currently being prepared will, of course, undermine world peace and security."
"The EU must therefore speak with one voice, and a strong one at that."
"It is the prerogative of the Iraqi people to establish their own democratic regime; this cannot be achieved with bombs."
"International law and the UN Charter must be respected, and the EU must state unequivocally that the international community has a duty to solve conflicts peacefully."
"'Yes' to weapons inspectors, but 'No' to war against Iraq!"
"That concludes the 'catch the eye' section of this debate."
"I thank all colleagues who have contributed and apologise to all those who have not been called, but it is in the nature of the 'catch the eye' procedure that we cannot take everyone in the time available."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the conclusions of the informal Elsinore Council were reasonable; it agreed to explore all avenues for a non-military solution to this problem, including sending in inspectors."
"However, for this to succeed, for example getting inspectors into Iraq, means Saddam Hussein honouring his obligations."
"That needs to be made crystal clear."
"We cannot allow him to act as judge and jury here."
"There needs to be broad agreement that Saddam Hussein must go."
"But this can only succeed if various viewpoints are taken on board."
"Unlike Mr Sakellariou, I believe that pre-emptive wars are acceptable."
"However, they are only acceptable if there is evidence of immediate danger and proof that there is a greater risk than without a pre-emptive war."
"Such evidence is not forthcoming at present and we can therefore see no justification for war."
"Nor has proper consideration been given to whether starting such a war and terminating Saddam Hussein's regime would not lead to changes in other parts of the Islamic world involving far greater risks than allowing Saddam Hussein to remain in power."
"Destroying the coalition against terror and establishing fundamentalist regimes in the 'moderate' Arab countries could have very negative consequences, particularly for us in Europe."
"This needs to be weighed in the balance if we wish to succeed."
"For example, we also need to consider what the direct consequences of such a military conflict would be for Iraq's minorities, given what Saddam Hussein has done to the Kurds or other population groups in the south of his country in given situations."
"This all needs to be taken into account in weighing up the situation."
"We Europeans, however, can only drive forward this process of weighing up the situation if we have a common view."
"That is a prerequisite."
"Neither Mr Blair's position on one side nor Mr Schröder's position on the other is very helpful in trying to reach such a common stance."
"I believe that the only way to stop the Americans going ahead unilaterally is by means of such a united approach."
"There is a debate raging about this even in America itself."
"If the US is aware that we in Europe are presenting a united front on this issue, it will be possible to get certain points accepted."
"Since 11 September, approaches have been adopted that may be understandable but are nevertheless dangerous."
"Since the events of 11 September, Article 5 of the NATO Treaty has been discussed but not implemented, because implementing it would have meant that we in Europe were involved in joint strategic planning and decision-making."
"So we Europeans have to ask ourselves this fundamental question: Can we position ourselves as partners and take part in the decision-making process, or we will just be ordered into action when the decision has been made and a war is imminent?"
"This also has fundamental implications for future transatlantic relations."
"Parliament should endeavour to support the Council and the Commission in pursuing this common policy approach, because that is the best way of both getting rid of Saddam Hussein and avoiding a war."
"Mr President, on the eve of the anniversary of 11 September, Europe must, more than ever, speak with a single voice and defend peace."
"Europe must firmly tell the world once again that the fight against terrorism, which it supports unreservedly, cannot involve war and that a so-called preventative war against Iraq would, on the contrary, sacrifice a nation, would cause unrest in the Middle East, and would have no guaranteed outcome."
"Europe is faced with an historic opportunity to speak with a single voice and to distance itself from the policy of the axis of evil that the United States is trying to impose whether we like it or not."
"In its report of 16 May on Iraq, the European Parliament called, in particular, for the UN to play a crucial role in seeking a regional, political and peaceful settlement, and for Europe to adopt a common position on the issue at last."
"These words have been almost completely disregarded."
"Once again, Europe is divided on which strategy it should follow."
"Baghdad is wavering over whether to open its doors to UNMOVIC inspectors and the Iraqi people are continuing to mourn the victims of an inhuman embargo which has failed to destabilise the regime of Saddam Hussein, whilst President Bush is mounting his crusade of good, blatantly breaching international law in doing so."
"What game are we playing?"
"That is why I shall avoid beating around the bush and ask the Commission and the Council the questions that are on everyone's lips today."
"What guarantees can Europe offer Iraq that the UNMOVIC inspections will be carried out fairly, that they will have a time limit and that they will ultimately lead to the lifting of economic sanctions?"
"In other words, that these inspections will not, as before the 1998 crisis, be infiltrated by US intelligence officers taking notes on locations to bomb in the future."
"Secondly, what guarantees can Europe give Baghdad that, once it has been proven that its arsenal has been dismantled or it has been verified that there are no weapons of mass destruction, America will not immediately attack, once they can see that the regime is not armed?"
"Although Europe is seeking to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, we all know that the United States want the regime overturned."
"Is this indeed Europe's mission to seek to overturn regimes?"
"There are certainly other regimes that we would like to see overturned!"
"Thirdly, what would Europe's reaction be if an attack against Iraq were carried out without the backing of the UN?"
"A war against Iraq would not be fair, appropriate, or effective."
"It would not be fair because, without the green light from the UN, it would be an affront to international law."
"It would not be clean because, as Mr Morillon has said, there is no such thing as a clean war, not to mention the fact that it would be an experimental war in new weapons, which would harm the Iraqi population."
"It would not be effective because, in terms of the fight against terrorism, and Afghanistan is proof of this, bombs are of no use."
"Osama bin Laden is still at large and Saddam Hussein will, in all probability, remain at large."
"That is why, when I hear Mr Van Orden speak I am afraid, as I was when I heard Mr Blair speak yesterday, I have just one message, based on the words of the Count of Auteroche at the battle of Fontenoy: if the English wish to support our American friends, they can fire first, but they cannot count on us to support them!"
"Mr President, I know that the President-in-Office, a highly respected former colleague in this House, will take back our views to the General Affairs Council."
"There may be no consensus among the Member States, but there is broad consensus in this House."
"Since the end of the Gulf War, our strategy has been one of containment and deterrence."
"To change that strategy, we need compelling evidence that our objectives in the regions would be better served by military strikes."
"Even with such evidence, military action should not be undertaken without clear and realistic political objectives and a commitment to finance and administer the necessary reconstruction."
"To win a war against terrorism in one country, you need broad consensus of support in that country."
"To win a war against terror across borders, we need to build a consensus across borders."
"The Council must unite, either to agree such objectives, to make such a commitment, to build such a consensus, or to rein in the declared ambitions of the United States."
"Mr President-in-Office, an opinion poll by the German Marshall Fund and the Council on Foreign Relations shows that two European citizens in three support the Union acting in this way."
"We in this debate are urging you to seize the initiative."
"Mr President, the truncated speech by Mr Haarder and the much longer statement by Mr Patten give us cause for concern, dismay and alarm, particularly after the British Prime Minister's warmongering in Sedgefield yesterday."
"It is evident that the unstated assumption by the European authorities - with the remarkable exception of the German Republic - is that war is, by now, a certainty."
"Never mind that there is no scrap of evidence that Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction, even nuclear weapons, never mind that Mr Blair has again postponed the publication of his own private dossier on the matter."
"There is no doubt that, as with Enron's creative accounting, the CIA are working on creative evidence."
"Confronted with such an imminent disaster for humankind, the Council and the Commission are taking the wrong - although expected - stand."
"As the French newspaper le Figaro puts it, 'confronted with American intransigence Europe excels again in its inclination to compromise'."
"Compromise in this case is offered by the figleaf of the United Nations, a figleaf that in this specific case covers much more than has been covered by UNSCOM and UNMOVIC."
"Unfettered, unconditional, intrusive access by United Nations inspectors, let us say Anglo-American inspectors, to every site in Iraq - something which Mr Rumsfeld himself expects to be rejected out of hand by the infamous Baghdad dictator."
"After that only one alternative: war."
"Unfortunately, what we have heard today from Mr Haarder and Commissioner Patten confirms our belief that there is a growing gap between the people of Europe and these governing bodies, a gap which this war will enlarge with deleterious consequences for the future of the Union."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that I served in the American Army in the 1950s, so I have a little knowledge of the horrors of war."
"I also want to say that George Orwell would find it difficult to create characters like Rumsfeld, Cheney and Ashcroft."
"It is very important to ask ourselves what precisely do we mean by weapons of mass destruction."
"Are we talking about Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Cambodia, or even Korea, where I served in the American Army?"
"What precisely is our definition, and what are they and where are they?"
"A unilateral attack on Iraq would be moral madness."
"The 22 million Iraqi people have already suffered enormous pain and loss."
"They are now threatened with a full-scale invasion by a so-called Christian power, resulting in countless dead."
"It will be seen for what it surely will be: a crusade by the West against Islam."
"We are told that Israel will use nuclear weapons in certain circumstances."
"Yet we have no evidence, as has been constantly repeated in this House this morning, that Iraq has weapons of the kind referred to by the hawks in the American Government."
"US Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, is proclaiming that Iraq is giving refuge to al-Qa'ida terrorists."
"Nobody but a fantasist would suggest such a thing."
"Another bombing of Iraq would be mass murder."
"The American Government talks about saving civilisation - a 200-year-old civilisation or a 5000-year-old civilisation?"
"One has to really ask the question: who is the American Government really out to save?"
"The American Government could be boosting the armaments or the oil industries at home or it could be geared towards the re-election prospects of President George Bush, à la Margaret Thatcher."
"We will certainly see a rise in Islamic fundamentalism and individual attacks on Western targets will continue unabated, even on a freelance basis, should this war take place."
"I urge the Iraqi regime to change course and allow UN inspectors to be readmitted to Iraq now."
"Finally, I ask the media to examine their conscience and ask: why now, why not then?"
"Mr President, one might wonder whether we are in Parliament or whether we are listening to continuous CNN propaganda."
"What has been said about Saddam Hussein could be said about countless other heads of State the world over."
"We are well aware, since we are the representatives of the nation States, that the Member States are, by nature, cold-hearted monsters, so cold-hearted that they only very rarely back down in the face of war, especially when seeing where they stand in the power stakes leads them to assume an imperial mindset, which is the case today of the United States which is fuelling potential conflict situations, throughout the world, in the simple, albeit acknowledged aim of achieving world domination."
"This is absolute madness, because let there be no doubt, it is not the United Nations that is waging war, it is the Empire."
"Imperialism equates to war."
"In order to prevent Member States engaging on this slippery slope, a few rules were drawn up through the ages, which, in the twentieth century, took on the name of collective security."
"Unfortunately, in the same way as the efforts of The Hague were scuppered in 1905 by the First World War, the efforts of the League of Nations were scuppered by the 'Imperial' and not the 'National'; the Imperial Hitler Socialism and, more specifically, its preventative wars, particularly in the Sudeten region."
"In 1948, we had to start again from scratch."
"That was the task of the UN founders and of the UN Charter, which now forms the backbone of any international order."
"In our book, war is banned."
"War is only permitted in specific cases, framed by stringent rules which assume, on the one hand, the support of the Security Council and, on the other hand, the monitoring of military operations by a major multinational State, itself placed under the authority of the Security Council."
"We are brushing all that aside today ."
"We are completely brushing aside international law."
"This is an enormous breach of the law."
"We are now in the middle of a discussion to determine whether we shall condemn a State which is, led by its own President, contravening international law, whereas Europe should quite simply condemn it, not simply out of pity - and I did indeed say pity, speaking as a Christian - for a nation, which has, for ten years, been suffering genuine martyrdom and upon which we are turning our backs because it reminds us of our own powerlessness, but we must, above all, think of the very concept of law, with which Europe has become synonymous for centuries."
"It is this concept that the United States is now disregarding, thus opening the door to new acts of barbarism."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Watson is right: the Council's position does not surprise us because, as illustrated so well by Mr Pasqua earlier, there is no more of a common foreign and security policy than a common policy in Europe."
"Our positions will never be similar, but Europe should, at the very least, remember that it has become synonymous, as has France, with the concept of law and this is much to its credit."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the American and British governments are preparing a general military offensive against Iraq, a small country of 19 million people, a member of the United Nations Organisation, in order to overturn Saddam Hussein's government which they - the self-appointed global police - suspect of posing, sic, 'a threat to world security'."
"In doing so, they are violating the United Nations' Charter, international law and, more generally speaking, people's rights."
"Since the end of the Gulf War, America and Britain have, in fact, never called a halt to their air attacks on Iraq and have caused, by imposing sanctions - a genuine crime against humanity - the poverty and death of civilian populations and, according to the UN, the death of more than one million children."
"It is surprising that, although a number of countries, including the allies of the United States are dictatorships, Iraq, a Muslim country that is secular and tolerant towards religions and minorities - the Deputy Prime Minister is Christian and three government ministers are Kurds - is their number one target."
"It is also surprising that these western superpowers, paragons of democratic virtues, are preparing so cynically to breach the peace."
"You are against the death penalty for murderers, but the British and the Americans are going to murder thousands of Iraqis and their children."
"This preventative war is unacceptable and you are well aware that real reasons are immoral; in fact, this war is essentially for electoral purposes and to protect oil supplies."
"(Applause from the Non-attached Members)"
"Mr President, I should like to express my thanks for a good debate with many sound viewpoints and many good pieces of advice."
"It is a difficult matter we are debating, but it is also a very simple matter."
"I have very deliberately confined myself to the crux of the matter, namely that the EU wishes to put maximum pressure on the dictator, Saddam Hussein to get him to comply with the UN resolution and the conditions to which he himself has agreed."
"That is not a weak but, on the contrary, a strong position."
"Everything we say and do must put maximum pressure upon Saddam Hussein."
"Strong and combined international pressure of this kind is the only thing that can induce him to respond."
"I would therefore thank you for all the reflections that have contributed to this agreement to put such pressure upon Saddam, and I would ask you to appreciate that, because of the need to do this, I am neither able nor willing to adopt positions on all contingencies."
"I can assure both Mr Barón Crespo and others that what Mr Patten said was, in every detail, in accordance with what is the common EU position, confirmed once again in Elsinore at the weekend."
"It was an informal meeting with no new decisions taken, but I can readily divulge that there was support for maintaining the existing policy and for the importance of broad consultation on the part of the United States, including consultation with Arab states."
"There was agreement about the inspectors now having to be given the opportunity of entering Iraq and there was concern about the weapons of mass destruction that not only the United States but also UNSCOM have reasons for suspecting are being produced and that may be a deadly danger to peace in the Middle East and in the rest of the world."
"The EU supports the UN's efforts."
"A regime such as Saddam Hussein's can only be expected to be prepared to comply with its obligations if there is strong and combined pressure from the international community."
"I should like to say to Baroness Nicholson and Mrs Napoletano that the Council fully supports Parliament's desire that everyone who has committed war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity should be held to account for their actions."
"That also applies of course to those responsible for the Iraqi regime's many crimes, and it is something for which preparations must be made in time."
"In connection with this, I should like to say that I am able to confirm what Mrs Maes said, to the effect that the Danish Presidency has set a deadline of a month for a dialogue with the United States on the International Criminal Court."
"I am able to confirm that this is what was at issue."
"Mr Barón Crespo would have liked me to report on the EU's latest efforts to help solve the Middle East conflict."
"I cannot give a detailed answer to his request but, like Mr Patten, I am able to inform you that my colleague, Mr Møller, is in the Middle East right now to present a proposal from the EU for a practical timetable or 'road map' for establishing a legitimate Palestinian state by June 2005."
"We are confident that there is broad support for this initiative, which can contribute significantly to further progress in the positive process which the Quartet has succeeded in setting in motion and in which we must place all our hopes."
"Mr President, I think that it is probably true that I have had the honour, and always the pleasure, of replying to more debates in this Parliament than any other Commissioner in the last three years, such is Parliament's welcome interest in external affairs."
"For me this has been one of the most interesting and important debates."
"It is no business of mine how Parliament conducts its affairs, but if one of the reasons for the interest and informed passion of this debate has been the formula which you have applied on this occasion, that which I think you call 'catching-the-eye', then I, for one, very much welcome it."
"I think that there are more people in the Chamber than normal."
"If Parliament does not mind me making the point, in my experience we have had the rather more unusual spectacle of people waiting to hear other people's speeches."
"I am even delighted to discover that one or two people have come back into the Chamber to hear the winding-up speeches which is a particular and rare pleasure."
"So speaking for my humble self, in the expectation that I will have rather a lot more debates to reply to in the next couple of years - unless Parliament focuses its interest entirely on domestic affairs - I found this an extremely welcome breakthrough."
"I was asked one specific question, and another rhetorical question to which I will return."
"General Morillon asked the specific question of what we know about the attitude of the people of Iraq to their own regime, what we know about their ambitions and aspirations."
"The sad truth is that we know damn all because they have not had the opportunity to express their views for all too long."
"Indeed, the expression of free opinions in Iraq has led to people being shot, tortured and stuck in jail."
"I look forward to the day when we will know rather more about the aspirations of the people of Iraq but I have my doubts as to whether, in a free election, Saddam Hussein would sweep back with a plurality of the votes."
"I should confess to a personal prejudice at this point."
"I have never regarded enthusiasm as a huge attribute in the discussion of foreign policy."
"I think enthusiasm does not always go well with the discussion of difficult foreign policy issues and I have always preferred foreign ministers who are prepared to sit under the tree for a bit and think what needs to be done first, rather than those who tear around trying to change the world."
"I find myself signed up enthusiastically to the famous dictum of Talleyrand 'surtout pas trop de zèle'."
"Reading so many articles over the last summer on Iraq and so many speeches, I have sometimes wished that I believed in the veracity and wisdom of anything I say as fervently as some people seem to believe in the veracity and wisdom of everything they say."
"I also think that we have seen a parade of certainties sometimes based on obfuscation."
"I know very few people, for example, who seriously contend that Saddam Hussein is not in possession of any weapons of mass destruction."
"As I said earlier, if he is without any weapons of mass destruction, then what is the problem about letting inspectors in?"
"When we are asked to define weapons of mass destruction, I suspect it is a question which could be put with some benefit to the Kurds in Iraq or to the people who live in the marshes in the south of Iraq, who could explain what chemical weapons do to your lungs."
"Those would be very good replies."
"Some of the certainties are also based on evasions and, from time to time, on a lack of willingness to enunciate clear, consistent and defensible principles."
"I just want to refer to a number of questions that we need to face up to."
"They go right to the heart of the issue of compliance with the United Nations and the whole issue of the justification for military action - an issue which was widely debated during the campaign in Kosovo and a question which goes to the heart of the matter we have debated on many occasions in this Chamber - the so-called clash of civilisations."
"My first question is what happens if Iraq continues to defy existing UN resolutions?"
"Do we simply shrug our shoulders?"
"Secondly, what happens if we go back to the United Nations Security Council, get a new resolution and Saddam Hussein defies that?"
"What do we do then?"
"Do we simply wring our hands?"
"Thirdly, what happens if we give Saddam Hussein an ultimatum and he defies it?"
"What do we do?"
"Write a letter to Le Monde, sign a petition?"
"There have been several references - not all of them as laudatory as Mr Alastair Campbell might have liked - to the press conference which the Prime Minister of Great Britain and Northern Ireland gave in his constituency yesterday."
"The honourable Member Mr Lagendijk, for example, referred to what he said."
"Let me quote one thing which Mr Blair said yesterday: the UN had to be a way of dealing with it - i.e. the problem caused by Iraq - not a way of avoiding dealing with it."
"While I am not a paid-up member of New Labour, that is a pretty good point and one which we simply cannot duck."
"My fourth question concerns a point which Dr Kissinger has often reminded us of."
"Since the Treaty of Westphalia and the end of the Thirty Years War, international law, itself sometimes a rather nebulous concept, has been based on, among other principles, the principle that one state should not intervene in the affairs of another and certainly should not intervene militarily."
"Is that an entirely adequate principle of international law today?"
"We saw the debate begun a couple of years ago by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, about whether humanitarian intervention was sometimes justified, for example when a sovereign government could be accused of assaulting the interests and the liberties and the rights of its own people."
"Is intervention in the affairs of another sovereign state justified by its possession of weapons of mass destruction?"
"Can you turn that into an acceptable principle?"
"Does it depend entirely on context?"
"Does it depend on the nature of the regime?"
"Does it depend on the stated intentions of the regime?"
"Does it depend on the scale of threat represented by that regime?"
"Whatever else you say, clearly if you are arguing along those lines you will need to present a good deal of evidence."
"Finally, on the question of justifying intervention, there is the point which Dr Kissinger argued very explicitly in a recent article in The New York Times."
"He argues that terrorism raises an entirely new issue for nation states."
"Today, he argues, one nation state can be faced with a threat from another nation state operating through non-state actors."
"In other words, the argument is that intervention could be justified where a nation state appears to be using terrorist organisations to threaten another nation state."
"At the very least I imagine all of us would argue that military intervention in a sovereign state demands a clear and well-argued justification."
"Those are all issues which will be very near the heart of foreign and security policy debates in the next decade or longer."
"They are issues on which we in the European Union, not least because of our tradition of the rule of law, not least because of the other principles in which we believe, should have clear and unequivocal opinions."
"The final question is: if the present government in Iraq is replaced as a result of military intervention, will that make the politics of the region more moderate or will it make the politics of the region more extreme?"
"All those are questions which we cannot duck."
"They are all questions to which we will have to find our own answers over the coming weeks and months."
"I would like to finish with this thought. There has been a lot of reference to our relationship with the United States."
"I very much hope that we can work together with the United States - Europe and the United States - over the coming months to deal with an undoubted threat to world peace and to international stability."
"We on our side may from time to time sound to Americans as though we are speaking with a rather self-serving condescension in arguing that United States leadership should be based on as broad a moral consensus as possible, referring to the Truman doctrine and the Marshall Plan, which helped to secure our futures, our prosperity, our freedom in Europe."
"But we in Europe, if we are to pull on our end of the rope, have to face up to one or two rather difficult issues ourselves."
"We must avoid wishful thinking and we must avoid ducking the difficult questions which I have addressed during these remarks today."
"I am sure this will not be the last time we debate this issue."
"I hope we can clarify our responses to some of those questions in the weeks and months ahead."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I want to apologise to Commissioner Patten because in my speech I gave him the title of Vice-President of the Commission."
"It was a lapsus due to the Convention."
"I hope that Commissioner Patten will not be offended."
"Mr President, I shall respond to that very courteous point."
"I am always delighted to be identified with Mr Kinnock, and even more delighted from time to time to be identified with the honourable gentleman's Spanish colleagues Mr Solana and Mrs de Palacio!"
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Afghanistan."
"Mr President, I should like firstly to congratulate Parliament on the 'catch the eye' form of debate we have just tested in practice."
"For a former parliamentarian, all these debates with planned speaking times have been a misery. Relief was at hand, however, and the delightful experience of real debates with spontaneous contributions in which people respond to each other instead of reading from pre-prepared scripts."
"Where Afghanistan is concerned, I should like firstly to draw attention to the fact that, a year ago, Afghanistan was a country in ruins, which initially suffered under an occupying power and a succession of warlords and then under an extreme Islamic revolution which forced through the de-modernisation of society and introduced mediaeval methods."
"Finally, the country became the domicile of fundamentalist terrorists."
"That is what makes it that much more significant and that much more of a pleasure to be able now - nine months after the Bonn process was set in motion - to report on a country in which the situation is gradually being normalised."
"There is nonetheless a long way to go before there can again be talk of a stable Afghanistan."
"There continues to be inadequate security in the country."
"In July, Vice-President Haji Qadir was killed openly in the street."
"Conflicts between local warlords continue, and serious infringements of human rights continue to take place."
"The conclusion of the Bonn Agreement of December 2001 between Afghan groups under UN leadership marked the start of the positive development we are now seeing in Afghanistan."
"The Bonn Agreement lays down a process for the re-introduction of democracy."
"As a first step, an interim government was established which governed the country for six months until a hastily convened council of elders, Loya Jirga, met in June and appointed a transitional government headed by Mr Karzai who is to lead the country for two years until elections are held."
"The convening of this Loya Jirga and the formation of the transitional government were essential steps forward."
"The Loya Jirga process and the regional and district elections showed that Afghans throughout the country have the desire and the courage to participate in the process of democratisation."
"Afghan women played a striking role."
"There have been attempts to mediate in the conflicts in Afghanistan."
"If the Bonn process seems to be a success, this is particularly due to the fact that it is founded on traditional structures in the country, based upon the need to secure a broad representation of the various ethnic and religious groups."
"It is precisely the securing of representativeness and the protection of minorities that are the keys to long-term stability in the country."
"Afghan ownership is another code word."
"Even though the UN has operated as an essential catalyst in the process that is now developing, it has played its role with full respect and support for Afghan ownership of the process."
"The re-establishment of an Afghan state that can secure unity, peace and stability in the country and guarantee the observance of human rights is absolutely crucial."
"Progress is slow and the transitional government still has difficulty controlling large parts of the country where, as a result, local warlords and bands of robbers have an easy time of it."
"Central to the efforts to promote security is the establishment of an Afghan army and police force in which the population has confidence and which operates with respect for human rights."
"In that connection, the EU has expressed great satisfaction with the setting up of Afghanistan's National Defence Council."
"Just as important a factor is the state's ability to deliver development, including access to health services."
"A large number of Afghan refugees have returned, and those who have done so need international aid to secure their permanent reintegration."
"On the issue of the return of refugees, I am delighted to note that, according to the UNHCR, the situation in Afghanistan has now improved in such a way that the great majority of Afghans are able to return voluntarily without risking persecution."
"I agree with the UNHCR that their return should be supported by relevant relief measures put in place by the international community and that individual Afghans should be offered 'realistic repatriation packages'."
"Seville gave high priority to adopting measures to promote an accelerated return to Afghanistan."
"In cooperation with the Commission and the Member States, the Danish Presidency will make efforts to comply with the Seville Declaration."
"I myself also had a meeting with Ruud Lubbers a short time beforehand."
"There are still forces that are seeking to knock developments in Afghanistan off course."
"There are still various ethnic groups that, with the support of groups in neighbouring countries, do not believe that their own particular viewpoints are adequately represented."
"There are various warlords who, for long periods, have become accustomed to a high degree of self-determination in those areas they control and who have resisted the establishment of a central government."
"There are also different points of view as to how quickly and how far Afghanistan can move in the direction of a modern Islamic state with close contacts with the West."
"The hope is that, by setting up a democratic process, opportunities will be created for solving these conflicts through political negotiations rather than through a return to the pointless fighting of the past."
"The relatively encouraging development is also due to the fact that the international community has committed itself to Afghanistan."
"The United States played a decisive role in the rapid removal of the Taliban government through Operation Enduring Freedom."
"The American-led forces are still present in the country, combating the last remaining pockets of al-Qa'ida fighters."
"In and around Kabul, the International Security Assistance Force, ISAF, is helping to ensure stability so that the interim government is able to operate."
"The EU also attaches importance to helping promote stability in Afghanistan and in the region."
"The country must not again become a seedbed of terrorism and of drugs production."
"We wish to support the Afghan people in their efforts to secure peaceful development."
"Together, the EU Member States contribute the larger part of the ISAF force and are the largest international providers of aid."
"The Commission's and the Member States' combined promise of aid amounts in 2002 to more than EUR 550 million."
"Recently - or, more specifically, on 22 July - the General Affairs and External Relations Council adopted conclusions concerning the situation in Afghanistan."
"It was stated that, in dialogue with the transitional government, the EU would proceed on the basis of the key principles agreed by the Afghan parties and the international community."
"The principles are stated in the Bonn Agreement, the final declaration from the Tokyo Summit in January and UN Security Council resolution 1419."
"The principles include the formation of a broadly constituted, multi-ethnic and representative government, in which women too participate."
"Through its special representative, Mr Vendrell, the EU is maintaining a close political dialogue with the government in Kabul and other Afghan parties."
"The purpose is to help developments proceed in the right direction."
"Dialogues are also being conducted with the countries neighbouring Afghanistan in order to ensure their cooperation."
"International commitment to Afghanistan will in the last analysis depend upon whether the Afghan parties really make efforts to achieve the stated objectives."
"The EU will therefore attempt to promote a process in which, in partnership with the international community, Afghanistan's transitional government develops verifiable criteria and monitoring systems in connection with the considerable aid that is being given."
"The EU will promote the allocation of aid in a way that strengthens the central government and weakens those who are not involved in, or who are directly opposed to, the Bonn process. At the same time, it will be ensured that the population as a whole shares in the aid as a visible peace dividend."
"The financial situation in Afghanistan is characterised by a serious budget deficit, and the government will soon be in no position to pay out wages."
"Direct budgetary aid will therefore also be necessary to ensure political stability in Afghanistan."
"The international community and the EU can therefore strengthen the peace process."
"Whether those steps in the right direction we are now witnessing in Afghanistan can be translated into genuine and sustained improvements of the situation will, when all is said and done, depend upon the Afghan people's own desire to support the process that has been set in motion."
"Mr President, I am extremely surprised because the Conference of Presidents has - unanimously - asked the Council and the Commission to specifically include in this morning's statement the issue of war crimes allegations in Afghanistan, which have recently been acknowledged by the UN."
"I am extremely surprised that nothing has been said on this issue, and I would like to ask you, Mr President, to ask Mr Haarder to expand on his statement so that it includes the subject that the Conference of Presidents specifically requested."
"As I was not present at the Conference of Presidents I do not know about your discussion, but Mr Haarder will have a chance to reply at the end of the debate."
"If he then wishes to take up that matter he is free to do so."
"The Minister may well want, on behalf of the presidency, to say a word about those allegations of human rights atrocities."
"I was certainly intending to say something myself, which I do not imagine will be very different from the presidency's remarks."
"Indeed it would be a cause of considerable diplomatic anxiety were we to be saying anything very different on this subject."
"I am sure we will not."
"I would like to thank Parliament for this timely opportunity to review the situation in Afghanistan."
"It is almost a year ago that the events of 11 September catapulted a country which the European Commission's humanitarian office had labelled a 'forgotten crisis' at the beginning of that year, into the limelight of world attention."
"Since then we have witnessed remarkable changes for the better: the Taliban regime imploded more rapidly than some expected, leading to the installation of an interim authority which soon established its credentials around the world and - even more importantly - managed to develop a balanced relationship with its neighbours."
"In June this year, an Emergency Loya Jirga brought to power a Transitional Authority which has more democratic legitimacy than any of the previous regimes over the last two decades."
"By and large therefore, the Bonn process is on track."
"However, there is still a pretty bumpy road ahead."
"As Afghanistan moves into the post-Loya Jirga phase, a number of key challenges need to be addressed."
"The most imminent is internal security - or rather, to be more accurate, the lack of it."
"So far, President Karzai has found it extremely difficult to extend the authority of the central government to the regions, despite his own formidable efforts."
"This challenge is linked to the difficulty of turning warlords into politicians."
"Some of them continue to thrive on drugs and other illicit trade; some profit from their involvement in the Operation Enduring Freedom; others are attempting to openly challenge the leadership of President Karzai."
"In this fluid environment, concerted long-term international support for the central government is more crucial than ever."
"This brings me to my second point."
"Unless President Karzai manages to show that the trust he generates among the international community in its turn generates tangible economic benefits and improved security, he will not find it easy to convince his rivals that he is the best man to lead the country through this difficult transitional period."
"As the going gets tougher, he needs even more of our support."
"The Commission is therefore pursuing - along with other donors - a two-pronged strategy: delivering a tangible peace dividend to the population as swiftly as possible, while ensuring that most of this assistance flows through the central government."
"In turn - and this is my third point - we insist absolutely on the conditionality of our assistance."
"In a nutshell, this means strict adherence to the letter and spirit of the Bonn process as well as to sound macroeconomic and financial management."
"Let me turn briefly to the Bonn Agreement."
"The appointment of the Constitutional Commission is due very shortly. This Commission's work paves the way for the general elections due by mid-2004."
"It will have to make difficult decisions on the future centre-provincial structure, the question of secular versus Islamic society, gender issues and the role of minorities, to name but a few thorny questions."
"This Commission, together with the Judicial Commission, will also have an impact on the dealings with war criminals, both past and present."
"It will take time to find lasting solutions to many of these issues."
"The important thing, however, is that we see this country progressing, with our assistance, towards peace and long-term stability."
"The issue which was raised earlier about human rights atrocities is of very considerable concern to the international community."
"Among other fora, it was discussed by the Security Council in a meeting on 28 August."
"The UN, I am pleased to say, is prepared to assist the government in a future investigation."
"At the moment it is important to keep the grave site protected and to protect potential witnesses before an active investigation can be carried out."
"In my judgement, the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan - UNAMA - is best placed to handle this delicate issue, supporting the key role of the Afghan Human Rights Commission in taking future steps."
"We totally accept that it will be necessary to take future steps and to be as transparent about the process as possible."
"The need for steady, long-term progress must not distract us from the huge and immediate humanitarian challenge."
"Since March this year, 1.5 million Afghans have returned from Pakistan to Afghanistan under the UN repatriation programme."
"A further 116 000 have returned from Iran."
"This is an impressive number but it is creating a large problem for the aid agencies."
"The same is true of the large number of internally displaced people."
"The international community is now faced with additional demands, both on the humanitarian and on the security front."
"These bills come on top of the EUR 1.8 billion pledged for 2002 in Tokyo in January."
"In such an environment, it is important to get priorities right, since it is unrealistic to assume that all the additional funding requests are going to be met at once."
"One such issue is the funding for the increased rate of return of refugees where some international agencies have claimed Europe has not been generous enough."
"I can speak for the European Commission."
"We have more than doubled the humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan this year - from EUR 25 million initially earmarked at the beginning of the year to EUR 60 million at present."
"However, I believe it is a mistake to look at this issue solely in quantitative terms."
"The foremost challenge is - and this has been our line from the start - to ensure that this summer's returnees do not become again this winter's refugees."
"Our interventions are therefore carefully linked to the overall sustainability of the return programme."
"For our rural recovery programme, the migratory flows are one important criterion for the selection of areas of intervention."
"Another important selection criterion is dependence on poppy production."
"Together with a few other donors, the Commission is leading the debate on how best to develop alternative livelihoods."
"All these issues throw up one unavoidable conclusion: Afghanistan needs partners who are prepared to be there for the long haul."
"This, however, is not to say that we cannot point to early achievements in our aid effort."
"Let me give you a few examples."
"Under the Aid to Uprooted People's programme, the Commission is funding the operation of 450 primary schools around the country in Afghanistan."
"We are now supporting over 200 clinics, three district- and three provincial-level hospitals."
"Our rural recovery and urban rehabilitation programmes are providing over 3 million person-days of work this year alone."
"Under a contract with Habitat, we are cleaning up five cities around Afghanistan, preventing diseases like cholera."
"We are co-financing a massive mine-clearance operation."
"We are contributing more than any other donor to the operating costs of the government (EUR 50 million from the Asia and Latin America budget and EUR 2.5 million from the Rapid Reaction Mechanism)."
"While less visible, these sums finance the salaries of essential government servants, including nurses, doctors, policemen, teachers and civil servants."
"Regarding performance, I am pleased to say that Afghanistan proves that the reform of the management of external assistance produces results even under the most difficult of circumstances."
"Of the EUR 120 million available so far for recovery and reconstruction, EUR 100 million has already been contracted."
"This figure does not include the EUR 45 million in humanitarian aid under the ECHO programme, which has already been committed, or the further EUR 15 million due to be committed under the same programme before the end of the year."
"I understand that Parliament will vote on a draft supplementary amending budget for the remaining EUR 70 million pledged for 2002 in October."
"It is intended for further support to the public administration, for much needed infrastructure projects and for a primary health care package."
"Preparations for implementation of this programme are well advanced."
"I can assure Parliament that these funds will be put to immediate use once approved."
"So we will have committed in Afghanistan this year - committed and largely spent - almost EUR 250 million - a good step forward in discharging our pledge to spend EUR 1 billion over 5 years."
"That, the House will recall, has been achieved almost from a standing start."
"It was, of course, only possible because of the understanding of the budgetary authority - Parliament and the Member States."
"But it has also been achieved because of the outstanding work done on the ground by our delegation and our ECHO staff."
"I cannot speak too highly of their cheerful dedication and professionalism in very tough circumstances."
"I much enjoyed meeting them during my visit in May and look forward to making a return trip."
"We in the Commission have good reason to be proud of those, like our team in Kabul, who do such a first-class job."
"They will, I know, work as well with our new, experienced EU representative Ambassador Vendrell as they did with his committed predecessor Ambassador Klaiber."
"I am determined to ensure that the European Commission remains fully engaged in Afghanistan even if world attention shifts to other places of conflict and post-conflict rehabilitation."
"Let me again thank the European Parliament for its very constructive attitude in dealing with additional budgetary needs to underwrite this commitment."
"I hope that as the months and years pass, Members of this Parliament will be able to go to Afghanistan - as they have been going to the Balkans in the last few years - and see European assistance being provided generously, efficiently and wisely, as it should be everywhere."
"We will not be able to complete this debate before lunchtime, but we will carry on until about 12.20 p.m. so that we can take the speakers from the political groups."
"Mr President, Mr Haarder, Commissioner Patten, thank you for giving us the opportunity to review the situation of this ruined country - as Mr Haarder described it last year - of this forgotten country, as the Commissioner so accurately described it."
"No one here, however, has forgotten the opinions of those who considered themselves, not so long ago, to be experts on Afghanistan and who recommended reaching an agreement with the Taliban regime, on the pretext of implementing a realpolitik which would mean that only the Taliban would be able to guarantee some semblance of peace in this ill-fated country which has been torn apart for so long - you mentioned this, Mr Haarder - by tribal feuds."
"The risk was that the country would once again fall prey to various warlords once the Taliban regime had been eliminated."
"That is why we can only welcome the fact that, despite these forecasts, Afghanistan is not being torn apart today and that the progress we have already made in restoring order in the country is, on the contrary, encouraging."
"The progress made is, of course, encouraging, as you have said, Mr Haarder, but it is far from satisfactory."
"The fight against terrorism waged by al-Qa'ida and Mullah Omar is far from over, security in Afghanistan is not, therefore, guaranteed, the reorganisation needed in Afghanistan - which involves creating institutions to ensure the representation of all ethnic groups and respect for international law and human rights - has only just got underway, and, lastly, because the large-scale return of refugees has only served to exacerbate the already disastrous humanitarian situation caused by the war and the drought which have been raging for years."
"I shall return to all these points in order, if I may."
"The fight against terrorism waged by al-Qa'ida and Mullah Omar is far from over because we have no idea what has happened to them, for it is unlikely that they could have found refuge in areas bordering on Afghanistan, in the uncontrolled territory of the Pashtun tribes in Pakistan, but there is nothing to prove either, as far as I know, that they are not still hiding somewhere in the very heart of Afghanistan."
"The security of the country is, therefore, not guaranteed."
"Commissioner Patten and Mr Haarder talked about the murders."
"They quite rightly emphasised the difficulties caused by these attacks for our representatives on the ground, and I join you, Commissioner, in praising the dedication and bravery of these representatives."
"This may be the reason for the demand made by the transitional government, by President Karzai, to all donor countries, and to the European Union in particular, to extend the mandate granted to the peacekeeping force to outside Kabul and even to the whole territory."
"Like the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, I do not think that this is desirable."
"I do not think that it is desirable for the Afghans to entrust the responsibility of maintaining order on the ground to others."
"It is far more desirable, to my mind, to speed up the training of the national army and police force, which has already begun, so that the Afghans themselves can take responsibility for security in their country, as they have begun to do within the institutions."
"I mentioned the reorganisation that is needed and which has been carried out by setting up institutions which ensure the representation of all ethnic groups."
"You are well aware that there are on-going difficulties with the Pashtuns."
"I would also point out that we are expecting a great deal, and rightly so, from the work undertaken within the framework of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs seeking to make it possible to enforce international law and respect for human rights in Afghanistan."
"I welcome the news that I received yesterday that a class has begun at the French High School in Kabul which is open to women and where female students do not have to wear veils."
"Lastly, I mentioned the humanitarian situation."
"In this respect, and I shall conclude on this point, we can only welcome the fact that, when examining the 2002 supplementary budget, the European Union has agreed to increase aid to Afghanistan, bringing it up to EUR 250 million."
"What we shall ask for is greater transparency in the way this money is used."
"That is why, when examining the budget, we asked for a line indicating all the transactions made with respect to Afghanistan."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, when we endeavoured to come up with a joint motion for a resolution yesterday, we took all the issues you have touched upon today into account."
"There was a really broad consensus on the points we discussed, and I do not just mean humanitarian issues and reconstruction in Afghanistan, but also other political issues."
"I would like to discuss that here, but I would like to specifically mention that my colleague Mrs Gröner will be dealing with the position of women in Afghanistan, which is a very special issue."
"Our motion for a joint resolution starts with a clear condemnation of terrorism, stating that Afghanistan's historical problems also contributed to the need for intervention of this kind."
"I do not want to say any more about that intervention."
"It was very broadly-based and it at least attracted support and could be justified."
"We believe that the role of the United Nations - and I am now returning to the same discussion that we had earlier - is not being given sufficient weight at present."
"The United Nations needs to decide not only about peacekeeping measures, but also about the future of this intervention."
"The United Nations also needs to define the objectives of this intervention, the time required for it, and it should also decide when this intervention should come to an end."
"We believe that the moral justification we had for this intervention should also apply to the treatment of prisoners from this war, either in Afghanistan itself or outside Afghanistan, in Guantanamo."
"These prisoners deserve to be treated in accordance with international law and the international conventions."
"We believe that the international community bears an important responsibility for investigating and establishing the position as regards the human rights violations in northern Afghanistan that have been mentioned, and in particular those in the Dasht-e-Leile region which have been reported by the UN."
"In reply to Mr Wurtz, who mentioned this point just now, I would say that we in this House should make a very clear request for the United Nations to carry out an investigation and to bring those guilty to justice once they have been tracked down."
"Mr Wurtz, I regret that your group feels unable to sign this motion for a resolution, but you can at least vote for it."
"Mr President, I congratulate the Commission and the team led in the Commissioner's office by Mr Fotiadis and those on the ground for the amazing work they are carrying out."
"I attended the Tokyo Pledging Conference and was proud to see the way in which European Union leadership in nation rebuilding was exemplified by both the Commission and the presidency."
"I congratulate the Commissioner himself and the presidency at the time - the Spanish presidency - for the way in which they conducted the business of the European Union there."
"But the Commission's subsequent work has proved my view to be correct: amongst the international community blocs claiming to be able to rebuild nations, the European Union is standing alone."
"And we are working in a tough and dangerous situation."
"Afghanistan is a very difficult country to help."
"For example the main message coming from the Afghan Government at the moment is that international pledges made in Tokyo are not being fulfilled and the government therefore cannot conduct its business."
"Last Saturday I had the opportunity to speak in Tehran with the new Afghan Ambassador to the Islamic Republic of Iran."
"He made this very point."
"I pointed out to him that the one partner on which he could firmly rely was the European Union."
"I commend the priorities the Union has set itself, as the Commissioner has outlined today, because, as I said, it is not a simple matter."
"Water."
"One Member - Mr Morillon - has already mentioned the acute drought."
"The acute drought is so widespread in the south-west of Afghanistan - it feeds across from the plain in Iran."
"There are 26 major water projects under way in the Islamic Republic of Iran to try and provide the local population with water."
"Over the border in Afghanistan, I have seen no water projects at all on the ground."
"Yet this is the largest drought for at least 300 years."
"It has hit many hundreds of thousands of people."
"Of course in a drought the farmers cannot grow alternative crops."
"The south-west of Afghanistan is not particularly heavily mined."
"They can grow opium poppies in this drought."
"Unfortunately, poppies grow extremely well in drought."
"Until we put water projects in the south-west region, we cannot complain as much as we do that opium production is not being contained."
"Of course it is not being contained."
"The figures provided by the Afghan Government have been unintentionally misleading to the international community."
"Water ought to be one of the topmost priorities."
"On health care, the population is virtually at the lowest ebb."
"Life expectancy is 46 years - the lowest in the world apart from Somalia."
"All the health indicators show that health has been abominable for the last 23 years and there is a lack of education."
"May we insist that other international donors focus on small-scale health projects to implement the World Health Organisation master plan on health."
"Not large hospitals, for which there will not be enough staff or resources, but more mass immunisation, more primary health clinics, more mobile health clinics."
"Could we please press other donors to focus on those areas?"
"Then, of course, women's rights."
"I must tell you that women's rights have gone downhill, not up."
"Only last week, for example, the government passed a law stating that women would not be allowed to perform music on the radio."
"So it is not easy."
"I congratulate the Commission and I urge it to persuade other donors to adopt the same approach as our team in Brussels and on the ground."
"We are doing wonderfully well; others, I fear, are not being nearly as successful."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, when my group invited the director Jamie Doran to show his film at the European Parliament on 12 June, we had three objectives in mind."
"The first aim was to gain as much recognition as possible for the overwhelming validity of the war crimes allegations made by the people interviewed by the British journalist in Afghanistan."
"Next, we wanted to give as much backing as possible to the idea of sending, under the auspices of the United Nations, a committee of enquiry to the region in question, with a view to establishing the truth of events. This would enable us to stop, hunt down and bring to justice the possible perpetrators of these atrocities, whoever they may be."
"Finally, we wanted to use this opportunity to reaffirm the need to respect the law and international conventions, in any situation, and this also applies to the fight against terrorism."
"The joint resolution which will be submitted to us tomorrow explicitly fulfils these three desires and this is an exceptionally encouraging outcome, even though, to achieve it, it will have taken a leading US magazine to confirm our statements and, in addition, the State department, the UN and, if not the Council, then a number of European leaders to speak more openly."
"We must now bring this episode to a conclusion and, furthermore, my group believes that we must learn some strategic lessons from it for the future."
"Personally speaking, I have no doubt whatsoever regarding the need for a consistent fight against terrorism, and I have never had one ounce of sympathy for the Taliban regime."
"It must be pointed out, however, that the military operations carried out by the United States or the West in Afghanistan, like the random detention of alleged Islamic extremists in Guantanamo or the compilation of ever-expanding lists of suspect organisations, have not enabled us to stamp out the al-Qa'ida criminal network."
"To some extent, this observation is based on the report that the anti-terrorist monitoring group formed by the UN sent to the Security Council today."
"On the other hand, the actions mentioned above have brought about inhuman and often traumatic consequences for the population, have without a doubt reinforced the most radical and extremist elements and, lastly, have increased insecurity throughout the world."
"That is why my group deeply disagrees with the passages of the resolution which seek to justify war as part of the fight against terrorism."
"If these paragraphs were to be adopted, many of use would unfortunately be unable to support this text."
"We must bear in mind that the subject of war has once again become a major concern in most of our countries."
"Unlike the sorcerers' apprentices who, not so long ago, supported Islamic extremist networks in their attempts to destabilise whoever their enemy happened to be at any particular time, we are calling for responsible, on-going management of security issues;"
"I am thinking, in particular, of the need to improve civilian conflict prevention and, if necessary, civil crisis management."
"The fact that al-Qa'ida cells still exist in at least 40 countries, according to the UN report that I mentioned earlier, also reminds us that terrorist networks are drawing their resources from the troubled waters of the international financial market."
"When will we finally adopt drastic measures to clean up and lend greater transparency to the international financial circuits where speculative - let us call it traditional - capital now mixes, if not crosses paths, with dirty money from organised crime?"
"This is one of the costs of a genuinely effective fight against terrorism."
"For the time being, Mr President, it is clearly vital, as many of my fellow Members have said, that the international aid promised to Afghanistan at the Tokyo Conference be provided immediately so that the deeply scarred population - these people and, especially, these women - can, at last, begin to live once again like human beings."
"Mr President, let the current situation in Afghanistan be a hard lesson to the United States and Europe about what happens to a country during and after military intervention."
"In my first point, I should like to comment on Mr Wurtz's contribution and the indications he has given, in combination with, in my view, strong clues in the article in Newsweek, as well as in the footage which he and his fellow MEPs showed last time, that hundreds, possibly even more, Taliban have been killed under suspicious circumstances."
"I am not quoting this to indict the Americans in any way for something which may be completely unrelated to them."
"I am quoting this because, in my view, it is extremely important finally to put an end to lawlessness after 20 years of civil war."
"This means that a serious inquiry must be mounted into this and, unfortunately, similar cases."
"We are all agreed without much hesitation that this inquiry falls within the remit of the United Nations."
"The only problem is that the UN's special representative, Mr Brahimi, has already made it clear that the United Nations is unable to carry out this enquiry because it cannot guarantee the safety of, for example, witnesses and researchers."
"My very explicit question to the Commission and the Council is whether they would make every effort to enable the United Nations to look into this and similar cases, and to sufficiently protect witnesses and researchers."
"My second point concerns the comment I made earlier in the debate on Iraq."
"The much vaunted regime change can only be effective if there is support for it in the country itself."
"Militarily speaking, such support was in place in Afghanistan, in the form of the Northern Alliance."
"If a regime change were to depend on the construction of civil society or the existence of NGOs, then this would be extremely difficult."
"These have all but gone in Afghanistan, and the European Union is at the moment trying its best - for which all credit to it - to develop these."
"Nevertheless, I am very anxious about the way this is going and the resistance that is met along the way."
"There are large groups in Afghan society that reject what they call Western, but in my eyes, crucially democratic, values."
"As Baroness Nicholson already mentioned, there is what I see as a setback where the role of women is concerned."
"Although I welcome the fact that the Loya Jirga included many women, there are now all kinds of signs that the role of women is being repressed."
"I think that this is a sign that nation building does not happen overnight."
"I am also addressing this statement to the Americans: nation building does not happen overnight."
"Building a democratic society is a long-term commitment."
"My final point is, in my view, politically speaking, the most important point at the moment and I would particularly ask the Council to address this matter."
"It is about extending the mandate of ISAF, the peacekeeping troops currently based in Kabul."
"We as the Parliament and also most Member States have been insisting for months that the mandate should be extended beyond Kabul because that is where chaos is escalating."
"Although the United States seems able to permit this, it will not supply a single soldier."
"It will be up to the European Union, the European Member States, to extend the mandate of ISAF by sending more troops to Afghanistan."
"My question to Mr Haarder is the following: is the Council prepared to send more troops to Afghanistan in order to control the chaos outside Kabul and to keep the peace?"
"Finally, Mr President, the lesson I have drawn from this situation is that we ought to think twice, if not more, before we decide on military intervention."
"Once we are there, however, we should acquit ourselves of our tasks effectively for as long as this proves necessary."
"Mr President, the fierce Taliban regime was defeated in the war but social and political calm and economic stability have yet to be established in Afghanistan, and the many problems linked to respect for human rights persist."
"The new government is faced with severe difficulties and we must provide more than just economic aid."
"Over 1.5 million refugees have returned from the places they had fled to during the many wars and upheavals which have afflicted their country in recent decades, but they have neither houses nor work and are prey to the ongoing dangers caused by the lack of security in the country."
"With a view to bringing greater security, the US Special Forces advisors are working together with the Karzai government to set up a national army in Afghanistan, but if, on the one hand, the soldiers of the new army lack weapons, on the other, there appear to be 750 000 armed Mujahideen belonging to the various ethnic groups."
"All this means that there will be further difficulties and that there is a need for especial political and diplomatic mediation between the national government and what are known as the 'warlords'."
"No progress has been made as regards the situation of women: the only woman elected a minister in the new government had to resign after receiving death threats for declaring her opposition to the Sharia."
"The recent attacks, the recent discovery of a chemicals laboratory for producing explosives and lethal materials and the existence of an area under tribal influence between Afghanistan and Pakistan are further indications of a dangerous situation."
"The Afghan government is proceeding, one small step at a time, to bring a return to law and order and respect for human rights, combating the extremist fringe groups which have combined terrorism and Islam to make a single religion."
"However, the international community must also continue to discharge its responsibilities through technical, humanitarian cooperation which will give Afghanistan the economic and structural support it needs to eliminate drug cultivation, and through more unambiguous measures to combat the Sharia and discrimination against women."
"The European Union has a particular responsibility: for too long, our democracies were deaf to the cries for help coming from the Afghan people oppressed by the Taliban regime and by the cultural and physical violence imposed by their dictatorship."
"In a few days' time, it will be the anniversary of the assassination of Commander Massoud, who was murdered a few hours before the tragedy of 11 September."
"It is our hope that the men and women in Afghanistan too who believe in freedom and democracy will respond to Commander Massoud's call and work together to defeat fundamentalist violence and secure peace for their people."
"Mr President, it is difficult to speak in this House which barely resembles a genuine Parliament."
"What we can say about the situation in Afghanistan is a mere extension of what we were saying earlier about Iraq."
"In both cases, we are witnessing the unleashing of an empire, which is using every possible excuse to inflict on a nation - and, there is no doubt, via this nation, on the whole world - a display of its military capability."
"In Afghanistan, the excuse is not plausible."
"One does not destroy a whole country because a terrorist is hiding there."
"As Mr Gollnisch said earlier, we will have to bomb London until the British Government extradite to France Rachid Ramda who masterminded several terrorist attacks that were carried out on the Paris underground in 1995."
"Although he spoke in an ironic manner, Mr Gollnisch has simply made a logical point."
"Due to the fact, ladies and gentlemen, that the empire and its propaganda are so deeply engrained in our minds, we are losing sight of the most basic logic and even the most basic common sense."
"Who, if not the empire, is flouting the law, and as I said earlier in relation to Iraq, the UN Charter, to which we are all bound, in the war that it unilaterally decided to enter into, first in Kosovo, then in Afghanistan and now in Iraq?"
"Who if not Washington is guilty of war crimes, which I, like Mr Wurtz, would like Mr Haarder to speak to us about this afternoon."
"And who, if not Washington, is using weapons of mass destruction in Kosovo, in Afghanistan and in Iraq, as proven by the numbers of deformed children being born in these countries as well as the condition of many American soldiers themselves?"
"The American people are themselves victims of the unleashing of the empire."
"Open your eyes, ladies and gentlemen."
"The great warlord is no longer Saddam Hussein - it is George W. Bush."
"The Hitler of today cannot be said to be the remote, sectarian 'hashassins' - it is Bush and the pathetic, militaristic gang with their aspirations to dominate the world."
"They should know that although they will not find wretched Europe standing in their way - Europe which is so divided now and becoming increasingly divided - they will at least hear the voice of the freedom of the Nations, and above all, the voice of France."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is certainly true that considerable progress has been made in the situation in Afghanistan and anyone who has visited the country recently can see that, despite the huge problems, there is hope and life."
"You are quite right, however, Commissioner, that the problem in Afghanistan is the lack of security and that the current government, led by President Karzai, has little power outside of Kabul."
"This is why, unlike Mr Morillon and the decision of the Security Council, I think that we are wrong not to respond in the positive to Mr Brahimi and Mr Karzai's request to step up the presence of the international peacekeeping force, to extend it temporarily and to widen its territorial jurisdiction."
"Personally speaking, I think that we perhaps have won the war, but there is a risk we might lose peace."
"Currently, 4 800 soldiers from the international peacekeeping force are stuck in Kabul."
"You are right, General Morillon, it would be better for the Afghans themselves to be responsible for the security of their country."
"However, to put together an army and a police force takes time and, in the meanwhile, the tribal leaders are becoming more organised, as is evident from the attacks carried out in recent weeks."
"That is why I am saying that reconstruction is a good thing."
"The Commission and our staff are, in my view, making miracles happen in Afghanistan, but I sincerely hope, Commissioner, Mr President, that the next time Mr Brahimi and Mr Karzai ask us to step up the peacekeeping force, we might have the courage to say yes."
"There are 7 800 American soldiers in Afghanistan to combat terrorism and 4 800 soldiers to maintain peace."
"I think that we have done the wrong thing."
"It would have been much wiser and perhaps more useful if we had had the courage to invest as much in peace and security as we have in the fight against terrorism."
"We will now interrupt the debate for the vote."
"The debate will be resumed this afternoon at 3 p.m."
"Mr President, I would like to tell Parliament that this morning the Prince of Asturias Foundation awarded the prestigious Concord Prize jointly to Daniel Barenboim and Edward Saïd."
"I believe this is an appropriate encore to the concert we enjoyed on Monday."
"Mr President, I was the Member responsible for the successful amendment to the Corbett Report, as a result of which the book where you sign written declarations under Rule 51 was moved to just outside this Chamber instead of being stuck in an office which nobody could find."
"I spoke to the official there today, who complained that not a single Member has shown any interest in reading the declarations or signing the book, even though the procedure is now much easier and more convenient."
"Can Members please cooperate with this project, in order to justify the change and the human resources dedicated to making it work?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to move a point of order pursuant to Rule 144 of the Rules of Procedure."
"The motion is to refer this text back to committee."
"We believe that the Beysen report cannot legitimately be adopted until the questions that were raised by the Executive Committee in the Green Paper on Consumer Protection have been resolved."
"These questions are: should we harmonise European consumer law using a framework directive or using specific provisions of the type used in the proposal for a regulation on sales promotions?"
"In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, can I have a speaker for the motion and one against?"
"Mr President, I think that the argument put forward by Mrs Patrie is based on common sense."
"We should not be expected to vote before we have held a debate on the Green Paper on Consumer Protection."
"My group is therefore also in favour of Mrs Patrie's request."
"The rapporteur has asked for the floor."
"Mr President, Mrs Patrie's suggestion comes as a huge surprise to me, because not a single new issue was raised during the extensive debate we held here yesterday, both in the morning and in the afternoon, and because Commissioner Bolkestein has also emphatically confirmed that the Green Paper and the draft regulation are completely compatible."
"Moreover, I should like to draw Parliament's attention to the fact that this report has been approved in the Committee on Legal Affairs by an overwhelming majority, with two votes against and two abstentions, and that normally speaking, this report would not have been discussed in the plenary had we applied the new procedure."
"What is more, it cannot be the intention, surely, to obstruct the legislative procedure because a group, however important it may be, fails to reach unanimity on this report."
"It is up to us to assume our responsibility freely; this is quite simply our mandate."
"I now put the motion that the text should be referred back to committee to the vote."
"(Parliament rejected the request for referral to committee)"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mr President, I would like to table an oral amendment."
"Mrs Villiers is suggesting the following amendment: 'believes it will be necessary to revise the regulation in order to apply it also to the transport area, as a strategic instrument for the development of the EU'."
"If we adopt this amendment, we will prevent the Commission's regulation on State aid for employment from coming into force, which is something, I am sure, no one wants."
"I therefore propose that we add the short phrase 'in the near future', to urge the Commission to present to us, in the near future, the proposals that Mrs Villiers desires, which will enable the Commission to apply this regulation that is, indeed, important."
"I believe Mrs Villiers is in agreement."
"Mr President, this report was voted under Rule 110a of the Rules of Procedure, which allows for no debate in Parliament and no amendments to the report."
"The British delegation of the PPE-DE Group has previously sought to amend reports which it did not support."
"The new rule, however, leaves no option but to vote against certain reports."
"The British Conservatives deplore violence of any kind and welcome measures to combat this, including some of the initiatives under the Daphne programme."
"Violence, especially against women or children, is completely unjustifiable and cannot be accepted."
"However, the measures called for in Article 18 of the Avilés Perea report represent an infringement of the Member States' right to determine their own criminal justice systems and represent measures to introduce harmonisation of criminal law."
"The calls for a specific European legal base infringe the principle of subsidiarity."
"We strongly believe that national parliaments and not the European Parliament should lay down laws relating, for example, to eviction of violent partners."
"Whilst accepting that good work is being carried out by the Daphne programme, the British Conservatives are opposed to the principles of the report, for the reasons outlined."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have fully and enthusiastically supported this magnificent report by Mrs Avilés Perea."
"In fact, the Daphne programme, designed to protect women and children against violence, and which is now also open to the countries that are candidates for accession and to the countries of the EFTA-European Economic Area, has had an exceptional level of response and, as has already been said, is a victim of its own success."
"Therefore, the efforts made to draw attention to the programme's clearly inadequate funding are not excessive. This inadequate funding is a matter of the greatest concern, particularly when we consider the forthcoming enlargement of the Union."
"To date, the participation of the candidate countries only represents 6% of the programme's total resources and this is predicted to rise."
"We also support the rapporteur's proposals on the rehabilitation and treatment of aggressors, on undertaking comparative studies into legislation and punishment, on approaches to the problem of prostitution, to undertaking educational programmes which show that violence against women and children is unacceptable and on the creation of a common database on eliminating violence against women."
"Nevertheless, in line with our Conservative colleague who has just spoken, we consider some excessive steps to be dispensable, in particular those which could be interpreted to favour a common European code, which we believe would breach the principle of subsidiarity."
"Physical, sexual or psychological violence exists in every country in the EU."
"The statistics gathered in the various countries are quite high, varying from 14.5% in Germany to 56.3% in Portugal, with 52.8% of women suffering physical violence at the hands of their partner or spouse."
"Since 1991, Portugal has had a law to protect women who suffer domestic violence."
"Nevertheless, this law was adopted under international pressure, and not as a result of any greater awareness, which means that there are almost no measures in place to implement the law."
"Violence perpetrated against children, adolescents and women must be condemned, because it violates their fundamental rights, entails serious consequences for society as a whole and constitutes an obstacle to gender equality."
"The Daphne programme to combat violence involves policies combining prevention, punitive action and victim support."
"To comply with the objectives that have been laid down, sufficient funding is necessary and it is, therefore, crucial that we increase the budget for forthcoming years."
"We voted in favour of this report despite the fact that, even in view of its limited objective - aid to associations which combat sexual violence and fight for women's and children's rights - the proposed budget is quite obviously insufficient."
"The report itself recognises this and lists the projects rejected due to lack of budgetary resources."
"We must, however, stress that, amongst the types of violence inflicted on women, who suffer not only sexual and domestic violence - they also suffer social violence which can in fact affect men as well, such as having to endure unacceptable working conditions."
"One example is working at night for women, which is permitted in industry by the European Parliament, or worse still, losing one's job and one's income."
"The inability to combat social violence and therefore prevent its consequences is also severely hampering efforts to combat domestic violence."
"Increasing numbers of women and children are victims of - as you would expect - physical, but also psychological violence."
"It is women and children who suffer the most from violence, but we must not forget that men are also sexually exploited and also suffer."
"We must therefore put in place effective measures to combat all forms of violence, by combining prevention, punitive action and support for victims."
"The Daphne programme is an effective instrument and it must be further developed."
"The fight against trafficking in human beings must include penalties that act as a deterrent and that are common across all Member States."
"All NGOs must be actively supported and violence must be understood in the broad sense."
"All forms of violence must be opposed because violence is unacceptable."
". (PT) There is an enormous gap between the declarations of good intent proclaimed in the Social Agenda and the way in which these are put into practice, as proved in the report itself, despite some weaknesses and some specific negative points with which we disagree and hence our abstention in the final vote."
"We welcome the report's criticism of the Commission, however, both with regard to issues of form and for the lack of information given to the European Parliament and the social partners, and for the delays in meeting commitments it has given, in particular concerning the following aspects:"
"amending Directive 92/85/EEC on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding, on the basis of the proposals tabled in the motion for a resolution adopted by the European Parliament on 6 July 2000;"
"the establishment of criteria for the recognition of disabilities and the submission of an effective action plan to prevent musculoskeletal damage occurring in the workplace;"
"and paying greater attention to the quality of work, to developing the social economy, to illiteracy, to combating illegal labour and discrimination against people with disabilities in terms of access to employment, to education and to vocational training."
"The aim of this Commission proposal for a regulation is to remove any restrictions imposed by the Member States on unfair sales promotions (price reductions outside sale periods, free gifts, below cost selling), such as the restrictions adopted in Greece in law 2941/01 banning below cost selling."
"This ruling will do even more to help large multinationals concentrate money and corner the market, because only they will be able to increase their overall profits, even if they sell certain products below cost."
"At the same time, it will be a disaster for small and medium-sized enterprises, which have already been hard hit by the implementation of the single internal market, and for consumers, who will be even more exposed to deception and will suffer the consequences when markets are cornered."
"The fact that it has opted for a regulation, which ensures immediate application, and the fact that the proposal was not discussed with the interested parties, especially SMEs, shows just how concerned the EU is to directly promote the interests of large companies."
"The whole affair illustrates exactly what it means by competition on the single internal market."
"The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece call for this regulation to be withdrawn and will be voting against the report."
"Since Mrs Patrie's legitimate request to refer the report back to committee was rejected and the amendments from the Left have not been adopted, I voted against the report along with my three colleagues from the Republican, Radical and Citizens' Left."
"The report dealing with the proposal for a regulation on sales promotions in the internal market, voted on by majority in the European Parliament, improves the European Commission proposal, although it contains some contradictions and incorrect points, which we voted against."
"We voted in favour, however, of the proposals that are intended to provide greater protection for consumers and micro-undertakings and small and medium-sized enterprises, by combating the habitual and repeated dumping practiced by certain economic groups, which use a predatory price strategy, in the de facto aim of ruining weaker competitors and of forcing them out of the market."
"We also support the proposals that are intended to uphold the most progressive national legislation, to protect subsidiarity and the sovereignty of every Member State, specifically in laws designed to protect consumers and minors and to support micro-undertakings and small and medium-sized enterprises, as has happened in Portugal, specifically with a ban on below cost selling outside sales seasons."
". (DE) Below cost selling has been a much-discussed issue over the past months."
"The Commission would prefer to use this regulation to lift the ban on this practice in various countries."
"Such a commitment would have catastrophic consequences for smaller producers, such as those in the agricultural and viticultural sectors."
"Unlike the major supermarket chains, they often sell only one product and cannot pass onto other products the losses involved in below cost selling."
"They would therefore lose all their capacity to compete, and, in order to counteract that, many producers would feel themselves constrained to use ingredients that were cheaper and thus of poorer quality."
"Lower prices would not alter the fact that it would still be the consumer who lost out in all this."
"It was with some satisfaction that I noted that the committee with competence in these matters has adopted the text of my amendment on the subject and managed to reach a compromise that satisfies almost everybody."
"In the Legal Affairs Committee, other amendments sought to prohibit any sales promotion whatever of alcoholic drinks such as wine, beer or spirits."
"There is no doubt that excessive consumption of alcohol needs to be stopped by means of appropriate education at an early stage."
"Moreover, all the Member States stipulate a minimum age for the public consumption of alcohol."
"Prohibiting any sales promotion whatever is, however, disproportionate, harming as it does all consumers rather than only the small minority who are addicted to alcohol and therefore need treatment."
"A majority on the Legal Affairs Committee realised the absurdity of this step and rejected the amendments to which I have referred."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"."
"(NL) These days, people are mainly seen as consumers."
"They have to try to accumulate as much money as possible by working long and hard, or through speculation."
"Anyone who fails to become rich fast, often at the expense of their fellow citizens, is considered a failure."
"The winners, on the other hand, are continually invited to hand over all their savings as quickly as possible to estate agents, those offering expensive holidays, and casinos. And also to schemes which will make them independent of the normal education, health care and public transport services, for these have been whittled down to a level that is now only acceptable to the losers."
"No wonder that the successful consumer is inundated with advertising, including from abroad."
"In this proposal, it is assumed that sales promotions, such as discounts, gifts and games, are conducive to welfare."
"In 2000, they accounted for a million jobs in nine Member States and investments to the tune of over EUR 40 billion."
"Although even the liberal-minded rapporteur, Mr Beysen, has to admit that such sales promotion adversely affects the ability to publish books, the fair distribution of medicines and encourages young people's addiction to alcohol and gaming machines, he does not focus his proposal on consumer protection but on the suspension of rules and fewer obligations for those who run companies."
"That is why I will be voting against it."
"I have supported the rapporteur's proposals, which significantly improve the text produced by the Commission and which seek to provide a satisfactory response to the points that could be most controversial."
"I abstained, however, from voting on the legislative resolution, because I believe it is still necessary closely to observe the follow-up given to this report in the legislative process."
"I agree with the ideas of ensuring price transparency and of strengthening legal certainty, responding to the pressing need to establish uniform rules with the introduction of the euro and corresponding to the new Community approach intended to provide more appropriate and coherent regulation at Community level."
"This proposal could contribute to clarifying contractual positions in a field of some sensitivity to consumers, such as sales promotions of the type covered by the regulation: discounts, free offers, prizes or opportunities to participate in promotional competitions or games, in the context of the selling of a product."
"I welcome in particular the constant focus on the need to provide full information in sales promotions, a feature that stands out in the new agreement on commercial communications policy and which I hope will run through future rules in this field, as the rapporteur recommends."
"The Member States - and France in particular - which have passed legislation, using their sovereign right, to regulate below cost selling and sales, have done so with the clearly stated aim of preserving the balance between manufacturers, distributors and consumers."
"It is the interests of each of these that the national parliaments have sought to protect."
"The Commission's desire, therefore, to remove restrictions on sales promotions, on the grounds of strengthening economic harmonisation, poses a direct threat to the interests and the balance of economic players."
"It is also - on the grounds of a misinterpreted benefit to the consumer - the image of our leading brands of products that could suffer under the policy , ahead of certain manufacturers' unscrupulous distributors - and their own economic restrictions - on which they thrive ."
"The amendments adopted by the parliamentary committees, including those that I tabled, have fortunately allowed respect for our national laws to be restored."
"Only on the condition that Parliament adopts these amendments shall I support this text."
"I fully support this report, which will potentially ensure that EU consumers operate in a level playing field and sales promotions are standardised across EU Member States."
"Indeed, one of the most compelling arguments in favour of the euro is that European citizens are able to compare prices across borders."
"This advantage is at present distorted by the fact that different types of sales promotion exist in member states and therefore cross-border price transparency is effectively distorted."
"Once this directive eventually comes into force, it will represent one more step towards the completion of a fully functioning single market."
"So this proposal is the best way to achieve price transparency and to ensure a level playing field."
"However, as the committee recommends, it should remain the prerogative of individual Member States to decide whether to ban discounts on fixed price products and I fully support the committee's insistence that the principle of subsidiarity must be upheld in this domain."
". (IT) I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work."
"State aid must be defined and provided by a nation at times of economic crisis."
"If aid were to become a normal, regular occurrence, far from benefiting the country or providing an essential means of overcoming difficult times, it would without a doubt exacerbate the problems of the recipients."
"The Berenguer Fuster report on the draft Commission regulation on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to state aid for employment should be read in this light, considering that these articles would also normally apply to the transport sector."
"The impending enlargement must be seen as an extraordinarily important, exceptional event."
"It will lead to a change in the distribution of work and to marked differences in salary levels and standards of living between the current Member States and the newly acceded countries."
"The potential structural distortions generated by the - certainly lower - cost of labour in these countries, by different environmental, social and technical standards and by strong competition between the labour forces on the market can be addressed by making the labour market more flexible and, to some extent, through the provision of state aid to employment."
"The accession of the candidate countries will lead, especially in the traditional economic sectors such as heavy industry, agriculture and transport, to excesses of labour, and these people will not be able to find work immediately in the new, emerging economic sectors."
"(Text abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of procedure)"
"The very title of this report is misleading in itself."
"The title talks of 'State aid for employment' whereas the report is, in fact, about funding to increase employers' profits."
"However much the report 'welcomes?greater transparency and legal certainty' in the areas of aid, tax relief and benefits which are granted to employers on the pretext of encouraging them to create jobs, it does not question employers' right to do what they want in their businesses."
"Nothing can prevent them, therefore, from pocketing the funding without creating a single job, which is what employers have routinely done for a long time."
"Since we do not wish to give our approval to this farce, we voted against the report."
"I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Berenguer Fuster on his work and on his report and then say what great benefit could be derived from a European Parliament resolution which seeks to encourage employment and which recognises the need for State aid."
"The report says that unemployment is too high."
"I would add that it is a tragedy and a real disease into which we must channel all our energies!"
"It is perfectly legitimate to use State aid to support a number of measures to combat unemployment and encourage employment."
"It was, incidentally, totally unacceptable to associate aid with increased labour market activity."
"However, since the right-wing Members voted in favour of the report, my colleagues from the Delegation of the Republican, Radical and Citizens' Left and I had to vote against the motion."
"We are concerned at the approach that the report insists on promoting when it states that 'the key to improving employment in the European Union is encouraging labour market flexibility through structural reform'."
"This ignores all the problems of unemployment caused by restrictive monetary policies and by constant privatisations, including in basic sectors of the economy and in social fields."
"It is also unacceptable that the report considers state aid for employment to be a last resort, thereby condemning disadvantaged regions and sectors in difficulty to failure and to poverty."
"Of particular concern is the damaging impact that its implementation could have in countries such as Portugal, with micro-undertakings and small and medium-sized enterprises which are experiencing serious difficulties, and in sectors such as ship building, which are affected by unfair international competition policies."
"Hence our vote against this report."
". (DE) I voted in favour of the Berenguer Fuster report, as I, like the rapporteur, support the Commission's approach to reforming the system of employment aid."
"I particularly welcome the way in which the planned limitation of the prior notification requirement now gives regional authorities more scope to develop local employment programmes, thus enabling them to respond quickly and flexibly, with targeted measures, to changed conditions in the labour market in the regions."
"It is in particular small and medium-sized enterprises that will benefit from the more lenient conditions, being able, where the need arises, to expect the speedy and straightforward payment of aid, which I emphatically support."
"The consolidation in a single text of current legislation on employment aid means that the Commission is also doing justice to its objective of greater transparency in the EU's lawmaking processes."
"There is one point, though, in the rapporteur's argument where he and I part company."
"The key to improving employment cannot be found in the greater labour-market flexibility for which he calls."
"It is far more a matter of responding to the changed situation in the labour market by rethinking employment policy, for example by using new working arrangements to guarantee full employment while simultaneously safeguarding quality jobs."
". (IT) We voted for Mr Berenguer Fuster's report."
"Indeed, it would be difficult not to, considering who the beneficiaries of this aid are and the goals of simplification and transparency that the Commission has set itself."
"The issue we need to reflect on, however, is the fact that, as the Commission is quite aware, in some regions of the Member States of the Union, the difference between being in an area receiving aid under Article 87(3) and not being in such an area is a tax reduction in excess of 12%."
"The question is then the content of Article 4(3) of the draft regulation, with reference precisely to the above-mentioned regions, for we believe that the method of determining the areas does not produce a wholly accurate definition of which areas are genuinely disadvantaged and that the Commission is aware of this."
"Consider the method used by local employment systems to define these areas and how it has been disregarded in some cases."
"We therefore believe that the current maps should be revised to ensure that they are consistent, irrespective of whether the regions themselves have used them."
"Otherwise, even with the planned 10% increase on the upper limit, the draft regulation would, in those cases, essentially serve the purpose of - covertly and only partially - remedying the errors made."
"We find it entirely understandable that the European Commission should consider the time to have come, on the basis of an active policy of employment aid, to establish more binding criteria and to lay them down in a single legal framework."
"In fact, this rationalisation is intended to pursue a dual objective: on the one hand, to simplify and clarify the system of regulating aid to employment, in the aim of ensuring greater transparency in the Commission's action and of facilitating understanding and monitoring of this action; and furthermore contributing to stimulating employment in the European Union, in line with the European employment strategy, especially for workers in the least-favoured categories."
"I have, therefore, approved the rapporteur's position, which supports, to a large extent, this Commission proposal, considering this to be the approach that will achieve the Lisbon Strategy, and I welcome in particular the references made to the need to support the economic development of the least-favoured regions of the European Union, with particular focus on the outermost regions."
"That concludes voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.53 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, 11 September is almost upon us, the first anniversary of that day when two aircraft, piloted by terrorists belonging to al?Qa'ida, crashed into the World Trade Centre, caused both towers to collapse, killed thousands of people and, at a stroke, changed the world - or, at least so we thought at the time."
"There have indeed been changes."
"Under UN mandate, an alliance against terrorism was forged."
"For the first time, a crisis was declared to be a matter for NATO, Article 5 of whose Treaty was invoked."
"The American President Bush called for the head of Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi billionaire who headed up the al?Qa'ida network, and the war against terrorism met with its first significant success in Afghanistan itself, where the fundamentalist Taliban regime, which was generally inhumane and in particular hostile to women, was driven from power and an interim government under President Karzai, which is putting down democratic roots, was established."
"One year on, we are of course all aware that the struggle against terrorism, as President Bush himself once said, will be a long one at various levels, and that quick victories are illusory."
"In Afghanistan itself, the Karzai government enjoys de facto power only in Kabul."
"The authority of the various provincial rulers belonging to different tribes is undiminished, and has, in some instances, even been reinforced, a fact demonstrated just as much by the murder of Commander Massoud as by the murder of Afghanistan's Vice-President Abdul Qadir, who had incurred the enmity of rival drug baron, supporters of Osama Bin Laden and of the Taliban, but possibly also of members of the Northern Alliance who had felt themselves bypassed."
"It is also far from clear whether or not Osama Bin Laden is still alive."
"What is beyond doubt is that the al?Qa'ida network has regenerated itself and reorganised both its guerrilla organisation, which is active not only in the neighbouring Pakistan, and also its sources of finance, which continue to flow in abundance."
"Anyone reading today's Herald Tribune will find a sobering report on the transfers of gold to Sudan through channels running from Pakistan and Iran."
"This means that the al?Qa'ida network and the Taliban militias still have large reserves of finance at their disposal, derived from the cultivation and sale of opium."
"Set against the sums involved here, the aid given by the European Union towards stabilising the situation in Afghanistan looks rather modest, even though the EU has become the largest donor of funds for this purpose."
"There is no doubt that we have to do this in order to bring peace to this country once under Soviet Communist occupation and ravaged by decades of civil war and thus make a contribution to consolidating the crisis region between Pakistan, Iran, India and the unstable Asiatic part of the former Soviet Union."
"We also have to do it for reasons of self-protection."
"Europe is a destination not only for Afghan drugs, but also for illegal immigrants, in the number of whom there has been a significant increase on the borders between the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria over the past year."
"There is, then, a need for humanitarian aid just as much as for targeted measures in the fight against terrorism and organised crime, a fight we will certainly have to carry on for a long time yet, and one in which we can expect no quick victories."
"Yet do it we must, if we are to demonstrate to the USA that we are to be taken seriously as a partner in an alliance against terrorism."
"Relations with the USA in the aftermath of 11 September have, to put it mildly, been beset by irritations."
"We are both saddened - Europeans when America goes it alone, and the USA by the European Union's lack of political unity and its military weakness, both exemplified by the EU's line on Iraq, which has to date been less than coherent."
"Also symptomatic of this are the USA's threatening gestures directed at Baghdad, which are not always credible."
"What is needed on both sides of the Atlantic is coherent crisis management combating not only the symptoms of international terrorism, but also and especially its causes, as rightly demanded by the former White House security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski."
"Developing such a strategy to pull the plug on the crises in the Middle East, settle the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, and neutralise Islamic political fundamentalism wherever it rears its head - and it has its boltholes in Europe itself - to all these things, the European Union can and must make a substantial contribution."
"EU aid in Afghanistan is an essential building block in this."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the European Union played a very active part in the democratisation of Afghanistan, for which particular thanks are due to the Commission and most especially its staff on the ground."
"It was as early as the International Women's Day in 1998 that European women started the 'Flower for the Women of Kabul' campaign, and deplored the human rights violations that excluded women in particular from education, medical treatment, work and political involvement."
"Another six years of the Taliban's despotic rule had gone by before things began to look up for democracy."
"The international anti-terror alliance then laid the spectre of the Taliban to rest."
"Democracy movements were launched at once, and the EU again played an active part in this on the Petersberg in Bonn."
"At the same time, albeit attracting almost no attention, the first Afghan Women's Summit was meeting in Brussels at the invitation of European women."
"It was there, for the first time and after two decades without political involvement, that it was possible for Afghan women, whether living in exile or in Afghanistan itself, to have their own forum and find themselves."
"International pressure made it possible for women to be first admitted to the Loya Jirga and subsequently to participate in the new transitional government."
"In the meantime, we saw to it that the Budget included funds to help the women make up a great deal of lost ground, and that it was again possible for self-help organisations such as the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA) to receive support from Budget funds."
"It is with consternation that we now hear it reported that the first schools for girls are being closed down again, that fundamentalists again want to force women out of public life, and that the political influence of women ministers is being curbed."
"All the political influence at our disposal must now be brought to bear in order to prevent the situation of women worsening still further and above all to ensure that aid reaches rural areas and is passed on to women."
"Jointly with the women on the European Council, we had taken the initiative of setting up a multinational group of women observers to ensure that women get the aid they need."
"Believing as I do that this fire must be kept alight, I now urgently call upon the Commission to continue to focus on the situation of women, and urge that we combat the principal evil, which is poverty and illiteracy among women."
"Even if world public opinion concentrates on other issues, I do think that we should continue to focus on Afghanistan and that we have to maintain a local presence there."
"My group, the Group of Social Democrats, will be sending a delegation to Afghanistan, and I look to the Commission to provide support for it in the shape of logistical aid."
"The threat of war in Iraq would destroy much that has been achieved, and so all our efforts are needed to help make peace in the region."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, following on from this morning's debate, it is encouraging to be able to read in the telegrams from Johannesburg that the President-in-Office of the Council, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, and the American Secretary of State, Colin Powell, held a meeting this morning in Johannesburg at which it was established that the United States would consult its allies about Iraq and that the US agreed with the EU about firstly trying to get Iraq to give international weapons inspectors free and unfettered access to the country."
"The Afghanistan debate covers two matters: the current issue of the alleged war crimes in Afghanistan and the longer term question of the situation itself in that troubled country."
"With regard to the alleged war crimes, we must now await the outcome of the UN investigation."
"If the investigation shows that war crimes have been committed, the people responsible must be found and prosecuted in accordance with the current regulations."
"There is really nothing more to be said about that matter at present."
"It has been very encouraging to hear the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner report now on developments in Afghanistan less than a year after the country lay in ruins."
"We can be pleased with the Bonn process and proud of the aid provided by the EU to that poverty-stricken country."
"We have in fact heard today about an EU success story in rebuilding a country, and we should thank the Commission in particular for its persistent efforts."
"We also know that we are only in the first phase, that there is a long way to go and that the new administration, or transitional government, is subject to both external and internal threats."
"Although much reduced in size, al-Qa'ida is still an external threat from hiding places in the regions bordering Afghanistan. Internally, the fact that warlords clearly continue to operate, are still behind the cultivation of opium poppies and are in a position to threaten the stability of Afghanistan is necessarily a source of concern."
"It is a threat to the country's integrity and to Mr Karzai's government, which is the best guarantee of a peaceful process of development involving the implementation of those values we cherish."
"We must therefore continue to maintain a close dialogue with the transitional government, as well as engage in close dialogue with any government resulting from the 2004 elections."
"Prompt and effective efforts on the part of the EU must be followed up by long-term efforts."
"The fact that the EU has just launched the 'Water for Life' initiative is commendably in line with what we have previously heard in this Chamber. Unlike almost all crops, opium poppies do not require much water."
"So let the EU supply water to Afghanistan, show responsibility and contribute to a more peaceful world."
"Mr President, I like to think and act to promote mediation and combating poverty and injustice as the means of resolving conflicts, not war and bombing, but I am not a saint: I am completely immersed in the complexity and contradiction of conflicts."
"I agree with Commissioner Patten: it is not enthusiasm that is needed - although a little would not go amiss - but solutions, and these solutions must not be the Danse macabre being performed by Mr Bush and Mr Sharon or Osama Bin Laden and Hamas, who are destroying people, nature and human and social rights."
"The conflict between forces of good and evil is reminiscent of the Middle Ages, and it undermines the rule of law."
"The Taliban have been defeated but their ideology lives on: many of their practices, with which those in power today are not unfamiliar, remain."
"The refugees are returning home but they are given no support, schools are reopening but schoolgirls have been the victims of a bomb attack, cinemas are reopening but they are banned from showing Indian films because they contain women without veils, women are banned from singing on the radio or television, rape and violence are common occurrences, the lethal, lucrative opium trade continues, and, although reconstruction is taking place - and it is a slow process - Afghanistan is in danger of forfeiting its sovereignty to money and corruption."
"For this and many other reasons, our economic and social aid must be provided swiftly and effectively to allow the establishment of the structures and infrastructure of a rule of law and to empower that part of civil society - particularly women - which is completely devoted to securing freedom, justice, development and peace for all men and women."
"The situation in Afghanistan is tragic and we must continue to help the country in the knowledge that there is a universal need for sovereignty and that there must be an end to war in the region."
"Mr President, in all our efforts to help construct a better Afghanistan we should not lose sight of why we are now involved there with such commitment."
"It is, of course, to root out terrorism, to help build a peaceable, well-disposed, durable and better society and to ensure that the extremists do not set down fresh roots either within the country or elsewhere."
"All our actions should be measured against these yardsticks and we should be under no illusions about the fragility of the situation, which poses major challenges both for ISAF and the other coalition forces operating within the country."
"There is now wider agreement about the desirability of ISAF broadening its mandate beyond Kabul."
"This is not just a matter of the availability of suitable international forces but, as Commission Patten has said, it also tests the willingness of reluctant local warlords, often backed by foreign interests in the region, to comply with the authority of Kabul."
"The Turkish armed forces are to be congratulated on the satisfactory completion of the first half of their span of command of ISAF."
"The building of a professional and reliable Afghan army and police force, which is happening in parallel largely under American, British and French auspices, will take time and there seems little doubt that ISAF will have to continue its operations next year and an early indication of the follow-on command arrangements is needed."
"The last thing we need, when action against Iraq is in the air, is uncertainty about military arrangements in Afghanistan."
"I should like to highlight three particular aspects of the situation: refugees, EU funding and the landmine issue."
"Firstly, refugees, which Mr Haarder touched on earlier."
"There is now a degree of security in Afghanistan."
"Yet, while many refugees have returned to the country, millions remain in Iran and Pakistan."
"Some talk about two or three million respectively, though estimates differ significantly."
"Furthermore, a large proportion of refugees and asylum-seekers coming to Britain and other European countries originate from Afghanistan."
"We should bear in mind that many have extremist backgrounds and that we are therefore vulnerable to the implantation and cultivation of Islamic extremists within our own societies, not just from Afghanistan."
"This is madness."
"More focused and determined action is needed to deal with these problems and encourage return to Afghanistan."
"On the funding question, the USD 4.5 billion pledged at Tokyo in January, including over USD 1 billion from the European Union, has, for the most part, been slow to arrive - although I note the Commissioner's remarks about the way the Commission has responded."
"There is an absorption problem: the Afghan Interim Government lacks the institutions to disburse the money efficiently and needs greater assistance in this area."
"At the same time there has to be proper control and management of international funds."
"I say this at a time when, yet again, the European Commission's procedures in this respect have been the subject of serious criticism and, as in the Palestine Authority area until recently, the issue of proper control of funds appears to have been largely avoided by the international community."
"The Bonn Agreement merely states: 'The members of the Interim Administration shall abide by a Code of Conduct elaborated in accordance with international standards.'"
"This Code is not published and, in any case, seems less than adequate."
"We must insist that measures be put in place by the Afghan authorities and the international community, including the European Union, to ensure the proper management, accounting and use of these funds."
"Finally, the question of landmines, which has already been touched on by other speakers."
"Afghanistan is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world."
"This was the case before last September and the situation has been exacerbated since then."
"The presence of landmines and UXOs - unexploded ordnance - are a major obstacle to economic and social regeneration."
"It is estimated that between five and ten people are injured in mine blasts every day in Afghanistan and that an estimated 10 million mines litter the country."
"We welcome the undertaking by the Afghan Interim Government to accede to the Geneva Convention banning the use of antipersonnel landmines, but the mines are still there in the ground and the victims hobble through the streets."
"There is an urgent requirement for a properly coordinated and funded programme of action to enable the resumption of mine action operations at least at the level they had reached before last September."
"A concerted time-limited effort is needed, otherwise we are still going to be talking about this in ten years' time."
"There is much to be done in Afghanistan."
"Let us get it right, working in harmony with the United States and other allies - and all the time remember why we are there."
"Mr President, a great deal still needs to be done for Afghanistan, and this resolution is a good political contribution."
"I would, however, just like to focus on three points."
"Firstly, we must restore the role, responsibility and visibility of the United Nations."
"In terms of assessing the outcome of the intervention, in terms of analyses which would justify any further action, we note that the United Nations is absent, often considered to be an intruder, and is, in effect, excluded."
"This unilateralist approach does not further the cause of Afghanistan, not least in that we are legitimately and frankly concerned at the way we are blindly placing all our trust in President Bush, whose approach to foreign policy is quite inconsistent and has, moreover, even been questioned by his Executive."
"Secondly, we reject double standards in matters of human rights."
"We call for guarantees of fair trials for all accused persons, whatever the offence they are being charged with."
"We call for respect for international conventions."
"It may be that some of them need to be reworked and revised, and they must genuinely be revised, not set aside."
"We call for these guarantees to be applied to all accused persons because it is a fundamental rule, a fundamental principle that there is no room for compromise in human rights, particularly if it is designed to make things easier for ourselves."
"I would stress: whoever the accused person is."
"Lastly, Mr President, through this resolution, we call upon the Afghan authorities to make the greatest possible endeavours to obtain justice for the journalists killed in Afghanistan and to expose the truth behind their murders - I reiterate, to obtain justice and to reveal the truth: as well as justice, we demand to be informed of the reasons why many journalists have been killed."
"If we have had the opportunity to find out about what has happened in Afghanistan, it is partly thanks to the journalists who decided to go and report on this war on the spot."
"To call for justice for those who fell doing their duty, Mr President, and for the truth behind their deaths to be revealed, is the least that Parliament can do now."
"Mr President, a year has now passed since the tragic 9/11 events which triggered the war against Afghanistan, now mercifully in a mopping-up phase to search out and destroy remnants of the odious Taliban regime and their al-Qa'ida terrorist allies."
"Nevertheless, Afghanistan has come a long way since the rout of Mullah Omar and the disappearance, hopefully for good, of Osama Bin Laden."
"Girls are back at school, music and film are allowed again and football is replacing public hangings."
"We have had a successful Bonn Conference and a Tokyo Donors Conference."
"The Loya Jirga was opened by the former king, whom I had the pleasure of meeting last September in Rome."
"He has now been granted the title of 'Father of the Nation', as he has worked tirelessly and assiduously behind the scenes to reunite his nation and stop squabbling, particularly amongst the Pashtun communities."
"However ISAF, the International Security Assistance Force, still has its work cut out."
"We have witnessed the assassination of two ministers and this week a bomb attack, presumably aimed against western forces."
"We still see the evils of warlordism, ethnic division and a flourishing drug trade."
"I was shocked to read that the opium crop this year was up to three thousand tonnes, overtaking even that of the Golden Triangle's 900 tonnes in Myanmar and Thailand."
"We still have the problem of considerable sympathy for Islamic terrorism in neighbouring Iran, where some al-Qa'ida fighters have allegedly taken refuge, but almost certainly many are sheltering in Pakistan, where president Musharraf walks a tightrope between cooperating with the West and yet not fully cracking down on his home-grown Jihadi Islamic terrorist groups despite pledging to do so."
"These groups infiltrate Indian Kashmir, causing mayhem and making a war between the two nuclear neighbours a very real possibility."
"Clearly, President Musharraf does not want a peaceful Kashmir election to be held."
"Pakistan is also not fully cooperating with ISAF, allowing it to enter the tribal areas of the north-west frontier region where al-Qa'ida is currently regrouping to threaten Afghanistan's government and civil society."
"The West must now be prepared to extend the mandate of Turkish-led ISAF forces beyond this December at the UN and extend their remit to Afghan provinces as well, to end the warlordism and extend the government's authority in the provinces as part of the nation-building exercise and construct a national army and police force and distribute much needed aid to a desperately poor country."
"Sadly, the USD 1.8 billion promised in Tokyo for reconstruction has yet to materialise."
"Only humanitarian aid has been seen so far."
"The recent Operation Mountain Sweep has only brought a few weapon caches to light and we still have a long way to go to make this beautiful country a peaceful and prosperous one and a respectable member of the international community again as it was once in the 1960s and 1970s."
"I feel particularly strongly that the government of Afghanistan should grant a moratorium on the use of Sharia law in areas such as the stoning to death of women and the amputation of limbs, in order to show how a modern Islamic country respects international covenants and treaty obligations and promotes justice without cruelty or abuse of human rights."
"War criminals must also be brought to book and tried."
"Refugees coming to the West who are terrorist sympathisers or have been active with the Taliban or al-Qa'ida must be sent back to face the music."
"I sincerely wish President Karzai and ex-king Mohammad Zahir Shah well with all the challenging problems that they face in the months to come."
"Overall, I sincerely hope that Afghanistan will again be a respectable member of the international community as it once was."
"(Applause on the right)"
"Mr President, wars, the Soviet presence and the Taliban have left a State without institutions or industry and with its agriculture struggling to survive. It has left a State with levels of poverty and illiteracy, including returning illiteracy, in men as well as women, which are truly incredible."
"Furthermore, the lack of integration between the different cultural, social, religious and ethnic identities making up Afghan society increases the complexity of the problem with which the transitional government has to deal on a daily basis."
"As has been said, governing this country means not just carrying out essential institutional reforms, starting with the Constitution, but creating a basic banking system from scratch with all speed, disseminating education and promoting respect between the citizens and ethnic groups, rebuilding cities and infrastructure, separating military and civil affairs and creating anew industry and agriculture which will be able to survive in a globalised world."
"The challenge facing the transitional government is not inconsiderable, for it is a question of doing everything at once with all possible speed, as cheaply as possible and with the widest possible participation."
"Clearly, these tasks are not easy, particularly if they have to be carried out within a relatively short space of time."
"Moreover, Mr Karzai has explicitly undertaken to achieve a stable peace between the citizens, between ethnic groups and between the sexes, to establish the bases for democratisation of the country in the transitional government's two years of office."
"However, as Commissioner Patten said, the path is still very tortuous."
"There has been no real, practical improvement in the situation of women, in particular, despite Mr Karzai's statements."
"The level of illiteracy among women is incredible - six or seven percent compared to 39% previously."
"Even the new government has deteriorated from this point of view, with some warlords assuming a political role not just in the decentralised administrations but in the Kabul government too."
"Censorship has increased, as has been mentioned, and women continue to wear the burka and are marginalised, particularly in the southern and south-eastern regions."
"The Union must multiply its endeavours to ensure that the hopes which were raised at Bonn are not completely dashed and that the present situation of far-reaching inequality, discrimination and failure to respect human rights does not become established in the long-term."
"Mr President, I think everyone agrees that big improvements have taken place in Afghanistan in the last eight months, and I should like to thank MEPs for the debate that has been conducted, but there is also agreement that there are still major problems, as emphasised in, for example, some of the most recent speeches."
"I should like firstly to add a couple of remarks about the issue of possible infringements of human rights, for example in connection with the recent discovery of mass graves in northern Afghanistan."
"There must be no doubt that the Council attaches crucial importance to the Afghan Government's and the Afghan people's taking responsibility for the past and for the war crimes that might have been committed."
"That does not of course mean only the atrocities committed by the Taliban regime."
"In that connection, President Karzai's statement that the issue of the mass graves is to be investigated is encouraging."
"The UN will play a central role in assisting the Afghan Government with this work. The EU too will of course help as far as possible, partly through our special representative, Mr Vendrell."
"Regarding the difficult security situation, especially in the areas outside Kabul, it is my view that the most realistic and forward-looking approach at the moment is to strengthen the transitional government's ability to take care of security itself, partly through assisting with demobilisation, building up the army and the police, developing programmes designed to root out drugs production and setting up an efficient judiciary."
"A number of EU Member States are making valuable contributions to this work."
"That also applies to the important task, to which Mr Van Orden referred, of clearing the many mines which are a constant danger to the civilian population and make economic regeneration more difficult."
"The Council is also alert to the large need for aid of various kinds which has been highlighted on many sides of this Chamber and which is perhaps greater than first assumed, partly because of the large number of refugees who have returned."
"In order to contribute to stability in the country, we must, as has been stated, secure a visible peace dividend for the Afghan population."
"Aid is also an important tool in our efforts to strengthen the transitional government at the expense of the local warlords."
"I might point out that, at the meeting of the General Affairs Council in July, the Chairman of the Council reminded the Member States of the need to ensure that the promises made at the Tokyo Donor Conference earlier in the year are complied with in good time."
"Finally, the issue of the situation of women in Afghanistan was raised on quite a few sides of the Chamber."
"Right from the beginning, the strengthening of women's rights has been an absolutely central feature of EU policy, and we shall pursue this objective both in our dialogue with the Afghan parties and through the aid we provide."
"As Mrs Izquierdo Rojo said, it is a question of replacing burkas with driving licences."
"I agree entirely."
"Commissioner Patten will no doubt also say a little about this."
"In an overall assessment of the situation in Afghanistan and of the efforts by the international community, it is important to keep a sense of proportion."
"As many have pointed out, there are serious problems in Afghanistan today. There are problems with security, with drugs production and, especially, with women's rights."
"Compared with the situation less than a year ago, the conditions under which ordinary Afghans live have improved no end."
"It may be said that still more might have been expected, but I do not in actual fact think it could have been."
"In view of the circumstances, there was reason to fear the worst."
"The EU and the Member States reacted quickly and generously, as soon as the opportunity presented itself."
"Thousands of Europeans, soldiers, police, emergency aid workers and officials are now making invaluable efforts to help Afghanistan get back on its feet."
"It is a difficult, thankless and dangerous task. Many had to lose their lives."
"We must, of course, always be receptive to criticism, but the efforts of all the courageous and committed people who have helped rebuild Afghanistan must not be belittled."
"On the contrary, we owe it to them to point out the major results that have been achieved."
"Europe has nothing to be ashamed of in Afghanistan, and I would just add, last of all, that 100 000 Afghans are now returning home to Afghanistan."
"Only very few are obtaining asylum in our countries, because it is now safe in Afghanistan, in any case in large areas of the country."
"In this connection, it is a question of acting in accordance with the declaration from the Seville Summit and making vigorous efforts to facilitate repatriation."
"That is something we owe to Afghanistan and to those people who are now taking the courageous step of returning."
"Mr President, let me make one or two comments in reply to this debate."
"First of all, I am grateful for the kind words expressed about the work that has been done by our Commission staff in Kabul and Afghanistan as a whole."
"Those tributes are wholly justified."
"The remarks made about the International Security Assistance Force underline the importance of the role that has been undertaken by the military in extending security."
"I am sure that Member States will note what a number of Members of this House have said about the possibility of extending the role of ISAF and extending its mandate."
"It is certainly the case that, if we want to see the authority of the Transitional Authority run right across the whole of the country, then it is imperative that we do not undermine that authority by reinventing the warlords as part of the continuing campaign against al-Qa'ida and the Taliban."
"It is absolutely imperative that we give all our support to President Karzai and his team."
"I want to make three other points."
"First of all, Mrs Maes reminded us of the great importance of not making the same mistakes that we made after the withdrawal of Soviet troops."
"We are not engaged in what has occasionally been rather derisorily described as nation-building or, by one distinguished politician, as social work."
"All I can say is that it is a pity there was not more social work and nation-building in the 1980s after the withdrawal of Soviet troops."
"We might have avoided some of the excesses of the Taliban if that had been the case and avoided the problems that have been visited upon us."
"What the honourable Member said is a reminder that the task that we have put our shoulder to is not going to be a short one."
"We have to be in Afghanistan, we have to be working in partnership with Afghanistan for many years to come."
"It is going to take a long time to complete this work."
"Several honourable Members - principally ladies, although it should be an issue of just as much importance to people of my sex as well - referred to gender issues."
"We must ensure that they get proper priority in our development assistance and development programmes."
"Mrs Izquierdo Rojo asked about exchanging burkas for car licences."
"She has not, alas, been able to stay with us for the end of the debate, but I will examine the point that she made and we will certainly ensure that the delegation to which she referred gets as much help as is required."
"It is extremely important for Members of this House to visit Afghanistan, see for themselves what is going on and give their support to the early stages of the democratic process in that country."
"Let me now deal with the issue of implementing the pledges and promises that were made in Tokyo."
"It is obviously important, as we discovered in Kosovo, in East Timor and in other countries and societies recovering from crisis, to ensure that the help which is pledged arrives as swiftly as possible."
"Not all is perfect by any means in Afghanistan."
"When Mr Tannock said that only humanitarian aid had arrived so far, that was a tad exaggerated."
"Certainly, as I made clear in my own speech, a great deal of reconstruction assistance has already been provided by the European Commission and others."
"It is particularly notable that the money we have been providing for budgetary support just to get government running - and we have probably been the biggest providers of that support - has certainly been provided rapidly and has been well used."
"I want to refer to the point made by Mr Van Orden about ensuring that even as one spends money rapidly, it is spent prudently and transparently because we have to be aware of the Court of Auditors, we have to be aware of the terrors of appearing in front of the Committee on Budgetary Control or the Committee on Budgets, we have to be aware of the importance of keeping European public opinion on our side."
"Just as in the case of the Palestinian Authority, to which he referred, it is the European Commission which has actually led the way in ensuring that reformed and transparent financial controls are put in place."
"We have led the way in reforming those financial controls which everybody is now supporting and using."
"Equally in Afghanistan, it was the European Commission which made itself tiresome by arguing initially for dollarisation of the budget, just as we did in Kosovo."
"We were in fact the only people arguing for dollarisation of the budget."
"We have settled reasonably happily for other arrangements, in close consultation with the International Monetary Fund."
"I do get fed up with the suggestion again and again that we are more lax in the way we support other countries and other governments in crisis than anybody else."
"On the whole, what we are now managing to do is to provide assistance more rapidly and in ways which will actually stand up to the closest scrutiny by this Parliament and by the Court of Auditors."
"Sometimes we should actually recognise what we are achieving and not just assume that what tabloid newspapers say about us is correct."
"Mr President, Mr Van Orden extends his apologies to the Commissioner."
"He had to meet a four o'clock deadline, but he will read the Commissioner's reply in the transcripts tomorrow with great interest."
"I have received six motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, the fourth Asia-Europe summit, or ASEM Meeting, is to be held in less than three weeks' time in Copenhagen on 23 and 24 September, thereby giving ASEM cooperation a prominent place in European policy on Asia."
"Since its first summit six years ago, ASEM has been characterised by ever broader and more fruitful cooperation in a range of areas of common interest to Europe and Asia."
"More than 40 initiatives have been launched in areas as diverse as money laundering, illegal migration, people smuggling, child welfare, human rights, environmental protection, educational exchanges, lifelong learning and international cooperation."
"The number of meetings has also increased."
"In between the summits, ASEM's foreign ministers and ministers of finance and economic affairs meet annually, for example, partly for the purpose of improving the summits and making efforts to ensure that the best possible results are achieved through the ASEM process."
"There are more than two billion people living in the ASEM countries."
"Together, they produce more than half of what is produced throughout the world."
"The Asian ASEM countries form the EU's second largest trading partner."
"This state of affairs illustrates the considerable significance of ASEM and the importance of the two regions' continuing to cooperate fruitfully and in promising ways."
"A successful summit at the end of this month is therefore a high priority for the Danish EU Presidency."
"In common with the three previous ASEM summits, ASEM 4 will be divided into three work sessions, one for each of the main areas of cooperation."
"These are: 1) political dialogue, 2) economic cooperation and 3) social, cultural and educational issues."
"Moreover, the forthcoming summit will include, as an innovation, an informal breakfast debate under the heading, 'Dialogue Between Cultures and Civilisations'."
"The idea is that the political dialogue should be based on the new international situation following 11 September, and it will involve a debate on the new challenges we face in terms of security policy."
"That means, for example, organised cross-border crime that affects us all."
"It is first and foremost a question of how, in the context of ASEM cooperation, we can unite in combating international terrorism, as well as other transnational threats such as the drugs trade, money laundering and illegal migration."
"A broad approach is required in this connection, with the emphasis on combating the underlying factors that can form a seedbed for extremism and intolerance. Among the matters to which we must attach importance are the fight against poverty and better access to education."
"With a view to translating words into action, the expectation is that the discussions will result in the adoption of a declaration on cooperation between Europe and Asia on the combating of international terrorism, combined with a cooperation programme based on existing ASEM activities for combating cross-border crime."
"The political dialogue traditionally involves an exchange of opinions about development in the two regions."
"The subjects will undoubtedly include the most recent developments in the Korean Peninsula, and a declaration concerning the Korean Peninsula is expected to be issued at ASEM 4 with a view to promoting reconciliation and cooperation."
"Other subjects might include EU enlargement and the development of cooperation under ASEAN+3."
"Discussion of economic matters will concentrate on economic and financial priorities in the light of the global economic recession, the consequences of the recession for the two regions and the opportunities for cooperating with a view to rectifying the situation."
"The current efforts to promote trade, investment and economic cooperation may, for example, be continued by working towards the implementation of the objectives formulated in the two ASEM economic action programmes, the Trade Facilitation Action Plan (TFAP) and the Investment Promotion Action Plan (IPAP)."
"Economic, financial and monetary integration as a growth factor is also expected to be discussed at the summit, as is the WTO Development Round as an essential prerequisite of sustainable economic development."
"It will be natural to use the ASEM process to add momentum to the Doha Development Round."
"In light of the results achieved in the Doha Round, there will be the possibility of strengthened regional cooperation with a view to achieving further progress in the economic relations between the EU and the Asian ASEM partners."
"ASEM's efforts to break down barriers to trade and investment are based on proposals from high-ranking private sector business leaders via the Asia-Europe Business Forum (AEBF) whose tasks include that of helping improve trade relations between Asia and Europe."
"This organisation's annual forum will take place - under my own chairmanship, incidentally - directly before the ASEM 4 summit."
"In the third main area - that of social, cultural and educational issues - the general theme will be that of measures for combating the unintended consequences of globalisation."
"The importance of developing human resources, including educational cooperation and lifelong learning, is expected to be given a central place in this context."
"One objective is to ensure that economic growth is reflected in progress in the social sphere that will go on to form the basis for social stability."
"A seminar on the subject is intended as the first step on the way."
"The discussions during the third work session will also relate to environmental issues and include a discussion of the ASEM partners' opportunities for consolidating and developing cooperation in the environmental sphere, partly in the light of the Johannesburg summit."
"ASEM brings together a broad range of different civilisations and cultures across geographical, ethnic, religious and socio-economic boundaries and, in that way, the ASEM process helps create trust between the regions."
"By, as it were, building bridges between the European and Asian cultures and civilisations, ASEM is a forum well suited to the dialogue that is necessary in the fight against international terrorism's attempts to split the international community."
"That is the background to the fact that the informal breakfast discussion I mentioned, under the heading 'Dialogue Between Cultures and Civilisations', is to be arranged at ASEM 4 with the purpose of promoting mutual understanding between Europe and Asia."
"The subjects might well be the significance of education in the efforts to promote understanding of other cultures and civilisations, the importance of equal access to information and significance of closer contacts between the nations of Europe and Asia."
"The expectation is that this special discussion will form the basis for an ongoing dialogue within ASEM concerning cultures and civilisations."
"I have noted with great interest the observations and recommendations by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, contained in the European Parliament's report of 16 July 2002 on the Commission Communication on a Strategic Framework for Enhanced Partnerships between Europe and Asia."
"I would point out in this connection that, with the forthcoming summit, we in the Council view ASEM-based cooperation between Europe and Asia as having advanced a stage further so that it now forms a better basis for meeting the common challenges we face."
"I hope we can achieve the objectives, with which I am in agreement and which are to be found in Parliament's report."
"As someone who was present here in Parliament at the start of European cooperation - I was chairman of the Japan delegation - I am impressed by what it has grown into."
"I should like to thank Parliament for the interest it has shown and also draw attention to the personal contacts that exist between members of the European Parliament and the Asian parliaments."
"The importance of these cannot be overestimated, and the Presidency therefore attaches importance to Parliament's report on ASEM cooperation."
"Mr President, allow me to start by congratulating the Commission."
"The Commission's document, its view of EU-Asia relations, which is the topic of my report, is clear, coherent and shows understanding for the situation Asia is facing, and there is a desperate need for this."
"One of the flaws in the Europe-Asia relations is, in my view, the Council's minimalist approach to date, particularly by Foreign Affairs Ministers."
"An all-time low was, to my mind, our Ministers' paper-thin contribution to ASEM III in Seoul, which was in sharp contrast to the Commission's contribution over there."
"This is no longer acceptable."
"Anyone who has worked on this over the past year knows that firm and concrete steps need to be taken, for this is what Asia and Europe's challenges require."
"Steps that go beyond strong, economic cooperation - of which, I, incidentally, am greatly in favour - and that go beyond window dressing and the endless symbolism that is meant to be taken as policy."
"I am therefore pleased with the Commissioner's announcement that a South?East Asia strategy will be adopted soon, for that is indeed the missing piece in the jigsaw puzzle."
"I can easily illustrate the challenge we are facing in the area of human rights by quoting an example from everyday life."
"In October last year, I reported in this Parliament on the case of Mr Bin Vinh Trinh in Vietnam."
"Following a lengthy stay abroad, Mr Trinh had made investments in his own country."
"He was subsequently detained under false pretences and his possessions were seized."
"This was a tragic event for him and his family, but, above all, sent a very negative signal to possible investors in Vietnam."
"We are now a year on."
"Some progress has been made, but not anything like enough."
"Mr Trinh's possessions have still not been returned to him and those who falsely accused him have still not been brought to justice."
"The European Union is currently Vietnam's key donor, but a parallel focus on respecting human rights is lacking."
"This makes the policy incoherent and certainly lacking in one of the areas in which Europe always prides itself."
"Not without reason did the UN human rights committee recently report on a large number of human rights abuses in Vietnam."
"Other Asian countries, including Cambodia or North Korea, did not escape the UN committee's condemnation either."
"It would be impossible to list them all one by one, but I hope that the message is clear."
"The observation of human rights, including, for example, the protection of investors, cannot be seen in isolation from economic cooperation."
"They are both interdependent."
"Not only does the European Union consider itself to be the guardian of human rights, but also the supporter of democratisation processes and young democracies across the world."
"Across the world?"
"Not quite, for surprisingly, there is a young democracy in Asia which should not count on any support, namely Taiwan."
"The way in which Europe and our Council treat this country is hypocritical."
"This is the only way I can describe it."
"Taiwan is a budding democracy with which we maintain sound economic ties."
"To give you an example: last year, President Chen Shui-bian was unable to receive his Liberal International Prize for Freedom, because he was refused a visa, whilst representatives of the People's Republic of China had a great time travelling across the entire Continent."
"We are all acquainted with the democratic content of the regime in Beijing."
"I can totally understand that Saddam Hussein and Robert Mugabe are refused visas, but surely it is very bizarre to bar an elected leader from a democratic country, who is on a private visit."
"Not one Member State wanted to grant the liberal-democratic guest a visa, and the Council showed its weakest side by not lifting a finger."
"I therefore warmly welcome the Commission's plans to open an office in Taipei."
"In fact, I do this for other Asian countries too."
"Commissioner, you asked for credit, well, here it is."
"Following the harsh words I have spoken about the Council, I should like to say to my good friend, Mr Haarder, that I was pleased with his comments about the preparations of ASEM IV."
"His words inspire confidence."
"A comprehensive and serious approach to ASEM IV was needed, and I hope that he will receive actual support within the Council for this."
"Economic cooperation - investments by SMEs spring to mind, but also political dialogue and exchanges - the Minister has quoted the entire list - are of major importance."
"By way of conclusion, it is not as if we were still living in the Rudyard Kipling's era, who observed: east is east and west is west, and never the twain shall meet."
"Democratic rule of law is central in Asia too."
"There is no Asian model, or, in fact, a European model."
"This is why I should like to finish off by reminding you of the words of a famous Asia expert, which he wrote some four years ago in his book on China and Hong Kong. He said 'it is absurd to argue for the existence of any fundamental difference between the personal standards and moral principles of Asians on the one hand and Europeans and Americans on the other, for decency is decency, East and West?."
"These are wise words, Commissioner Patten, that have not lost any of their truth."
"Mr President, Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, my dear Bertel, Commissioner, I will start by saying how glad I am that, as well as people watching the debate, there are in the galleries diplomats from the People's Republic of China and also representatives of the freely-elected parliament of Taiwan."
"I think it is a great thing that both sides of the straits are following our debate today."
"Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I speak on behalf of the PPE Group when I make the observation that we very much welcome your statements on the preparations for the fourth ASEM process."
"I believe that your statements constitute impressive evidence of the careful and committed way in which both the Council and the Commission have prepared for the ASEM IV meeting."
"My group, however, calls for something about which I would ask you to say something in greater detail, namely, in view of the plethora of issues to be discussed, which the President-in-Office of the Council has mentioned, for there to be definite action by the Heads of State and of Government, with firm timetables and defined objectives."
"It is not enough to do as we did at ASEM III and discuss all the problems we have in the world, taking in the economy, culture, politics and education, leaving the public to wonder after the event what actually came out of it all."
"Hence our preference, and our demand, for fewer but definite plans for closer cooperation between Asia and Europe."
"Please allow me to pick out from the abundance of issues that have been mentioned, just three on which I believe it important to us in Parliament that the Heads of State and of Government in Europe and Asia should bring forth definite results."
"The first is that a start be made on a special process of bringing the two cultural horizons together."
"It is precisely in view of the anniversary of the terrible events of 11 September that Europe and Asia, whatever their many historic, cultural and religious differences, must define, for the sake of our co-existence and peace in the world, what they have in common, what binds them together and draw conclusions from this."
"We expect this political and cultural dialogue to have a definite starting point."
"The second issue is one that Bertel Haarder, being a Dane, will well understand. As regards terrorism, there is one point on which we want something definite, namely the combating of terrorism at sea."
"Over and over again, our ships, when sailing between Asia und Europe, fall prey to pirates in certain narrow stretches of sea."
"We cannot explain to the public how it is that we are in a position to combat terrorism throughout the world, but apparently incapable of facing up to terrorists in narrow stretches of sea, terrorists who endanger our ships' crews and kill them!"
"The third is the problem of migration."
"In the President-in-Office of the Council, whose remit not only includes European policy but also immigration, we have a good partner, one who will see to it that definite decisions will actually be taken in the course of ASEM IV on how we can cooperate better in combating the illegal movement of people between Asia and Europe."
"I will now turn briefly to Mr Maaten's report, which is of course an excellent one."
"Time compels me to highlight only five aspects of it, so please forgive me for that."
"Commissioner Patten, you pointed out that the issue of enlarging ASEM's membership calls for a consensual approach, but you quite rightly understood that we in Parliament want to encourage you to talk with our Asian partners in ASEM IV in preparation for the Hanoi conference."
"What is at issue is the assertion that 'we will enlarge from 15 states to 20'."
"As Europeans, we consider it important that Asia should concentrate particularly on including such countries as India and Taiwan in the Asia process."
"You yourself pointed out the special role that India and Taiwan play."
"I believe that we should, so to speak, 'push' these countries in order to get them accepted."
"You have already demonstrated political commitment to a dialogue on human rights, and on that you have our full support."
"I believe that the human rights dialogue with the People's Republic of China, which has just begun, has demonstrated that both sides will from now on be working on the basis of human rights being universal in character."
"Let there be an end to the appalling argument about whether there are Asian or European human rights - on the contrary, human rights are universal, and it is on that basis that the dialogue should be proceeded with."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, Europe should also perhaps play more of a part in the prevention and resolution of conflict in Asia."
"The security of the region is of crucial importance for the world as a whole."
"That is why we should also give constructive support to the political dialogue between the People's Republic of China and Taiwan on the basis of democracy, peoples' right to self-determination, respect for human rights and for the rule of law."
"We should also be endeavouring to play some sort of role in reducing the tensions between India and Pakistan."
"This has to do not only with the protection of cultural minorities, but also with the protection of Christian minorities in the region."
"We are very grateful to you, Commissioner Patten, for referring, in your capacity as the Commission's spokesman, to the prompt inauguration of the delegation to Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Cambodia, Laos and Nepal."
"That is something that Parliament has long desired."
"We need to have higher-profile representation in a continent comprising half of the world's population."
"On that you have our support."
"Please permit me to conclude on a note of mild criticism."
"Today finds us discussing the great importance of Asia and Europe, and the two continents' relationship with one another."
"I hope I am not off beam in saying that there will soon be, and also in September, a meeting, a summit between the European Union and China, which is scheduled to take one day."
"I wonder whether the Heads of State and of Government should not perhaps take longer than just one day to embark on a truly in-depth dialogue with the People's Republic of China."
"I think that would be appropriate in view of that country's significance and that of the continent."
"Madam President, I welcome the Commission's communication, 'Europe and Asia: A Strategic Framework for Enhanced Partnerships', and Mr Maaten's report, for which we congratulate him."
"We have in the past too often neglected Asia and focused more on other regions of the world, but in fact it contains a majority of the world's population."
"We welcome the recognition, both in the report and the Commission statement, that we must engage with Asia, not only in trade and economics, but in other areas as well: cultural exchanges, for example, particularly between Europe and Asia's moderate Islamic states; justice and home affairs, in the war against terrorism, drugs traffic and organised crime, all self-evidently with a global dimension; environmental policy, where Europe and Asia face the same threat from pollution and environmental degradation; security policy, where, in an increasingly globalised world, a crisis on the Korean Peninsula - as Commissioner Patten mentioned - would threaten the peace and stability of the whole world."
"That is one reason why the European Union is engaged in the KEDO process."
"We therefore welcome the emergence of Asian voices speaking together through ASEAN and other regional fora."
"We also welcome and would like to encourage and deepen the widening of the ASEM process and its parallel parliamentary dialogue through ASEP."
"I had the opportunity to participate in the first ASEP meeting here in Strasbourg back in 1996 and in last week's second ASEP meeting in Manila, where we achieved a unanimity of views with statements on terrorism, the environment, on human rights for women and children."
"Here Members of the European Parliament from Germany, Spain, Belgium and Italy joined with colleagues from China, Japan, Korea and the Philippines to agree that Kyoto needs to be ratified; the UN must be the basis of the global war against terrorism; positive action is required to address discrimination against women; we should work with trade unions and other representatives of civil society to combat child labour."
"The fundamental problem is poverty, with hundreds of millions of people around the world, particularly in Asia, living on less than one euro a day."
"We hope Parliament will agree to the proposal in the amendment that I and other Members of Parliament have tabled to host ASEP III early in 2004."
"We can support the broad thrust of Mr Maaten's report."
"My only criticism is that an attempt has been made to hijack the report on behalf of the Taiwan lobby."
"Of course Members of Parliament have a perfect right to do this, but we should be aware of what we are being asked to approve."
"I would remind Members of the provisions of Rule 9(1), Annex I, Article 1 on declarations of interest."
"On behalf of the Socialist Group, I have tabled amendments to attempt to correct these distortions."
"Yes, we must recognise Taiwan as one of the most important trading entities for the EU, but here we are being asked to go further."
"If we want to abrogate our support of the one-China policy we followed in the past, we should do so directly, rather than by hiding it within paragraph 35 on the WHO."
"Membership of the World Health Organisation is restricted to nation states."
"To demand membership of the WHO for Taiwan is to recognise it as a nation state; to grant it an independence that its own government has not even requested."
"Equally I am at a loss to see why, if the PPE-DE Group is genuinely interested to allow the fundamental rights of freedom of travel for the President and senior officials of Taiwan's Government, it wants to restrict this to strictly private visits, rather than leave it more open."
"Otherwise we can only conclude, if they maintain their position, that this is really a subterfuge for opening up a political process that as yet we have not agreed."
"With these reservations, we support the report."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Maaten who has produced a distinguished report on a particularly wide-ranging subject."
"Asia is not only huge in terms of area. It also embraces a range of economic, political and religious differences, which mean that it is particularly challenging to deal with the area in a single report."
"This has been achieved, however."
"I shall just highlight a couple of points here."
"In anticipation of the forthcoming ASEM summit in Copenhagen, it must be crystal clear that there is full support for maintaining and developing relations between the EU, the ASEM countries and Asia as a whole."
"It is first and foremost a question of supporting the struggle to obtain respect for democracy and human rights in Asia."
"With regard to the global campaign against terror, it is also important for the EU to forge sound alliances with the Asian countries."
"More extensive relations between the EU and Asia must also play their part in supporting the market economy and sustainable development and, in that way, promoting a prosperous Asia."
"Simply take a look at recent history and the examples of Japan and Taiwan and it will quickly be very obvious that democracy, the market economy and respect for human rights are the way forward."
"I must naturally express my delight at the fact that both China and Taiwan are now members of the World Trade Organisation, or WTO."
"It is of course gratifying to hear the Commissioner confirm that the EU is to open an office in Taipei within a year."
"Taiwan is the EU's eleventh largest trading partner and is therefore a very important partner of the EU."
"Braving possible accusations from Mr Ford, I regret that Taiwan cannot participate in the ASEM Meeting, for example as an observer."
"By the same token, I also regret that Taiwan is not a member of the World Health Organisation, or WHO, not even as an observer."
"In my view, every democracy in the world should have a place in these international institutions."
"Madam President, there are large parts of Mr Maaten's report with which I can agree entirely."
"There, are, though, a number of problems."
"Firstly, any consideration of Europe and Asia has to include Russia as well."
"All the issues touch on the interests of Russia as a great Eurasian power, as became clear only recently in the Korea issue."
"Both the North Korean president's journey to Siberia and the plans to build a rail link crossing North and South Korea are worthy of a great deal of attention."
"On the other hand, considering the problem more in the unclear light favoured by the USA, and failing to involve Russia and China to the extent they deserve, makes it difficult to achieve a peaceful and fair solution to the problems before us."
"Secondly, to have an Asia policy without due consideration of the Shanghai Group and its place in Eurasian political events is to ignore the realities of the situation."
"We must now decide on what the place of Central Asia, for example, is to be and what attitude we take towards the USA's Eurasian strategy, which envisages a new geostrategic situation in this area."
"The end of the Cold War saw the budding of hope for a peaceful world, and that hope is, unfortunately, waning fast."
"Thirdly, the States of the European Union have long disregarded or underestimated developments in Asia and are still persisting in deliberations that are one-sided and sometimes limited."
"The Commissioner observed that reality has overtaken the report's reference to India and Taiwan in the same breath."
"That I consider to be a political error that takes inadequate account of the realities."
"Realpolitik always has something to do with interests, and the EU does well to strike a balance between its own well-understood interests and those of its partners."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will start by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Maaten, as there is a massive amount of lost ground to make up in relations between the EU and Asia."
"We are behaving as if Europe were something other than an appendage to the Eurasian continent, as if it were the centre of the world, and as if Asia were on another continent."
"The ASEM is certainly a useful forum on cooperation, but it is that only if all the Asian countries belong to it, with, at the least, prominence given to those that are striving to become democratic."
"For example, I see the ASEM as unthinkable without India."
"Only with the EU's firm commitment is the creation of democracy in Asia a feasible process, and the democratic countries, of which Taiwan is an example, can and must be planted and nurtured as a leavening influence."
"Taiwan can, one might say, become the engine for the continuing process of democratisation that we want to advance in Asia."
"Moreover, cooperation agreements between Asian countries and the EU - one thinks of Laos and Vietnam - are meaningless unless they are actually adhered to."
"My primary concern now is with the mountain areas, for Asia has the highest mountains in the world, including the Himalayas, the Karakorum, the Hindu Kush, and also the Pamir Mountains, and it is in these mountainous areas, which, when we look at them on the map, are bigger than the whole of the EU, that we find the greatest trouble spots."
"Let us consider Tibet."
"Tibet has its own history and culture."
"Tibet is of about the same size as Europe measured from Gibraltar to the Urals."
"Tibet was occupied by China in the 1950s."
"The intelligentsia and the leaders of its society were driven out of the country."
"His Holiness the Dalai Lama left the country in 1959 and now lives, with his government-in-exile, in exile in India."
"The Tibetans were admittedly promised autonomy, which was formally introduced in 1965, but this autonomy is a pure farce."
"All things Tibetan were increasingly repressed, and the country is being plundered."
"The railway that is now to be built from Golmod to Lhasa, and which, incidentally, runs across zones of permafrost, which makes little sense, does not serve to keep the country supplied, but to keep on exploiting it."
"In this hybrid system, part-capitalist, part-communist, China has done everything to marginalise Tibetan culture along with this minority."
"All efforts on our part towards human rights have to date been in vain."
"This initiation will repress all things Tibetan unless the EU works to counteract it."
"Our next stop is Sinkiang, still today belonging to China and with a sparse Muslim population. It is a vast region in the west of China between the Kuenlun Mountains and the Altai and Pamir ranges."
"Here too there is repression, the violation of human rights and, after 11 September 2001, yet more suppression under the pretext of combating terrorism."
"No longer is autonomy even mentioned."
"I wonder whether we Europeans might offer our experience of regional conflict resolution as aid here."
"So we come to Kashmir, Asia's number one trouble spot, a problem dragged out from 1947 onwards, with the divided Kashmir, called Jammu-Kashmir, torn between Pakistan and India."
"Following many wars between the two countries, soldiers have been facing each other down, in summer and winter alike, at 6 000 metres above the sea, for 15 years."
"Nuclear war has been threatened."
"Attempts to resolve the conflict have been unsuccessful."
"I am not concerned here with apportioning blame to one side or another, but with finding solutions."
"The indigenous people, the Kashmiris, must of course also be asked, and here too, autonomy is a possible solution, perhaps even shared autonomy for this divided country, and we Europeans have a number of models to offer of how to achieve solutions."
"As regards autonomy, the same is true of Tibet, of Sinkiang and of various regions in the Caucasus."
"Let us move on to Nepal, a small but very densely populated country."
"Here there are situations resembling civil war and plunging this country - one of the world's poorest - into virtual self-destruction."
"On the one hand there is a corrupt government, and on the other there are rebels describing themselves as Maoists, fighting each other, each under the pretext of supporting the impoverished rural population."
"While this is going on, the rural population and tourism, which is this country's sole surviving source of income, get trampled underfoot."
"This means that our non-governmental financial aid, which has indeed hitherto alleviated a certain amount of poverty, is no longer possible."
"At the moment, I see no chance of giving this little kingdom at the southern foot of the Himalayas some degree of freedom from its self-destructive dilemma."
"Nor has peace been brought to the situation in Afghanistan."
"The mountainous areas of the Hindu Kush have been laid waste, tourism is impossible there as an economic activity, and the mountainous areas are becoming more and more desolate."
"What we Europeans have to bring about is, firstly, respect for all other lifestyles, the protection of minorities, and, of course economic aid, peacekeeping, education, conflict resolution, and, where necessary, intervention."
"How, though, are we to play our part in influencing political interaction in the complex entity that is Asia, and how is the EU to play its part in shaping it, if we do not learn to speak with one voice?"
"For as long as the EU fails to thrash out a common foreign and security policy, much of what we want to implement, and should put great effort into implementing, will unfortunately remain nothing more than wishful thinking."
"This last point is unfortunately the most important for us to resolve before we take on our real task in Asia."
"Madam President, I can hardly conceive of a region that would be more difficult to draft a policy strategy for than Asia."
"It is a powder keg from a security point of view, a baby elephant economically speaking and mainly a source of concern from the point of view of human rights."
"What is the European Union to do with this region?"
"Mr Maaten's report contains many valuable building blocks for a coherent vision."
"These are of such high quality that I will support the report, even though I do not see eye to eye with the rapporteur on all scores."
"I should like to raise two points."
"I will start on a critical note."
"The report says a great deal about the role that the European Union should play in all kinds of conflicts in the region, but nothing about the relationship with the United States."
"According to Paragraph 14, the European Union is to point out to the East that Europe has a role of its own, independent of that of America. This is not terribly realistic, for, as is also recognised in Paragraph 14, the EU does not yet have an effective foreign policy and certainly not an effective security policy."
"I am therefore noting, without any perverse delight, that if Europe is to play any role whatsoever in conflicts of this kind, the EU will inevitably need to work more closely with the United States."
"After all, not only does the US's military presence guarantee stability, it also adds political weight to the region."
"The lack of this notion in the report is an oversight, in my view."
"Secondly, along with the rapporteur, I should like to underline the importance of the principles of the rule of law and respect for human rights."
"Our relations with, for example, China, Indonesia, Burma and Vietnam should be subject to compliance with these fundamental principles."
"I completely agree with the rapporteur that the only true basis for economic and social progress in the region is to respect human rights and the rule of law."
"Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the President-in-Office of the Council: this is a good report."
"However, as he is quite aware, it is very often the case that Parliament produces good resolutions but there is a problem afterwards, and that problem is the Council."
"Mr Messner is clearly right: there is an institutional problem, but that is not all, There is the problem of the Commission too."
"Mr Belder was right to remind us of the need for the strategy."
"I cannot believe that, even today, we are unable to distinguish between democratic Asian countries and non-democratic Asian countries."
"We lump them all together with China, with which we have been pursuing a difficult dialogue, not just since yesterday but for a decade now, a difficult dialogue in which we are repeatedly informed by the Chinese leaders that China is a specific case, that there is a specific Asian approach to human rights."
"Have you never thought to tell them that Engels, Marx, Stalin and Lenin were not exactly Asian and that they must stop talking such rubbish?"
"The problem is not economic, President-in-Office, and our Taiwanese friends are the best illustration of this, for, quite apart from any political or institutional relationship with our countries, they have become a country with 20 million inhabitants which is the European Union's third largest trading partner."
"The businessmen of Taiwan and the European Union have found their own way."
"It is we who have a problem, and the problem is that a number of countries are at war: in Vietnam, there is currently a Vietnam war against democracy and freedom, there is currently a war being waged in China against democracy and freedom, there is currently a war being waged in Laos against democracy and freedom."
"This problem cannot be addressed here."
"Mr Ford has condemned the initiatives of Mr Jarzembowski and other Members in support of democracy in Taiwan."
"All this seems to me to be completely incredible."
"I fail to understand this cooperation policy, Commissioner Patten. I fail to understand why we should continue to give money that we know full well will end up in the wallets of the Vietnamese, Chinese and Laotian leaders and have no impact at all."
"Why, Commissioner, do you not do what you are starting to do with other countries? To do away with all these cooperation projects and give countries EUR 1 million once they have completed this specific democratisation reform."
"This would eliminate all the European bureaucracy and, therefore, fraud as well, all the disgraceful wastage of our and taxpayers' money."
"I would also like the Council and the Commission to inform us whether there really is no hope of succeeding in obtaining the release of five 'disappeared persons' ."
"Twenty years ago, hundreds of thousands of Europeans marched down the streets calling for the release of the Chilean disappeared."
"We are incapable of saving five missing civilians, five 'disappeared persons', in Laos, a country of 5 million inhabitants of minor geopolitical influence."
"We are not even capable of obtaining the release of the leaders of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, who have been in prison for 20 years now."
"I find all this absolutely unacceptable, not to say incomprehensible."
"Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I should also like to start by thanking Mr Maaten for an excellent report."
"Although not a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I have followed the matter and read the report, and I found it excellent."
"I have a few reservations about some of the details, but on the whole it is an exceptionally good report."
"We all, of course, believe it is important for the ASEM meeting in Copenhagen at the end of the month to be a success."
"The economic issues, which are extremely important for relations between the EU and the ASEAN countries, will naturally be discussed."
"These key issues have been developed further in recent years."
"Something we ought to develop further is cooperation in the area of foreign policy, i.e. the EU should join with Asia in adopting a committed role in conflicts around the globe and play a more active part."
"I therefore believe it was positive that Sweden addressed the Korean question during the Swedish Presidency, and I hope this cooperation can continue."
"I have some experience of environmental issues."
"With regard to the global environment, I believe it is very important to cooperate with the Asian countries."
"We have a lot in common and we have the same viewpoints."
"Since these are global issues, we see that the US is dragging its feet in this area."
"We know that we need to get the US on board. We stand a better chance of succeeding if we can create a coalition with the countries in Asia around these issues."
"We must also continue to cooperate on human rights issues, an area in which it has - quite rightly - been said that many of these countries have considerable problems."
"I remain, however, convinced that dialogue will improve our chances of moving forward in this area, too."
"I should now like to turn to dialogue-related issues."
"I am back from the ASEP meeting in Manila, where I was one of the delegates."
"Although there were differences between us, I must say that the atmosphere was good."
"We managed to agree on a joint communiqué."
"At the Manila meeting we tried to focus on three areas: firstly, terrorism; secondly, environmental issues; and thirdly, human rights issues."
"We managed to agree on all three."
"What I would stress above all with regard to the fight against terrorism is that it must be conducted under the auspices of the UN and within the framework of international law."
"It is also important that the UN's various conventions be ratified."
"I have already mentioned the environmental aspect, which is a global issue."
"Global warming is the most important question."
"It is important that we should all ratify the Kyoto Protocol."
"Furthermore, we must try to get the US first to sign it, and then ratify it."
"We also discussed the need to mobilise civil society in the context of the environment and of human rights."
"We are very concerned about the human rights situation, which has been deteriorating in recent years."
"More cooperation is needed in this area."
"As Mr Ford said, it is important to have continuity in our relations at government level."
"At the same time, it is important to have continuity in relations at parliamentary level."
"I therefore hope that an ASEP meeting can be organised in connection with the next ASEM meeting in 2004."
"Our relations with Asia have greatly improved over the past few years, and this is something to be welcomed, for Asia accounts for 56% of the world population, 26% of the total global BNP and for 25% of world trade."
"Despite the crisis in Asia, trade and investment relations have expanded to such an extent that Asia is currently the EU's third largest regional trading partner."
"We can even say that we in Europe have contributed to a relatively swift economic recovery in Asia by means of our open markets and investments."
"Despite this, a great deal still needs to be done."
"Our political ties need to be strengthened and broadened."
"We still do give Asia enough consideration as an important partner in multilateral discussions within international forums, such as the World Trade Organisation."
"I would, in this connection, refer to China's recent endorsement of the Kyoto Agreement."
"This is a positive point."
"Asia is indeed gradually realising that it faces the same global challenges as we do: promoting peace, security, minimum social standards, environmental protection and the fight against cross-border crime and trafficking in human beings."
"Finally, I know from my own experience that Asians still do not know Europe well enough."
"This results, for example, in the EU's trade deficit with Asia which, partly due to the crisis, has increased almost tenfold over the past five years."
"We must therefore step up our presence in the region as a matter of urgency, and make the Asians aware of Europe's - and, above all, of the EU's - significance, so that the trade and investment potential of our companies can also be enhanced."
"Madam President, I would like to congratulate the Presidency of the Council on the ambitious programme for the Asia Summit in Copenhagen."
"It is, in my view, particularly gratifying that there is a specific focus on dialogue on culture and civilisation, for it is particularly in these times that mutual understanding in this area is particularly important."
"All too often, there is still great misunderstanding despite the progress made in relations between Europe and Asia, which are distant rather than close, in contrast to relations with the ACP States or Latin America."
"We have to come to understand that the Asian states are not merely in economic or trading competition with us, but that they are genuinely important partners."
"Both Mr Maaten's report and also the communication from the Commission make it very clear that the strategic framework also has to highlight priority areas for political and strategic cooperation, in which area the strengthening of the United Nations will, on the one hand, certainly be a point of view that will carry weight, as will without any doubt, on the other hand, the bilateral and, as far as possible, joint efforts at tying the USA into a multilateral relationship."
"In this time of conflict, when we are faced with problems and challenges, it cannot be too often emphasised that it is most important that Asia and Europe should support a multipolar world."
"This is where we, as Europe's Parliament, can certainly play an important role with these reports and these debates, and the ASEP Summits could emphasise this."
"I really do consider that important."
"I would also like to emphatically underline the role to be played by the principle of detente and change through rapprochement in giving human rights and democracy issues priority."
"What have we achieved in Europe by means of this policy?"
"Why can it not used to give us leverage in Asia?"
"That we should be cooperating with the Asians in this way in the ASEAN Regional Forum, and in other areas affecting stability, is something I consider right and proper."
"I would like to take this opportunity to make another appeal."
"Another issue here is certainly cooperation between non-governmental organisations, as is the new relationship on the basis of equal rights, partnership and mutual understanding."
"What, though, will we have achieved if this remains confined to the heads of government, to the business world, or even to the parliaments?"
"We have to include the young people of these continents of ours."
"With that in mind, I would like to encourage the Danish Presidency of the Council to do even more for the European-Asian summer schools and even more for mutual understanding between the young people of Asia and Europe."
"Madam President, first of all, I should like to express my support and praise for Mr Maaten's report."
"It is an excellent document."
"I should also like to express my appreciation for the communication by Commissioner Patten."
"Over the past ten years, the attention given to Asia by the EU has not always been what it should have been."
"Partly thanks to Commissioner Patten, this attention has been rekindled."
"This, of course, has something to do with his great knowledge and experience in the area in question."
"At parliamentary level too, contacts have improved over the past few years, as witness the recent ASEP meeting in Manila."
"It is also vital that talks should not simply be held at ministerial and official level, but also at parliamentary level."
"This reinforces the debate on mutual contacts, and the contacts are thus guided and controlled at parliamentary level too."
"Reinforcing the democratic substance in Asia is certainly no hollow exercise."
"I should like to make a few more additional comments, starting with Indonesia."
"I am pleased that Commissioner Patten has spoken so highly about Indonesia."
"I should like to say something about Indonesia, because I know the country well and I am also co-Chairman of the newly formed working group 'Friends of Indonesia'."
"Indonesia is in the throes of becoming a democratic system."
"The authoritarian Suharto regime has fortunately made way for a democracy under the leadership first of President Wahid and now of President Megawati Sukarnoputri."
"This process is far from easy, and this is why it is important for that country to receive our support."
"After China, Indonesia is the region's largest country."
"We should not forget that Indonesia, in terms of inhabitants, is the world's largest Islamic country."
"These two elements together mean that Indonesia is of great strategic importance in the region and of great strategic importance in present-day world politics in the light of the events of 11 September last year."
"Over the summer, the Indonesian Congress, which is a combination of national and regional parliaments, took important decisions which further reinforce democracy."
"In future, the President will be elected directly by the people and the military power will withdraw from the national parliament in which it still had a preferential position."
"At the same time, however, we also notice the emergence of an increasing number of fundamentalist Muslim groups which are opposed to freedom of religion in Indonesia."
"Christian communities too, are under attack on a regular basis."
"The situation in the Moluccas has often been discussed in this House."
"Indonesia is vulnerable in this transitional phase to democracy, and this is why the Indonesian government deserves extra support from the European Union."
"My question to Commissioner Patten is: how could this support be stepped up?"
"Secondly, I should like to make an observation about Burma, or Myanmar."
"Mr Maaten's report states that that country should also become a member of the ASEM group."
"I would strongly question that."
"Burma still has a military regime that came to power by deposing a President who had 80% of the votes behind him, by depriving a parliament of its powers, by imprisoning many MPs or having them killed and by adopting a disastrous policy on ethnic minorities, resulting in more than 100 000 refugees in Thailand, among other countries."
"I have visited these refugee camps."
"Neither should we forget that Burma tolerates slave labour and is Asia's largest drugs exporter."
"In this respect, it is in close competition of Bolivia."
"In my view, such a country does not belong in ASEAN and in the ASEM group."
"We should instead try to ensure that Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi is reinstated as President of the country in a democratic system."
"I should like to finish off with a remark about Vietnam."
"It is interesting to hear that the next Ministerial Conference will be taking place there."
"Although I am positive about Vietnam, I hope that attention will also be focused on the high number of political prisoners in that country."
"Mr Pannella has tabled an amendment to this effect."
"In my experience, it is useful to ask questions about this - and I have done so on numerous occasions - and for the Commissioner to assure that the European ambassador in Vietnam give this matter his urgent attention."
"I have letters which show that Vietnamese prisoners have been released following pressure brought to bear by Parliament and the European Union."
"It therefore works."
"I hope that this aspect will be given due consideration in the debates in Hanoi."
"One final word."
"The Commission's line on Taiwan receives my unqualified support."
"I hope that Taiwan will be accorded a place in the ASEM and I also hope we can appreciate that Taiwan is a more important democracy than the vast country of China, which, it is of course also to be hoped, will yet develop in that direction."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, although, when cooperation between ASEAN and the EU is mentioned, most people take it to refer to the ASEM process, that is to say the meeting of Heads of State and of Government, ASEP, the important meeting of parliamentarians from Europe and Asia, must not be overlooked."
"Cooperation in this area is so important that one of our partners must not be forgotten."
"We need both of them!"
"We have, in the course of time, built up very intensive ventures in economic cooperation, and Asia is in any case the European Union's most important trading partner."
"We have built up good relations in the cultural sphere, but what we need is to step up political cooperation, quite simply because geopolitical conflicts and problems have an effect on the European Union."
"Consider terrorism, consider internationally organised crime, consider migration, consider environmental issues and the many other problems we have."
"So I welcome the initiatives taken in this report, as well as the Commission proposals, and congratulate the rapporteur on the very precise proposals he has made."
"I would, though, like to add some of my own, which I believe will further improve cooperation. The first is that we should arrange, in future, for an ASEP meeting to be held, if at all possible, prior to every ASEM Summit, in order to draft tangible proposals and, in second place, in order that we should move on, as Mr Jarzembowski has just said, instead of just putting dialogues on the record in broad terms, to coming to definite decisions and setting out in definite terms for these summits resolutions and objectives that can and must be put into operation."
"A number of us from this House, led by the distinguished Lord Inglewood, took part in the ASEP meeting from 26 to 28 August, at which we were exemplary in so far as we wrapped up a very solid package in the area of counter-terrorism."
"There I had the opportunity to act as coordinator, and I will ask you, as President of the Council, and you, as the Commission's representative, to incorporate these specific points from the terrorism package at the next ASEM Summit."
"Let me pick out a number of proposals."
"We proposed unanimously that the UN should attempt to come up with a uniform definition of terrorism that would then be binding on all our States."
"We decided on the establishment of a network facilitating cooperation in counter-terrorism, the exchange of information, mutual aid - including aid of a technological nature - in dealing with chemical or bacteriological weapons or the training of experts."
"At this meeting, we made proposals for security systems in transport by land, sea and air to be improved to defined standards, and we also proposed that, at last, all terrorist acts, including conspiracy, incitement, and membership of terrorist organisations should be classified as serious offences and punished as such in all Asian states."
"Finally, we also resolved that protection and help be afforded to the victims of terrorism."
"We will be successful in the struggle against terrorism only when Europe itself takes measures that work, when cooperation with the USA is developed and made to work, and if, at the end of the day, we also succeed in developing first-rate cooperative projects with our Asian partners in the fight against terrorism."
"I beg you, Commissioner, and you Bertel Haarder, my much-respected former fellow Member of this House, to take account of these proposals from ASEP at the Copenhagen Summit and take them on board."
"Madam President, we are in the happy position today of debating this report just three weeks before the Copenhagen summit and this happy position is enhanced by the fact that, if anyone knows the area, it is the Commissioner responsible, Mr Patten."
"The subject of this debate is the European Union's policy towards Asia."
"However, the policy discussed in Copenhagen will, of necessity, focus on the institutionalised dialogue with the members of ASEM which, as you know, are the fifteen Member States of the European Union, ten Asian countries and the European Commission."
"In this sense, it is very difficult to deal with all aspects of this area under this one umbrella."
"However, it is a step in the right direction and I believe that this modus operandi and our involvement in this process is helpful to the European Union's strategy in political and regional partnerships and the multipolar world."
"However, I would point out that, so far, this dialogue has, for the most part, been held solely at the economic level and it needs to move on to political, educational and cultural issues."
"It is no accident that China, which recently joined the World Trade Organisation and is staging the 2008 Olympics, is also party to this debate, and clearly the economy and culture also exert a great deal of influence on the development of democratic institutions and human rights."
"However, one very important issue which needs to be addressed is the enlargement of ASEM."
"The European Union will soon have ten new members, making a total of twenty-five."
"All the members of the European Union belong to ASEM."
"Obviously, once we enlarge, the other side will ask for other countries in Asia to be allowed to join."
"This means that this political factor is urgent in the extreme and enlargement criteria need to be laid down."
"I think that the criteria which must, without fail, be adhered to by both sides are the Copenhagen criteria, which improve economic, cultural and, above all, human relations and human rights."
"I hope, in fact I am certain that successful developments will result from Copenhagen and I believe that this European Union policy will be more widely accepted in an area wracked by conflict and crisis, by which I mean the whole of Asia."
"Mr President, as Mr Pirker pointed out I had the honour to lead the European Parliament's delegation to the ASEP II meeting in the Philippines last week."
"This event, which was efficiently and successfully organised under the auspices of the Philippine Senate, concluded, as a number of colleagues have said, by issuing an agreed communiqué and statements which dealt with human rights, with special reference to women and children, terrorism and the environment."
"But at least as importantly, it provided some parliamentary input into the ASEM process, which culminates later in the year with the Copenhagen meeting."
"In an increasingly interdependent world, where modern economics propelled by science, technology and improved transport systems breaks down the significance of national boundaries and with them the practical relevance of ringfenced national jurisdiction, the democratic political process must not get left behind."
"The evolution of governmental, ministerial and Heads of Government meetings that take decisions, which either de facto or de jure legislate or commit their component participants to legislate, should have a proper parliamentary angle and aspect."
"In my view this is at least as important as many of the conclusions reached by parliamentarians' meetings such as ASEP II."
"They are the first step towards finding collective parliamentary institutions to work with collective governmental and administrative developments such as ASEM."
"I very much hope that the decisions reached by ASEP II in Manila, and the decision of this Parliament in voting for the Maaten report, will endorse the call for another meeting of ASEP to be held to complement the proposed 2004 ASEM meeting in Hanoi."
"I also hope that this parliamentarians' meeting will be held in Europe, although not necessarily here in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, the location of the first ASEP meeting in 1996."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Members for an interesting debate and for the many kind words and requests received by the Danish Presidency in connection with the preparations for ASEM 4."
"I would join in the praise of Mr Maaten's excellent report."
"I do not entirely agree with his view that the Council has a minimalist approach towards Asia, for it might just as well be said that relations between the EU and Asia have never been stronger than they are today."
"It must be remembered that all this activity was certainly not a foregone conclusion."
"It is in itself an achievement that dialogue is taking place, that trade is increasing, that there are more frequent exchanges between us and that human contacts are being further developed at all levels, including the very highest."
"That is an achievement in itself. It is very important, and vital as well to our economic well-being in this part of the world."
"I would mention the first six meetings that are to take place under the Danish Presidency: the big ASEM Meeting, the meetings of business leaders and of ministers of economic affairs, as well as the summits with Japan, China, South Korea and India which are all to take place in Copenhagen during the Presidency."
"In addition, there is the summit with Japan which has already taken place."
"Over and above these, there is a range of contacts at ministerial level and among officials."
"Mr Solana undertook a major visit to four Asian countries in July, participating in the annual ministerial meeting on security cooperation in the ASEAN Regional Forum where, as is well known, the EU makes efforts towards intensifying cooperation and presses for the move to be made from mainly confidence-building measures to what we call preventive diplomacy."
"Basic conditions such as respect for human rights, the promotion of democracy and the principles of a state based on the rule of law are central themes in the EU's relations with Asian countries, and I can assure Mr Messner and others that we shall raise the Tibet issue at the summit with China."
"The EU is also involved in a range of problems of regional significance such as relations between India and Pakistan, the situation in the Korean Peninsula and developments in Burma."
"In my view, the activities we have under way are, then, particularly wide-ranging. Nothing just happens of its own accord and there is nothing that is here and now giving rise to tremendously visible practical progress, but relations are slowly but surely improving, and that is of course how cooperation takes place in terms of the larger frame within which Euro-Asian relations must be conducted."
"If it comes to making a list, there have of course been very many examples of practical progress, some of them of benefit to our citizens."
"There is a host of tasks waiting to be carried out, however, and both the Commission Communication and Mr Maaten's report are very useful tools in this regard."
"I have also heard Mr Patten say that relations with South-East Asia are an area in which we could well do more."
"An EU-ASEAN meeting of foreign ministers is planned for January 2003, and this will be a good opportunity to discuss how we can strengthen relations."
"The communication on relations with South-East Asia, mooted by Mr Patten, may prove to be a valuable contribution to the debate."
"I can give an assurance that the Council shares the desire to strengthen relations between the EU and Asia."
"With all the activities mentioned and with everything which has been said here in Parliament and which, I know, is taken note of in the countries we wish to cooperate with, there is a particularly sound basis for the range of activities we are now getting under way under the Danish Presidency."
"Finally, I want to say that we shall follow with interest the efforts to arrange another ASEP meeting, or Asia-Europe parliamentary meeting."
"I myself took part in the first meeting here in Strasbourg, and I look forward to its being possible to arrange something."
"Thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council."
"The debate is closed."
"Question No 1 by Bart Staes (H-0524/02):"
"Subject: Charter of EU Fundamental Rights and a tightening up of aliens policy in various Member States of the EU"
"Governments throughout the EU are tightening up their aliens policy and creating more and more obstacles to asylum-seekers, for example: tightening up family reunification provisions, with those concerned being required to deposit large amounts of money as a guarantee, an increase in the minimum age for marriage to 24, expulsion of children born to parents who entered the country illegally, the obligation on immigrants to prove that they have a job to go to, and restrictions on the right of immigrants' parents to come and live with their children."
"The measures referred to above constitute a downright violation of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Can the Council indicate whether or not it agrees that the measures referred to above and implemented by the Member States do indeed constitute a breach of the spirit of, inter alia, Articles 7, 9, 15(3), 18, 20, 21, 24, 25, 29, 33, 34, 41 and 47 of the said Charter, and it is prepared, where appropriate, to intervene?"
"Illegal immigration is a considerable problem for the EU's Member States and an issue that occupies their populations a good deal."
"The Seville European Council decided to reinforce the EU's efforts in this field."
"There was agreement that the measures taken in the short or long term for the joint management of migration flows must strike a fair balance. On the one hand, there should be an integration policy for lawfully resident immigrants and an asylum policy complying with the international conventions, principally the 1951 Geneva Convention."
"At the same time, our policy must involve resolute action to combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings."
"That is what is stated in paragraph 28 of the conclusions agreed in Seville."
"The measures to which the honourable Member refers are legislation adopted by the individual Member States as national measures for combating the problems faced."
"It is outside the Council's competence to decide whether the measures taken by the Member States are, or are not, in accordance with the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"I should like to refer to Article 51(1) of the Charter, affirming that the Member States are bound by the Charter when they are implementing Union law and only when they are implementing Union law."
"There is generally no question of the regulations to which the honourable Member refers being adopted in implementation of Union law, and I do not therefore think that there is any point in asking me to assess whether the measures taken by the Member States are in accordance with the Charter."
"The Charter is of a different character."
"It is aimed at the implementation of Union law."
"Wearing my other hat as Danish Minister for Integration, I should like to say, however, that, when it comes to Danish legislation in this field, it complies fully with all the international standards."
"That is something I should like to emphasise."
"I should obviously like to thank the Minister and former fellow MEP for his response, but surely we cannot concern ourselves with word games."
"I clearly asked whether the Council could indicate whether or not it agrees that the measures enacted by the Member States do indeed constitute a breach of the spirit, I repeat the spirit, of the Charter."
"I am aware of the fact that the Charter is a solemn declaration, Mr Haarder, but it contains very fine passages about respecting privacy, the right to marry and start a family, the right to equal working conditions, the right to asylum, the ban on discrimination, and I could carry on for a few minutes yet."
"Surely you have to admit, Mr Haarder, that in your country too, legislation is now being enacted which is at least in breach of the spirit of what is written in the Charter."
"I should like to call on the Council, the Ministers of the Fifteen Member States, to respect the spirit of the Charter."
"I believe that a better society could be the result."
"Mr President, I completely disagree with the questioner and should like to emphasise in no uncertain terms that there is no question of any breach either of the letter or of the spirit of any international agreement whatsoever."
"I should also like to add that what the question says is false in certain respects."
"It states, for example, that a country has a minimum age for marriage, and that is incorrect."
"There are conditions governing the circumstances under which a permanent residence permit can be obtained solely on the grounds of marriage, and that is something quite different."
"It is self-evident that no condition of this kind applies, of course, to refugees for, if it did, it would be contrary to the conventions."
"I can assure Mr Staes, when he talks about Danish legislation, that we are up to speed on the conventions."
"We are well aware of how they are to be interpreted, and I could not contemplate taking responsibility for any breach at all, either of the spirit or of the letter, of any convention whatsoever."
"I was myself the European Parliament's human rights spokesman in 1998 and 1999."
"The reports are there to be found and read."
"I have no intention of infringing either the spirit or the letter of any international convention whatsoever."
"Question No 2 by Gerard Collins (H-0526/02):"
"Subject: Southern Africa and serious food shortages"
"Last February the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations warned that nearly 4 million people in southern Africa would need emergency food assistance this year."
"This is due to reduced 2001 cereal harvests caused by adverse weather and reduced planting."
"Christian Aid has just published a position paper warning that over 12 million people in the southern Africa region risk starvation in the coming months after poor harvests, drought, flood and mismanagement."
"Will the Council outline its response to this alarming situation and state how it considers the issue of providing adequate food aid can be addressed and how support for civil society organisations can be strengthened?"
"The food crisis in southern Africa was discussed at the most recent Council meeting on 22 July of this year, that is to say the meeting of foreign ministers."
"The Council expressed its concern about the situation in southern Africa where up to 13 million people are feared to have been hit by the crisis."
"The Council is disturbed by various political decisions and initiatives that have been taken and that have apparently contributed to exacerbating an already alarming humanitarian situation, involving drought and floods."
"The Council is of the view that solving the humanitarian crisis is one of the most important political priorities, and it therefore calls upon the countries in the area to direct their respective policies towards fulfilling that objective."
"Regional efforts to solve the crisis should be encouraged in line with principles, such as that of good governance, laid down in the initiative concerning the New Partnership for African Development, NEPAD, in which the states of southern Africa play a crucial role."
"The Council calls upon the countries in the region to do their utmost to facilitate the regional and humanitarian operations that are under way, including those designed to provide logistical and administrative support and to secure access to, and the distribution of, emergency aid."
"Organisations forming part of civil society ought to play a decisive role in the distribution of food aid so as to prevent such aid being misused for political ends."
"The EU has already responded by providing extensive food and humanitarian aid to the area."
"There is, however, a need for further efforts."
"The EU and its Member States are prepared, in close cooperation with the SADC countries, to continue to contribute to these efforts."
"I surely do not need to say anything about Zimbabwe and Mr Mugabe."
"It is surely self-evident what the Council thinks about the matter."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for the very comprehensive reply which he has given."
"The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is now warning that some 13 million people are threatened with starvation over the next six months as a result of food shortages brought about by adverse weather conditions and flawed government planning."
"The UN Special Envoy for Humanitarian Needs in Southern Africa is to visit six drought-stricken countries in the region from 6 to 16 September, and I understand that representatives of WHO, the UN Children's Fund and the Food and Agricultural Organisation are expected to join the mission."
"What strikes me is that there is no reference to EU participation."
"Would the Council take appropriate and urgent action to ensure that the EU is involved in this mission and in the coordination of international food aid with other international organisations?"
"Finally, I would like to know what the Council's response is to the FAO warning in a report last August that only 24% of the USD 507 million needed to provide food assistance until the next harvest in April 2003 has been pledged and that agricultural inputs are needed to help farmers recover from the crisis."
"I fully understand the view put forward here by my good friend and colleague, Mr Collins."
"I should like to emphasise that the European Union is involved, but that it is the UN that takes action."
"It is therefore the UN that is the contractor and in charge of the work, while the EU to a very large degree supports the work financially and, of course, also diplomatically and politically, if need be."
"The EU is involved, then, but it is the UN that is responsible for actually carrying out the work."
"Question No 3 by Liam Hyland, which has been taken over by Mr Crowley (H-0527/02):"
"Subject: Promoting the participation of young people in political and civil life"
"How does the Council intend to follow up the positive comments of the Education and Youth Affairs Ministers who met on 30 May last and highlighted the need to promote the participation of young people in political and civil life in the Member States and acknowledged that it is necessary to be more receptive to young people and to take their views into account, both formally and substantively, and will the Council outline the areas in which it considers that the views of young people should be taken into account?"
"The honourable Member is undoubtedly aware that the discussions in the Education and Youth Council on 30 May, discussions concerning the participation of young people, took place in connection with the adoption of a resolution on the framework for European cooperation in the youth field."
"In accordance with this resolution, the open coordination method is to be applied in a flexible and appropriate way to certain priority themes in the youth field."
"The Commission has drawn up proposals on this in a white paper entitled 'A New Impetus for European Youth'."
"It was published in November of last year."
"Information and participation are some of the subjects which will be tackled initially."
"In consultation with the Member States, the Commission has drawn up a questionnaire on these subjects."
"The questionnaire has now been submitted to the Member States, which should answer the questionnaire with due regard for prevailing opinion among young people themselves, youth organisations and other relevant bodies."
"The issues concerning young people's voluntary work and greater understanding and knowledge of young people will be tackled at a later date."
"I would like to emphasise on the Council's behalf that the new framework for European cooperation in the youth field is still at a preliminary stage."
"An evaluation report is to be presented in 2004."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his response."
"The reason for Mr Hyland asking this question, and why I am taking it on his behalf, is that over the last few years we have seen more and more young people becoming disconnected from political and civil life."
"Indeed those same people who feel no connection with the political movements or the political parties in their own countries are very likely to turn up at demonstrations about anti-globalisation, about reclaiming the streets or eradication of poverty and so on. Surely, through the Council and the good offices of the minister himself, there must be some mechanism whereby that energy and that idealism can be harnessed for the good of all of society and not just for the good of the few."
"I am particularly anxious to hear an answer concerning the initiatives they hope to undertake during the Danish presidency."
"I am entirely in agreement with the presentation of the problem, as outlined here by my esteemed colleague."
"On the one hand, we have a group of young people who are more internationally minded than ever before and who are deeply committed."
"We saw this in the summer at the 'Youth 2000' forum, where a thousand young people from throughout Europe met at 13 folk high schools in Denmark, where they each drew up proposals for a constitution for Europe and finally came together and combined them all into a single proposal which they presented to the Convention."
"I also want to mention the youth convention as exemplifying these very committed young people."
"Next, there is a very large group which is extremely passive."
"They are perhaps not opposed to European cooperation, but it does not interest them."
"Finally, there is a very small group which demonstrates and throws stones."
"As for this small group, I would say that one of the gratifying features of the meeting in Elsinore at the weekend was that there were twice as many police officers as demonstrators present."
"That is a step forward - let us hope that this will characterise the rest of the presidency and also future presidencies."
"I can only declare myself in agreement with the honourable Member."
"The Council is very aware of this issue, and I think this has been stated so well that I do not need to repeat it."
"The Council considers that the Seville decisions concerning the European Council merely elucidate the relevant provisions of the Treaty on European Union, in particular Article 4, which states that the European Council shall provide the Union with the necessary impetus for its development and shall define the general political guidelines thereof."
"At a time when the Union's activities are characterised by increasing development and differentiation, and immediately before major enlargement to include a number of new Member States, the European Council has found it necessary to strengthen the Council's powers as a provider of guidelines and impetus."
"This is precisely what the role of the European Council is according to the Treaty."
"The Council cannot see that these practical guidelines are in any way incompatible with the Commission's executive powers, which cannot in any way be affected by a decision, the sole purpose of which is to enable the European Council to exercise as effectively as possible the responsibility which the European Council has been given."
"In this respect, I would point out that the President of the Commission is of course a member of the European Council, and I have not heard any objections to the Council's trying to reform itself."
"As regards any possible democratic deficit and the lack of separation of powers within the Union, the Council considers that the current situation, regardless of what one thinks about it, cannot be affected by a reform the sole purpose of which is, as has already been observed, to implement the existing provisions of the Treaty more effectively."
"As the question concerning the separation of the executive and legislative powers - whether it is a matter of the principle in general or its application in the Union - has not been discussed as such by the Council, the Council is not in a position to respond to the exact point raised in Question H-O 535."
"Of course, the Council is not unaware of this classic problem, which is indirectly taken up in the Laeken declaration, for example, adopted by the European Council in December, and which will, in all probability, also be taken up in the Convention and later at the subsequent intergovernmental conference."
"The honourable Member must understand that, beyond purely academic considerations which do not belong here, the Council cannot comment on the possible outcome of a debate which will not be conducted in the Council itself and which, in any case, has not yet taken place."
"I hope that, with this explanation, I have made it clear why I cannot go further into the question which has been raised."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, many thanks for your response."
"I might be asking the impossible, but I would have liked the period for responding to our questions to be shorter, so that the Spanish Presidency could have replied to my question, as it, in its time, was responsible for the Seville European Council."
"Having said this, it is undeniable that in Europe, in the European Union, it is the Council that wields the most legislative power and, furthermore, controls executive power through the comitology procedure."
"I would like to ask you if you believe that the United States would be the world leader if its legislative power, instead of residing with the House of Representatives and the Senate, resided with a Ministerial Council composed of representatives of the various North American States, from New York State or Washington State to California, Florida or Colorado."
"If the American President, Mr Bush, had the level of attributions, competences and powers that our President, Mr Prodi, has, do you think he would have the influence and capacity he has in international relations and at domestic level?"
"Would he have the same influence and capacity?"
"I believe we must make Europe a true democracy, with separation of powers, as suggested by other speakers: legislative power should reside with this Parliament, and executive power with the Commission."
"I will confine myself to saying that I am as exercised by Montesquieu's theories on the separation of powers as the honourable Member is."
"I am, as it happens, a political scientist by training and think that it is absolutely fundamental that we should keep this separation of powers in mind."
"I said this as recently as yesterday, when I represented the Presidency in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs here in Parliament."
"With the best will in the world, I cannot, however, see the Council's efforts to reform itself as being in conflict with Montesquieu's theories on the separation of powers, and I cannot see that the Council has taken powers or in any way hampered the Commission."
"As a matter of form, I would like to report what I said on behalf of the Danish Government in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs yesterday, that is that the Danish Government is an ardent adherent of the Community method and does not want the Council to take powers from the Commission."
"That is what was said - but it was as a Danish Minister that I added this."
"The President-in-Office made an extremely interesting remark in passing in the first half of his first answer when he referred to the President of the Commission having been a former Member of the European Council."
"So it is in order for people who have been members of other EU institutions to express an opinion in their present position."
"The President-in-Office was a very distinguished Member of this Parliament so he is therefore able to express an opinion, by his own words, on the state of the Council now."
"Would you agree Mr President-in-Office of the Council, based on your experience in the Parliament, that we do need separation of the powers and will you be urging the Danish presidency to put this forward at the Convention?"
"This is Question Time and concerns questions to the Council."
"The Council does not deal with the Convention, the Danish presidency does not deal with the Convention."
"We respect the procedure that has been laid down for the Convention so I have no further comment."
"Yet I hope that what I just said indicated that the honourable Member might tend to agree on the need to separate powers in a democracy."
"As the author is not present, Question No 6 lapses."
"Question No 7 by Alexandros Alavanos (H-0536/02):"
"Subject: Cyprus - expiry of the deadline for a political solution to the problem"
"In June 2002 the deadline that had been set for a political solution to the Cyprus problem, to be achieved by means of talks between the two Cyprus communities under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the UN, expired without producing a result, because of Turkish intransigence."
"Could the Council assess any results attained by the talks so far?"
"Could it outline the next steps leading up to the accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union, together with the nine other applicant countries?"
"As the honourable Member no doubt knows, the current direct talks concerning Cyprus are confidential."
"The Council is well aware that no breakthrough has yet been made in the talks, and that disappointingly little progress has so far been made, which has also been stated by the UN Security Council according to the report which Mr de Soto, the UN Special Envoy for Cyprus, issued on 9 July."
"As the talks are now continuing, the Council expects the parties to increase their efforts with a view to taking advantage of the current unique opportunity and finally make the necessary progress towards a solution - hopefully before the accession negotiations are concluded."
"The decisions concerning the accession of the candidate countries must be taken before the end of the year within the normal enlargement procedure on the basis of the Commission's report and the recommendations which the Commission will put forward in its document on the enlargement strategy, which we expect by October."
"With regard to the accession of Cyprus, the EU's view, which was put forward once again in Seville, is in line with the Helsinki conclusions, to the effect that a solution of the Cyprus problem will facilitate Cyprus's accession to the EU."
"A solution is not, however, a prerequisite for Cyprus's accession."
"When it takes its decision, the Council will take into account all the relevant factors."
"That is a position which it is wise to adhere to, and so we all hope, and cross our fingers, that advantage will be taken of this 'window of opportunity', this unique opportunity which there will be this autumn to resolve this extremely old and tragic problem on this wonderful island."
"I thank the minister and former member of this House."
"I have listened very carefully to his views, which are the same views as those expressed by his prime minister, Mr Rasmussen, in a recent interview in the Politiken newspaper."
"I should merely like to ask the President-in-Office a straight question: what message is the presidency of the Council of the European Union sending Turkey."
"Why, if the talks are not succeeding, must someone be to blame?"
"There are those who stand to gain if the talks do not succeed."
"Is the message which the presidency of the European Union is sending Turkey, yes, we will make every effort to resolve the Cyprus question, but if no political solution can be found, that will not stop the Republic of Cyprus from joining the European Union?"
"I think that it is important that, in my answer, I should adhere entirely to the well-established and sensible formulation which was adopted in Helsinki and which has been repeated time and again, namely that a solution to the Cyprus problem will facilitate the accession of Cyprus, but that a solution is not a prerequisite for accession."
"The Council will take all factors into account when the decision is taken."
"That is what can be said, and I think that everyone understands what is meant, and I have nothing to add."
"Mr President-in-Office, that we are concerned about the impasse in cross-community talks goes without saying."
"You said in your first reply that the interested parties will need to step up their efforts."
"However, as everyone knows, the key to resolving the Cyprus problem is to be found in Ankara, not in Cyprus itself."
"I should like to ask if the Council intends to put pressure on the Turkish government to take the steps needed in order to help resolve the Cyprus problem. Otherwise, I fear that, as things stand, we may well end up partitioning the island, with the Turkish side, with Turkey behind it of course, as always, insisting on recognition of the independent sovereignty of the Turkish Cypriots."
"I would like to emphasise that the negotiations have certainly not broken down."
"There is a continuing dialogue, and there should be a meeting very soon between UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the parties on Cyprus, so there is absolutely no question that anything has broken down."
"Nor will I accept the description of Ankara's shadow."
"I will not comment on whether there is a shadow, but I can say that this process, which was adopted in Helsinki and has been confirmed, is going ahead."
"It will not be affected by any shadow."
"Question No 8 by Ioannis Marinos (H-0539/02):"
"Subject: Discrimination against Greeks in Albania"
"According to reports in the Greek press, hundreds of Greek residents of the town of Himara, in southern Albania, have protested formally to the Albanian Government concerning the non-restitution of their property in the part of the town located by the sea, which Albania's former communist regime took from them."
"The residents of Himara have not yet managed to obtain the title deeds to their property, and much of it has been illegally transferred to Albanians by the authorities, who took advantage of the absence of the owners outside Albania for a period of many years."
"There is also a similar problem with the property of the Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Albania, whose land was also confiscated by the communist regime and has not since been returned."
"Is the Council aware of the problems faced by property-owners in Albania?"
"What action does it intend to take to ensure that they receive the title deeds to their property as soon as possible?"
"The Council is aware that the Greek minority in Albania claims property rights in the same way as other citizens."
"It has also emerged that the Autocephalous Orthodox Church makes similar claims."
"Pursuant to Article 181 of the Albanian constitution, the Albanian Parliament must adopt laws before the end of November with a view to finding a fair solution to questions concerning expropriations and confiscations that took place before the constitution was adopted."
"The Albanian Parliament has set up a special committee on the restoration of property."
"This committee is now starting to scrutinise the legislation with a view to restoration of, or compensation for, property which was seized under Communist rule."
"The committee has not completed its work."
"The Council is fully aware that a solution to the property question is also an essential prerequisite for encouraging domestic and foreign investments in Albania, just as it is a prerequisite for the development of agriculture."
"The Council was able to subscribe fully to the assessment of the individual countries, given by the Commission in its first annual report on the stabilisation and association process."
"On 13 May of this year, the Council approved the recommendations in this report and requested that rapid progress should be made in each of these areas over the next few years."
"In one of these recommendations, Albania was specifically called on to adopt new legislation on ownership and restoration of property, to remedy the existing shortcomings in the legislation in this field and to ensure better enforcement of property law in Albania."
"Albania is the EU's partner in the stabilisation and association process."
"The EU maintains a regular dialogue with Albania, especially in the form of the meetings in the advisory EU-Albania taskforce."
"Here, the EU has the opportunity to stress the importance which is attached to solving this issue, now that the country is starting to approach integration into Europe, at the same time as acquiring closer ties with the EU."
"It also gives the EU the chance to ensure that Albania continues with the measures which it has promised in this field."
"I thank the President-in-Office for his reply, from which I understand that the Council really is aware of the problem and is making efforts in the right direction."
"However, it is not clear exactly what the Council is calling for or I, at least, fail to understand what he means by 'dealing with the problem'."
"I would expect him to decide how the problem should be dealt with."
"The State Department wrote to the Albanian government a few days ago, calling quite specifically for Greek schools to be opened at once, for recognition of land ownership by members of the Greek community and for trespassing on Greek property in Himara to stop."
"As far as I know, the Greek government has taken similar steps."
"I would remind the President-in-Office that Greece sends generous financial aid to Albania and that over 600 000 Albanian immigrants work legally and without obstruction in Greece, earning wages that workers in Albania can only dream of."
"Perhaps the European Union which also sends various forms of aid to Albania should take more persuasive measures?"
"And surely it considers it urgent and imperative, Minister, to put a stop to the plan to move 15 000 settlers from northern Albania and Kosovo to the Himara area, in order to tip the ethnic balance against the Greek minority?"
"I understand my colleague's concern very well, but I would like to stress that Parliament has taken up the matter, and a special committee has been set up."
"The constitution envisages that a solution will be found."
"The Council has expressed its opinion, and there is an ongoing dialogue between the EU and Albania, in the context of which I promised here a little while ago that the EU would ensure that Albania pursued the measures promised."
"There is therefore no question of either the Greek minority or others being left in the lurch or forgotten."
"The situation will be monitored continuously and closely."
"Mr President, first a comment on the manner in which the President-in-Office replied."
"Perhaps he thinks his questioners are stupid."
"But I can assure him that we are not that stupid."
"He has no right to say that the matter is not overshadowed by Ankara when both Ecevit and his foreign secretary have stated that they will go ahead and integrate occupied Cyprus into Turkey."
"How dare he reply like that."
"What does he take us for?"
"I did not think at all that I had brushed it aside;"
"I think that my last remark was extremely binding."
"It was a little shorter than the first one, but no less binding."
"Without wishing to correct anyone here, I shall simply remind you all that this is Question Time, which has its own rules, and ask you to adhere to the Rules of Procedure."
"Without setting a precedent and taking into consideration that Mr Lage had to leave the room for a few minutes at the time scheduled for his speech, I am going to give the President-in-Office of the Council the opportunity to respond to his question."
"I repeat: this must not set a precedent."
"If you leave the room, you lose your turn, but Mr Lage had to leave for a moment."
"I would also ask him to avoid doing this again."
"Question No 6 by Carlos Lage (H-0530/02):"
"Subject: Free movement of persons in the Schengen zone"
"On 22 June a group of 500 Portuguese citizens travelling to Spain to take part in an authorised demonstration to be held in Seville during the European Council meeting was prevented - in a violent manner - from entering Spanish territory by members of the Spanish police forces."
"Nothing can justify this kind of behaviour and action, totally unacceptable in a Union which considers respect for fundamental freedoms and rights as one of its founding principles."
"It seems unlikely that the Portuguese citizens represented a particular danger, or indeed any danger, to the Spanish State."
"And, even if they had, the forceful and heavy-handed behaviour which, unfortunately, characterised the reaction of the Spanish police authorities, would have been quite unacceptable."
"Can the Council therefore say what measures it will take vis-à-vis the Spanish Government to clarify the facts?"
"Does it not consider that a clear definition and common agreement should be sought concerning the circumstances and conditions which may lead to the suspension of the rules governing Schengen?"
"I should like to answer Question 6 by Mr Carlos Lage."
"As regards the first question, I would like to draw attention to the fact that neither Article 33 of the EU Treaty nor Article 64(1) of the EC Treaty gives the Council the ability to intervene to maintain public order or security in the Member States."
"This also applies to public-order measures which the Member States take when meetings of the European Council are held within their territory."
"This is therefore something in which the Community cannot interfere."
"As regards the second question, I would like to refer to the Executive Committee Decision of 20 December 1995 on the procedure for applying Article 2(2) of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, which has a long reference number which I do not want to read out."
"This Decision draws up detailed rules for when controls can be reintroduced at the internal borders."
"It constitutes a part of the so-called Schengen rules, and it is thus binding for all Schengen States."
"Incidentally, it is published in OJ L 239 of 22 September 2000, page 133."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I thank you for the information you have provided."
"I must tell you that this episode, linked to the Seville Summit, has caused a small political storm in Portugal and has been used by many opponents of the European Union as an argument against the European Union itself."
"Because we live in an area of free movement, the majority of public opinion in Portugal cannot understand how this area of free movement and these citizens' rights could be breached by border controls carried out in a quite oppressive and arbitrary way by the Spanish authorities."
"We do not want to make this a Portuguese issue."
"We are simply asking the President-in-Office of the Council, when he has the opportunity, to look into the matter in order to establish, not even changes to the law but common and consensual procedures to ensure that such episodes do not reoccur."
"As has been shown, it is not a matter for the Council to decide when it is reasonable to make use of the possibility under the Schengen rules for temporarily closing the borders."
"I can state that the Danish Presidency reserves the right to make use of this possibility."
"We have stated this expressly, but we were pleased that, during the weekend which has just ended, there were so few demonstrators at the summit of Foreign Ministers in Elsinore that there were twice as many police officers as demonstrators."
"Let us hope that this sets a trend for the future."
"This is not the first time this unacceptable practice has been used and the citizens of one Member State have been banned from crossing the border into another Member State and treated badly; generally it is people protesting against the policy of the European Union who are on the receiving end."
"It is what happened during the Nice summit, when thousands of Italian protesters found the French borders closed, during the Genoa summit, when hundreds of Greek demonstrators, who were badly mistreated, were prevented from disembarking in Ancona."
"It happened to Danish demonstrators, your fellow countrymen, Mr President-in-Office, during the Gothenburg summit, when they tried to cross the border and meet up with people protesting against the policy of the European Union."
"It is clear, despite the pronouncements, that Schengen was not introduced to facilitate the free movement of the citizens of the Member States of the European Union within the European Union; it was introduced in order to turn the European Union into a fortress."
"It applies when it is in the interests of the ruling circles of the European Union, so that capital can move freely, but it does not apply when it comes to the movement of people protesting against interests of big business and the policy of the European Union."
"The Schengen cooperation means that the countries undertake to maintain open borders in respect of each other, except when there are exceptional reasons for temporary closure."
"It is not a retrograde step; it is a step forward."
"The Council and I regard the possibility of temporary closure as reasonable."
"We must bear in mind that it is not only a question of lawful demonstrations, it has been a question of something resembling terrorist activity in connection with these meetings."
"We must protect democratic gatherings. That is something we owe to democracy."
"Mr Haarder said, amongst other things, that the meeting in Elsinore had been very calm and that none of the expected, or feared, disturbances had arisen."
"That is good, of course."
"I wonder, however, whether this might possibly also have had something to do with the fact that there were strict border controls, so that any foreign demonstrators who might have wanted to get to Denmark and Elsinore were in fact unable to do so."
"It would be helpful if Mr Haarder could deny that this is the case and state clearly that no one has yet been turned away from the Danish border during the Danish presidency."
"If I may venture to answer as a Danish minister: I do not think that, in connection with the weekend meeting in Elsinore, we made any use whatsoever of the possibility under the Schengen rules of closing the borders."
"Demonstrators were completely free to enter; but fortunately only peaceful demonstrators came, and that is something I think we should be pleased about."
"Question No 9 by María Izquierdo Rojo (H-0540/02):"
"Subject: Women who work in the fields in accession countries"
"What measures, benefits and activities connected with the accession process directly affect women who work in the fields in the accession countries?"
"What measures will the Danish presidency be taking with regard to such women?"
"Both the Member States and the EU institutions are obliged to incorporate equal opportunities for men and women in all EU policies and programmes, and the European Council has on several occasions set out guidelines for a special strategy in this field."
"Furthermore, Regulation No 1250 from 1999 lays down that the Structural Funds shall contribute to removing inequalities between men and women and to promoting equal opportunities in the context of strengthening economic and social cohesion."
"That also applies to pre-accession programmes."
"In connection with this, the Union has set aside considerable financial aid for measures to develop the rural districts by means of the so-called SAPARD programme."
"The Member of the European Parliament may apply directly to the Commission if she wishes to have a fuller overview of the specific programmes."
"With particular regard to the pre-accession negotiations concerning the chapter on agriculture, the common position of the Union also contains a comprehensive section on development of the rural districts."
"It covers the aid which will be given through the EU's various financial instruments."
"As the rural districts in the candidate countries require restructuring, modernisation and alternative production and facilities, the EU attaches great importance to the measures for developing the rural districts, which have a direct effect on the conditions under which women in these regions work."
"During the negotiations on the chapter on employment and industrial relations policy, the Union has stressed the importance which this section has for the equal treatment of men and women, and it has also been emphasised how necessary it is for the candidate countries to comply with the rules in this field."
"I would like to draw attention to Regulation No 1257 from 1999, which groups together all Community actions in favour of development of the rural districts and in which it is expressly stated that measures aimed at removing inequalities and promoting equal opportunities for men and women should be supported."
"Recently, the Council concerning agriculture, that is to say the Agricultural Ministers Council, at its meeting on 27 May of this year, adopted specific conclusions on the integration of the equality aspect into the Common Agricultural Policy."
"The Council expressly recognised in these conclusions that women play a bigger and bigger role in the rural districts, and it calls on the Commission to use the Structural Funds to continue to promote entrepreneurial spirit, high-quality employment, training and the provision of life-long services for rural women."
"Furthermore, the Council urges the Member States to adopt policies which actively strengthen women's economic capacity in the rural districts."
"The Council points out that all the candidate countries have now agreed to come into line with existing Community law regarding equality immediately on accession."
"The Danish Presidency wants to follow the same line, inter alia in the context of the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy and the further negotiations on accession."
"We want to make use of every opportunity to draw attention to the general fundamental principles of the Treaty establishing the European Community, as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam, and in this respect to promote equality between men and women, as referred to in Article 2 and Article 3(2) of the Treaty."
"Finally, I should point out that the current Chairman of this Agricultural Ministers Council is herself from a farming background."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, how many of these female agricultural workers will become part of the European Union at the next enlargement?"
"What number were you working with in your forecasts?"
"I would also like to ask you if, during the Danish Presidency, any actions or campaigns will be implemented to correct the current salary discrimination."
"I am not in a position to answer the question that has been asked, and I am not even sure that studies will make it possible to answer it. I shall gladly try, but I cannot answer the question here orally."
"I cannot."
"Mrs Izquierdo Rojo asked two questions, did she not?"
"I believe the second question was this, but perhaps you would care to comment, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo."
"Mr President, I would like to tell you that I would be interested to know the figure whenever the President-in-Office of the Council can provide it, in other words, how many female agricultural workers are expected on the first wave of accession."
"Otherwise, we cannot carry out any advance planning."
"For any action to take place, if we are to gear it towards female agricultural workers, we have to know how many there will be."
"At the moment this is not possible, but I would be grateful if you could send me the figure."
"With regard to the second question, I would also appreciate a response on whether or not a campaign will be carried out."
"I do not think that we in Denmark have any information as to how many there are in Denmark. Nor do I think that people in other countries have any."
"It may be regrettable; but I do not think the information exists."
"However, I shall willingly try to find the information, if it is wanted."
"Yes, we have taken note, but, Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, Mr Haarder answers what he sees fit to answer."
"We are not going to start a debate now."
"Mr President, the Council must know how many female agricultural workers are going to join the Union."
"Well, if and when the Council does know, it will answer you, but now you have asked your question twice."
"If the President-in-Office of the Council wants to tell you anything else, however, I am not going to stop him."
"Yes, of course we know how many farms are entering."
"We know quite precisely, both in Poland and the other countries."
"However, we do not know how many rural women are coming in."
"We do not have the classification by gender."
"I very much regret that."
"Question No 10 by Jonas Sjöstedt, which has been taken over by Herman Schmid. Question No 10 by Jonas Sjöstedt (H-0542/02):"
"Subject: Future accession treaties for new Member States"
"It is possible that the Irish electorate will vote against the Treaty of Nice for a second time, which would also render the new breakdown of votes on the Council and seats in Parliament under that Treaty null and void."
"Would it not then be possible for the Union to act as it did at the time of the accession of Finland, Sweden and Austria, i.e. negotiate and reach agreement with each of the applicant countries separately on seats in Parliament and votes in the Council in the treaty of accession?"
"The Treaty of Nice would not then be needed as a basis for the accession of new Member States."
"Is this not an appropriate procedure to use for the enlargement of the Union should the Irish people vote against the Treaty of Nice once again?"
"I would like to remind the honourable Member that the European Council in Seville expressed satisfaction that the Irish Government had firmly decided to get the Treaty of Nice approved, something which - as is well known - is a prerequisite for enlargement to take place within the time limits laid down."
"On behalf of the Council, I would like to recall that, at the meeting in Seville, Ireland's Prime Minister stated that his government intended holding a referendum this autumn, so that Ireland can ratify the Treaty of Nice."
"The Prime Minister presented a national declaration from Ireland, confirming that the provisions of the EU Treaty relating to foreign and security policy do not affect the country's traditional policy regarding military neutrality, and will not do so after ratification of the Treaty of Nice, as can be seen from Annex 3 to the Presidency's conclusions."
"The European Council adopted a declaration, in which note was taken of the national declaration by Ireland."
"This declaration can be found in Annex 4 to the same conclusions."
"The European Council expressed satisfaction that the Irish Government had firmly decided to get the Treaty of Nice approved, something which - as is well known - is a prerequisite for enlargement to be implemented within the time limits laid down."
"I fully appreciate that the Irish Government and the Irish Prime Minister would like this to happen, but the Irish Government cannot decide how the Irish people will vote."
"The issue must therefore be regarded as remaining open until the referendum has been held."
"Consequently, another 'No' vote from the Irish people cannot be ruled out."
"My question relates to a situation that is wholly feasible and quite practical."
"This is not an abstract question, but a practical, political one."
"Given such a situation, could we not solve the problems in a very simple, practical way, by allowing Ireland to join the institutions in the same way as Finland, Sweden and Austria did, i.e. by negotiation?"
"That way, there would be no problem with the Treaty of Nice."
"Would not that be a practical, pragmatic solution that might also appeal to Mr Haarder?"
"I cannot say any more than I have already said, because this is the way things stand."
"Of course it might turn out to be a 'no' - we all know that - but in that case we would have a totally new and unpredictable situation of which it would be impossible to predict the conclusion. It is a very uncertain situation, and one which puts enlargement at risk in any case."
"I would not wish there to be any controversy over the matter, however; I only wanted to state the facts concerning the Council and the Irish vote."
"Several Members have asked to speak."
"Pursuant to the Rules of Procedure, I am going to give the floor to the two who were chronologically first to ask."
"Mr Crowley has the floor for a supplementary question."
"I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his response."
"I should like to ask him to confirm - what I believe him to have said, through interpretation - that ratification of the Treaty of Nice by all Member States is necessary for enlargement to proceed."
"It is a simple 'yes' or 'no' answer."
"Yes, as I have said twice before, this is a precondition for enlargement to take place within the scheduled timescale."
"This is what it says in the Seville conclusions, and I take my stand on these."
"My question follows that one."
"You say it is a precondition within the time set."
"Is that the 2004 time-limit, meaning that it will still be possible to have enlargement beyond 2004 without the Nice Treaty, perhaps under the system suggested by Mr Sjöstedt in this question?"
"I have said what was agreed in Seville, and I take my stand on that."
"I have nothing to add: everyone is aware that deadlines were set in Helsinki and that these have been affirmed time after time."
"What was said in Seville was that the Treaty of Nice is a precondition for enlargement to take place within the scheduled timescale."
"Non-ratification of the Treaty of Nice would present us with an extremely uncertain and unpredictable situation."
"Question No 11 by Gary Titley (H-0544/02):"
"Subject: Better regulation"
"This month, the Commission delivered its communication on better regulation."
"A central aim of this communication is to ensure that an impact assessment of all Commission proposals is carried out."
"What practical measures are being taken by the Council to ensure that they carry out impact assessments on Council amendments to Commission proposals?"
"The European Council in Seville welcomed a number of communications from the Commission on how lawmaking might be improved."
"I am thinking in particular of the action plan for finding ways of simplifying and improving the quality of the regulatory environment."
"It invited the three institutions concerned, that is, Parliament, the Council and the Commission, to arrange for this to happen on the basis of the work of the High Level Technical Group and to adopt an interinstitutional agreement before the end of 2002 in order to improve the quality of Community legislation and the conditions, including time frames, for its transposition into national law."
"The High Level Technical Group for Interinstitutional Cooperation met on 15 July 2002."
"In anticipation of this meeting, the Presidency had put forward a proposed timetable for drawing up and adopting the commercial interinstitutional agreement, starting with the specific actions relating to the three institutions as proposed in the Commission's action plan."
"At the meeting on 15 July 2002, it was decided firstly to reach common agreement on the chief elements of a future interinstitutional agreement."
"The institutions would then, on the basis of this, discuss the practical content of the specific actions of the agreement."
"At the same time, it was emphasised that the principle of specific actions in an agreement should be viewed in the context of the work being undertaken in the Convention."
"Practical measures with a view to an impact assessment of amendments to the Commission's proposal can be expected to be an element for inclusion in further discussions on an interinstitutional agreement."
"In this context, I can tell you that the next meeting of the High Level Technical Group is expected to take place next week, on 10 September."
"It is a delight to have Mr Haarder with us again, in a different role."
"But may I say with respect that now that he has become part of the government he acquired the government's habit of not answering the question."
"How exactly is the Council going to approach the issue of impact assessments?"
"If the Commission carries out an impact assessment as part of its better regulation proposals, will the Council, when it amends the Commission's proposals, carry out a further impact assessment of its own amendments?"
"How will it do that and who will it get to do it?"
"It is very important in terms of the interinstitutional agreement with Parliament to know exactly what the Council's approach is to impact assessments."
"I should like to have given a clear answer."
"If I did not do so, it was because that very question is to be discussed in connection with the interinstitutional agreement; it is a question which, among other things, will be discussed next week, on 10 September."
"I cannot say what will happen, therefore, but I can say this: a reform is not undertaken without carrying out assessments, and without pursuing the aims of the reform."
"Finding a way of assessing its possible impact is a natural subject for the interinstitutional agreement."
"Following up Mr Titley's point, could I ask whether the Council would look seriously at the question of critically considering methodologies of impact assessment?"
"In the years when I had something to do with this in an academic capacity, it was notorious that it was extremely difficult within the sociology of law to find reliable ways of assessing the impact of legislation which was in force."
"Predicting the impact of legislation which is going to come into force is yet more difficult."
"Does the President-in-Office agree with me that it would be wise for the Council to look into issues of methodology before we embark on expensive projects of this kind?"
"It is precisely that which is to be discussed."
"I cannot say whether I am 100% in agreement with what was said, but the speaker is in any case an intelligent man and he is probably right in what he says."
"The question, therefore, is to what extent we shall proceed in this way."
"It is that which is to be discussed on 10 September, and I ask that the House appreciate this."
"Question No 12 by Manuel Medina Ortega (H-0545/02):"
"Subject: Measures to restrict illegal immigration into the Canaries"
"On the basis of the agreements adopted at the Seville summit, what measures does the Council propose to restrict the massive influx of illegal immigrants into the Canary Islands?"
"In particular, what measures are proposed to curb this irregular form of immigration at the places of origin, in order to ensure the safety of the immigrants themselves?"
"The conclusions from the Seville European Council outline the measures which are to be taken with a view to combating the problem of illegal immigration effectively at EU level; and here we are talking about both prevention and restriction of immigration."
"We need to strike a fair balance between this aim on the one hand and the aim of better integration of those immigrants who are lawfully present in our countries on the other, and of course we also need an asylum policy which complies with international conventions."
"It should also be mentioned that, even before the Seville European Council, the Spanish Presidency had given a significant impetus to this matter, notably by adopting two normative instruments, which not only map out some of the necessary measures, but also set the framework for future efforts and the development thereof."
"The instruments concerned are the action plan to combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings and the action plan for the management of EU external borders, which were both adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council."
"In addition, this Council reached an agreement on 13 June of this year on conclusions about measures to be taken to prevent and combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings by sea."
"The conclusions from Seville, which make specific reference to these action plans, attach importance to the following measures."
"Firstly, speeding up the conclusion of readmission agreements currently being negotiated and approval of new briefs for the negotiation of readmission agreements with countries already identified by the Council: see conclusion No 30."
"Secondly, as regards expulsion and repatriation policies, adoption by the end of the year at the latest of the components of a repatriation programme based on the Green Paper submitted by the Commission in April 2002."
"This also falls under conclusion No 30."
"Thirdly, the gradual introduction of coordinated, integrated management of external borders, which should, among other aims, help bring greater control of migration flows."
"A number of measures are mapped out which should make it possible to achieve this goal very shortly: see conclusions Nos 31 and 32."
"In a wider and more general perspective, the conclusions from Seville affirmed that immigration policy, as an essential element to be taken into consideration, should be integrated into the EU's relations with third countries."
"They pointed out that an integrated, comprehensive and balanced approach to tackle the root causes of illegal immigration must remain the EU's constant long-term objective."
"The conclusions highlight the importance of ensuring the cooperation of countries of origin and of transit in joint management and in border control and also in readmission, which is discussed in conclusion No 34."
"The conclusions confirmed that it is necessary to carry out a systematic assessment of relations with third countries which do not cooperate in combating illegal immigration in the relevant areas."
"They point out in this regard that inadequate cooperation by a country could hamper the establishment of closer relations between that country and the EU."
"In the light of the conclusions from Seville, the Danish Presidency has attached a high priority in its work schedule to the fight against illegal immigration, so that the European Council conclusions can be implemented swiftly."
"I can inform you that I myself shall be the President-in-Office of the Council when it debates these issues."
"Mr President, during the first sitting in July, when you were President-in-Office of the Council, I asked you a very similar question and you told me that the Council and the Danish Presidency would address the matter as quickly as possible."
"Two or three days later, on 8 July, I asked this question, hoping specifically that during the summer something would have been done."
"The problem we have in the European Union, Mr President, and this is neither your fault nor that of the Danish Government, is that our system does not work."
"Between the date on which I asked the first question, the first week of July, and today, thousands of illegal immigrants have entered the Canary Islands, both by sea and by air, and the situation there is unsustainable, and we do not have any reception centres."
"These islands have a smaller area than the islands of Denmark, and at the moment we do not have any means of solving the problem."
"Mr President, I would say - and I repeat - that, through no fault of your own or of the Danish Presidency, the Council of the European Union is not following up the proposals that Mr Vitorino has been making for some time now, so that the European Union can in fact establish control."
"We should at least know who is arriving and why, and what we can do for them."
"These problems in the Canary Islands came to my attention frequently when I attended the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) on migration in Lanzarote in the early summer."
"I am therefore very aware of these problems, and I can assure Mr Medina Ortega that we are very active in this field."
"I travelled to Athens to discuss problems - specific problems - with what is known as the Dublin II agreement, which determines which country should take responsibility for handling an asylum application."
"I am probably going to Rome next weekend to discuss the same problems."
"If we adopt the new system - guaranteeing that it is the responsibility of the first country to handle an asylum application - combined with the system of fingerprint exchange, there is some apprehension that certain countries will see particularly large numbers of asylum seekers returned to them and will therefore bear an exceptionally heavy burden. Of course, this will have to be discussed."
"I do not believe that the problem is very serious; but we do have to consider how we can reassure the governments concerned."
"There are several ways of doing this, and it is those I am discussing with the relevant governments. This merely by way of convincing Mr Medina Ortega that we are absolutely not passive in this matter; we are extremely active."
"We have started with the most difficult problems of all, with a view to getting those out of the way, in order that we can not merely realise the wish expressed in the Seville conclusions for the completion of the Dublin system, but also make the best possible progress with the common asylum rules. Although the Presidency has also declared these a high priority, we have not promised to be able to finish drawing them up during the Danish term."
"We intend to make the best progress we possibly can with the work, and if possible complete it in November."
"Question No 13 by Astrid Thors (H-0547/02):"
"Subject: Finalising of the agreement concerning the Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Program"
"According to the Commission (DG External Relations) a part of the bilateral work concerning the EU's relations with Russia focused for much of 2001 on energy, environmental protection and nuclear safety."
"This was meant to be done through the conclusion of the agreement on a Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Program, (MNEPR), aimed at cleaning up radioactive waste in north-west Russia and through the Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership (NDEP)."
"Similarly, in the press brief from the Commission (issued on 27 May 2002) before the Ninth EU-Russia Summit held in Moscow in May 2002, it was stated that the environment and nuclear safety were going to be discussed and that it would be important to ensure that the Russian federation finalise the MNEPR agreement as soon as possible."
"In the Joint Statement issued after the EU-Russia Summit, however, no reference was made to the MNEPR."
"A pledge conference on the NDEP is also to be held on 9 July."
"What is the current situation concerning the MNEPR?"
"What are the obstacles to the conclusion of an agreement on the MNEPR?"
"What measures is the Council going to take in the near future in order to ensure that the Russian Federation finalises the agreement?"
"The negotiations on the Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Programme in the Russian Federation (MNEPR) have been going on for more than three years."
"The EU has emphasised at a number of summits that these negotiations should be brought to a swift conclusion."
"It is true that the common will to conclude the negotiations was not formally expressed in the joint statement from the summit in Moscow on 29 May, but the question was discussed at the summit, and Russia expressed a desire for resolution of the outstanding issues, which are of course taxation and civil liability."
"The EU has taken every opportunity to put pressure on Russia to break the deadlock, including at the meetings of the Cooperation Council."
"The other partner countries, the USA and Norway, have also put her under intense pressure."
"The EU attaches great importance to nuclear safety in North-West Russia and believes that this agreement could contribute to overcoming some of the obstacles to the implementation of projects which could further cooperation on safety in connection with the management of irradiated nuclear fuel and radioactive waste in the Russian Federation."
"The inaugural pledging conference for the Support Fund of the Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership (NDEP) was concluded with a positive result on 9 July of this year in Brussels."
"The initial contribution to the Support Fund was approximately EUR 110 million, of which EUR 62 million are earmarked for nuclear projects."
"Participants in the conference emphasised that the conclusion of this MNEPR agreement is a necessary precondition for projects within the nuclear sphere entering into operation within the framework of the NDEP."
"The NDEP is an important and practical step towards achieving the objectives, set by the G8, of the Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction."
"The nuclear-safety issue is of decisive importance for environmental protection on the continent of Europe."
"This particularly concerns Russia, but also other North European countries."
"The Danish Presidency therefore wishes to work towards bringing the negotiations on the MNEPR agreement to a conclusion by the end of this year."
"I hope this answers Mrs Astrid Thors's question."
"I am satisfied with the reply, but unfortunately I must say that the Russian side seems to have a certain attitude of divide et impera towards the European authorities."
"In the past, I have even seen a situation where the Council was given one answer and the Commission another, and they play on the fact that the presidency changes."
"I could also quote yesterday's answer from the Commission to a similar question: 'Unfortunately, over recent months the Russian side has neither confirmed its willingness to sign nor given any indication of the nature of the problems holding up their signature.'"
"I regret to say I have a feeling that the Russian side will continue to delay."
"I would therefore appeal to the Danish Presidency to exert considerable pressure if necessary."
"At the same summit where this agreement was not signed, Russia was still accepted as a market economy."
"Is there no similar way to achieve what is now needed?"
"I would like to thank Mr Haarder for the commitment he showed to the Northern dimension last week."
"I do understand the fact that Mrs Astrid Thors is losing patience: we in the Presidency and the Council are as well, which is why we have taken every opportunity to exert pressure."
"Without commenting on what was said about Russia's strategy, I can at least guarantee that we shall not miss an opportunity to put pressure on Russia, as I have said."
"I have just attended a Ministerial Conference in Greenland in which the Russians also participated."
"The subject matter was the Northern Dimension, in which I know that Mrs Thors also has a great interest."
"Many of these matters were also raised there, and I believe that it is important - and here I am sure that we are in agreement - that we establish cooperation with Russia in as many fields as possible, while seeing this as a way of increasing the opportunities for exerting pressure on her in those areas where we believe it important and necessary."
"I am thinking of Kaliningrad, of the enlargement of NATO and the EU and of the environmental problems in the Murmansk area, which Mrs Thors knows more about than I do."
"There is every reason for establishing relations with Russia in as many fields as we possibly can, and at the same time for taking advantage of these opportunities to put pressure on her where we believe it really is necessary."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would be interested to know whether these treaties were concluded at International Atomic Energy Agency level."
"In Europe, we do have the problem that it is the Member States alone that decide on safety standards for nuclear power stations."
"Parliament has come to an arrangement with the Commission, specifically with Commissioner de Palacio, that safety standards for atomic power stations are to be submitted before the new Member States join."
"Your fellow Member of the Council emphasised to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy that this would be one of your Presidency's priorities."
"So I would not only like to know what the current position is on the agreement with Russia, but also what we ourselves think about nuclear safety and about how nuclear power stations are to be made safe."
"In my opinion, the agreements which I have been answering questions on here concern a different topic, and therefore this supplementary question does not bear any direct relation to the questions I have answered."
"I do not mean that there is a set of rules in the archives, but I prefer not to improvise, as this is outside the scope of the question."
"The supplementary questions should still be on the Russian Federation and the problem of nuclear energy in EU-Russia relations."
"Question No 14 will not be taken as the subject to which it refers already appears in the agenda for this part-session."
"Question No 15 by Brian Crowley (H-0554/02):"
"Subject: Tackling Drugs"
"The prevalence of illegal drugs, including crack-cocaine, continues to cause serious problems for society in terms of addiction, criminality, treatment and policing."
"Will the Danish Presidency, in the light of subsidiarity, give assurances that the Council will make the fight against illegal drugs a top priority of the Danish Presidency, and will it report back to the House in December 2002 on the initiatives and actions it has undertaken in this regard?"
"This is Question No 15 by Mr Fitzsimons."
"No, sorry, just a moment."
"The question was from Mr Crowley."
"Like its Spanish predecessor, the Danish Presidency attaches great importance to combating drugs."
"The cornerstone of the Presidency's drugs programme is the mid-term review of the EU action plan to combat drugs for 2000-2004."
"The Commission will draw up an evaluation report to be submitted to the European Council at the meeting in Copenhagen in December."
"The Danish Presidency intends to monitor closely the preparation of the Commission's report to ensure that the relevant working parties in the Council contribute to the greatest possible extent so that the report is comprehensive and informative."
"The Danish Presidency has adopted a balanced approach to the drugs problem and will therefore endeavour to pay as much attention to prevention and drug-supply reduction as to international cooperation."
"It has presented initiatives on the treatment of criminal drug abusers whilst they are in jail, and on synthetic drugs: the generic classification."
"In addition, the Presidency intends to step up efforts to address current, and any future, problems regarding the distribution of illicit drugs on the Internet."
"At international level, meetings will be held with the candidate countries, the USA, Russia and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN); and, as far as Latin America is concerned, meetings will be held in preparation for the event to be held during the Greek Presidency."
"In this way, the Presidency intends to hold meetings with most of the countries which, from the point of view of the EU, are the principal countries of origin and of transit for illicit drugs."
"The issue of cocaine will be discussed at meetings with the USA and with parties in Latin America."
"In December, the Presidency will as far as possible inform the European Parliament of the results achieved during the Danish Presidency."
"Mr President, again I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his response."
"The reason for asking this question is that over the last eight months several huge seizures of illegal drugs and narcotics have been made across the European Union."
"In Ireland over the last eight months something in the region of 24 million euros' worth of illegal substances was seized by police and customs officers, in Britain 82 million euros' worth and across the rest of the European Union 297 million euros' worth."
"The European Union now has the distinction of being the main user of synthetic drugs such as ecstasy and amphetamines."
"The reason I put a specific request for you to come forward with conclusions or results at the end of the presidency in December is that I was hoping that - linking back to what Mr Hyland was talking about earlier - it would be possible during your time in the presidency to undertake a joint initiative between young people and the presidency to ask young people about the dangers facing them and try and alleviate some of the social problems and issues people face that drive them into the drug culture."
"I should like to thank Mr Crowley for his firm commitment to this matter and thank him for his good advice and suggestions."
"I can only say that we shall do what we can because, and I repeat, we consider this a particularly important area."
"Mr President, what I would like to know is whether preventive programmes are being considered or whether the Council has given some thought to incentives for alternatives, so that young people who have already come into contact with drugs can come off them."
"We could talk long and hard about this subject, that is, how alternatives - alternative substances in some cases - can be used to help these young people out of their abuse pattern at the earliest opportunity."
"This is a matter which, I believe, concerns the national parliaments in all of our Member States, and it also concerns the Danish Presidency."
"I cannot say that the question will become a central one, as it is first and foremost the responsibility of national, and often even local, authorities to guarantee these therapies, but I can say that I agree that this is a core problem. In my national parliament, at least, it is the subject of a debate involving heightened emotions and opinions which cut across parties because the plight of these young people is so distressing."
"At the same time, there is a difficulty with giving them substances to help them out, as this can also cause them to become dependent in some other way."
"In short, we could talk at length about this, but this is not the place."
"Question No 16 has been withdrawn."
"As the author is not present, Question No 17 lapses."
"The Council is monitoring very closely humanitarian conditions and the human rights situation in Equatorial Guinea, in particular the case of the imprisoned opposition leaders and the conditions under which they are held."
"We all recall that the EU, directly after the sentence was passed, made a declaration calling upon the relevant authorities to take the necessary measures to have the sentences reviewed and ensure that the fundamental rights of the accused were respected."
"The EU has on a number of occasions expressed deep concern at the deterioration in the human rights situation, and, following the death of Juan Ondó Nguema, the Council debated reports concerning the causes."
"At that time, neither the government's nor the opposition's explanation could be confirmed."
"According to the opposition, his death was due to torture and ill-treatment, whereas the government gave the cause of death as a serious lung disease, from which he was allegedly suffering prior to the trial."
"Against this background, the Council does not intend to take emergency measures at this stage, but will continue its investigations into the circumstances leading to Nguema's death."
"The EU will employ appropriate political and diplomatic means in order to put pressure on the authorities in Equatorial Guinea to bring about an improvement in the human rights situation in general and to promote democratic reforms in that unfortunate country."
"Mr Haarder, we were referring in our question to the death in prison of Juan Ondó Nguema, but, sadly, we must now add that on 31 August another political prisoner died in the Black Beach prison, Juan Asumu Sima."
"This 80-year-old man had to attend trial, sometimes assisted, and at others seated, due to the brutal torture to which he had been subjected."
"The political prisoners in Black Beach may end up becoming names on a long list of the deceased which will continually prick the conscience of international and, of course, European Union public opinion."
"Mr Haarder, the Council can think what it likes, but, of course, believing the government of Equatorial Guinea instead of the opposition is too much to believe."
"I ask you, is the Council thinking of making an official visit to the political prisoners in Black Beach and, moreover, taking measures to suspend the Cotonou agreement with Equatorial Guinea if they are not freed immediately?"
"The Council will of course use all available means to find the truth."
"I myself have been present here in Parliament to debate resolutions on that unfortunate country, and I can assure the House that the Council has every intention of finding the truth."
"My words should not be taken to mean that I attach more weight to the government's than the opposition's assertions;"
"I am just pointing out that it is one party's word against another's, and what we have to do is establish the truth - documented truth, mind you - so that we can substantiate any charge against the government and increase the pressure on the regime."
"I fully agree with my former colleague and thank him for the tragic, and regrettable, news that another death has taken place."
"This is of course yet another argument for maintaining the pressure and availing ourselves of all the means to obtain information and exert pressure."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, on 3 July, we asked the Council for immediate action to address the highly worrying situation of a large group of opponents of Mr Obiang's regime in Equatorial Guinea."
"At that time we asked for an appeal to be made, for pressure to be exerted."
"Two days later, on 5 July, to be precise, one of those convicted in the judgment that incarcerated dozens of opponents in Black Beach, Juan Ondó Nguema, died as a result of the maltreatment he suffered, and due to water and sleep deprivation during the last days of his life."
"Mr President, I know that the world is often cruel and that, of course, neither Europe nor the Council can solve all of its problems or shoulder all of its tragedies."
"This, however, was a very specific, localised problem."
"A few days ago, another opponent died, and we ask again, insistently, Mr President, that the Council please do something immediately to solve this problem and remove the threat hanging over a few, very specific people."
"I do not know how my former colleague had thought the Council could remove this threat."
"It has done its best with the means at its disposal."
"I have said this, and the Council will continue to do so. I can say no more."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"As the time allocated to Question Time is at an end, Questions Nos 20 to 34 will be answered in writing"
"The next item is the report (A5-0226/2002) by Mrs Stenzel, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the annual report on the European Agency for Reconstruction (2001/2255(INI))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, and those ladies and gentlemen who are still present, the report on the 2001 annual report on the European Agency for Reconstruction was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on 11 June 2002."
"The vote in plenary was, however, deliberately adjourned to the autumn, in order to give the Commission the opportunity to comply with a demand constantly reiterated by the Foreign Policy Committee by presenting a strategy for overall policy in the Balkans and the Agency for Reconstruction's role in it and clarifying how, in future, functions are to be shared out between, on the one hand, the Agency and, on the other, the delegations on the ground."
"The Commission has not submitted a report on this, nor has it kept to the November 2001 agreement in which it undertook to present the report on the medium-term strategy for the administration of EU aid in the context of the stabilisation and association process before the end of March 2002."
"The European Commission's report on strategies for assistance in the Western Balkans is a very thorough depiction of the situation, and Commissioner Patten was also available on 19 June to give us additional information."
"No strategy in this sense was articulated, however, something that Mr Swoboda summed up with words to the effect that, if there were no such strategy, that itself spoke volumes."
"The demand that the Commission submit a report to the Council, not as late as June 2004, just before the European Agency for Reconstruction's mandate expires, but by June 2003 at the latest, and involve Parliament in this, is therefore all the more important."
"Only thus can we avoid destabilising the Agency and ensure that it can work efficiently."
"This becomes a matter of even more pressing concern in view of the EU's financial commitments in the Balkans."
"I was myself able, when visiting Pristina, to satisfy myself as to the Agency's efficiency, which, incidentally, the Court of Auditors has also confirmed."
"It is extremely regrettable and gives cause for concern that the export of electricity by the local electricity company KEK resulted in substantial irregularities, with export earnings amounting to USD 4.2 million landing up in an illicit account in Gibraltar."
"The Agency has itself, however, introduced measures to prevent future criminal manoeuvres of this kind within KEK and help it to clear them up."
"The Agency for Reconstruction also itself called in OLAF in relation to the contract of a questionable external advisor."
"What is important in this connection is that an internal auditor is to be appointed as soon as possible."
"The provision of electricity in Kosovo still leaves much to be desired."
"That a new agreement between UNMIK and Serbia created the political conditions for making it easier to supply Kosovo with adequate electricity is something to be welcomed."
"As rapporteur, I am aware that the Agency works in Kosovo under difficult political conditions."
"Its political status has still not been clarified, and there are continuing ethnic tensions between the Serb minority and the Albanian majority."
"Making the positive influence of the European Union and of the Agency visible is thus all the more important."
"Any strategy for this region must have as its objective the facilitation of a sustainable policy and the progressive reduction of financial grants from the EU, principally through efficient charging for all public services."
"The extension of the Agency's mandate to Macedonia aroused controversy, as the political situation prevailing in Macedonia at the outset, whilst extremely fragile, was quite different to that in Kosovo and, above all, because the consultation mechanism between the Commission and Parliament, by which of course funds have to be approved, was not always ideal."
"The report therefore proposes political guidelines for the Agency, and future work can centre around these."
"The decision-making mechanisms in the Commission's individual offices should also be as clear and transparent as possible."
"Turning specifically to the Agency's commitments in Macedonia, the situation has improved, and it has been possible to complete 900 houses."
"Progress has also been made in clearing mines."
"It is also particularly important that the Agency should enjoy a problem-free working relationship with the local delegation in Macedonia, where elections are due to be held on 15 September."
"The situation there is extremely tense, and it is not certain whether these elections will be held under proper conditions, if, that is, they are held at all."
"Today in plenary, we have been debating the European Union's responsibility for Afghanistan, and have assured Commissioner Patten of our support."
"What is true of Afghanistan applies far more to the Balkans, for which the European Union has a direct responsibility."
"In this sense, the report on the Agency for Reconstruction should make a contribution to sustainable crisis management."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to make a few comments on this matter from the standpoint of the Committee on Budgets."
"Since the beginning of the crisis in the Balkans, we - especially the Budget Committee - have insisted that all the substantial EU funds invested in reconstruction must be used in such a way that our principles of good governance are respected."
"This means, inter alia, that we have demanded assurances in terms of efficient administration, decentralisation, swift payments, avoidance of bottlenecks and scrutiny of funds."
"When the European Agency for Reconstruction was created in early 2000, it was actually in response to a request from Parliament."
"Furthermore, we did away with the original, unwieldy committee procedure."
"We obtained a much simpler model that we believe has been extremely important and thanks to which, inter alia, decisions on practical projects can generally be taken at local level."
"I must also say that cooperation between the Thessaloniki office and the operations offices in Pristina, Belgrade, etc., has been more effective than many of us had believed at the outset."
"We would perhaps still like to have a little more information from the Commission regarding how many people are left in Brussels and how many are working in Thessaloniki and in the other localities."
"Have we really managed to avoid duplication of effort, which was one of our aims?"
"In any case, what we can say is that an extremely high percentage of the available funds have been allocated and paid out."
"The Court of Auditors also commented on the high levels of efficiency, which is very good."
"At the same time, guidelines are, of course, needed for the future, particularly since we now realise that we have been so efficient that we might have too little money left at the end of this seven-year term of the CARDS programme."
"Even now, the Commission has been forced to propose a radical reduction in aid to Kosovo, for example, and this present us with a big challenge."
"Can we delegate to the local and national authorities?"
"How shall we proceed in the future?"
"Strategic reflection is now needed for the future, if we are to continue to have the same levels of efficiency."
"That is the message from the Committee on Budgets."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Stenzel, this is a very fine and comprehensive report."
"The fact that we, as my group has demanded, are actually debating it this evening is almost enough to give one a bad conscience."
"I wish to apologise to all those for whom that is their reason for being here."
"I do think, though, that it is right to review what we have achieved in the Balkans, especially in the area where the Agency is active, and consider what we have not yet achieved."
"As previous speakers have done, we must hang on to the fundamental truth that the Agency has performed well and that we can take much satisfaction in that."
"At the same time, though, it must be said that there are a number of aspects in which the European Union's policy has to be continued with and perhaps even stepped up."
"If we are to use the Agency to disburse funds - Mrs Stenzel thinks the amount should decrease, and she is right - we have to be aware that the economic situation continues to be very, very bleak."
"Money will not compensate for all of that; we must rather concentrate on building up structures that make it possible for there to be perceptible - but, admittedly slow - economic development and growth."
"Such structures are, unfortunately, not yet in place."
"As far as the political situation is concerned, we still also have great deficiencies to deal with; one might almost say we have to deal with the lack of a maturation process, both in relations between Serbia and Montenegro and in the conditions within them."
"There is still, alas, insufficient willingness in Kosovo to accept that this European Union of ours has committed itself to a multi-ethnic Kosovo inhabited mainly by the Albanian population, but in which the Serbs must also be able to live in freedom and peace and go about their normal work and economic activity."
"That has not even started to happen in Kosovo!"
"In Macedonia, to which some of us are travelling in a few days to observe the elections, there are still recurrent incidents, and some killings."
"There, too, the process of political maturation has not yet progressed as far as it needs to."
"I am glad that Commissioner Vitorino is present to hear the third point I would like to make, which is that the central Balkan region continues to be a country of transit for a lot of objectionable cross-border activities."
"We are of course aware that certain illegal organisations do not object to ethnic cooperation and have no problem with the overcoming of borders."
"Now, I do not want to run this region down, as activities such as trafficking in drugs and human beings often have EU countries as their destinations, whilst their sources are often elsewhere."
"I do believe, though, that it is with our own population in mind that we have to shoulder full responsibility for a Balkan policy that makes it possible to put the brakes on these dealings as quickly and effectively as possible."
"Some of us have ourselves visited the Bucharest centre that is actively dedicated specifically to combating these criminal activities, and I want to ask Commissioner Vitorino, as a matter of urgency, to collaborate to the utmost with Commissioner Patten in seeing to it that a stop is put to these criminal activities, which are giving the region a bad reputation."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Stenzel for her very effective and useful report."
"I cannot claim to be a close observer or to have very detailed knowledge of the operations of the agency and therefore I find her report very valuable."
"As someone who for the last three years has been on the delegation to south-east Europe and more recently a vice-chair, I feel it is essential that we keep up and develop the financial assistance to allow the Balkan countries to aspire to the eventual goal, which must be membership of the European Union."
"I was one of those who was not convinced by the original decision to site the headquarters of the agency in Thessaloniki."
"It was the rather traditional story of doling out prizes to Member States."
"I may have slightly changed my view because Greece is playing a very valuable role in leading and in coordinating regional cooperation."
"Yet I think we need to reconsider whether this is the most effective way for an agency that has several different bases to operate."
"The agency is doing a good and essential job."
"It will be important over time to rationalise and if possible to expand our assistance to the Balkans."
"This assistance must evolve from reconstruction to development, just as it evolved from emergency aid to reconstruction."
"The network of agencies that are perhaps in danger of tripping over themselves in south-east Europe is a challenge we have to resolve."
"It is a very complex scene - a kind of alphabet soup."
"It is very difficult, even for someone in my position, to understand who does what and I am not sure what the impact is on the local citizens."
"Mrs Stenzel makes several valuable points, among which is the need for agreements with other donors on 'sharing' out who is responsible for what sector to avoid overlaps."
"She particularly mentions that the agency should take the lead on energy in Kosovo, with which I would agree."
"She also emphasises the need for a strategy on the future of the agency's relations with EU delegations."
"I wonder from my experience in Skopje whether we have not gone too far in bypassing the competence of the local Commission delegation."
"I felt there was a danger of the agency taking a slightly imperialist tone towards the local delegation."
"In view of the upcoming elections on 15 September, I am still not sure that we have reconstructed enough houses there."
"Mr President, Mr Stenzel's excellent report, on which we are essentially all in agreement, attempts to present in a positive light a balance sheet which can clearly only be problematic."
"It should come as no surprise that there are differences of opinion regarding a European agency which manages financial aid for south-east Europe, and so the calls for promotion of adequate investigation of any suspicion of mismanagement and/or corruption, in particular those related to investments in the energy sector, are understandable."
"Hence the need to improve transparency in the financial transfers and practices of all areas of the organisation's activity."
"It is no coincidence either that a call has been made for an internal auditor to be appointed and that the importance of the European Court of Auditors, of a financial auditor and, lastly, of the role of the European Anti-Fraud Office has been stressed."
"All this points to the fact that things are going rather as we had feared but that that was rather to be expected: we cannot work miracles in the region, it is almost impossible for good governance at all times, on all occasions, to be guaranteed, but we must, of course, make every endeavour to reduce the possibilities of illegally providing or receiving funds."
"As you can see, there is no international cooperation strategy, and this is quite a serious matter."
"Our organisation has not contributed a strategy either, but it is difficult to establish a strategy when we do not know where our borders will lie in the short- or long-term future."
"All this must be borne in mind."
"On the other hand, however, the competence of the European Agency for Reconstruction has been extended geographically, and I wonder whether this is the right way to proceed, given that the problems presented by each individual situation differ quite widely."
"The Commission had promised Parliament that it would produce a report, although this is not yet available."
"This too is confirmation of the difficulties and is a further indication of the problems encountered by the reconstruction bodies in the Balkans."
"It was, of course, an easier matter to provide initial aid, but things become more complex when it is a question of defining reconstruction and deciding where and how to strengthen the institutions."
"The figures on the aid managed by the agency would appear, however, to be more or less in order as regards the relationship between projects, financing, payment times and results, and this is good news."
"The reconstruction of the Balkans is too delicate and sensitive a matter to be neglected even temporarily, and so I feel that we should devote more attention to it."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Mrs Stenzel on behalf of the Commission for her report on the European Agency for Reconstruction."
"It is a thorough and thought-provoking report which raises important questions."
"My colleague, Mr Patten, discussed it with some of you at the meeting in Strasbourg on 2 July and circulated an information note in June which I hope covered many of the concerns of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"Mr Patten has promised to present a report outlining the future implementation of assistance before the end of 2003."
"This will form the basis of the recommendations which the Commission is required to submit by 30 June 2004 under the European Agency for Reconstruction regulation."
"Today I will outline some preliminary thoughts, but first allow me a few comments on some specific points in the report."
"I am pleased that the report so clearly acknowledges the efficiency and high delivery capacity of the European Agency for Reconstruction."
"The agency is indeed a success story."
"It is doing an extraordinary job in channelling Community assistance to the former Republic of Yugoslavia and former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"In this context, I would also like to highlight the success of the deconcentration to Commission delegations."
"This has, for example, been a major factor in the successful implementation of the European Community assistance in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"The Commission endorses many of the observations in the report."
"We strongly agree, for example, with Parliament's suggestion that we need to focus increasingly on institution and capacity building."
"That is certainly our approach."
"A large percentage of the overall assistance is allocated to institution building and it is increasing all the time."
"The country strategy papers and the multiannual indicative programmes allow for some flexibility and do not need to be revised for these transitions."
"Mr Swoboda mentioned the issue of illegal immigration and the Balkan routes and we have made it very clear that we need a regional approach to fight illegal immigration and organised crime in south-east Europe."
"Under the Swedish presidency we organised the first meeting of the five countries in the region, because without regional cooperation we will not succeed."
"Some Member States have developed a liaison officers' network and we have been cooperating with border guards and police forces in the region and that has definitely improved the situation although it is still far from resolved."
"The shift I have mentioned above applies to the countries with deconcentrated delegations, as well as those where the agency is operating."
"There is no reason to think that the agency will handle institution-building programmes any less successfully than it has physical reconstruction."
"The legal base for the agency is perfectly adequate and does not need to be amended."
"Nor do we want to change its successful brand name, even if the focus is no longer principally reconstruction."
"The report suggests that if the territorial competence of the agency were to be extended its regulations should be modified."
"The decision to extend the agency's mandate to the whole of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia and to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was taken because of exceptional circumstances."
"We do not see a need to extend the agency's territorial competence further."
"In the report you emphasise the need for coordination."
"We share this view."
"It is an absolute necessity to ensure that our assistance brings the highest added value possible."
"We are therefore pleased to note the systematic and extensive coordination already taking place between Commission services and between actors on the ground."
"From previous debates, I know that you want to discuss the broader issue of the future of assistance to the western Balkans and its organisational aspects, including the competences of the European Community delegations and the agency."
"Our preliminary thoughts are as follows."
"There is no reason to assume that the coexistence of the agency and the Commission delegation in the same country leads to an overlap."
"The political role and the status of all delegations in the region are identical, beyond assistance implementation."
"They are focused on developing the political and institutional relationship with the European Union."
"As each country moves further into the stabilisation and association process, we will have to evaluate whether support for the process of bringing the countries up to European standards needs to be completely integrated with the political work of the delegations."
"This question will be at the heart of the decision on the future of the agency."
"But we cannot give a clear answer at this point."
"Above all, we do not believe it will be to the region's benefit to dismantle recently established arrangements which are working well."
"Administrative and institutional tidiness must not impede our primary objective of achieving real change on the ground."
"However, we clearly need to keep our options open and be ready to change how we deliver aid, when there are clear benefits in doing so."
"The Commission will ensure that these decisions are taken on the basis of what is most effective in achieving the four objectives: more focus on quality, speedier implementation according to the highest standards of management, visibility, and above all the impact of our programmes on the ground."
"Parliament's views will be invaluable in developing the arrangements that best suit the needs of the region and the strategic ambition for its closer integration into the European Union."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0241/2002) by Mr Coelho, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the third Commission report on citizenship of the Union (COM (2001) 506 - C5-0656/2001 - 2001/2279(COS))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are now discussing European citizenship on the basis of the report which I had the honour of drafting and which was given almost unanimous approval in our Parliament's Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"I must begin by emphasising what is essential and what we do not want."
"What is essential is to promote awareness of a common heritage, based on a range of fundamental common traditions and values and, at the same time, of the recognition of a number of rights."
"What we do not want is a concept of European citizenship that is seen as the artificial creation of a supranational identity that seeks to replace feelings of nationality."
"Indeed, as we understand it, European citizenship is something to be superimposed and added to national citizenship, complementing and broadening it."
"There is no way of acquiring this other than having nationality one of the Member States."
"Although our Community has taken an essentially economic route, it is now much more than an economic community."
"It is home to more than 375 million people, who are not only consumers in a vast single market, but are also citizens of the European Union, who have the right to move freely within it, to settle in any part of its territory, for personal or professional reasons, and who hope to be able to live without fear of persecution, discrimination or violence, which accentuates the need to step up cooperation between police forces, customs services and judicial systems."
"Recognition of this European citizenship has been a slow process, however, which faces too many obstacles, even today."
"There are eight areas in which I am submitting proposals for the full application of the concept of European citizenship in its political, administrative, judicial, social and economic dimensions."
"First: it is crucial that we implement a strategy of promoting European citizenship, at both the institutional and legislative levels, and in terms of education and information."
"Second: the lack of information."
"European citizens must be better informed of their rights and the scope of these rights, with regard in particular to the right to petition the European Parliament and to complain to the Ombudsman."
"It is deplorable that most of the petitions to the European Parliament and the complaints sent to the Ombudsman are deemed unacceptable, which confirms the lack of knowledge of the petitioners about the competences of the Union."
"It is crucial to improve, through all available means, the European Union's information and communication policy, which must be targeted and appropriate to the population for whom it is designed."
"The Union's document base must be made accessible to the public in all the official languages and free of charge and the development of interactive portals must be promoted."
"Third: the steady decline in the rate of participation of the Union's citizens in European elections, which undermines the legitimacy of our Parliament."
"We must adopt the measures needed to further raise voter awareness of the importance of these elections. With regard to setting a date for the next European elections, this must not coincide with national traditions or statutory holidays, so as to optimise the chances of voter participation."
"It does not make sense, for example, that in Portugal the day of the Europeans elections frequently coincides with a national holiday, thereby seriously damaging the electoral participation of the citizens of my country."
"Fourth: diplomatic and consular protection."
"It is important that those Member States that have not yet done so incorporate into their legal systems the measures needed to ensure diplomatic and consular protection for EU citizens whose state of origin has no representation."
"Fifth: protection of the citizens."
"The Member States must adopt all the measures needed to ensure that fundamental rights are respected, the protection of the citizens against terrorism and organised crime, support and compensation for victims, and to ensure the effective and equitable access of European citizens to justice."
"Particular emphasis is given to the implementation of the directives on combating discrimination, to the fight against racism and xenophobia and to equality between men and women."
"Sixth: the continued existence of obstacles to the exercise of freedom of movement and residence by European citizens."
"In order to overcome these obstacles, Member States must adopt without delay the proposal for a directive of 23 May 2001, which, by revising the existing texts, introduces essential simplifications and in particular establishes the right of permanent residence after four years of uninterrupted residence."
"Furthermore, the Member States must remedy the many legislative discrepancies which continue to exist and which represent an obstacle to the full expression of European citizenship in the areas of the status of individuals, justice and conditions of movement and residence for migrant workers."
"Seventh: barriers to the free movement of students and teachers."
"With regard to barriers that still remain, the action plan for mobility must be adopted as a matter of urgency, so as to facilitate and enhance the mobility of students, volunteers, teachers and trainers."
"Furthermore, the Member States and the competent authorities must use educational programmes to encourage a better knowledge of Europe, particularly in the form of history and language teaching."
"Finally, I should like to ask the Convention on the Future of the European Union to agree on the binding legal status to be given to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, to communitarise the third pillar, and to endeavour to ensure that texts in which EU policies are laid down are more accessible to the general public as a whole."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Coelho, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities regrets the fact that the Commission did not include the dimension of equal opportunities in its Third Report on Citizenship of the Union and fails in particular to develop gender-sensitive and gender-specific guidelines and indicators and use sex-specific data at all levels."
"On the other hand, the Committee welcomes some of the actions that have been adopted but which must be implemented."
"First, the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Based on the principles of human dignity and equality of women and men, the Charter will serve as a framework defending the fundamental rights of women and men in the Union."
"Also the Daphne Programme, created to defend the citizens' rights of children, adolescents and women, must be further developed as an instrument to strengthen European citizenship."
"The action plan for mobility and the Commission proposal to adopt a directive combining the various legislative instruments on the freedom of movement and residence of the citizens of the Union in a single text is of particular importance to women and the problems they face in the framework of European integration."
"We therefore ask the Commission, in its next report, to provide an adequate analysis based on comparable statistics, which enables a gender impact assessment to be made in areas linked to the electoral process, such as the percentage of women voters, of women who stand as candidates and, of course, of women who are elected."
"Lastly, let us remember that strengthening citizenship of the Union will only be achieved through total equality between men and women in all sectors of economic and political life."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, it is never out of place or superfluous to mention European citizenship, not least because we very frequently expect the citizens to be Europeans and then fail to treat them as such."
"Indeed, the citizens are starting to feel European, and this is happening as they begin to enter into dialogue with the European institutions."
"However, there is more to citizenship than that: in a way, it confirms the citizens' place in this European dimension, which they must feel both contributors to and responsible for at this time of great impetus and dynamism."
"We feel that the level of participation in the European elections is low and declining steadily, but we wonder what we are offering the citizens of the Member States as part of this European package."
"We are not offering them the mutual right to study in different Member States, we are not providing facilities to resolve language difficulties, we are not providing a labour code, we are not - as Mr Coelho, who has produced an excellent report, pointed out - providing free movement, we are not recognising qualifications and, therefore, we are not recognising a right to work, and we are not recognising the right to health."
"I am saying this on behalf of the citizens, for I receive the petitions sent by the citizens to the European Parliament's Committee on Petitions, in which they describe these major areas of intolerance within the Member States of the Union."
"I would next like to point out a major contradiction: we have achieved Schengen, which is a milestone which could benefit the whole world, particularly the countries which are still troubled by wars over territory and border conflicts, but we are preserving the right for the Member States to expel European Union citizens from one Member State to another."
"How is it conceivable that the right of expulsion still exists when it runs counter to Schengen?"
"We can expel citizens outside the Schengen area, not within the same territory."
"Well then, I feel that we should all make every endeavour to start building Europe at the level of the citizens, starting precisely with the recognition of status which the Charter of Fundamental Rights placed at the centre of the European project and which must be reproduced in the Treaties."
"If we do not succeed in doing this, however many conventions we produce we will never manage to build Europe, especially when one country - I am referring to Ireland but there may be many others, including my own - has refused to recognise, to sign and to ratify the Nice Treaty and when three Member States have refused to share our experience with the single currency."
"The road is long: we must all strive to place the citizens at the centre of the Europe we are building."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for me, citizenship of the EU is something like a building block towards enhanced integration, but also of course towards our citizens having a greater sense of their European identity."
"Looking at the basis for it, though, we find just six paragraphs referring to citizenship of the EU, and, on reading these, we find relatively few rights attached to it, which range from participation in local elections or in those for this Parliament to diplomatic representation or the right of petition."
"That, though, can be nothing more than a beginning if we really want to create EU citizenship."
"The task we have to set ourselves in future is a political one, that of making EU citizenship, as it now is, meaningful and breathing life into it."
"We are also called on to give thought to how we can actually extend the rights enjoyed by EU citizens."
"This report turns the spotlight on our present deficits and also makes very definite proposals where changes are necessary."
"I very warmly congratulate the rapporteur on the attitude he has taken to this refined analysis and on the very constructive proposals he has made."
"There is a need for measures to demolish, and quickly, the barriers which exist at present and still hamper the freedom of movement and of residence of people who are called EU citizens, which do not guarantee all EU citizens access to the law and to justice to the extent that they desire, and which, above all, hamper the mobility of students in schools and higher education, of apprentices, and also of teachers and the workforce."
"What use to us is the best Leonardo programme for the training of professionals, if such things as social benefits are not recognised or if there are yet other barriers standing in the way of real mobility, or if qualifications from university or vocational training in other states are not accorded the recognition that has long been overdue?"
"We have to think about informing people about what their rights as citizens of the EU actually are and about how they can best make use of them."
"We have to call for the necessary work to be done in schools and in information offices - the latter including those run by the Commission and by Parliament."
"Much, then, lies ahead of us."
"We still have to do intensive work in order that those endowed with citizenship of the EU can feel that they really are its citizens."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his work."
"This is a clear and balanced report, which explains the existing shortcomings, recognises the progress that has been made and indicates the direction that must be taken to remedy these shortcomings, in the aim of constructing a real and effective European citizenship."
"The concept of European citizenship has been one of the main legacies of the Maastricht Treaty and has contributed to increasingly engage the citizens of the Member States with the common project of European integration."
"Now that more than a decade has passed, the balance sheet is clearly positive."
"Freedom of movement, the right to vote and to stand in local and European elections, the right of petition and the right to diplomatic and consular protection are today already irreversible steps forward with practical effects from which Europe's citizens derive real benefit."
"Nevertheless, the development of a genuine European citizenship requires more, both with regard to those rights already enshrined in the Treaties, but whose full implementation today still faces too many obstacles, and with regard to the integration of the future institutional model of the Union, which is undoubtedly the great challenge currently facing our community of peoples and countries."
"Furthermore, full European citizenship cannot ignore the social and economic rights of our fellow citizens, at the risk of the citizens seeing the European project as a step backwards from the social contract expressed through national constitutions."
"In relation to the freedom of movement and residence of Community citizens, I should like, Mr President, to congratulate the Commission on the reform that has been introduced in this field, formalised in the Directive of 23 May 2001."
"In the aim of guaranteeing the citizens of the European Union conditions of movement and residence similar to those of Member State citizens in their own country, this Commission initiative has made the conditions of movement and residence more flexible, has simplified the legislation in force in this field and has established an innovative rule according to which after four years, residence in European Union territory can be extended with no formalities required."
"The European Union cannot distance itself from the situation of those who, although not Member State nationals, have their lives established on European territory, thereby making a major contribution to the cultural, social and economic wealth of the Union."
"It is, therefore, with considerable satisfaction that we welcome the Commission proposal for a directive of 5 July 2001, on the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents."
"We urge the Council rapidly to adopt this proposal and thereby end the existing discrimination and to ensure that these persons can, in the field of employment, education and social security, enjoy rights close to those held by citizens of the Union."
"In the field of the right to vote and to stand for election, the report rigorously describes the present framework, which is characterised fundamentally by the poor participation of Community citizens in European and local elections in their States of residence."
"The lack of information and the short periods laid down by States Members in which citizens can be placed on electoral registers undoubtedly contribute to explaining this relative lack of success."
"Nevertheless, this phenomenon should be seen in the context of the more global trend of a steady decline in voter participation which, as far as we are concerned, could be effectively countered by clarifying the European Union's institutional framework and by drafting a genuine constitutional text which enables the citizens to identify as closely as possible with the decision-making process at European level."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mr Coelho on a very strong report, which is concrete and specific."
"He makes it clear that European citizenship not only supplements and complements national citizenship but also that the concept should adapt to include the rights of long-term resident foreign nationals."
"I would just take issue with him on one point."
"In 2004, elections to the Greater London Authority are due to take place one month before the European elections."
"I hope agreement will be reached to postpone them for one month so that they take place on the same day, which will help raise turnout and make a legitimate connection, in the sense of a Europe of the regions."
"Mr Coelho adopts a fully justified tone of impatience."
"The rights of people must not continue to lag behind the rights of goods."
"In several areas I fully support him: openness, transparency, freedom of information."
"In the EU we are still depressingly opaque and inaccessible."
"Information documents must become more available."
"Secondly, of course our citizens want protection against crime and terrorism, but there is a very poor level of democratic scrutiny in the area of police and judicial cooperation."
"We must improve this situation."
"Also, measures to combat crime and terrorism must have due regard to respect for human rights, including the right to a fair trial."
"The rapporteur stresses elimination of discrimination, on which I fully support him, but I would also add that respect for cultural traditions must not be at the expense of fundamental human rights."
"Lastly, life is too much of a hassle for people when they try to exercise their European rights, whether it be residence permits, family reunions, social security or access to justice."
"I have a constituent - and I have brought this to the attention of the Commissioner - against whom proceedings were brought in the civil courts in the UK and whose case was thrown out by the English High Court."
"Proceedings were then brought against her on the basis of exactly the same facts by the criminal courts in Spain and she suffered years of worry and expense, until the case was finally thrown out just a month or so ago."
"Why is there not mutual recognition of the same facts between a civil and a criminal case?"
"My conclusion is that we need to reinforce our monitoring of the implementation of citizenship and human rights standards."
"We must take the opportunity of transforming a process which is currently being applied to the candidate countries into a genuine European Union peer review process, so that the standards of citizenship and human rights applied in each of our Member States is the concern of all of us on a cross-national basis."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure for me to speak this evening on a theme that is close to my heart: that of European citizenship."
"As stated in the Treaty, European citizenship supplements national citizenship, but is not a substitute for it."
"European citizenship should also be an added extra for everyone living in the European Union."
"In December 2000, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights finally placed the citizen at the heart of European integration, eight years after the Treaty of Maastricht."
"It was high time indeed because, at European level as well as at national and local level, it is unthinkable to conduct politics in any way other than by placing citizens at the heart of all considerations, all social measures and all social projects."
"Despite being in a good position to know that, in practice, things work slightly differently, this must not prevent us from fighting to change things, quite the opposite."
"The rapporteur listed the areas that are meant to feature in European citizenship."
"There is therefore no need for me to repeat them."
"I am, however, deeply mindful of a whole series of social rights which were quoted by other speakers."
"The report gives an assessment of how these rights are being implemented."
"This assessment is not overly enthusiastic because, although it reports on progress made, it also highlights the fact that a great deal is still to be done in various areas."
"We mentioned voting at the European elections, in which less than 50% of voters took part."
"We must, therefore, put in place measures that will encourage citizens to take part in these elections and, above all, we must give renewed consideration to the link between the elected representatives and the electorate."
"We must, once again, inspire citizens with the desire to vote and the desire to become involved in community life."
"The citizen must be an actor and not just an observer."
"The recent elections in the various EU Member States also reinforce this belief."
"What can we also say about mobility for education purposes?"
"I have been telling the authorities for years about the lack of recognition of qualifications."
"European citizens are calling for swift action to be taken in this area."
"What can we say about the mobility of researchers?"
"I have been appointed rapporteur on the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Development and I know that this is a real obstacle course."
"I would like to end, Mr President, by thanking the rapporteur for his thoughts and with the hope that, if we all pull together, we will be able to take steps to strengthen our approach and to go further in placing the citizen at the heart of our European project."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I could not begin without paying tribute to the magnificent work done by Carlos Coelho and thanking him once again for the openness and the willingness with which he accepted two proposals from our group in the specialist Committee, enabling them to be adopted in compromise versions which were agreed on."
"Mr Coelho's report is the necessary and appropriate complement to the third Commission report, giving it a crucial political meaning that is well expressed in the motion for a resolution, on which we shall be voting tomorrow."
"The report and the motion for a resolution address the matter adequately, dividing it into various strands with regard to the political, administrative, and judicial dimension, and lastly, into the strand of promoting European citizenship, which contains proposals for various practical actions."
"I do not wish to add anything to this, either in terms of the report's analysis, or of the motion."
"We do have something to add, however, to the discussion, particularly when the Convention is up and running and the future of Europe and institutional reform are being so widely debated."
"It is true that we must work on promoting European citizenship and full understanding of this by our compatriots, our fellow citizens."
"The fact, however, that, ten years after Maastricht, with so many direct elections to the European Parliament having already been held and so many actions having been undertaken to promote and disseminate the European framework, on which enormous quantities of money are spent every year, after all this, the State of European citizenship is as portrayed by the Commission report and justifies some of the rapporteur's complaints, forces us to keep our feet on the ground and to build the future with our eyes on the horizon - not as far into the horizon as the visionaries would like, but as far as the reality of the situation requires."
"The real state of European citizenship - as demonstrated, for example, in the symptomatic low levels of electoral participation - shows, as the motion for a resolution points out and emphasises in line with the Treaty, that 'European citizenship shall not replace national citizenship, but complements and expands it'."
"In other words, and we must always bear this in mind, European citizenship is, for the overwhelming majority of our fellow citizens, a complementary citizenship, because it is the central place spontaneously occupied by the most intense sense of belonging and of identity with national citizenship."
"The reasons for this inescapable fact are many and profound."
"And so the future of Europe will only be achieved properly if this factor is borne in mind."
"Provided that we do this, we shall be constructing something - with the solidarity of the nations and the genuine democracy of the citizens."
"We shall be constructing something with a future, because it will have roots."
"When we distance ourselves from this goal, however, because we want to continue sleeping easy, we shall be opening the way to nightmares and to creating points of conflict, tension and disillusionment that will undermine the European project."
"Because we shall be giving in, ultimately, to the pressures of a new type of collectivism - multinational collectivism - and thereby distancing ourselves from democracy, affronting genuine citizenship and replacing that Europe of all citizens, of which we all dream, with bureaucratic jiggery-pokery."
"European integration can be achieved by respecting the feelings of the citizens, and will be more secure as a result."
"It must never be done by overriding these feelings and must be done preferably together with the citizens."
"The Convention must also not forget this."
"Mr President, Commissioner, despite the major steps taken in recent years to achieve genuine European citizenship, a great deal still needs to be done to guarantee equal, fundamental rights to all the citizens."
"That is the essence of the report before us, an excellent, high-quality, comprehensive report - and I would like to congratulate Mr Coelho - which is, at the same time, a kind of stock-take and revitalisation of the major project seeking to guarantee all the citizens equal opportunities, free movement, residence throughout the Community territory and free access to employment, justice and all rights, making innovative developments benefiting the citizens of third countries too."
"These basic principles are complemented by the undertaking to provide all the citizens with a real job, a real house, adequate healthcare and prospects of social and other growth in addition to economic growth."
"Moreover, the recognition of fundamental rights must go hand in hand with the consolidation of measures to combat xenophobia, religious discrimination and discrimination on grounds of sex, race or social condition."
"A particularly interesting section is that exploring transnational methodologies for achieving practical police and judicial cooperation."
"As regards these areas of cooperation, innovative proposals are also included relating to the involvement of the different groups of long-term legal immigrants."
"Particularly topical - as many Members have pointed out - is the concern expressed in a section of the report at the low level of interest hitherto displayed by the European citizens in respect of the European Parliament elections."
"If we encourage the development of genuine citizenship, this should be the decisive factor which will also lead to greater political awareness among the people at the time of European elections and to the many other forms of direct participation which are becoming increasingly available to all the European citizens."
"It is important to make the citizens aware that European citizenship - a term which is often bandied about in this Chamber - does not replace national citizenship, which remains undiminished, retaining all its associations of cultural, historical and social roots which connect different races of peoples which, however, are united in a common destiny, the destiny of the European Union."
"We cannot, therefore, accept the amendments tabled by the GUE/NGL Group, which impose a certainly excessive and dangerous acceleration on the process of integration of citizens from all the third countries, who are resident in Community territory without distinction."
"This is certainly a desirable development which should be contemplated in the future - that active and passive voting rights and long-term residence permits should be granted to third-country citizens - but the time is not yet ripe for it to be fully implemented, at least for it to be implemented across the board and to include all nationalities."
"A number of disparities are still present and, not least, where some third countries are concerned, there is no desire for reciprocity of this kind."
"In any case, it is important that we succeed in establishing a fundamental concept: these issues fall strictly within the sphere of Community competence."
"Just recently, we read in the press that some Member States appear to be claiming regulation in this field as part of their own national competence."
"This would be a serious mistake: there cannot be any disparity in the ways major issues such as asylum, integration, the recognition of civil rights - including the right to vote, most importantly - and the right to citizenship are treated within the Union."
"Mr President, I think the last speaker, Mr Santini, made an error which a lot of people make, confusing nationality and citizenship."
"Even the notion of citizenship is distinct from being a citizen."
"It is my view that citizenship derives in the first instance from a sense of responsibility which comes from within a moral framework - I am not talking specifically about a religious framework, but a moral framework of how one sees the world and one's place in the world."
"I regard myself as a citizen of the world."
"I do not have a piece of paper which tells me so, but there are various conventions and laws and international rights which exist and which protect me as a citizen of the world."
"It seems to me that there is a lot of work to be done in terms of developing the notion of European citizenship and it is a mistake to reduce it to the notion of political citizenship, although that is an important aspect of it."
"Turnout in elections is important, but people's identity as citizens is not confined to their political identity."
"In fact many people, as we can see from the low turnouts, no longer define themselves in political terms and therefore disengage from the political process."
"Many are far more interested in their identity as, for instance, fans of a football club or a particular pop star."
"There are a lot of good ideas in this report."
"One of the most interesting is the simple idea of a national holiday on Europe Day."
"This would create a connection between Europe and the people of Europe."
"It would bring home very strongly the idea that there is a benefit to being a European and being part of the European process."
"As an exercise, I logged onto one of the more popular websites a few minutes before I came down here and I found 1.8 million references to citizenship."
"At the top of the list were the United States, Canada and then the UK."
"On the first thirty pages, I was not able to find a single site for the European Union."
"It seems to me that is a mistake."
"One of the things that the sites constantly emphasise is education - the education of young people."
"I would ask people to bear in mind that citizenship is not defined by the passport you hold."
"Mr President, how can we speak about citizenship in the European Union without mentioning the plight of tens of thousands of men and women who have even been refused the right to simply have papers, papers that would permit them to stay in the Union without being pursued by the police and exploited by unscrupulous employers?"
"Many men and women have become paperless due to administrative acts, even when they have made a life for themselves in one of the countries of the European Union, often for more than five years, and they have worked there and often been much more useful to the community than a good many rich parasites."
"In the name of the Members from Lutte ouvrière, I am anxious to affirm my solidarity with those lacking papers who are, in particular in France currently, protesting en masse for the regularisation of their situation."
"The status of all persons without papers must be immediately regularised in order to allow these people to live with dignity, and every political, legal and civil right that the citizens of the European Union enjoy must be accorded to every immigrant worker of the European Union, whatever their country of origin."
"Mr President, I find that this report on European citizenship is somewhat schizophrenic."
"On the one hand, it is concerned about the steadily declining turnout for European elections, which reflects the citizens' lack of interest and may, if it continues, and I quote, 'delegitimise the elections to the European Parliament'."
"It also states, similarly, that a European citizenship cannot be created solely from above and that a minimum level of citizen participation is required."
"All this is perfectly true."
"On the other hand, however, if we look for the cause of this lack of interest, we find them in the proposals of the Coelho report itself."
"For example, the Opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs annexed to the report asks yet again for transnational lists for European elections to be established, which would be the best way to increase the citizens' sense of distance from the Union."
"The report itself contains the traditional request to make the Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding, which would have the distinctive feature of removing the definition of a good number of citizens' rights from national democracies."
"In relation to this, I would point out that the Charter neatly sidesteps national citizenships and does not even mention the fundamental right of citizens to express themselves democratically within their own nation."
"The Coelho report also calls, in paragraph 3, for immigrants from third countries to be granted rights which are as near as possible to those enjoyed by EU citizens."
"In other words, European citizenship would be granted in practice, if not in principle, to immigrants who are not nationals of a Member State."
"Could this manner of proposal make our citizens love Europe?"
"I do not need a public answer from you now, ladies and gentlemen, but I would ask you to think it over."
"To briefly summarise, all these proposals and a good many others that I could refer to tend to reduce or limit the rights of nations."
"Even now, however, the institutions of the Union do not seem to understand the basic fact that citizens are deeply attached to their nations and by attacking or by downgrading their nations they are hurting citizens and turning them away from Europe."
"In this way, even if our citizens are convinced, as we are, of the importance and need for European cooperation, it is the Union's own attitude that turns them off Europe."
"The Union must have a radical change of attitude if it wants to regain contact with its citizens."
"The Convention that is meeting to prepare the IGC 2004 will afford us the opportunity in the months to come."
"The proposals that result from it must give out a clear signal that Europe must be built on its nations and that it will respect their laws."
"In particular, it must be clear, not only that the European citizenship does not replace national citizenships, but also that it remains subordinate to them."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Friedrich, citizenship must be seen as a contract between the state and the individual, in which the parties recognise mutual rights and obligations."
"EU citizenship is a logical extension of the various long established de facto rights and obligations of various kinds between the EU and Member State citizens."
"A natural step towards EU citizenship would, of course, be a binding charter clearly stating and clarifying the fundamental rights and obligations."
"The charter should be seen as an important part of the principles of EU citizenship and would be at the very heart of citizenship."
"The need for EU citizenship has become fully obvious in the light of the necessary restrictions on individual rights that followed the 11 September catastrophe."
"The need for a developed EU citizenship thus becomes clear, a citizenship that provides a better definition of the basic contract between the individual and the EU and balances rights and restrictions in the same political decision-making system."
"With every day that passes it becomes increasingly difficult to understand why some social democratic governments oppose merging the Communities and the Union, yet this is absolutely necessary in order to clarify the fundamental obligations and rights."
"Without that simplification, any EU citizenship will be difficult to grasp and more or less impossible to communicate to EU citizens."
"It should be remembered that the outcome of ongoing national elections could have both a positive and a negative impact on citizens' rights."
"EU citizenship could provide an important tool for explaining to European citizens what EU membership means."
"However, this requires a clearer, simpler Treaty."
"As the European Parliament representative on the Interinstitutional Committee on Access to Documents, I have reached an agreement with the Council representative, Mr Haarder, on information focusing directly on the citizen."
"The idea is to show citizens how and where they can obtain the information that will enable them to take part in European democracy, by giving a simple summary of citizens' rights in European daily newspapers."
"The funds for this are there but it is taking far too long to mobilise the political will."
"This could be a simple way of creating an understanding of citizenship."
"Consequently, it would be unacceptable if this proposal were delayed just now when it is so important for European democracy."
"The Commission, which is responsible for organising the next interinstitutional meeting, should therefore promptly - very promptly - organise such a meeting to ensure that Europe's democratic progress is not delayed."
"Finally, I should like to thank Mr Coelho for his very constructive contribution to the democratic development of Europe, in which EU citizenship plays such a central role."
"Ever since the Edinburgh summit in 1992, the architects of the EU have been cultivating the view that European citizenship is not a substitute for national citizenship, but, on the contrary, that it supplements and broadens national citizenship by creating 'EU rights'."
"That is a distortion of the truth."
"In the same breath as citizens' rights are defined as 'European rights', taking precedence over rights based on national legislation, in precisely the same breath, national citizenship is undermined."
"European citizenship is purely and simply integration through the back door."
"This political pickpocketing is at once antidemocratic and repressive."
"What is being proposed is the absorption of vital parts of countries' legal systems, including criminal law and the police, into European citizenship."
"The belief seems to be that these genuine values - democracy and the rule of law - can be acquired for the DKK 2 000 million which the Commission has just allocated to strengthen the legitimacy of the European institutions."
"'There is something rotten' - not in Denmark, but in the European Union."
"It is obvious that third-country nationals should have the same rights as Member States' nationals, but we do not need this measure to make the fact clear."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have the opportunity today to discuss the issue of citizenship of the Union with you, precisely at a time when we are celebrating the tenth anniversary of its creation."
"I believe that the objectives, which in 1992 ensured that European citizenship was included in the Treaty of the Union, have not lost any of their relevance."
"Citizenship of the Union is, of course, a source of legitimacy for the process of European integration and strives to increase the participation of the citizens in the construction of a Community-centred Europe."
"Furthermore, citizenship is a crucial factor in the establishment, amongst the citizens, of the concept of belonging to the European Union and of having a genuine common European identity."
"This identity is constructed, however, on respect for diversity, because national diversity is an integral part of the specific European identity."
"Therefore, it neither replaces nor conflicts with national identity, but rather complements it."
"I shall take this opportunity to express my thanks for the report that has been presented today on the Third Commission Report on Citizenship of the Union and I should like, in particular, to congratulate the rapporteur, Carlos Coelho, not only on the quality of his report, but also on the way in which he structured the issue and on the clarity of the political objectives that he has attached to it."
"I fully agree that the concept of European citizenship must be implemented in all its dimensions, be they political, administrative, judicial, social or economic."
"We have reached a position in which citizens' rights are, in the Member States of the Union, broadly respected, but in which there are still some legal discrepancies and practical obstacles to the full expression of European citizenship."
"We must further strive to resolve these discrepancies and obstacles, which prevent the citizens from enjoying their rights as European citizens."
"One of the aspects highlighted in the report is the lack of information, one result of which is the low level of awareness of European citizenship."
"What is required is for European Union policy in the field of information and communication to be strengthened by all available means."
"This observation made by the rapporteur is shared by the Commission, whose report repeatedly highlights the need to better inform the citizens on the rights to which they are entitled."
"I believe it is common knowledge that the Commission adopted, last July, a new approach to information and communication policy and I believe that this approach is necessary to counter the lack of knowledge and the apathy of European citizens about the debate on Europe's future."
"Nevertheless, the European institutions clearly cannot, on their own, communicate with the 370 million people who make up the Union, or, if you wish, with the around 500 million following enlargement."
"The Member States must share responsibility for the provision of information, for dialogue with the citizens and for their recognition because European integration concerns them above all."
"And, as I understand it, there are now signs that the Member States have the political will to work together, thereby proving that there is no incompatibility between the feeling of national belonging and the feeling of participation in the European project."
"It could, therefore, be considered that the 'Europe Direct' service, created by the Commission, is a success."
"Since 1998 this service has provided information on a whole range of matters concerning the European Union, thereby contributing to people knowing their rights and opportunities as citizens of the Union and knowing how to take advantage of them."
"Small steps are often, in practice, the most important ones."
"Such as, for example, the creation of the universal green number for 'Europe Direct', which enables citizens anywhere in the fifteen Member States to access an operator who speaks their national language and who can answer any question they wish to ask about the European Union."
"With regard to information, I should further like to add that the Commission will shortly be studying how to raise citizens' awareness of citizenship of the Union and of connected rights through a specific Eurobarometer survey."
"The survey will be launched with the title 'Ten Years of European Citizenship' and the results will be used as the basis for future information and communication measures in the field of citizenship."
"The Commission wanted to include a framework for the structure of fundamental rights in its third report, specifically the proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in December 2000."
"This caused - I admit - some delay in meeting the initial deadline for submitting the third report, but I think that the importance of the Charter fully justified this."
"Carlos Coelho's report states that the Charter places European citizenship at the heart of the Union's activities."
"I fully agree."
"I also agree with the report's call for the Convention on the future of Europe to define the binding legal status that the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be given."
"I believe that the most important debate to take place in the Convention, capable of producing real results to bring the citizens and the European institutions closer together, is not so much the debate on the institutions, but will perhaps be the debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, on its inclusion in the Treaties and on its legally binding nature."
"The citizens might remain distant when institutional questions are discussed, such as power-sharing between the bodies of the Union and legislative procedures, but are decidedly interested when it comes to knowing what rights they have and how the Union can meet their expectations."
"I also hope that the Council is able to approve the Commission proposal on reorganising the right to freedom of movement."
"This is the correct test to show that a freedom that is at the very heart of European citizenship has the same status of effectiveness and of political dignity as the freedom of movement of goods, capital or services."
"I note, ladies and gentlemen, the suggestion that the Members of the future Convention should decide on the statute of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Given that I am one of the representatives of the Commission in the Convention, together with my colleague Michel Barnier, I shall not fail to express my support for the Charter having the strong statute that you wish to see."
"The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0255/2002) by Mrs Korhola, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive providing for public participation in respect of the drawing up of certain plans and programmes relating to the environment and amending with regard to public participation and access to justice Council Directives 85/337/EEC and 96/61/EC (5475/2/2002 - C5-0227/2002 - 2000/0331(COD))."
"Mr President, this directive is a second pillar in the legislative process, designed to amend EU legislation to take account of the Aarhus Convention."
"The first pillar concerned the transparency of environmental information, and it is currently going through the conciliation procedure."
"We are still awaiting a Commission proposal on the third pillar."
"Concerning both the first and second pillar, it must be said that the Council has shown a very positive attitude, and over several presidential terms I have found that there is genuine commitment and good will on its part."
"With regard to this directive also, the Council has already approved many elements of Parliament's first reading and now Parliament is to adopt many elements of the common position."
"Nevertheless, problems do remain and it would appear that this directive will also only take on its final shape in conciliation."
"In the general approach alone there are already differences."
"The Commission proposal and the Council's common position are based on the 'quick fix' principle, while Parliament has wanted a broader horizontal approach."
"It is nevertheless clear that it is not Parliament's aim to defend its amendments to the letter but rather ensure that there remain no grey areas in EU legislation, where public participation would be justified, but not possible."
"The importance of the report before us cannot be overemphasised."
"Unusually, it directly affects all citizens in the EU Member States and candidate countries."
"The public will now have the invaluable right to participate in decision-making on the environment."
"This is also an important tool for the environment, and one which may improve the quality of decision-making on the environment considerably."
"For these reasons, this is a tool that must be closely guarded."
"It would be in nobody's interest - and least of all in the interests of the environment - if this tool were to be used for defending selfish interests, for politicking by opposition groups or to cause wilful mischief."
"As rapporteur I have been conscious of the fact that the tool now being created may be abused."
"Furthermore, the authorities in Member States must be aware of the risks involved in national implementation."
"Moreover, that alone is not enough."
"The environmental organisations must also know they have an immense responsibility not to allow pettiness to inflate the importance of the rights granted to our citizens and the special status accorded the organisations themselves."
"There is also the problem of Mr and Mrs Nimby or the 'Not in my backyard' syndrome."
"But I myself have tried to avoid this by stressing the importance, insofar as it has been in your rapporteur's power to do so, of arguing the case and the high quality of participation."
"Opposition alone and the self-centred defence of one's own territory cannot be sufficient."
"The tool now being created for this is too important and the resources used for its creation too invaluable."
"For all these reasons I wish to defend the rights of our citizens to participate in decision-making on the environment and I am, moreover, prepared to repel any opportunity to abuse this tool."
"I also want to remind everyone of my solution, which was rejected by Parliament at first reading, which Member States might yet consider when they implement the directive nationally."
"In it I hold that the public as a whole have the right to express an opinion but the right to access to justice only applies to that section of the public affected by a decision taken."
"My solution is unusual in that it would have simultaneously benefited both those citizens who were genuinely keen to participate and the authorities, and the parties responsible for the relevant projects."
"Firstly the work of the authorities would be easier as they would not need to specify beforehand the parties concerned and, at the same time, the likelihood of omission when the parties were being heard would be removed."
"Secondly, the ready cause for complaint of those who want to apply the brakes would go: the party was not heard."
"Above all, however, it would mean the quality of participation would be highlighted and the importance attached to hearing Mr and Mrs Nimby would decline."
"A precondition of the ratification of the Aarhus Convention in the EU is that the working practices and procedures of the EU's institutions should be revised as necessary."
"In addition it is especially important for the Commission to submit a proposal on the third pillar regarding review and access to justice as speedily as possible, as this is surely the most problematic of them all."
"Unfortunately, the Commission has not been able, despite its promises, to put forward a clear timetable and course of action in respect of the measures that need to be taken for ratification."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this report has come back to Parliament for second reading. It has already been the subject of frank and, at times, lively debate between those who call for the citizens to be fully entitled to be involved in certain structural policies at the decision-making stage and those who feel that the political, technical and administrative institutions set up to perform the task of decision-making should have a greater degree of competence and autonomy."
"In its response to first reading, the Council scaled down the rapporteur's proposals somewhat, appearing to consider them to be too advanced and too open to a form of democratic participation that could slow down the process of drawing up texts or which, as the rapporteur herself said just now, could open the door to exaggerated , authoritarian or distorted interpretations."
"In short, the Council intends to confer on the citizens' organisations a consultative role - an important role but not a decision-making role - giving the legislators elected to take decisions on the basis of the input of civil society sole responsibility for doing so but without rendering it impossible for exceptions to be made."
"The rapporteur proposes various forms of legal review where the positions of the citizens and the decisions of the relevant authority do not tally, particularly where the subject involves major issues such as security, the environment and public health."
"As regards the need to ensure that the Member States have the possibility of exemption from the directive in the event of an emergency, there is a specific amendment providing this loophole with due regard for subsidiarity and for specific environmental conditions or crises."
"As far as public participation is concerned, the rapporteur has resurrected a number of amendments already rejected by the Council, clearly hoping that the role of the citizens and their lawfully established organisations in the drawing up of environmental decisions will be reconsidered."
"Many amendments were accepted by the Council, and some of them propose again particularly important, not to say essential principles."
"Here are some of them."
"Most importantly, there is the principle that the public must be furnished with the necessary information through electronic media providing access to the institutions' documents."
"Secondly, the public must receive, inter alia, information about the right to participate in decision-making in the forms and quantities permitted - we touched on this just now. Thirdly, the public must be entitled to express both minor and far-reaching comments and adopt positions without prejudice to any options."
"A further obligation is placed upon the competent authorities, and that is to make reasonable efforts - as the document states - to reply to the public individually or collectively, and an obligation is placed upon the Member States too, to adopt practical, tangible measures on the review procedures and to make available to the public all the necessary information on how to obtain access to both administrative and judicial review procedures."
"This is to make it possible for the citizens to defend any grounds they may have for dissent throughout the judgment process and uphold an opinion which is different from that of the competent authority."
"This line of reasoning may, of course, be interpreted in different ways in different countries, depending on the level of democracy permitting public participation and, above all, protecting the organisations through which the public exercises this right of participation."
"Two things appear to be particularly important: firstly, the provision of access to cooperation and to the drawing up of legislative documents, and secondly, the provision of access to legal review throughout the judgment process in the event of differences."
"In this way, we are following faithfully the basic philosophy of Voltaire, who said, 'I may disagree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it'."
"Even if Europe is not improving our knowledge of law, it is, at least, teaching us some philosophy."
"Mr President, on Monday a series of petitions - as many as 200 - for July and August was noted in the Minutes of the first hour of the sitting."
"According to the statistics of the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions, 40% of these petitions concern failure to comply with Community Law on the environment."
"Mr President, if these measures for public participation in drawing up certain plans and programmes concerning the environment were really put into practice, if we really complied with the Directive on the public right to information, I am sure that a significant number of these petitions, which are noted each week in the Minutes of the sitting, would probably not reach here, because what we are seeing in the Committee on Petitions, where all these petitions arrive, is that not only is the public not allowed to participate in these environmental programmes, but it is sometimes denied the information that the Directive on the right to information should guarantee it."
"Mr President, I think that if we manage to have the amendments from this second reading adopted, and this third pillar of the legal aspects the rapporteur talked about is discussed in Parliament and ends well, we shall manage to reduce this list of petitions on the environment at each sitting."
"Mr President, I was listening to the debate here just now on European Union citizenship, and at least the latter part of the discussion, which I had the opportunity to follow, showed that we often understand the concept of citizenship as something rather abstract in this way, something handed down from on high, perhaps, which we must do no more than inform the people of."
"At least I was not aware of anyone mentioning the fact that the right to participate in decision-making is an absolutely essential aspect of citizenship."
"In this respect the report under discussion, which Eija-Riitta Korhola has skilfully taken through from the Committee stage to plenary session, is absolutely indispensable, as the fact that the European Union has begun to implement the Aarhus Convention shows that it is understood in the Union that, at least in environmental matters, we can make a start and give our citizens the right to participate."
"Mrs González Álvarez also raised a very important matter. She said that the public would have far fewer complaints about non-compliance with Community legislation if they had the right to participate in decision-making relating to it right from the early stages, and this is precisely what this report is about."
"It is absolutely essential that this right to participate should be applied widely to the parties concerned."
"In this regard it is important that Amendment No 10 actually goes through."
"I have no doubt that it will, but it does state that non-governmental organisations shall also be deemed to meet the definition of what constitutes a party concerned."
"I took note of the fact that, unfortunately, the final document produced by the United States of America and the group of developing countries at the Johannesburg summit on sustainable development that has just ended made no mention of Principle 10 of the Rio Conference, which specifically concerns the right of the public to participate in decision-making on the environment."
"It is even more important that the European Union should swiftly bring the Aarhus Convention into force."
"Now we will discuss the second part of the Convention which deals with the right to participate in decision-making."
"The rapporteur said that the right to participation can be abused."
"Unfortunately, however, much too much is made of this subject of abuse."
"In fact when the public actually start to exercise the rights they have, those who could not care less about their opinions all too readily claim those rights are being abused."
"I believe that when people are granted the right to participate they will also exercise that right responsibly and will eventually enjoy even fuller rights as citizens and that it will not occur to them to upset or terrorise the decision-making process."
"That is perhaps more an unfounded concern on the part of the decision-maker."
"Mr President, after having supported public access to environmental information in May 2000, today we back public participation in environmental programmes."
"The objective remains the same, that is to say to make decisions more transparent and to allow the citizens concerned to bring a civil action."
"But let us avoid hindering public lawsuits with the burden of costly inquiries."
"In our opinion, the limits of the directive must be based on Amendment No 3, that is to say, 'effective public participation in the taking of decisions enables the public to express, and the decision-maker to take account of, opinions and concerns which may be relevant to those decisions, thereby increasing the accountability and transparency of the decision-making process and contributing to public support for the decisions taken.'"
"In the same manner, Member States must, in accordance with their national legislation, be able to exclude these provisions from programmes affecting national defence."
"Furthermore, certain amendments approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy are not acceptable as they stand."
"Providing the public with information relating to decision-making is, in my opinion, a matter for citizens' associations."
"Achieving widespread public participation in the entirety of Community legislation seems utopian."
"If this is the case we will soon witness a marked increase in litigation."
"This type of procedure should be reserved for certain directives, such as Seveso or Natura 2000."
"In this particular case, owners affected by zoning have not even been consulted."
"The concept of the public has also not been defined, this wide and all-embracing concept ranging from a physical person to an association, as well as the more specific concept of the public concerned."
"In my opinion, only the public concerned should be included."
"Yet, the directive recognises non-governmental organisations working for the protection of the environment as having an interest in this context, which considerably increases the scope of our measures to the detriment of public prerogatives."
"Mr President, my colleague, Mrs Wallström, is attending the World Summit on Sustainable Development."
"Therefore it is an honour for me to participate in this debate on her behalf."
"The first meeting of the parties to the Aarhus Convention on access to information, public participation and access to justice in environmental matters will take place at the end of October."
"The Community will not yet be in a position to participate as a party to that convention."
"We can, however, show that we take our commitments seriously and make good progress in adopting the implementing legislation."
"This common position deals with the second pillar of the convention, public participation in environmental decision-making."
"In addition, other recent Community legislation already incorporates the principles of the Aarhus Convention concerning public participation and the common position on access to environmental information is under consideration."
"The Commission will present the remaining proposals, notably on access to justice and the application of the convention to Community institutions, by the end of the year."
"The present common position, with one exception, provides a good basis to enable this directive on public participation to be adopted fairly soon."
"The Commission is happy that the rapporteur and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy as a whole share this positive view and also support the Commission's position on the outstanding issue."
"On the main amendments tabled for the vote tomorrow, the Commission's position is as follows."
"First of all, public participation in the updating of permits under the IPPC directive."
"I will start with the exception where the Commission is not happy with the common position."
"Under the Aarhus Convention, public participation is as a rule required, not only for the issue but also for the updating of permits for the activities covered."
"This was provided for in the Commission's proposal concerning permits under the IPPC Directive, where such updating is a key revision."
"The common position largely restricted this requirement and its wording leaves a wide discretion to the Member States and the competent authorities in charge of updating permits."
"This will lead to widely divergent practice and legal uncertainty and will potentially mean that public participation is possible only in a few cases when permits are being updated, rather than being the rule."
"Amendment No 15 requires public participation for the most relevant cases of permit updates, which are those covered by Article 13 of the IPPC directive."
"While the Commission proposal included permit updates as such, the amendment is in line with Article 6(10) of the Aarhus Convention, which allows for the rules on public participation to apply updates where appropriate."
"The Commission considers public participation in permit updates covered by Article 13 appropriate."
"The wording of the common position fails to identify where public participation is deemed to be appropriate, leaving it entirely to the discretion of the Member States."
"The Commission therefore fully supports Amendment No 15."
"Regarding the extension of the public participation provisions to cover other Community legislation plans and programmes which may have a significant effect on the environment, Amendment No 18 proposes extending considerably the scope of Article 2 to cover other Community legislation, plans and programmes, which may have a significant effect on the environment or health."
"The Commission cannot accept this amendment, nor can it accept related Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 6 to the recitals, for the following reasons."
"To the extent that the wording refers to public participation in the preparation of Community legislation, the present directive is not the correct legal instrument."
"In addition, public participation in the preparation of legislation is referred to as soft law under the Aarhus Convention."
"In regard to plans and programmes, the amendment would considerably deviate from the original approach to cover clearly identified plans and programmes in the environmental field."
"It would not provide sufficient legal certainty as to which plans and programmes are covered and would duplicate measures in different pieces of legislation."
"In respect of plans and programmes in other sectors likely to have significant environmental effects, Directive 2001/42/EC on strategic environmental assessment already incorporates measures of particular relevance."
"This directive provides for an environmental assessment of relevant plans and programmes in the integration sectors."
"As part of the assessment, public participation will take place in line with the Aarhus Convention."
"I turn now to access to justice."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 10 providing for access to justice in relation to plans and programmes covered by the directive, or Amendment No 5 on the related recital."
"Article 9(2) of the Aarhus Convention explicitly requires access to justice in relation to projects that may have a significant effect on the environment."
"This is dealt with under the common position."
"In relation to plans and programmes, access to justice is not explicitly required."
"It would also be inconsistent to apply it to certain plans and programmes when it is not provided for in the case of those covered by the directive on strategic environmental assessment."
"However, the Commission is preparing a legislative proposal on access to justice to fully implement the third pillar of the Aarhus Convention."
"In the framework of that proposal, the content of Amendment No 10 could more appropriately be addressed in a horizontal way."
"On the amendments concerning information about the outcome of public participation and practical information concerning administrative and judicial review, the Commission would like to point out that the provisions on public participation have to be practicable to allow smooth implementation in the different administrative systems of the Member States."
"Amendments Nos 7, 13, 14 and 16 require the competent authority to make reasonable efforts to reply to the public and to ensure that information provided about decisions taken includes practical direction concerning the procedure for seeking review."
"The common position already incorporates the obligation to inform the public about the final decision and the underlying reasons and considerations and provides for appropriate information to be made available on the review procedures."
"Requiring more would constitute a disproportionate administrative burden and hamper effective public participation."
"The Commission therefore cannot accept those amendments."
"To summarise our position on the amendments: the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 15 and 19."
"Amendments Nos 3, 4, 11 and 12 can be accepted in principle."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 5 to 10, 13, 14, nor Amendments Nos 16 to 18."
"To conclude, I would like to emphasise that it is in our common interest, which is the interest of the European citizens, to have this directive enter in force swiftly so that public participation can be fully integrated into administrative practice."
"Thank you very much, Mr Vitorino."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 10.55 p.m.)"
"Recent serious problems concerning food safety in the EU"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the recent serious problems concerning food safety in the European Union."
"Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to report on the recent contamination of the feed and food chain with medroxy-progesterone acetate, or MPA as it is commonly known."
"I must stress that the Commission takes this incident very seriously indeed."
"It is simply unacceptable that hormones should find their way into the food and feed chains."
"So, having found ourselves in this regrettable situation, what action did we take?"
"First, my services called an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health on 10 July, with further meetings following on 16 and 24 July. These were in addition to the continuous contacts between the Commission services and their counterparts in the Member States."
"These efforts were very successful in reducing the risk to public health to a minimum."
"However, this success was achieved at a very high cost."
"Very substantial quantities of food and feed had to be traced and destroyed. The impact has been particularly severe in the Netherlands."
"Investigations into the factors which allowed the contamination to take place are, of course, ongoing."
"However, two factors in particular already stand out: firstly, the application of Community legislation on the movement and disposal of pharmaceutical waste, and secondly, the carelessness of certain feed producers in their selection of raw material suppliers."
"Investigations into the onward distribution of the contaminated glucose syrup revealed that it had been delivered to feed mills and traders and, to a limited extent, to the food industry."
"The contaminated feed was produced mostly for pigs, but also, to a much lesser extent, for cattle, poultry, zoo animals and pets."
"This contaminated feed could be separated into two groups: a lesser quantity of highly contaminated feed distributed to 57 farms in the Netherlands and larger quantities with a low level of contamination."
"In response to the situation, the Standing Committee agreed the following measures. All animals fed with highly contaminated feed would be kept under strict official control."
"Member States would test individual animals fed with the highly contaminated feed and only release them for consumption if results confirmed that MPA could not be detected."
"The authorities in the Netherlands chose to destroy pigs fed with the highly contaminated feed, thus removing them entirely from the food chain."
"All samples from animals fed with the low contamination feed tested negative for the presence of MPA and the restriction was therefore lifted."
"Several hundred samples of glucose syrup, molasses and feed have been analysed and, as a result, thousands of tonnes of contaminated raw materials and feeding stuffs have been recalled, seized and destroyed."
"The next meeting of the Standing Committee is planned for 11 September."
"At this meeting, the measures taken by the Member States in relation to the MPA contamination will be reviewed."
"However, we can already conclude that the measures were successful in limiting the potential risk to the public."
"They were also very successful in averting any unilateral restrictions by Member States or third countries on trade, particularly from the Netherlands."
"Clearly we have to learn the lessons from the contamination and avoid any repetition."
"At the Agriculture Council of 15 July 2002, I repeated my call for the Member States' competent authorities for food and feed to exercise stricter control to ensure a high level of consumer health protection."
"Feed and food operators need to be more aware of their responsibilities in this area."
"We all consider the food law a major step forward for the protection of human health."
"In that context, the responsibilities of feed and food operators are clearly established."
"Feed operators must ensure that the raw materials they buy are safe."
"In the very near future the Commission will be proposing a major reform of the Community's system of official controls, in order to create a harmonised, coordinated and more effective system of controls on food and feed."
"In addition, the Food and Veterinary Office is urgently investigating the operation and control of the animal feed sector."
"Its aim will be to pinpoint how recent contamination incidents have been allowed to occur and to identify the action that needs to be taken to prevent similar incidents arising in the future."
"Furthermore, in order to complete the legal framework for the entire feed sector, the Commission will present a new proposal on feed hygiene at the earliest opportunity."
"We intend to put forward general hygiene rules for the production, distribution and feeding of animals and also to enlarge the scope of the registration system for feed operations."
"Under the current arrangements, only establishments dealing with certain feed additives are registered."
"Clearly this is not sufficient to ensure traceability of all feed materials."
"In this context, a positive list of feed materials is being looked at with a view to increasing consumer protection, as Parliament itself has requested."
"I am pleased to say that the feasibility study you requested is nearly complete."
"You will receive the report with our analysis before the end of this year."
"At the same time, the question arises as to whether Community legislation in relation to the waste sector is sufficiently stringent and properly implemented."
"I would remind you that had existing waste legislation been correctly applied in the case of MPA, it would have prevented such an incident."
"I alerted my colleague, Mrs Wallström, as soon as it became apparent that the problem involved pharmaceutical waste."
"Discussions have taken place with waste experts from the Member States and are continuing."
"One lesson we can learn from this incident is the need for closer coordination and cooperation between the authorities responsible for the waste sector and those responsible for feed and food safety."
"The authorities of the Member States involved in this affair have been asked to provide all relevant information to enable the case to be assessed from an environmental point of view."
"On the basis of that assessment, the Commission will take any further action deemed necessary."
"Finally, it goes without saying that incidents such as this only serve to undermine our efforts to restore consumer confidence in our food supply."
"We need to redouble our efforts, in terms not just of legislation but also better enforcement and control, to make such incidents a thing of the past."
"Mr President, food safety has been high on our parliamentary menu for the past three years."
"We have had scares and scandals in Europe on olive oil, contaminated wine, mineral water, listeria, salmonella, E. coli, BSE, dioxins, sludge and slurry."
"They all concerned our constituents and exercised our legislative minds."
"Now, once again, there is a problem with hormones."
"We discussed and debated the Food Safety White Paper and went on to pass legislation on food and feed and on the establishment of the European Food Safety Authority."
"Now, our media have been full of new food scandals."
"50 000 Dutch pigs condemned to be slaughtered because they were contaminated by illegal feedstuffs - illegal because of contamination by MPA hormones in feed additives."
"The cost to the Netherlands alone is immense, tens of millions of euros."
"The problem probably came, as we heard, from waste water from an American-owned pharmaceutical company in Ireland, sent by an Irish waste disposal firm to a Belgian reprocessing plant that is now bankrupt."
"That firm supplied glucose syrup or treacle to Dutch feed manufacturers."
"All 4 000 pigs were then exported from the Netherlands to Belgium."
"The banned hormone has been found in pigfeed in Germany."
"300 German farms were banned from selling milk or animals."
"But pork was sold, was processed and has been eaten by humans and of course MPA in humans can cause infertility."
"Some of the syrup, too, ended up with soft drink manufacturers."
"Some of the feed ended up in Denmark, Spain, France and possibly Luxembourg and Britain."
"One of the messages the Commissioner has highlighted is that we need coordination, not only between governments but between the directorates of the Commission."
"I welcome what he said about talking to Mrs Wallström."
"Commissioner, what is the point of our passing laws if they are not enforced?"
"Where were the checks and the monitoring?"
"What, incidentally, are the Commission's new proposals on controls?"
"Was this negligence or was it a criminal attempt to increase the weight of pigs by illegal means?"
"How often is a blind eye turned to wrongdoing?"
"A banned carcinogenic herbicide was found in grain fed to organic chickens in Germany in June."
"Yet exports of organic chicken or eggs from Germany were not banned."
"I have faith in our new food safety measures."
"I have faith in our new authority and I wish it could be set up faster."
"But it will only be effective if we have proper enforcement throughout the European Union."
"(Applause from the right)"
"Mr President, over the past few years - since 1996, I would say - I have told this House at least five times that animal feed should not be a dustbin for cheaply disposing of all kinds of rubbish."
"It is surprising to find that such a simple statement never ceases to be topical and is never a source of boredom, given that it remains so topical."
"Why should that be?"
"Because of our agricultural policy, of course."
"Since we try to produce everything as cheaply as possible, it makes sense to produce cattle feed as cheaply as possible too."
"I once said that the manufacturers and we ourselves should try to picture sitting down in front of a plate of animal feed with a knife and fork on either side - just imagine what that would look like!"
"Mr Bowis just pointed out that this is not just a matter of carelessness here but of criminal intent."
"He is quite right."
"To describe storing animal feed in a former chemical works as carelessness is to put it mildly."
"I do not know what makes people do things like that or allow them to happen."
"What are we to think when a waste disposal company produces glucose syrup as a parallel activity?"
"Should we not perhaps be somewhat sceptical when we come across an Irish company wanting to dispose of its waste - to which there can be no objections as such - and we see that it wants to do this in Belgium and that the waste reprocessing company also produces glucose syrup?"
"The waste that it is processing comes from washing the coating on contraceptive pills, which of course contains sugar."
"No one actually noticed this and we all found it quite normal, but when it actually came to light in the course of the monitoring process it caused enormous excitement."
"If we do not start to change the system in some way, we will carry on having this debate here at least three times a year."
"So what can we change about the system?"
"I am grateful to Commissioner Byrne for pinpointing some ideas."
"Yes, we need tough legislation on feed hygiene."
"Yes, we need to separate the production of animal and plant-based feeds."
"Yes, we need stricter approval procedures for feed producers, with a registration system for factories producing animal feeds."
"And yes, every manufacturer of feedingstuffs must employ a biochemist at his plant full-time and not just source one from somewhere else."
"These are all commonplace ideas that we could all suggest, of course."
"What is the situation with legislation on waste?"
"Yes, there is indeed proper waste legislation."
"Are there proper controls in the Member States?"
"Apparently neither the country of origin nor the receiving country carries out controls."
"Will the Commission go to the European Court of Justice more quickly?"
"Will countries which are obviously ignoring their control obligations under the existing legislation be prosecuted more quickly and suffer appropriate penalties?"
"What is the position as regards controls in the Member States?"
"Since the BSE crisis, we have established that the real Bermuda Triangle within the European Union is the system of controls in the Member States."
"We should be obliging all Member States to, at last, make the process more transparent and to tell us how many people are carrying out controls on what, when, where and with what result. That can just be one page, nice and transparent, available to anyone, and on the Internet if you like."
"Is that too much to ask?"
"No, it is not too much to ask!"
"We have been saying for years - since 1996 - that we want a positive list of substances and additives in animal feed."
"Commissioner Byrne told us that the feasibility study is almost complete, so we should be able to start soon."
"I am grateful for that."
"However, if we do not all accept that up to now we have been consistently turning a blind eye so that animal feed can be produced cheaply and so that meat can be produced cheaply, then we will still be encouraging firms to dump all kinds of waste, anything that can no longer be recycled in any other way, in animal feed."
"That is why we need to have quality requirements for animal feeds."
"We need to have other controls on animal protein."
"And in our role as consumers, we ourselves also need to consider what we are consuming and how, and what we are willing to pay for products."
"Mr President, food safety will, without a doubt, be high on the agenda in the coming years."
"If we consider the recent scandals, the big question is whether the Commission would have been able to prevent them."
"The Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin has been in existence for a number of years."
"What kind of inspections does it carry out precisely?"
"How often are they carried out?"
"Is there room for improvement?"
"Would the Commission be able to comment on this?"
"The imports of food, of meat from other countries, have already been mentioned."
"Does the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin have sufficient staff to inspect them?"
"I should also like to raise the issue of the Food Safety Authority."
"Once this is fully up and running, it will need to analyse all the production processes and see whether they can be improved."
"This Authority will also need to issue recommendations to the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin about the way in which the inspection procedures can be improved still further."
"In fact, cooperation with the Member States will also be required."
"However, the most important thing is for the Office to perform its task of implementing existing legislation well."
"In the light of increasing liberalisation, we will obviously be facing ever growing imports and, in my view, ever greater risks as a result."
"Another issue is production in Europe itself."
"The idea that the entire production chain is to be monitored is increasingly taking root in different countries."
"This is referred to as 'integrated production'."
"Why does the Commission not prescribe any standards in this respect?"
"What exactly is integrated production in a European context?"
"How can we monitor every link in the production chain?"
"There is legislation in Europe governing organic production in which this is laid down."
"In a slightly different area, there is legislation in Europe which defines precisely what regional products are."
"Why, therefore, do we not have legislation which identifies what integrated production is by means of a quality mark?"
"Then we would be able to trace everything promptly."
"Moreover, the European consumer would be able to express a preference for European products from European farmers."
"Mr President, there is no doubt that there are a great many weaknesses in our food controls, and food safety is an unacceptably low priority."
"The revision of the directive on food may help to significantly change this situation."
"This is particularly necessary given the growing worldwide trend towards producing food by artificial means."
"There are at present no universal controls on the value-added chain, and awareness of state food controls needs to be increased."
"There will certainly be an improvement in this state of affairs if we can succeed in involving the agricultural industry, the animal feed industry and those engaged in the monitoring of food."
"That will not be a simple task as those in positions of responsibility throughout the chain have a very negative attitude."
"State controls are necessary, but we need to create better incentives for promoting voluntary self-regulation and self-regulation under civil law."
"State controls can then focus on the high-risk companies and farms that will always exist."
"It is not acceptable, when products have been placed on the market contrary to health regulations, for this to be declared the result of a production accident and the products withdrawn under covert or open buy-back schemes so that they will simply be forgotten."
"As we know from past experience, it tends to be very difficult to clarify the facts of such cases rapidly and rigorously."
"Compulsory reporting of what are labelled as serious health risks is clearly not enough."
"In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania 320 farms were temporarily closed because of suspected contamination with Nitrofen, but the discovery of this scandal and the attendant publicity were remarkable not so much because of the number of cases as because of the nature of the crisis."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have already observed that moments of crisis are, more often than not, moments from which policy-makers should draw lessons."
"They are also moments when we learn a great deal about society."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mr Bowis pointed out that, apparently, there are people in the food industry who act irresponsibly and are careless, and for whom only the gross profits, pure financial gain and greed count."
"What lessons can I and my group draw from the nitrofen case in Germany and the Whyeth Pharmaceutical/Bioland case in Ireland and Belgium?"
"First of all, we need to prevent products entering the human and animal food chain which originate from recycled waste, and inspection must also be stepped up, including in respect of the waste flow of the chemical and pharmaceutical industries."
"In my own country - and I assume that this is the case in most - we need to work towards better cooperation between the services that monitor the food chain and the services that manage the waste flows."
"I am pleased, Commissioner, that you have come to the same conclusion."
"Secondly, there is a European Rapid Alert System that also applies to animal feed, and that, I believe, is functioning well at the moment."
"Should we not insist that our national and regional counterparts adopt a kind of rapid alert system internally within the Member States too, and certainly in federal Member States such as Germany and Belgium where the powers are spread across different authorities?"
"Thirdly, we must introduce a system of perfect traceability of raw materials that end up in the food chain."
"Fourthly, and this is something which my group has advocated, we ban by law all practices that do not yield any extra nutritional value or any extra advantage to the consumer, or that are superfluous from a technical point of view."
"Fifthly, it is clear that the number of inspections needs to be increased."
"They must also be diversified, for we can only find something if we look for it."
"This was made abundantly clear in Germany's nitrofen case when the organic sector decided to carry out voluntary checks."
"Sixthly, I would push for producer liability to play its full part."
"The whole debate on environmental liability must be speeded up and we must bring it to a more rapid conclusion."
"Finally, Commissioner, I would once again urge the Commission to draw up of a positive list of products allowed in cattle feed."
"You have announced that this is to be the subject of a feasibility study."
"I would expressly ask you what progress is being made on this matter."
"Finally, there are quite a few comic characters in the food industry, and only a well-organised authority with strict inspections can rid the industry of these characters once and for all."
"Mr President, there are many examples of this Parliament and the institutions responding with urgency to matters of public concern and none more so than in the area of food safety and consumer protection."
"In this regard I compliment the Commissioner on his response to the most recent scare and share fully his views with regard to what has happened."
"While the number of incidents proportionate to the volume of quality food produced is minimal, the negative impact on consumers is considerable."
"Restoring confidence in the food chain has been a slow, tedious and indeed expensive process."
"Thankfully the measures put in place are proving their effectiveness and there is now an acute awareness on the part of all involved, from producers to processors, from the retail to the catering trade, that any breach of the regulations is unacceptable and will be severely dealt with."
"It is important to put on the record that, while EU consumers always had access to quality food, the effectiveness of new controls and greater transparency in the food chain provide the additional safeguards necessary to allay fears resulting from isolated incidents and indeed the unforgivable incident which this House is addressing this morning."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that you cannot control safety - you have to create it."
"Listening to today's debate on food safety, I fear that we have not come very far in recent years."
"Producers and consumers have the same objective, we are all in the same boat, so it is not just consumers that are affected but the producers themselves as well."
"As I see it, consumers are quite right to be alarmed by the serious problems we have had recently, the string of scandals that have already been mentioned - BSE, dioxin, Nitrofen - it is a very long list."
"Ultimately, however, the weakest link in the chain is always the farmer, the producer, who has taken a battering because of the price situation."
"That is why the agricultural sector has a particularly great interest in achieving high quality in the upstream market."
"I am at present rapporteur on the issue of additives in animal feed."
"Commissioner, I am certainly in agreement with you in calling for very stringent measures to be applied to a wide variety of additives."
"We are talking here about antibiotics and cocciodiostatic drugs."
"I have just been discussing this with some of your colleagues."
"As a practical person, I firmly believe that we got things adequately sorted out on paper a long time ago but, in practice, when it comes to implementation and control, I regret to say that we will still have a lot of black sheep to deal with in future."
"We will only make progress here if the control system involves tougher sanctions."
"As I see it, those who are too slack deserve to be pilloried and should have their quota withdrawn and their production units shut down."
"Only if you point the way on this with our support can pressure be exerted to restore a reasonable situation in the European Union, one in which producers and consumers can process or consume food in the knowledge that it is safe and we can maintain the high quality of food that we have in the future as well."
"I would like to fully support Mrs Roth-Behrendt's proposals, but we have spent over 20 years talking about people's willingness to spend more money on food; it is just that the distribution process has totally changed."
"We need to be honest about the fact that many people simply cannot afford it."
"They want it all."
"They want not just to eat and drink, they also want to go on holiday, to travel, and so on and so forth. That is why we have food that is virtually free."
"Mr President, I am sure that the Commissioner attends these events with a heavy heart, because he is responsible not just for the food chain and the feed chain but also the worst chain of all, the contamination chain."
"One of the problems we face in this House is that we often orate about how everything should be perfect without always ourselves being willing to seek the means to go with the ends: the means to allow us to have an effective FVO, which at the moment is overstretched and understaffed; the means to have a proper process of scrutiny whereby every Member State, great or small, whether its population is a few hundred thousand or many millions, takes equal precautions and provides equal information."
"That has not happened in some of the cases here and I appreciate the difficulties that the Commissioner faces as a result."
"In regard to the scandal about the presence of nitrofen in grains for organic chickens, we know from information provided between May and July that not all of the Member States were informed with express speed about what had happened."
"Our information is that in regard to contaminated pork - to pigs that had been fed with these appalling materials - four Member States had purchased and no doubt their citizens had consumed some of the contaminated pork before the process of control was effectively operating."
"The controls are now better and, as a result of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health being set up in February and the evidence it collates, we can now say that we have a rapid-alert system that ought to work."
"That is the Commissioner's responsibility, so we commend him on it."
"The question is whether the Member States are providing sufficient information."
"Can they be trusted to bring their own rogue operators under control?"
"I do not know."
"I should like to hear from the Commissioner whether he believes the resources are there."
"Mr Bowis said earlier that all the institutions have been dilatory and slow in setting up EFSA."
"It is going to come into operation later than we had hoped."
"Is that one of the reasons why we are having to wait longer to get these positive lists of feed materials and the general hygiene rules which follow from the reforms we so enthusiastically greeted last year?"
"I hope that the Commissioner can tell us that proper investigations are proceeding in all the Member States as to why organisations like Bioland could perpetrate the scandals they did."
"Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, animal feeds are, after all, food, and we need the positive list."
"You have been quoted in the German press as saying that there are thousands of substances that need to be tested."
"I hope that was a misquote, because if there really are thousands of substances added to animal feeds, that would be a scandal in itself."
"The number of additives needs to be limited and that should be implemented on a restrictive basis."
"After all, if the industry then comes along and says that it has forgotten a substance and makes the test available straight away, that substance can be added on."
"Of course, the positive list does not mean that we have nothing to worry about."
"The fact that there are people willing to dispose of toxic materials by putting them in animal feeds because that is cheaper demonstrates a criminal intent which should be punished accordingly."
"That also convinces me - and I think we in this House are all agreed on this - that a simple ban is not enough."
"We need to consider what substances we are banning and what happens to them next."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt has already pointed out that legislation on waste should be closely linked with controls, just as it should be linked with what we are discussing here, so that there is not any overlap."
"We have repeatedly seen cases of substances that really should be destroyed finding their way into animal feeds."
"However, we should not throw the baby out with the bath water - please note, Mr President!"
"We have already seen what can happen in the case of food waste."
"We also need to establish reasonable recycling arrangements where it is appropriate to do so."
"Yesterday, I visited a cat and dog food factory."
"When you see the meticulous controls applied there you realise that it is not a question of controls but rather of the sanctions that can be applied by consumers wielding their purchasing power against industry."
"Mr President, I wish to concur with what has been said by many of the previous speakers."
"I should also like to thank the Commissioner for what he has said."
"I do notice, however, that, although he is introducing a large number of measures, he fails to mention the best piece of news, namely that it was the farmers who discovered that something was wrong with their pigs, because their sows were not breeding properly."
"It is down to the farmers."
"This means, then, that there is a very important lesson we should draw from this, and that we should be aware that the inspection system, however effectively it has been set up, has failed thus far."
"With all these fine measures that are now being proposed, I have one overriding question, and I believe that Mrs Roth-Behrendt has already mentioned it as well."
"How does waste legislation relate to what we do with our cattle feed?"
"Who monitors this?"
"Commissioner, if you say that, according to Commissioner Wallström, if waste legislation had been enforced, we would not be facing any problems now, then I think you should ask the Irish authorities why they did not verify that these hormones landed up in a waste processor in an improper manner."
"Why did they subsequently not check at the border that these hormones were being exported to a company which should raise question marks, at any rate in Belgium?"
"This means, therefore, that in this respect, the Irish and the Belgians have dropped major clangers."
"Mr President, why - and I am also speaking on behalf of my own country - did we fail to check these companies when we know that, in addition to manure, they also produce their own feed and that they are already shrouded in great suspicion?"
"What about product liability legislation?"
"I hope that those who lost out will be receiving compensation from the governments responsible."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, high-quality food is produced nowadays and it has to meet a wide range of requirements."
"An enormous variety of food is on offer, including food from widely varying countries outside the European Union."
"Our guiding principle should continue to be that our food should be safe and of a high quality, in order to ensure that consumers are protected."
"Food is the most basic prerequisite for people's health and quality of life."
"Nevertheless, past scandals have unsettled and frightened consumers enormously."
"For example, I find it irresponsible that dishonest pharmaceutical companies should dispose of hormone products through animal feed and food, turning consumers into walking rubbish bins."
"I find it absolutely horrifying that metroxyprogesteronacetate is present in sugar syrup and soft drinks!"
"I would like to ask, Commissioner, what legal steps have now been taken to prevent this recurring in the future."
"I welcome the new European Food Safety Authority as an early warning system for Europe and as an efficient crisis management system coordinated between the Commission and the Member States."
"I am, however, concerned that the EU's controls should work properly."
"The network should be extended to provide better information and the reporting obligation for companies should be brought in as quickly as possible so that goods and products are withdrawn from the market if they are harmful."
"What has the Commission done in the meantime to implement this, and to ensure greater transparency and traceability?"
"We need to protect consumers, and that applies to imports as well."
"That is why I believe it is a matter of urgent necessity to introduce control systems for food as quickly as possible in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe too, including those cases where food is already produced in accordance with European standards."
"However, to allow consumers to decide for themselves what they want, we need to ensure that we have practical and clear labelling both for conventionally produced food and for genetically modified food."
"I firmly believe that we need to set the course for this as soon as possible."
"Mr President, for the public, health and healthy food are the top priority."
"But how am I as a consumer to know if a particular food is healthy?"
"Just looking certainly is not enough."
"An apple with wormholes in it can be far healthier than a shiny, beautifully round apple."
"The agricultural sector - and this does not just apply to Austria - professes to observe the principles of food safety, traceability and hygiene."
"For me, this debate is an opportunity to champion the cause of small farms, because it is always in the big, industrialised concerns, which really have very little in common with farms, that scandals occur."
"Nevertheless, small farms are still at the mercy of animal feed producers and vets who can prescribe all sorts of hormones and other drugs."
"One thing is certain: the controls have not worked."
"You can, of course, turn things round however you want and say, yes, we just need even stricter rules."
"But if we are not even enforcing the existing rules, how are we going to cope with even stricter ones?"
"It will not help at all."
"Whatever legislation we enact will remain a paper tiger if we do not enforce it."
"As I see it, controlling the enforcers should be a job for the Commission."
"You cannot just turn your back on this problem."
"Cheap food may be good for winning the next election, but it is not good for public health, and I think the public knows that too."
"I would like to stress once more that strict rules and regulations and comprehensive documentation of controls are certainly important for big companies."
"But it would be pointless to harass small family farms with this."
"To be quite specific, very small food-processing companies need more information and motivation and less bureaucracy and documentation."
"There is no denying that not only is preventing food crises extremely important for the future of farmers, it is also highly important for the future of public health in the European Union."
"I believe, Commissioner, that we have not yet found the right way of achieving this."
"Mr President, a number of speakers have referred to the problem of waste and waste policy."
"We will have an opportunity to discuss this issue later this month in Parliament when we adopt the animal by-products regulation."
"This hugely important piece of legislation will ensure that one key sector in particular, animal by-products, is better regulated."
"The positive list was referred to by a number of people. I shall say something about that."
"The Commission will shortly present the study which has been undertaken on the positive list. This will be presented to Parliament and our views on the feasibility of such a list will be made available for discussion here in Parliament at that time."
"But we should bear in mind that a positive list would not include MPA."
"It would not, therefore, have prevented the recent contamination."
"MPA should not be on the list; it will never be approved and therefore the positive list is not the full answer."
"However, I recognise that a number of people in this House are anxious for progress to be made on this issue and this will be discussed in Parliament before the end of the year."
"A number of people also mentioned the Food Safety Authority."
"The work is ongoing there and, as we all know, the board has been established."
"Further steps have been taken on the appointment of the executive director."
"The board will hold its first meeting very soon on 18 September."
"In relation to further progress on the Food Safety Authority, if Parliament would make the appropriations requested by the Commission available to us, this would facilitate our work."
"I know that there are reasons why Parliament feels it wants to hold back this money as leverage for something else, but that may or may not be legitimate."
"It does nothing to facilitate the establishment of the Food Safety Authority and ensure that it is up and running and carrying out its work."
"I would appeal to Parliament to reconsider its position on these appropriations."
"Some other points were raised by individual Members and I hope I can pick them all up but if I do not, please forgive me."
"Mr Bowis made reference to growth promoters."
"We can safely conclude that the contamination we are talking about this morning was not due to illegal use to increase the weight of pigs."
"Such use, that is the use of hormones as growth promoters, is illegal."
"As I have already said, the Commission will be presenting a major proposal on controls shortly."
"This is aimed primarily at improving the implementation of our existing legislation."
"I intend in particular to increase the penalties and the cost of non-compliance."
"I think we all agree that we must make it painful and costly for Member States and producers if they fail to implement Community legislation."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt made a number of relevant points."
"She is 100% right: feed must not serve as the dustbin for waste producers."
"Several of the recent major food-safety crises have originated from waste management: dioxin, the recent nitrofen crisis in Germany, sludge and now MPA and BSE."
"They are all associated with the feed issue."
"As I have already said, we must improve contacts between the Member States on the treatment and disposal of waste - a controversial issue in a number of Member States but, nonetheless, one that has to be addressed with courage and effectiveness."
"Mr Mulder referred to the Food and Veterinary Office. It is doing a very good job in ensuring compliance with Community law."
"Its reports continue to highlight the serious shortcomings in the implementation of legislation."
"It could do with more resources, but that is an issue for the budgetary authority."
"I am unhappy with the follow-up to the FAO's recommendations in a number of areas."
"This is why the Commission is coming forward with a new proposal to improve controls."
"As I have said repeatedly, we must make it painful and costly not to respect Community law."
"Mr Mulder mentioned a quality mark. This may be valuable but it has its limitations."
"Like legislation, quality marks are only effective if the qualifying conditions are respected."
"In the Netherlands, for instance, feed producers undertook to use only safe ingredients as part of their quality assurance scheme."
"Clearly, they failed to respect this requirement."
"So quality marks may be useful but they have their limitations."
"Mr Whitehead referred to the rapid alert system at Community level and this has worked very effectively in relation to the recent food-safety crises."
"In a number of cases - not just this one but also the nitrofen case - the system worked very effectively."
"The problems have occurred at the national level."
"As Mr Whitehead suggests, in the recent nitrofen crisis in Germany there were clear failings in the notification of national authorities."
"Very often that occurs because of the federal structure that exists in a number of our Member States."
"Mr Staes also made the point that those Member States that have a federal structure really need to look at their systems of rapid alert to ensure that they match what we have at Community level."
"For instance, the Commission immediately notified Member States when it learned of this particular contamination."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten then referred to a number of points that I would like to take up."
"Commissioner Wallström and I have written to the Irish authorities requesting a full and comprehensive reply to the question marks as to their compliance with the relevant Community legislation."
"This legislation requires formal notification of the movement of pharmaceutical waste, which does not appear to have happened in this instance."
"In the light of the reply I expect to have from the Irish authorities later this month we will then be in a position to return to this issue."
"When that reply comes in it will be examined closely and any further action that needs to be taken will be addressed at that time."
"Thank you Commissioner Byrne."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the report (A5-0224/2002) by Mrs Van Brempt, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the Commission communication on Making a European Area of Lifelong Learning a Reality [COM(2001) 678 - C5-0165/2002 - 2002/2073(COS)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing a report on an area for lifelong learning."
"This report forms part of a process started a few years ago which has already received some attention at the Stockholm and Lisbon European Councils, for example."
"However, it was primarily the Feira European Council that concluded that lifelong learning would be crucial to the development of our European society in terms of social cohesion, employment opportunities and suchlike. It also called on the Member States, the Commission and Parliament to develop strategies and a policy."
"It is in this framework that we now view the Commission communication and, particularly, the memorandum that was published prior to this."
"I should now like to take some time to consider the areas of attention which Parliament highlights in its report."
"Allow me to start with the principles on which the concept of lifelong learning should be based."
"This is a matter of great importance and often discussed, but the question is: are we using the same guiding principles?"
"We have already underlined a number of these principles in Parliament's first report."
"I shall outline them here very quickly."
"The first is democratisation and the principle of equality - of crucial importance, in my view."
"If we fail to provide better and equal access to education and training via lifelong learning, then we have failed in our objective."
"Everyone knows that there is a yawning chasm between the highly qualified and the poorly qualified."
"If we cannot reduce this chasm and do not succeed in doing this via lifelong learning, then we have failed."
"A second crucial principle is, in fact, the right to individual personality development."
"This does not only encompass lifelong learning, it also recognises the wider social value of lifelong learning."
"This is about the right to work on one's own personality development without necessarily focusing on the jobs."
"In addition, we need to strike the right balance between, on the one hand, a right that we have to create for our citizens, a right that we, as a government, must be able to make reality on the basis of our own resources, and, on the other hand, the individual's duties and responsibility."
"A second vital aspect which still needs a great deal of attention - and I am addressing the Commission, in particular, here - is formal and informal learning."
"Formal learning is very important in the Union, because we need to ensure that our citizens' qualifications are also recognised in Member States other than their own and that the citizens know that their qualifications are equivalent elsewhere."
"This is why the Commission has proposed the European curriculum vitae, to be replaced in due course by the portfolio system."
"I welcome these, but they strike me as somewhat vague and the link with informal learning is distinctly missing."
"Informal learning is precisely what this is all about."
"We must ensure that we can validate, certify and also verify informal competences, or the competences acquired elsewhere, for this is, once again, the key difference between those who have a qualification and who can build on it, and those who do not have a qualification, those who have already dropped out."
"We could incorporate the latter by recognising informal learning."
"In this area, the Commission still has a great deal of work to do, Commissioner, for we are, in fact, nowhere at the moment."
"Along with my fellow MEPs, I trust that you, together with the Member States, will develop the instruments required for this purpose."
"I have already mentioned individual personality development and the fact that not only is lifelong learning is important, it is important to recognise its wider social value too."
"In my first report, and now in the second report as well, I have introduced the concept of the individual learning account."
"We would very explicitly ask the Commission to look into this and consider, working together with the European Investment Bank, whether we could not free up resources to invest in what is so valuable to us, namely our human capital."
"I would like to finish off with a few critical remarks."
"I notice that we in the Union are capable of formulating clear objectives, or even of enforcing them."
"The Maastricht standard, the employment strategies and the benchmarks all prove this point."
"In the field of scientific research, we have the courage to introduce a benchmark, but we are clearly lacking the political courage to do this for education and lifelong learning."
"This is, in fact, causing me concern, for I do believe that it is vital that we should do this."
"On a final note, I should like to say that we must find a new way of describing 'lifelong learning' as a matter of urgency, for it sounds like a sentence."
"If we have to say to our school leavers: you have done well, you have your qualifications now and you can now learn for the rest of your lives, then this will hardly motivate them."
"We can write the finest speeches and adopt the finest policies, but if our people and our students refuse to cooperate, then I fear, Commissioner, that these words will not be translated into action."
"And this is exactly what we need to avoid."
"I therefore suggest we might need to involve a communications agency that can produce a different name for lifelong learning."
"There are so many experts here that there is no need for recourse to an external office."
"I am sure one of us will be able to come up with the right solution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, first of all, to thank the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, and particularly its rapporteur, for its commitment and also for the constructive criticism that has been made."
"This report confirms, if confirmation were needed, the importance that Parliament attaches to our action in the field of lifelong learning."
"I am also pleased to note that Parliament supports the broad principles that the Commission has emphasised in its communication, in particular with regard to the broad objectives that lifelong learning seeks to achieve and the need for every citizen, and I stress, every citizen, to have access to education and to lifelong learning."
"We know that, today, we are far from achieving the target: only 8% of European adults have access to lifelong learning and almost two out of ten young people leave the educational system without any qualifications."
"This is an unsustainable situation common to all our Member States."
"On this matter, I am relieved to note that most of the ministers are addressing this problem, which is already a scandal, before the new school year starts."
"What is needed, therefore, to resolve these two problems - education and lifelong learning - is the mobilisation of all the actors involved and of the financial resources needed."
"Mr President, Parliament addresses a number of points in its report."
"I should like to highlight three of them: basic skills, investment and the European area of education and lifelong learning."
"With regard to basic skills, our objective is clear: every European citizen must have these skills in order to be able to learn, work and live in the knowledge-based society."
"I say 'live' because personal development and the capacity to play a role in our society, in our democracies are also important."
"I am thinking, in particular, of the most disadvantaged, who also have to learn to read, write and count."
"We know, however, that illiteracy is still a major problem and that the main obstacle to social integration, as Mrs Hermange's report also emphasised, is this lack of basic knowledge."
"I shall also add to this basic knowledge the 'digital divide' between those who have access to the new technologies and those who do not."
"Lastly, I should like, if I may, to return to one of my favourite themes: the failure to acquire foreign language skills and the lack of personal and social skills."
"The Member States and the Commission are currently working on the issue of basic skills by implementing the work programme on objectives for education and training systems."
"Together, we have identified the basic skills needed and there will be an exchange of best practices in order to see, together, what works, what does not work, what can done by certain people and what must be worked on by everyone."
"The conclusions of this work will be included in the interim report which the Education Council and the Commission present at the European Council in spring 2004."
"Mr Chairman of the Committee on Culture, as promised, your committee will be involved in this."
"My second point is funding."
"This is a delicate matter, as you know, for which the Member States are largely responsible."
"If we want to create a genuine system of lifelong learning, if we want to translate our political ambitions into practical actions, we, not only the Member States but also the social partners, will clearly have to spend more."
"It is indeed true, Mrs Van Brempt, that where lifelong learning is concerned, we are leaving the framework of formal education and entering that of informal education, and, as a result, are working with partners which are not traditionally academic."
"We must, therefore, start by defining national strategies."
"In this field, the Member States have made some progress, especially those which lagged the furthest behind."
"What needs to be done now is to improve the coherence of the strategies - a coherence which is, most of the time, I am bound to say, lacking - and to translate these strategies into practical actions."
"This is where we must develop the partnerships that you underline in your report."
"Because lifelong learning is a shared responsibility, national strategies must be the result of agreements at all levels, including at the local level, and between all operators, in particular the social partners."
"Unfortunately, attempts to achieve this are very inconsistent and not nearly forceful enough."
"My third point concerns the European area."
"Although responsibility for implementing these policies falls primarily to the Member States, the Community itself has a role to play in creating a European area of education and lifelong learning."
"An area in which citizens, whoever they are and whatever country they come from, can transfer their skills and their qualifications from one country to another, for the purpose of studying, training, working, getting involved or just living."
"We now know, and we have already discussed this on several occasions, that a number of obstacles to the creation of such an area exist, mainly with regard to the recognition of qualifications."
"A great deal of progress has been made in this field, however, and rest assured, ladies and gentlemen, that the Commission is working on this, to ensure that we achieve the recognition of qualifications and that, especially in the field of vocational training, we are able to open up new perspectives and use new common working methods."
"A political initiative has been taken to strengthen cooperation between Member States in the field of vocational training."
"This is generally known as the Bruges process, because it is in the beautiful city of Bruges that national ministers and the Commission decided to adopt this approach."
"Various projects are currently underway, such as that established by the former French Minister, Mr Mélenchon, which is a model of its kind."
"New initiatives are, therefore, being taken, progress is being made, and I must say that, despite all the difficulties that exist, governments are moving in the direction described because they have understood the absolute need for such measures."
"At the next Education Council, which is due to take place in November, a resolution must be adopted."
"This will also be debated by the governments of the 30 countries that will be meeting at the end of the year."
"We will, therefore, be extending the issue of education and lifelong learning to encompass our future partners in the European Union."
"As far as my own involvement is concerned, I shall say this: my staff are in the process of implementing the communication."
"A European website on the various options for learning will be up and running before the end of the year."
"In forthcoming weeks we shall be launching other actions such as the creation of European learning region networks and the establishment of a database on best practices."
"These will all be very practical measures because we have studied the problems and we understand them."
"We know what we need to do, so let us make a start!"
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we are all agreed that lifelong learning is an important political tool and I would like to thank Mrs Van Brempt for not pulling her punches."
"Despite all our agreements, despite the fact that we all recognise that training and lifelong learning must be linked to the world of work if they are to yield any returns, we have a problem and there is a vacuum."
"Training and lifelong learning are based on education, which has huge problems of its own, and training cannot replace a poor education."
"We have huge inequalities between the Member States in the field of education, as the report acknowledges, and consequently we also have huge vacuums and huge problems in lifelong training."
"One typical example is that we have yet to reach an agreement on what constitute basic skills in education."
"Whenever ?ECD statistics are published on the different countries, there is an outcry and there are some countries which find the criteria used hard to accept."
"Likewise, education systems need to be changed and improved."
"But what are we, the European Union, doing about it?"
"We try to coordinate but do little else."
"That, I think, is a huge political shortcoming."
"What are the Member States doing about their lifelong learning strategy?"
"At least one in two Member States has no specific strategy and a strategy is vital if we are to have economic development, if we are to improve industry and mobility and if we are to improve unemployment programmes."
"I think that one very important factor would be if the Member States were to set a budget."
"Similarly, lifelong learning should be able to reach the underprivileged, the unskilled, people who left school early, the unemployed and, of course, immigrants."
"Madam President, we are busy drawing up long wish lists."
"We talk about the forthcoming knowledge society and about lifelong learning, and there are no limits to what we all want."
"However, this is only a kind of policy of piracy, since the reality of education policy in the Member States is completely different."
"Priorities have to be set and expenditure on education has to be weighed up against other forms of expenditure."
"Education budgets are being cut at the moment."
"It is not, therefore, very helpful if we sit here discussing our long lists."
"Instead of drawing up long lists, we should prioritise."
"We should prioritise the most important items of expenditure."
"I agree with those who say that, if this is the case, we should prioritise the needs of the undereducated, for education exaggerates differences unless some sort of compensation is built in."
"I would point out, in particular, two aspects that I believe are important and that are perhaps not adequately stressed in the long lists."
"First of all, there is a great need for proper vocational retraining."
"It is not enough to have a little training here, a bit of additional training there and an extra course there."
"Training is needed if people are to be able to shift from jobs that are no longer required - agricultural workers, lumberjacks or fishermen, for example - to jobs in an expanding service sector."
"A transition such as this cannot be achieved after a six-week course. Instead, long training programmes are required."
"Such programmes are quite expensive, however, and it is consequently difficult to obtain political support for them, yet this is vital since we in Europe are facing major problems of structural change that will require radical job changes."
"Secondly, I should like to emphasise training organisations or training on the job."
"This is, of course, mentioned in the Commission's justification, but it should be accorded greater attention."
"Since we know that it will be difficult to get funding for in-school training, it is extremely important that we try to create the kinds of organisations and jobs that provide scope for continuous training, education and learning as part of the labour process."
"It is difficult to send people on courses, but it is perhaps easier, cheaper and better to make sure that people can learn on the job."
"We can take the new IT sector as an example."
"All the small IT firms that sprang up in the 1990s could afford to let people experiment and learn in the workplace, and the IT sector was very successful."
"That is something we can learn from ."
"Madam President, Commissioner, there can be no doubt that, with the new order created by globalisation and the leaps and bounds being made in science and technology, the constant renewal of knowledge through lifelong learning is vital if we are to make the best possible use of human resources."
"This being so, we urgently need a European policy to give momentum to this sector and, from this point of view, I congratulate you on your initiatives, Commissioner, and I congratulate our rapporteur on her excellent report."
"As the draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, I should like to point out that the only way of achieving a European policy on lifelong learning is to take serious account of the new order created by the mass, dynamic entry of women on to the job market."
"Women are currently the most dynamic force behind development because, as you know, two-thirds of the new jobs which it is estimated will be created over the next ten years will be filled by women."
"We therefore need to take serious account of the gender dimension when we take policy decisions and apply measures which will abolish direct and indirect discrimination against women, given that such discrimination always comes at the expense of the viable development and competitiveness of the economy."
"An active lifelong learning policy needs to be designed with women's needs in mind, which means involving women, improving their skills, widening their professional choices, removing glass ceilings, ensuring there is a balance between men and women in the sciences and new technologies and abolishing gender-based divisions of the job market."
"You spoke, Commissioner, of the digital divide."
"This digital divide applies mainly to women."
"We also need to give special attention to the most vulnerable groups of women, such as immigrants, women in rural areas and elderly women."
"Last but not least, the gender mainstreaming policy and the need to reconcile family life and work must become part of the overall policy to promote lifelong learning."
"Mr President, I believe that lifelong learning has very often been defined as a priority objective."
"However, I feel that the effort being made by Europe is not really being reflected in the results."
"It is very difficult to establish these principles, to establish a system of quality evaluation, and to develop the right types of teaching so that lifelong learning can genuinely become a common basis throughout people's lives."
"In this regard, I believe that the measures we should adopt should include an increase in monitoring and inspection and the clarification of quality indicators, and they should be of differing types, and, above all, it seems to me extremely important to ensure that training be established throughout the territory."
"This type of training is usually available in the big cities."
"Rural areas and the most distant extremes of the regions, on the other hand, are not usually so well served."
"I believe that, from now on, we must implement a policy of proximity, of accessibility, and that really is sustainable development: bringing education closer to people and making it more flexible."
"Furthermore, there are huge numbers of complaints from companies that they cannot find qualified staff, and we have a very high level of unemployment given the economic situation supporting it too."
"In this respect, I believe that we must implement these expansion policies throughout the territory and prevent education causing people to be uprooted from their regions, as many women are because they have to move away to be educated."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since the Lisbon Summit, education and training have become a more and more important part of EU strategy."
"Commissioner Reding has appropriately described the situation regarding education and training as undergoing a quiet revolution."
"This description is also true in a negative sense."
"The European Parliament and its Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport have barely played any part in setting targets for education and training."
"Furthermore, the open coordination method that has been adopted in the education sector has caused the main focus of the debate to move away from the forum of democratically elected bodies to one made up of civil servants."
"Now that Kathleen Van Brempt has produced her excellent report, we have a good opportunity to talk about lifelong learning here in plenary."
"An economy built on people's knowledge and skills will be more successful the more widely human resources are used."
"Ensuring that all our citizens keep up with developments as best they can is not only an ethically sustainable policy but also one that is wise and practical."
"Lifelong learning is becoming increasingly important with regard to citizens' participation, boosting employment and regeneration of the workforce."
"It would help employment and increase motivation if there were a clearer link between lifelong learning and qualifications based on the needs of industry."
"Nevertheless, I want to stress the importance of the point made in the Committee on Culture's report that lifelong learning is not merely a social necessity."
"It must also be a social right for everyone, irrespective of their age, sex or social background."
"Equality of education is, for many reasons, very difficult to bring about."
"However, it is precisely education that is the path to equality."
"For that reason I wish to emphasise the need for setting special targets so that the provision of lifelong learning can be made to include people who failed to finish their secondary education, are untrained, have special needs and learning difficulties, or who are socially underprivileged."
"We should remember that a quality secondary education creates a basis for lifelong learning."
"It is not very realistic, for example, to consider demanding IT skills if a person's literacy and numeracy skills are inadequate."
"Although it is the responsibility of Member States to organise education, we need practical European targets and measures."
"The Commission communication is a step in the right direction."
"We also have to try to achieve consensus on what the basic skills mentioned at Lisbon - knowledge of information and communication technologies, foreign languages, science, entrepreneurship and social skills - actually consist of."
"It is easier to achieve aims if we know what we are aiming at."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 1996 was the European Year of Lifelong Learning."
"In 2002, there are still more than a million people in the Netherlands who are functionally illiterate, and I think that the situation is not much better in other Member States."
"It is therefore for a good reason that the European Union - my congratulations to Mrs Reding, incidentally - is giving this topic so much attention."
"It might be an idea, after the Johannesburg Summit, to organise a world summit in Brussels on functional illiteracy."
"Following the memorandum, and having defined the strategy and priorities, we are now about to make the European area for lifelong learning a reality."
"This receives my warm support."
"My group has always endorsed the rapporteur's previous reports and, I should like to thank her now for her sound report."
"I still have two minor observations to make."
"Permanent education is a sweeping term and can range from teaching correct manners to very technical further training courses, from infant education to university courses."
"Anyone can become involved - all governments, all public establishments."
"Nevertheless, I should like to drive home the message that we should not lose sight of the quality of education."
"We may need to set up a quality evaluation programme for this purpose, as is done in regular education."
"I therefore endorse the request to exchange information, experiences and best practices at European level and to set up and maintain a European database."
"This will obviously require the support of the European Commission as a matter of vital necessity."
"Moreover, in this way, it is possible to reach mutual recognition with regard to credits, certificates and qualifications obtained, which is crucial to mobility."
"I should also like to draw the attention to the importance of the citizens' own responsibility for their education."
"It is up to them to decide whether they want to work on it and thus enhance their chances within the labour market."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having spoken yesterday evening on European citizenship, I am pleased to be able to speak this morning, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the matter of the European area of education and learning."
"The link is clear, and was, furthermore, emphasised by the Feira European Council, where it was stated that 'education and lifelong learning are an essential policy for the development of citizenship'."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as everyone has said, education and learning must be accessible to everyone so that everyone has the same opportunities to find their place in society."
"As we know, however, we are a long way from achieving this objective."
"Inequalities become clear as soon as children enter the educational system, and are responsible for many academic failures, before breeding social exclusion in later life."
"This is a downward spiral and hence the vital importance of adopting a coordinated strategy at European level which provides access for every European citizen to a decent and sufficient minimum standard of education and of learning."
"The Commission communication attempts to respond to this ambitious project."
"Several proposals are, furthermore, of the greatest interest, even if they would benefit from being clarified and complemented by the provisions contained in Mrs Van Brempt's report, on which we are about to vote."
"We welcome the fact that the Commission is advocating the right of every citizen, including those who have left school early, to acquire basic skills via free compensatory learning in later life."
"We also support the idea that the Commission should, working closely with the Member States, put in place a European framework to define the basic skills that all pupils have to have acquired."
"With regard to training, I support the request for the Commission to implement clear strategies with adequate funding for the chapter concerning lifelong learning."
"Finally, in order to create a European area of education, equal opportunities in the field of education and training must be guaranteed for everyone, in particular for women, through close cooperation between all the social actors concerned."
"Furthermore, the integration programmes designed for immigrants should exist even for pre-school pupils."
"I shall finish by very warmly congratulating Mrs Van Brempt on her work and her report and by pointing out that education and lifelong learning are not only a social necessity but a major social right too."
"Mr President, we have come to depend in the 21st century on what we call a knowledge based economy and the information society."
"However, not everyone has access to this knowledge base."
"The proposals on lifelong learning are an emerging response to this deficit, but only an emerging one."
"It is not simply a matter of training for particular job skills, although people with a low educational base face a higher risk of unemployment and such inequalities of education need to be particularly targeted in the case of both women and men."
"Training cannot replace a poor education and there is considerable risk that those with a strong education base will benefit further from lifelong learning and those without it will become even further marginalised."
"This should be of particular concern."
"The proposals are encouraging, but it is far from clear how they will be implemented and funded."
"Here, the rapporteur has done an excellent job in firming up rather vague proposals."
"This is not the fault of the Commissioner, whose commitment is not in doubt, but is due to the difficulties in coordinating education across the Member States when there is no clear European responsibility."
"Mr President, I hope to be 60 next year, an age at which I used to think that one could quietly wait for retirement, but nothing could be further from the truth."
"In fact, I am constantly having to learn about new things in order to be able to continue to do my job."
"What is more, I am also having to remain abreast of the latest developments in order to be able to communicate by e-mail with my children and grandchildren."
"I still learn something new every day using my computer."
"Lifelong learning is therefore not a policy model; it is a fact."
"I subscribe to the need for lifelong learning."
"Accordingly, I consider it necessary for the government to adopt a proactive stance in order to enable the public to acquire new knowledge continuously."
"The current policy in many Member States leaves something to be desired in this respect."
"The measures are aimed at employers, local councils and benefit agencies, but not at motivating the individual citizen."
"The best approach is one whereby the government pays for the education that a person receives before entering the labour market."
"Thereafter, employees should be responsible for their own development."
"In this context, the government and employers need to ensure that the right preconditions and financial support are in place."
"Within Europe, we will then be able to establish these preconditions together in order to guarantee the public - even those reaching retirement age - ongoing participation in the labour process."
"Madam President, I should like, first of all, to thank the Commission for having proposed a clearly defined strategy in the field of lifelong learning, as well as the rapporteur, Mrs Van Brempt."
"We had great expectations for this communication because we all knew that the Member States had made almost no progress in the field since the Lisbon Council."
"If we genuinely wish to create a Europe of knowledge by encouraging equal opportunities, it is crucial to offer every citizen of the Union equal access to education and to lifelong learning."
"With a view to the translation of this strategy into practical action, I shall focus on a number of points."
"First of all, we must make efforts in the area of the recognition and transferability of learning and qualifications by making use of already existing networks or by creating new ones."
"Secondly, access to lifelong learning must be provided for all employees and for jobseekers."
"It therefore falls to the Commission to promote all Member State initiatives in this area and, wherever possible, to propose specific programmes designed, for example, for jobseekers or for young people without qualifications."
"Thirdly, it is crucial to agree on a target for annual expenditure in the field of education and lifelong learning and to provide fiscal or other incentives to encourage investment by employers and individual citizens."
"Finally, I wish to focus on the European dimension of education and training, which requires mastery of a second language."
"All the institutions and the Member States must pursue their efforts in this field so that there is a proper follow-up to the European Year of Languages."
"The European area of education and lifelong learning is a huge workshop and we must establish it without delay to enable all of our fellow citizens to benefit more from this right to learn."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, creating an area of lifelong learning means taking active steps to guarantee equality of opportunity for all population groups."
"The European Union cannot realistically achieve that alone, considering that 1% of the total budget is invested in culture and education."
"Something would need to change there too."
"What is more, there is often a narrow-minded anxiety in the Member States, in Germany's Länder for example, as regards cultural sovereignty. They feel that their cultural sovereignty is being threatened when the EU makes pronouncements about education policy."
"The results of the Pisa Study should have opened people's eyes."
"Finland has achieved excellent results in practising lifelong learning, beating Germany with its achievement principle in the first phase of education, which often blocks people's path to further education."
"So we can learn from each other."
"We should draw up training plans for new developments relating to the electronic revolution, in industry as well."
"We should extend education centres."
"The rapporteur has proposed individual learning accounts."
"The key issues here are exchanges of information and experience."
"We need to have recognised, guaranteed systems for mutual recognition of final examinations."
"That needs to be developed."
"We need to gear what is on offer towards specific groups, for example mothers returning to work, for single parents who need childcare arrangements, for migrant workers, and for people in rural areas."
"The Commission and the Member States should focus on this in a coordinated way, and particularly careful attention needs to be paid to the gender mainstreaming approach for lifelong learning."
"We also need to take advantage of all possible instruments, such as loans from the EIB, in order to extend our educational systems so as to create a modern and efficient educational system."
"We need to involve the informal sector and accelerate the political process of adult education, we need a new learning culture to secure sustainable development of the most precious resource at our disposal - people and their minds."
"Madam President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this excellent report."
"I do, however, have a few comments to make."
"We are certainly following the approach called for at Feira, but I have heard some speakers, including a colleague from my group, mention illiteracy."
"I would like to draw the attention of the House to this specific point: there is a disturbing degree of returning illiteracy affecting a large part of our European population as regards new technologies and new languages."
"The Commissioner mentioned 'living' in the knowledge-based society."
"Of course, living means interacting, but living also and above all means communicating, for, nowadays, it is those who communicate who count in society."
"In order to communicate, a person needs both knowledge and the ability to communicate, which means being in possession of the tools of communication - languages."
"This is the area where we have to make progress. This is what we must concentrate on."
"One consideration is training and another is teaching."
"If we want high-quality teaching, we must take steps to establish a common basic curriculum and review all the European education systems."
"As regards training, then, the individual States must strengthen these national agreements on training, working together with local communities, businesses, firms and all those who invest in the training of the young and not so young."
"I certainly support lifelong training, but I feel that if specific preparation, specific training in learning skills is not provided at the appropriate age, namely during school years, we will have even less chance of success with adults who are no longer open to learning."
"There therefore needs to be a whole strategy for strengthening primary and secondary education, and we can introduce lifelong learning measures after that."
"I would like to end with the comment that our countries spend less than 5% of GDP on teaching and training."
"It may well be that the Commission needs to take action and prepare the ground for a political and cultural debate at European level, because the knowledge-based Europe, the Europe of culture, the Europe of values, can only become reality if we invest more and differently in training ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if you think that education is too expensive, 'try ignorance!' as Abraham Lincoln said, and this is why I welcome the report by Mrs Van Brempt and the truth and relevance of the ideas she has just put forward."
"As she has illustrated so well, in our societies, equal opportunities, personal development and the ability to take charge throughout one's life are dependent upon better access to education and training."
"This report has the merit of reminding us of the essential issues in lifelong learning."
"It gives a precise definition of the vulnerable social groups that must have access to this process, namely the illiterate, immigrants, the handicapped, the unemployed and women finishing maternity leave."
"I wish now to pay tribute to the fine work done by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities."
"Furthermore, this report reflects our societies, which are undergoing enormous changes and in which everyone can change career several times in their lifetime."
"If this report is rapidly implemented, it will be an opportunity for all men and women who think that progress in society is definitively blocked for them."
"Certain shortcomings must, nevertheless, be mentioned."
"Mrs Karamanou has highlighted the disparities between men and women in access to training, but there are genuine shortcomings where the illiterate, immigrants, the handicapped and the long-term unemployed are concerned."
"The most crucial issue for me, ladies and gentlemen, is funding, because, although the Commission has currently earmarked more than EUR 500 million and will set aside an equivalent sum in 2006, and although the European Investment Bank intends to increase the budget earmarked for this area, the Member States, on the other hand, seem not to want to make any great effort on this matter."
"Furthermore, it would be inappropriate, on such an important matter, to indulge in penny-pinching or, for example, to restructure already existing programmes, such as Leonardo and Socrates."
"Finally Commissioner, I am categorically opposed, as I hope you are, to the idea that the price for even a tiny part of this education should be met by those who are precisely in greatest need of it."
"Let us bear in mind the phrase by Victor Hugo: 'Every school that is opened closes one more prison'."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us bear in mind that it is the most vulnerable people who must be concerned by lifelong learning."
"This gives enormous hope to them all, men and women, and perhaps a last chance too."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I would first like to comment on Mrs Van Brempt's proposal as rapporteur to replace the phrase 'lifelong learning'."
"It really does sound like a prison sentence and I would like to suggest an alternative straight away: 'learning for life'."
"It implies the same thing, but it does not sound negative, or like a prison sentence."
"Perhaps we could use that in future."
"The report we have before us highlights many possibilities and this debate has also demonstrated how much we can and should do."
"I would also like to touch again on a few points that are not clear to me, and, in particular, the question of recognising formal qualifications."
"The Commission talks in one place about a voluntary minimum quality standard and in another place about a modular system that needs to be worked out by 2003 and which would allow people to combine different educational and vocational training establishments."
"The term 'voluntary' gives rise to a degree of uncertainty here: we need to clearly express what we want and what would result in mutual recognition."
"We have already talked a great deal here about equality of opportunities, and about lifelong learning or learning for life."
"The fact that according to a Eurostat survey 16% of university graduates take advantage of further vocational training compared with only 2% of people with the lowest educational qualifications tells us that access to education should not create inequalities but reduce them."
"We in this House need to help to overcome these barriers."
"Social exclusion and marginalisation need to be reduced by means of a new European project such as lifelong learning."
"The Lisbon Council set the target of making the EU the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economic area in the world."
"However, if we are to achieve this objective, everyone needs to be involved right from the start."
"Access to education and training should no longer be dependent on people's level of education, gender and nationality and on infrastructural issues."
"Madam President, I know that we are pressed for time and that I should state my position on all the very practical proposals made by the honourable Members."
"I cannot do this, but we have taken note of everything you have said and these are very practical and very useful proposals."
"I shall simply give a brief explanation of the actions that are planned for the next few months."
"In November, the Commission will present a communication on indicators and benchmarks, which will serve to measure the progress made in the priority areas."
"And so you will have this communication, which will enable a real evaluation to be made of the practical measures that are adopted."
"Furthermore, with regard to basic skills, seven working groups are in the process, in collaboration with the Member States, of reaching agreement on the common criteria necessary to apply the benchmarks correctly and to evaluate the measures that have been adopted."
"This task is almost over now and things will therefore, move ahead rapidly."
"Furthermore, in the field of vocational training, the situation will develop very quickly."
"Clearly, to achieve progress in the field, the social partners will need to be directly involved."
"I wish to add that the social partners and the Member States have given a commitment to establish common principles in the field of non-formal training, a task that we are striving to see through."
"I should also like to state that I am as shocked as anyone at the frightening number of people in our societies who can neither read nor write."
"I have understood your message: you would like us jointly to undertake a major action to combat illiteracy."
"Together with my staff, I shall study this proposal and perhaps the Commission and Parliament could then adopt a joint initiative on this matter."
"Thank you, Commissioner Reding."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0183/2002) by Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on Universities and higher education in the European learning area [2001/2174(INI)]."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport for having accepted this proposal to carry out a study on universities and higher education in the European area of knowledge."
"I must say that many ideas from my fellow Members of Parliament are taken up here, and I have listened extensively to the views of the European Students' Association and the European Universities' Association, as well as many other sectors and that, furthermore, a hearing has taken place."
"However, before discussing the main issue, I would like to say that there are no amendments and that simply, in order to aid the reading of the text, I would ask the secretary for the plenary session to introduce two subtitles: 'European Area of Higher Education ', before item 1 and 'Bologna Process ', before item 5."
"Why is it necessary to produce this report?"
"There is a certain contradiction in Europe."
"For more than 1 500 years the universities have been an axis upon which European culture has been built."
"Furthermore, they have been the places where dialogue has been created, where scientific thought has been developed and where young people have been educated."
"But, nevertheless, curiously, we are seeing a process of distancing - which many call 'endogamy' - of universities from the system and the European Union, and the Commission itself and European policies are not taking sufficient account of the role the universities could play as consultants, institutions and conveyors in relation to the Community acquis."
"As well as being highly professional and independent, these institutions are established throughout the Union's territory and should be key references for civil society, as places for dialogue and debate and as support for the MEDA programmes and the programmes of the candidate countries, as well as centres for training in many respects, even more than they are at the moment."
"We are not therefore just addressing the Committee on Culture, which we know has created specific programmes on the universities, but the whole of the European Commission."
"We are therefore discussing the first European document on this issue."
"By this I mean that, on the one hand, we invite the universities to come closer to Europe, to observe Europe and take an interest in European issues and, on the other, we invite the Commission to extend its relationship with them in all respects."
"What are we asking for in the report?"
"It is necessary to reinforce the creation of a European area of education and, to this end, the universities must be protagonists."
"Furthermore, we need them to take on the scientific and conceptual challenge facing Europe and its regions and nations."
"The universities must also be guardians and must be committed to quality and be the main protagonists and conveyors of the culture of hard work and open and transparent evaluation."
"Evaluation, transparency and quality should be the responsible reaction of these bodies which are generally funded with public money and in which society trusts to educate our future generations."
"We support the Bologna process, starting with the universities themselves and with the Council, with all that it implies: mobility, recognition of qualifications, the creation of networks, etc.; but it is understood that, in order to achieve this convergence, both the recognition of qualifications and the increase in mobility amongst teachers, students and researchers, it is necessary to make admissions procedures more flexible and make the Bologna process itself more open, as well as the architecture of qualifications."
"In that way people will feel more comfortable and more at ease and it will be easier to take account of the diversity of problems posed by the different types of qualifications and research, as well as the varying characteristics of practical training."
"The production of a Green Paper is also requested, because it is surprising how little we know about the situation of the universities."
"The indicators - the few available - in many cases show very negative figures; the universities are going through a great crisis: they have made a great effort to bring education closer to everybody, and they have often lost out in terms of competitiveness."
"They must be helped."
"We must recognise the research profession, promote research and create incentives so that students, when young, are initiated into these aspects; it is necessary to reward merit, mobility and results, and it is essential that the universities increase their role as centres for life-long learning."
"They must be centres for the spreading of technology and innovations, as well for the updating of knowledge."
"It is also suggested that the presence of universities in the media be increased as well as the promotion of distance-learning universities - they have asked us for this - and at the same time that a 'centre for universities' be created, as a centre for the universities to meet so that their relations are not maintained via the Internet and at a cool distance, but that there may be a place in Europe for debate on universities."
"Madam President, I have taken note of the proposals of the rapporteur, Mrs Van Brempt, and of the Committee on Culture with very great interest."
"It is true that if we want to create this Europe of knowledge that we have been anxiously hoping for since Lisbon, we must integrate universities in a very real way."
"This is the reason why my colleague responsible for research, Mr Busquin, and I are preparing a communication on the role of the universities in the Europe of knowledge, a role which cuts across research, education and innovation."
"With this communication, the Commission will take account of the ideas expressed in the present report, such as, for example, those concerning, doctoral studies."
"These studies must, in fact, be consolidated and 'europeanised'."
"I share the rapporteur's point of view on this matter."
"We shall discuss the Bologna process, next year in September, at the major conference in Berlin."
"Until then, we shall have practical work to do."
"In fact, on 17 July, the Commission adopted the Erasmus World project, which will authorise the creation of links between our universities, at masters' degree level."
"We will thereby create cross-border university families, which will offer Europeans masters degrees and will be open to students and lecturers from other continents."
"This proposal has been submitted to Parliament and to the Council, under the codecision procedure."
"We are thereby affirming our will to innovate and to strengthen our universities so that they once again become the centres of excellence that they have the potential to be and so that they contribute to making a reality the Europe of knowledge, which still exists in theory only."
"Let us not forget that universities are themselves a collection of actors and institutions - schools, professional training, businesses, citizens - for whom the Commission's policy is intended."
"We are relying on Parliament's support to achieve a Europe of knowledge which comprises all the various forces in intellectual society."
"Adopting the resolution, taking account of this global perspective, will mark a step in this direction."
"I thank you for the support that you have given to the action that we are in the process of undertaking."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, our colleague, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, because I believe she is the most suitable person to be rapporteur for this report on universities and higher education, and she has demonstrated her great experience in this field."
"I would like to focus on sport."
"In Europe it is very difficult to combine studies with sport and this means that our young people eventually have to choose between the two."
"We parents naturally try to have an influence on this choice and we encourage them to chose studies instead of sport, since they seem to us to offer more security."
"In other countries, such as the United States, sport and university studies are entirely compatible."
"And not only are they compatible, but a North American student actually has access to many more universities and opportunities thanks to sport than they would without it."
"The European Union must promote sport in universities, both inside and outside the university itself."
"We must promote the participation of university teams in competitions between universities (regional, national, international, etc.) and perhaps - and why not? - we could apply part of the Erasmus programme, which is having great success, to providing mobility for university sports teams, as enjoyed by other students."
"We must not forget that young people who divide their time between studies and sport are not left with much energy and time to indulge in other activities which we would all consider less advisable."
"Madam President, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines' excellent report is a milestone, for this is the first report tabled before Parliament to be so comprehensive and well-structured."
"There has been talk, particularly in recent years, following Lisbon, of the need to develop a knowledge-based Europe, but this has in many respects thus far remained just a good intention."
"Those like myself who have experienced the effects of the Erasmus and Socrates programmes in universities know, despite the frequently limited scale of the programmes caused by lack of funding, how much impact they have had both in terms of widening the horizons of students and lecturers and in terms of creating extensive European awareness among the citizens, starting with the families of those who have benefited from the programmes."
"Our task is now to extend the Union's attention and action to a large number of other aspects of higher education, most importantly encouraging the dissemination of the good practices of some countries in all the other countries of the Union, promoting the right of all the citizens to study irrespective of their financial situation, and this can be achieved by expanding public higher education, which is the only form of education which attracts investments that are not subject to the mindset of quick profits and which is therefore able to guarantee all the citizens access to higher education, which is necessary for the renewal of the ruling classes."
"We must not disregard the fact that the supremacy of public universities in some countries of the Union is currently under threat from alarming privatisation trends, which are in danger of irreparably reducing the freedom of study and diminishing the quality of research and teaching, placing greater emphasis on income than on merit and ability."
"The Gutiérrez-Cortines report takes this situation into account and contains a number of important proposals."
"I would like, inter alia, to point out that it calls upon the Commission to set up a 'European University House' providing the academic world - including students, lecturers and the various agencies operating in the sector - with an autonomous way of asserting their needs and making proposals."
"This would be an interesting example of the application of the principle of subsidiarity to a sector of European culture which is crucial to all our work."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to thank Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines warmly for the effort she has made to write this own-initiative report."
"I could not agree more that knowledge is the key to competitiveness and economic and social development in Europe, but I certainly do not see eye to eye on all her conclusions."
"Universities play a vital role when it comes to turning Europe into the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy."
"It is therefore very important for them to maintain mutual contact and exchange information and experiences."
"The pre-condition is, however, that they should offer high-quality education in an attempt to create centres of excellence within the academic world."
"I completely share Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines' view that the mobility of students, lecturers and researchers could be much improved."
"Administratively, many stumbling blocks could be removed."
"However, I cannot see the good in the Commission and Member States having to promote the establishment of a European University Seat."
"Accordingly, it is not clear to me what role a representation of the Member States and of Parliament would be playing in this."
"Another point, the validity of which passes me by, is the setting up of a separate European cultural university."
"Language and literature, philosophy and communication are already being taught at existing universities, while special academies cater for the arts."
"The report points at the need for an intercultural dialogue with the world's other regions."
"This is all well and good, but it does suggest that the existing universities are completely introspective and maintain no contact with the rest of the world, and this is simply no longer the case."
"I therefore fear, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, that my group, despite the fact that we agree on certain aspects of the report, will be abstaining from the vote, since it cannot reconcile itself with the two above-mentioned points."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, universities in Greece are fast losing their academic credentials."
"Their basic functions are being privatised, they are increasingly controlled by business interests and they are forced to operate as enterprises subject to competition and the laws of the market in general."
"As a result, the standard of education provided is falling across the board."
"The European Union is the main driving force in this direction and the report is right behind it."
"The Communist Party of Greece is radically opposed to the Bologna process, to private universities, to interventions via the Green Paper, to the so-called European area of higher education and, of course, to the creation of a seat of European universities, all of which eradicate independence and the free circulation of ideas."
"We are fighting for state universities and state universities alone, subject to academic, not business control, which will meet grass-roots and social needs."
"We support cooperation between universities with due respect for the academic order."
"Ladies and gentlemen, universities are not grocery stores."
"If we let them become so, we shall dash any hopes which young people have of acquiring a rounded education and any hope which society has of a better future."
"Madam President, I very much welcome this initiative."
"It was a very necessary initiative and I commend it."
"Universities are the cornerstone of our societies, so encouraging universities, students and teachers to forge closer links and share experiences will play a crucial role in enriching our societies."
"It will also increase European competitiveness, because universities play an important role now in the business sector."
"Many higher education establishments are already suffering a funding crisis and European Union higher education legislation will not be brought closer without proper financial commitment."
"I urge the Commission, the Council and Parliament to ensure this happens, because it is vital that this initiative is properly funded."
"However, I would have liked to see more emphasis on the teaching of modern foreign languages, since linguistic barriers are one of the main impediments to mobility."
"In my own country, the UK, the compulsory teaching of foreign languages is being cut back."
"Providing an optional language is very important."
"I commend this report to the House and fully support it."
"Madam President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines on her particularly important report, for, as she herself has stressed, before us is the first document dedicated by the European Parliament to universities as recognised institutions."
"I fully agree with Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines that the time has come for Europe not just to fund but to manage and promote a model of education without frontiers at European level, restoring research to its institutional home, the university."
"I therefore feel I must stress the importance of consolidating the European higher education area, an assuredly important goal which, although involving the individual universities of the Member States, would affect neither their autonomy nor their cultural history while providing for what will, I am sure, be high-quality teaching."
"Moreover, the movement of students, researchers and lecturers is an excellent way of bringing about exchanges of skills and of developing critical faculties, and has great social value, with a view to ensuring successful cultural integration in the future."
"I deeply believe that the establishment of a network of higher education and the results of research will not only bring reciprocal evaluation of performance but will make any monitoring process more cost-effective too."
"It is therefore becoming increasingly important for the European Union to implement a support policy through the programming of funds for university research, bearing in mind that the task of a university as an institution is not just to teach but, above all, to carry out research and experiments, thus enhancing the role of researchers who would otherwise seek more professionally rewarding activities elsewhere, specifically in the United States."
"Looking back at the funding hitherto appropriated for research by the European Union, I note that a huge amount has been dedicated to small and medium-sized enterprises, which are certainly important in the overall economies of our countries, while the sector of university research has been neglected."
"I am afraid I must point out, on the basis of this analysis, that much of the research funded was then subcontracted precisely to university researchers for its implementation."
"I realise that many resources have certainly been made available to the European Union's universities thus far - the Fifth Framework Programme, the Sixth Framework Programme, Erasmus etc. but we have a further task: to further convince those working on this document that it is time to restore to the institution of the universities their supreme role in research, acknowledging that they have performed this role for over 600 years and achieved excellent results, offering them for the benefit of the whole world without claiming property rights."
"Madam President, there is no doubt about the importance of universities and education."
"In fact, education itself is so important that Prime Minister Blair has said in the past that he only has three policies: education, education and education."
"But the high profile of education in the political arena makes universities and other institutions especially vulnerable to external pressure."
"Not for nothing do universities become one of the first targets of demagogues and dictators."
"The free thinkers and the independent spirits are soon removed."
"Democracies also have a problem here because our educational establishments rely predominantly on the state for their funding and he who pays the piper seeks to call the tune."
"As a result we have seen increasing interference in our educational establishments."
"This is also the case with the European Union."
"As more and more money destined for academia comes through the European institutions, the European piper is indeed now calling the European tune."
"As I travel around British universities speaking to students, I see a rash of ring of stars flags and EU literature."
"But more worryingly, under the Jean Monnet programme I see the orthodoxies of the European Union now being taught in political science and in European history courses. Such is the grip of EU money that dissent from the perceived wisdom is treated almost as heresy."
"Unless the correct version of political history is submitted in their course work and in their examinations students now find themselves penalised in their exam marking."
"Thus I view this report with some degree of dismay and trepidation."
"The European Union has its own key policies and they are integration, integration and yet more integration."
"That of course is why the European Union is so interested in universities and further education."
"I have no doubt that this particular report is well meant but the creation of a European learning area and the prospect of yet more taxpayers' money being filtered through the EU into universities is a recipe for even more political interference."
"The independence of our universities is far too important for them to be sacrificed on the altar of political integration."
"Madam President, Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines' report on universities and higher education in the European learning area is full of good intentions."
"We must ensure, however, that we do not fall into the trap of the dogmatic principle that is so dear to pro-European supporters: wherever there is a European area, everything must, without fail, be merged and blended together."
"As far as universities are concerned, a great deal has already been done, particularly under the Socrates and Erasmus programmes, to encourage the mobility of students and teachers, the creation of joint courses, the scheduling of intensive courses as well as helping to set up thematic networks."
"Must we, however, go further down a centralising and bureaucratic route, which would introduce unique and rigid criteria in an area where the diversity of cultures, methods and concepts is the guarantee of a culture of quality, which is not tied to an ideology?"
"Up to now, Europe has done what it has had to do in this area by providing everyone with effective tools under the programmes I mentioned earlier."
"We must now develop original forms of cooperation, whilst respecting the freedoms and desires of each EU nation."
"Business and engineering schools provide an example of the success of schools which, independently of any European legal framework, have successfully managed to integrate themselves into this new area by freely organising joint reorientation classes, exchanges, subjects and degrees."
"Is it up to Europe to decide what belongs to the private domain?"
"Is it up to Europe to concern itself with sporting activities in universities?"
"Is it up to Europe to define what must constitute teaching of artistic studies?"
"I do not think it is."
"I recognise, however, that there are two positive points in this report. Firstly, the drafting of a Green Paper, as long as it does not become an instrument for standardizing our universities, and secondly, granting post-graduate study grants on the basis of merit rather than household income."
"These two points are not enough, however, to convince us to vote in favour of this report."
"Madam President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines and focus on one aspect of her speech, namely the need to define a system of qualifications which makes them easy to understand and compare."
"I wish, in particular, to put forward once again the proposal, which I feel has a place in a debate such as this, that the legal validity of qualifications should be abolished."
"In my opinion, this is a measure which could serve to ensure that the confusion in the debate between public and private sectors - the guarantee of high quality education - is avoided."
"Indeed, as Professor Vattimo rightly said, there is a great deal of emphasis on providing a genuine guarantee of the educational experience."
"Well then, until evidence is provided to the contrary, the legal status of the administrator cannot be the guarantee of that experience."
"In the eighteenth century, the whole of Europe flocked to Prussia, not because Prussia had an efficient state capable of running universities but, above all, because there was a great teacher named Immanuel Kant."
"In fact, the validity of the learning adventure is guaranteed by the broad-mindedness of the teachers, and that is precisely the point I am trying to make."
"In all probability, abolishing the legal validity of educational qualifications is still one of the best ways of guaranteeing the full legitimacy of those establishments which know how to teach properly."
"This is so true that, although Professor Vattimo the MEP may not be able to acknowledge it for ideological reasons, Professor Vattimo the university lecturer is quite aware that studying for a degree under 'the Prof' is different from doing so under any other tutor, to the extent that the guarantee of the educational experience that he provides is not the fact that it is the state which runs the University of Turin but his love of the truth and his love of the adventure of learning."
"Madam President, the report by Mrs Gutiérrez Cortines, who is much respected and who is a colleague of mine twice over, is timely and of a high quality."
"She deserves the congratulations she has received and of course I would like to add my own."
"It is timely because its description of the university situation and its interesting proposals put an end to what has been several years of slow progress in terms of European construction in the education field, during which we have seen little more than passivity and rhetoric."
"On issues such as the unification of quality standards, the mutual and automatic recognition of qualifications, the convergence of degrees and programmes and the employment of graduates, the achievement of a European dimension, and the objectives set for 2010 in general, are almost as far away as they were on the day following the end of the Bologna process, more than three years ago now."
"The most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world is still waiting for us to be able to create a European area of higher education."
"Meanwhile, the universities' response to European employment demands is inadequate and furthermore, in a context of globalisation, the European universities are still losing the battle against the American universities, both in terms of their leadership of the knowledge-based society and in terms of their external attractiveness to third-country teachers, researchers and students."
"The fact that the European university sector, with its fifteen million students and 600 000 teachers, is the most dynamic sector in our society, and the fact that we are adopting reports such as these, are hopeful signs which lead us to believe that, despite nationalist resistance in the Council, the autocratic attitude of some of our universities and the apathy of the Commission and Parliament in this sector, we will finally achieve the stated objective of a European area of higher education which is worthy of the name."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a former dean of a faculty of the University of Lyon, where almost thirty foreign languages are taught, I found, in the report by Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines, many positive elements as well as others which, unfortunately, I feel are rather more debatable."
"To list some of the positive elements, efforts are being made to reduce administrative or other obstacles hampering exchange programmes for students and teachers, efforts are being made to encourage learning foreign languages, and not only English; efforts are also being made to create joint networks and services for circulating information, and, lastly, efforts are being made to encourage placements and even sporting competitions."
"These are all excellent initiatives."
"I must, however, express some reservations about the self-confessed goal of this report through the creation of a European area of higher education."
"The Commission's assessment of all university systems, both public-sector and privately-run, could create a new bureaucratic, supranational European layer, disregarding the subsidiarity principle which is included - almost for the sake of appearances - in the first paragraph of the report."
"The stated desire to introduce uniform criteria in the structure of qualifications, or even to harmonise all university curricula for students, will undoubtedly reduce the diversity of distinctive academic or scientific models, which can be regarded as a competitive factor and a mark of progress."
"European civilisation has created diversity in all areas."
"By first of all fully mastering a specific area of knowledge, a science, a technique, a particular experience and a national culture, we shall stay as faithful as possible to true European traditions."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by congratulating the committee on its own initiative report on universities in the European area and endorse the thoughts and issues raised by the rapporteur and the proposals which she has formulated."
"Universities have always been incubators of European culture and have played an important role in developing our societies."
"We must therefore realise that if the European Union is to achieve the new strategic development objectives set in Lisbon today, it needs more active and competitive universities to generate knowledge and innovation not as isolated institutions but as active partners in the social and economic fabric at national level, at regional level and at a cross-border level that mirrors the new configuration of Europe."
"Another dimension we need to be aware of is the role of universities in promoting European unification, by cultivating a European conscience and promoting a European nationality."
"Our universities can become the laboratories of unified Europe with their educational and teaching programmes and the cooperation and mobility of students and teachers which they can promote."
"This is the direction you are working in, Commissioner, but the Member States also need to come on board."
"There is a great deal of work to do here because we all know about the obstacles to the mutual recognition of diplomas, low mobility and the differences in academic approach to university courses in the various countries of Europe."
"What we all have to understand is that convergence and promoting educational cohesion can be achieved with all due respect for diversity and, at the same time, by introducing systems which recognise and promote the added value of the special attributes of our universities."
"This sort of policy will also bring about better conditions for the professional mobility which the European Union is striving to promote."
"So I think drafting a Green Paper would be a good initiative and I for one shall be behind you in this endeavour, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"The next item is the vote."
"Report (A5-0241/2002) by Carlos Coelho, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the third Commission report on citizenship of the Union (COM(2001) 506 - C5-0656/2001 - 2001/2279(COS))"
"(Parliament adopted the text)"
"Report (A5-0224/2002) by Kathleen Van Brempt, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the Commission communication on Making a European Area of Lifelong Learning a Reality (COM(2001) 678 - C5-0165/2002 - 2002/2073(COS))"
"(Parliament adopted the text)"
"Report (A5-0183/2002) by Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on universities and higher education in the European learning area (2001/2174(INI))"
"Before the vote:"
"It is simply a question of introducing certain titles which had been forgotten."
"After the recitals, the title, 'European Area of Education' must be introduced and, before paragraph 5, 'the Bologna process'."
"Before we proceed to the next vote I should like to give a warm welcome to Mrs Fan, President of the Hong Kong Legislative Council, who is in the distinguished visitors' gallery today."
"As you know, we follow developments in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region with great interest."
"Mrs Fan is here for a number of important meetings."
"We wish her a very enjoyable stay."
"Yi lü ping an [We wish you a safe journey home]"
"Paragraph 29 of the Coelho resolution welcomes the judgment of the Court of First Instance of 3 May 2002, which granted to Jégo-Quéré et Cie SA a direct right of appeal against a European regulation."
"It is true that this company was not 'of direct and individual concern', but if the action had not been declared admissible, the company would not have had any other means of defending itself in law, and would thus have been 'denied access to the courts'."
"We also welcome this judgment, but merely regret that it had not been passed earlier, for example when we tabled an appeal, which was obviously justified on its merits, against changing the name of the single currency."
"Unfortunately, the Commission, probably feeling under threat, immediately requested that the Jégo-Quéré ruling be overturned, and it also immediately obtained a ruling in line with its wishes during the judicial vacations ?"
"The European institutions have therefore succeeded in putting themselves in a position where they can constantly destabilise the Member States, whilst practically guarding their general regulations from individual appeals by citizens."
"This is a perversion of the current system, which protects supranational enterprises but must be improved in the future."
". The British Conservatives believe that this is an ill-timed report which tries to move the discussion forward beyond what the representatives and the people themselves want."
"We believe that it should come about as a result of one's citizenship of a Member State, and not of Europe."
"We are all, of course, 'Europeans' but most people would not recognise an actual citizenship of Europe as being superior to the citizenship of their own country."
"We want to make people more caring and interested in the communities in their own nation states rather than create an artificial right, as the rapporteur seems to be suggesting."
"The British Conservatives are opposed to the principles of the report for the reasons outlined above."
". (NL) The promotion of citizenship of the EU, the core objective of this proposal, does not do a great deal for me."
"In the former Soviet Union, attempts were made to turn the citizens of different federal republics, with different languages and cultures, into Soviet citizens."
"This was never successful."
"In Yugoslavia, attempts were made, alongside Serbs, Croats, Slovenes and Macedonians, to create new generations of real Yugoslavs who were meant to organise the country's future."
"These people are now second-class citizens."
"The creation of EU citizens who are constantly on the move between Member States in search of the most privileged jobs, leads to conflicts with their environment and to misfortune for themselves."
"A second goal of this proposal is to increase the level of participation during European elections."
"People do not vote in order to meet a ritual obligation which they do not experience as useful."
"They only want to vote if the body they need to choose has a decisive say and if there is an actual choice between conflicting alternatives."
"Asking people to vote as an expression of sympathy with a united Europe does not work."
"If we carry on like this, even fewer people will vote in the next round of elections."
"I do, of course, support the reinforcement of civil rights, including those of immigrants, and better information about the Ombudsman."
"Many fellow Members have the dreadful habit of twisting the meaning of words in order to meet the needs of the federalist cause."
"We have had the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, which some wrongly considered to be the preamble to a hypothetical Constitution."
"We have had governance, an unidentified political subject."
"Now we have European citizenship, a concept that has no meaning at all."
"Citizenship is a political, not a technocratic concept, based on a political and not bureaucratic reality, based on the roots that people put down, on belonging to a natural community."
"Citizenship is a status that is only granted to those who, by virtue of their birth or their merits, share common values."
"It also assumes the existence of a political area, the most advanced form of which is still the nation."
"Yet, where is the European nation when it lacks what Renan called a desire to live together?"
"Without language, culture and traditions shared by the peoples of the European Union, a European people is no more."
"As Joseph de Maistre would have said, no one has ever met 'a European citizen'."
"Your artificial citizenship has no substance whatsoever."
"The report therefore has no purpose."
"The report contains a large number of good, important points."
"Nevertheless, I voted against the report, since it would involve, inter alia, incorporating the third pillar into the Community framework."
"I wholeheartedly supported the Commission's proposal on European citizenship."
"Of course, it is not easy to increase the political dimension of European citizenship by decree."
"Clearly, it is essential that we strengthen measures on the ground to make citizens understand that we have provided them with considerable scope so that they can participate in the European area for citizens."
"This is the price of achieving legitimacy for the European Union."
"We must find channels of communication which will enable us to teach citizens about the challenges that they themselves must contend with in the future."
"It is a matter of regret that, amongst the requirements that have come to the fore, the EU is not creating a specific history course which would describe the various uprisings, wars and revolutions which have taken place on the continent of Europe as being often difficult periods in achieving the vision that some have held for fifty years."
". (EL) The policy on lifelong training (not learning) is a policy to replace systematic education and fundamental learning with a superficial, market-driven transfer of skills and practices with its very own sell-by date, the basic aim of which is to meet the demands of big business for pliant, flexible workers, restructure employment relations and promote 'employability'."
"It is a way of exerting ideological and psychological pressure on the workers into blaming themselves for unemployment and accepting long-term unemployment and of destroying the link between education and job prospects."
"At the same time, traditional schools are becoming a clearing house for lifelong learning by 'opening up their facilities' to 'local communities and enterprises', that is, multinationals will have a say about school curricula; this is already happening with pilot programmes being funded in Greece by the ?U."
"We are radically opposed to this policy and we are fighting for the abolition of all forms of discrimination or obstacles to equal access for all young people to a free, standard, state education until the age of 18, the sort of education which is vital for subsequent professional specialisation, an education that will help young people put their ideas in order, acquire scientific criteria against which to measure nature and society and become conscientious contributors to social progress."
"That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the Van Brempt report."
"We endorse the proposal that the Commission should draft a Green Paper on higher education in order to launch what is known as the Bologna process."
"We voted against the Van Brempt report on a European Area of Lifelong Learning because it is a good example of the unwarranted extension of European powers."
"The report is based on Article 150 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which provides for, in a vague and debatable manner, the implementation of a European vocational training policy 'while fully respecting the responsibility of the Member States'."
"Then the report attempts to extend this competency to the rest of education."
"In particular, it proposes that the Commission should develop (albeit 'acting in close collaboration with the Member States') a 'European framework of basic skills' to be acquired by all students before they leave compulsory school education."
"In such circumstances, the attempts to extend powers are never-ending."
"In addition, the European Parliament once again states that the current situation in the area of qualifications 'constitutes a serious obstacle to mobility between Member States and the emergence of a Europe-wide labour market' (recital F)."
"Yet, we had been led to understand that the European labour market was already functioning."
"In reality, it is clear that, since the aim was that of full mobility in a totally unified labour market, it is the nations themselves which will soon become the obstacle."
"Although we agree with some of the proposals put forward in the report, as well as with some of the good intentions expressed, we abstained overall."
"The proposals are not in fact based on the aspirations of the young and the less young who, it is claimed, influence many of society's needs."
"Everything is designed in accordance with what the report discreetly calls the labour market and its flexibility."
"Behind these noble sentiments, the aim is to provide industrial groups and capitalist businesses with a workforce that is trained according to their needs."
"This has nothing to do with a policy that provides all citizens with lifelong learning based on their potential and their aspirations."
"Creating a European area of lifelong learning has become a priority for the twenty-first century and we can only encourage the initiatives to achieve this."
"This is a two-fold priority: it underpins the awareness of the need for lifelong learning for all and the incorporation of this training within the framework of the European area and no longer simply of just one Member State."
"By placing the emphasis on mobility, the report highlights the importance of training people whilst taking into account various experiences and methods that are specific to each Member State."
"It is both a way of achieving self-improvement and of enhancing one's job prospects."
"Lastly, although the report does not place sufficient emphasis on apprenticeships, this is nonetheless included in the awareness of the need to improve policies on professional training at European level and it reinforces my belief in the absolute need to put in place, in the coming years, a genuine 'Erasmus for apprentices' scheme which will provide professional training through a network, which has been jointly developed and takes into account the vast experience of each nation."
"Although this report contains some positive aspects in terms of its intentions, it also makes some misguided proposals, which arise from a largely economic view of the system."
"For example, although its recommendation for a single course of initial study is to be welcomed, this course must be guaranteed not to be made excessively short on the pretext of meeting the needs for courses that will make students rapidly 'employable'."
"These courses would be cheaper but it would be students and families, once again, funding the system, with students paying once they have graduated."
"The fact is that, with regard to what is known as the Bologna process, which contains this and other proposals, on the basis of the Bologna declaration of 1999, which was reiterated and developed in Prague in 2001, a distinction must be made, on the basis of the objectives underlying the entire process, between the official line and the practices that are taking place."
"Despite the statements to the contrary, the set of measures that we have already seen, some of which are already underway, suggest an attempt to cut costs by the Member States in higher education, as is happening in Portugal."
"We therefore wish to stress our opposition to attempts to commercialise knowledge, to reduce the role of public higher education, to make structural changes to the social function of higher education and to its organisational structures and to attempts by the ruling classes to hijack the contents and objectives of education for ideological reasons."
". I welcome the initiative of Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines to draft this report, bringing together many issues surrounding third-level education in the EU in a cohesive document with solid laudable proposals."
"While education remains a national competence, it is important that the EU give whatever support possible to educators and students, particularly in areas where new and innovative courses and qualifications are needed."
"In the area of rural development, there have been very significant initiatives in my own country, Ireland, to utilise EU funding such as through Leonardo to develop courses tailored to the needs of the rural economy."
"The first course developed was a Diploma in Rural Development and Agri-Business."
"Pioneering work in adult education was carried out by Professor Jim Phelan of UCD, Dr Michael Ward of UCC, Professor Michael Cuddy of UCG and Dr Ted Fleming of Maynooth."
"They have now gone one step further and developed the first degree programme via the Internet which is a BSc in Rural Development."
"This type of programme is an inspiration to what can be done for rural areas by fully exploiting new technologies."
"The aim is life-long learning; to produce a new type of specialist graduate equipped with superior rural development, advisory and management skills."
"This report is the confirmation of the irresponsible attitude of a Parliament which is shamefully abusing its right of initiative."
"This scandalous text is attempting, with rare hypocrisy, to place universities under the exclusive tutelage of Brussels."
"Several recitals clearly show the hidden intentions of the report, namely: to turn universities into servile outposts of the Commission, transform professors into docile supporters of European technocracy, to give the Commission a right of scrutiny over the national university systems, to encourage the mass influx of professionals and experts that have been duly mandated by Brussels into our universities."
"The report is the natural corollary of the Jean Monnet Chairs, which, in France, raised the legitimate anger of a number of teachers, who have now regrouped within the Jean Bodin Observatory in order to counter the federalist offensive."
"It is the same perverse and obscurantist logic which is at work."
"The report shows utter disregard for the fundamental principles which serve to contribute to the importance of universities!"
"Scientific neutrality is swept aside by this Europe-centric ideology, the propagation of which is the task of the Brussels agencies."
"The independence of teachers is violated by the interference of supranational bodies in the way the universities work and are organised."
"You are turning universities into a Trojan Horse for European federalism."
". (NL) The lack of the right of consultation has two causes."
"One is an authoritarian state view in which citizens are seen only as obedient conscripts and taxpayers who must leave the actual decision-making to a specially selected elite who know how to do things much better than ordinary people."
"The other reason is economic interest."
"The protection against pollution, nuisance and dangers in their living environment that most people want often means that businesses are hindered in their pursuit of profits."
"This also results in an authoritarian approach in which decisions are governed by economic interests instead of being taken by everyone collectively."
"Over the last few decades these hindrances seem to have been broken through."
"There are forms of citizen consultation everywhere, and the EU also prescribes this."
"Unfortunately the results of this participation are still often twisted to mean the opposite."
"I support Mrs Korhola in her quest to put an end to the exceptions that are still being made for military interests and civil disasters."
"The military often still think that they are above civilian society and that they can impose their own ideas."
"Measures to prevent disasters can often be very drastic, like flooding polders in the Netherlands when river water levels are high."
"Such decisions must not be taken without consultation."
"The right of citizens to information and to participation has, for a long time, come up against the so-called right to secrecy, behind which the state authorities have been hiding."
"The progression of reforms to improve relations between the administration and users has made this practice an exception ."
"The divisions between 'departments' are gradually diminishing in the area of the environment as well."
"This development is, of course, welcome."
"That is why I support the Commission's proposal for a directive of 19 January 2001 seeking to transpose into Community law the second pillar of the Aarhus Convention of 25 June 1998."
"This proposal is innovative, but it is down to the Member States to give the public effective opportunities to take part in the decision-making process."
"I would, however, like to express some reservations about the amendments of the Korhola report which go further than the Aarhus Convention and which confirm the opinion of the rapporteur himself."
"The MPF delegation believes, of course, that transparency of information and public participation in the decision-making process must be encouraged and well defined."
"This should not, however, create overly complicated procedures that would go against the objectives of the proposal."
"If excessively restrictive provisions are introduced, there is a risk that the whole process of access to information and decision-making could be impeded."
"The only thing we should do is transpose into Community law the provisions - which are wholly appropriate - of the Aarhus Convention in order to encourage the effective application of this convention."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"Mr President, with respect to the floods, it could be said that, in times of trouble, you find out who your friends are."
"This old saying might illustrate the attitude of the European Union towards those affected by the floods, which have devastated Member States and candidate countries."
"By reacting swiftly, by dispatching representatives to the affected areas and by agreeing to make available financial aid, the Union has boosted its Community policy and its closeness to the people."
"The Union has proved that it can show the solidarity expected of it and which we work to achieve."
"Although we can welcome the commitment to set up an assistance fund for natural disasters in the Union, we must certainly bear in mind the causes of this unpredictable weather."
"Scientists throughout the world are all telling us that global warming is irreversibly changing the way we live and greenhouse gas emissions are only serving to make these disasters worse."
"On one side of the planet, we have to sell livestock due to a lack of water and fodder."
"Elsewhere, entire regions have been devastated since July due to thunderstorms."
"Incidentally, Mr President, let us reiterate that, in Nepal, 422 people have died and 173 people have been reported missing."
"In Russia, 50 people have lost their lives and 100 have been reported missing."
"In Mexico, torrential rain has cost 21 lives and 15 000 people have been affected."
"In Asia, 250 people have died this year."
"Millions of homes have been affected by the rising water levels."
"Unfortunately, as we know, these geographical areas do not have the opportunity that we have here to provide victims with solidarity."
"Although Members can welcome the fact that aid has been granted and emergency measures have been taken swiftly and effectively, it is not enough to call for the application of the Kyoto Protocol, we must do much more than that."
"We must integrate the environment into all our projects, into all our policies so that we can create a glimmer of hope."
"We must lead the way in trying to slow down climate change."
"The Rio Summit brought little in the way of results, so it is up to us to lead by example!"
"Mr President, although Bavaria, Saxony and Austria were also very badly hit by the floods, I have had an opportunity, as Federal Chairman of the Sudeten German Association, to mount a major relief programme for the Czech Republic. This stems not only from our traditional links with the country our families come from, but also from the fact that in situations like this we realise that as neighbours we are dependent on each other, for good or ill."
"Sometimes there are what you might call neighbour disputes, but in emergencies like this we see the value of good neighbourliness."
"Czechs were in action in Germany and in Austria, Austrians and Germans were in action in the Czech Republic, and I believe that there are two important points here. The first is that no victim of the floods should be worse off in the Czech Republic, which is a candidate country, than they would be in the existing Member States of the European Union."
"Secondly, we also need to show solidarity when it comes to prevention."
"We need to recognise that we are all in the same boat and that what is happening in central Europe today could happen tomorrow in southern Europe or northern Europe."
"Above all, we should avoid something which I heard in this House earlier - by which I mean adopting the disdainful tone we heard during the topical and urgent debate about victims of the floods in the south."
"A lot of people from the north said that is typical, special pleading for the south, and vice versa."
"We Europeans are all in the same boat, and that is the key message of this disaster."
"Like my colleagues, the Belgian Socialists, I abstained during the final vote on the resolution on the floods in Europe for two reasons."
"First of all, solidarity can have no borders."
"As Mrs Zrihen said, in the open sitting, the European Parliament is wrongly trying to compile a list of Member States whose regions have suffered torrential flooding."
"Italy had to be added, as it did not appear in the current list, and the final text does not mention, in particular, the floods in Switzerland."
"Secondly, if we want to better protect the territory of the Union against floods - and this is undoubtedly the desire of the European Parliament - we must take into account river basins, which ignore borders mapped out by history."
"It is regrettable that, in our haste, we did not include this essential clarification in the text."
". (NL) During the past few years, the Rhine, Oder, Vistula and Elbe basins have been affected by flooding one after the other."
"This is no coincidence."
"They carry rainwater and ice water from the Alps and the Carpathians to the North Sea and the Baltic."
"Rain has been on the increase due to global warming, the deforested soil is no longer able to retain the water and the river beds have become too narrow."
"The dikes along these canalised rivers have been built too close to the main flow and houses have been built in alluvial areas where flood water was previously allowed to overflow."
"This is therefore certainly not about chance but about predictable accidents."
"The reference to the need to implement the Kyoto agreements worldwide is extremely appropriate, but it is to be feared that America will remain obstructive on account of pressure from the oil companies and the motor industry until they themselves become more and more affected by desertification and flooding."
"Attention is now once more being paid to finding the money to help the victims of flooding."
"This is necessary but unsatisfactory."
"The same disasters may happen again in future years, and the likelihood of their happening again is unfortunately very great."
"Our river management will therefore have to change radically, and this is still in danger of falling by the wayside."
"The serious floods which recently devastated various countries in Central Europe clearly deserve our full attention and solidarity, especially for the families of the victims and for all those who have lost their homes and possessions."
"We are also fully aware that the consequences of this type of natural disaster, which are to a large extent due to the climate changes that we have been seeing, take on a transnational dimension and call for the support and solidarity of the European Union as single entity."
"We have not abstained, therefore, due to any disagreement with the basic reasons or proposals for immediate aid contained in the joint resolution that has been adopted. We simply have doubts about establishing a permanent financial reserve for emergency actions to respond to disasters of this type by harnessing some of the structural funds."
"Indeed, it does not seem reasonable to us that financial resources from the structural funds should be permanently mobilised for emergency actions, which are by definition unpredictable, since it is possible to find, as has in fact happened in this case, more appropriate alternatives for dealing with this type of tragedy without affecting the permanent objectives that the use of these funds is intended to achieve."
"Mr President, I would rather like to take a slightly different approach to the one I adopted during the debate on Afghanistan."
"I am afraid to say that I am very pessimistic, as I have the very clear feeling that we are heading towards a fresh crisis."
"In Afghanistan, which is a multi-ethnic state, there is an increasingly strong feeling amongst the largest national group, the Pashtuns, and whether it is justified or not I cannot say, that they are being neglected as compared with the peoples who lead the Northern Alliance, such as the Tadzhiks and the Uzbeks. This feeling is giving rise to an increasing potential for conflict, which the surviving Taliban are exploiting."
"People talk about the Taliban withdrawal area in eastern Afghanistan as if it were just a military or police problem."
"Unfortunately this is a nationality problem, since as I have said the largest group in this multi-ethnic state feels that it is being treated as second class, and that is something that could be explosively dangerous in the long run."
"That is why we need a clever strategy for Afghanistan, in order to integrate all the ethnic groups more or less uniformly, which up to now clearly has not been the case."
"Despite all the humanitarian successes and all the progress made on paper there is still a time bomb ticking away in Afghanistan."
"The main reason for our voting against this joint resolution is the approval of parts of the resolution that seek to justify war and US intervention in Afghanistan, a situation which is all the more serious because of all of the US pressure for a new war against Iraq."
"In fact, we totally disagree with resorting to war to resolve the problems of terrorism."
"As we have stated repeatedly, there are other ways of combating terrorism, such as acting to resolve its direct and indirect causes."
"By the same token, we cannot accept the calling into question of fundamental rights and freedoms or the practice of State terrorism on the pretext of combating terrorism."
"Nevertheless, we welcome - which is why we have voted in favour of this point - the approval of the request for a detailed investigation, under the auspices of the United Nations, of the allegations of massacres and war crimes, which our group has condemned on more than one occasion, specifically by inviting the film-maker Jamie Doran to show his film in the European Parliament on 12 June."
"We also support the call for greater financial aid for the economic and social reconstruction of the country and urgent humanitarian aid."
". I have voted in favour of the joint resolution even though it contains certain points with which I do not agree."
"First of all I disagree with the analysis that the intervention in Afghanistan was necessary - on the contrary!"
"Second, the UN mandate for peace enforcing should not be prolonged but changed to peacekeeping."
"But I support the joint resolution in the demand for investigation of all war crimes committed in Afghanistan and in the demand that prisoners should be treated in accordance with international conventions."
". (NL) Afghanistan is a sort of Switzerland."
"In every valley the people determine their often stubborn points-of-view and they do not appreciate outside interference."
"Over the last twenty-five years, ideologues from Russia, Saudi Arabia and now the US have wanted to try out their various experiments on Afghan society."
"This has mainly resulted in death and destruction."
"The latest intervention was not so much aimed at helping to solve the many problems that exist in Afghanistan, but to avenge the destruction of two office towers in New York a year ago."
"Whether this dreadful attack was devised from within Afghanistan has never been proven, but the American response was that the established regime there had to be punished and ousted. Just as they now also want to oust the Iraqi regime."
"In a world in which there is only one big military and economic superpower left, will the national government of another country only be legitimate from now on if it is well-disposed towards America and acts in line with American interests?"
"The resolution falls between two stools."
"On the one hand, it justifies the war and the continuing military presence."
"On the other hand, it is looking at the war crimes of the victors and the need to investigate and punish for the first time."
"The latter is new, and is a step forward compared with earlier attitudes."
"In the light of this improvement, I am voting in favour of the resolution."
"I am sorry that Mr Fatuzzo is not here today - I seem to be standing in for him."
"However, I am genuinely concerned about this issue."
"On the subject of Mrs Stenzel's report, I would like to congratulate her very warmly on it."
"I am pleased that we have adopted it today, as elections are being held in Macedonia on 15 September."
"What is at stake here is the democratic stability of this important country, to which we are now linked by an association agreement."
"This country has experienced a huge refugee problem."
"It has had two wars within its borders, many disasters, and now it is afflicted by terrorism."
"That is why it is very important for us to signal to Macedonia today that this democracy has our support, this democracy, which over the last four years - during which there have been several major disasters - has amazingly succeeded in achieving a balance between different nationalities."
"Even if quite a lot that glitters is still not gold, when you see the remarkable things the Macedonians have achieved, you have to say that they have earned our solidarity."
"One sign that we could give would be to abolish the visa requirement for Macedonia at long last."
"There was never such a requirement for Yugoslavia, there is not one for Croatia or Slovenia, and in fact Macedonia is the only associated country with a visa requirement."
"We should finally accept this small country as a genuine European partner."
"The report presented by the Commission on its strategy on Asia gives a great deal of room to pious hopes."
"It has the advantage, however, of being extremely clear on certain key issues, particularly on the desire of the EU's leading bodies to take action over any unequal liberalisation in trade and in the movement of capital, and to provide the WTO with even greater powers."
"No lessons have been learned from the 1997-1998 financial crises and from the crash in Asia, the current stock market crisis or from the crash in South America."
"Reality must fade into the background in the face of liberal dogma in the era of capitalist globalisation."
"The ASEM 4 Summit in Copenhagen will also discuss security."
"At a time when, in Europe, immigrants are being used as scapegoats for the social crisis and, in Asia, Washington is deploying its policy of a 'lasting war' in the name of combating terrorism, is once again sending forces to the Philippines and is threatening to invade Iraq, we would hope that the EU would guarantee the rights of immigrants and would oppose American interventionism."
"In the real world, however, the European Union is behaving like an economically dominant force in Asia and the United States like an aggressive force."
"This is certainly something that the European Parliament should oppose."
"There may be different situations that set Asia apart but there are general developments which affect the entire continent of Europe and Asia."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
". (NL) The crux of this report is not the greenhouse effect in newly industrialised countries, the fight against poverty, capital punishment in China or the dictatorship in Burma."
"These comments serve only as padding for the EU's stance favouring Taiwan over China."
"Taiwan has recently changed from a place of exile from the old pre-1949 Chinese regime into a country in which the majority is non-Chinese, where the old Kuo Min Tang party has lost power to movements of indigenous Taiwanese, and which is looking more and more like Europe and Japan from a political and economic point of view."
"The majority will probably now choose to become an independent state in a referendum."
"Not even so much because this has actually been the case for 53 years, but rather because they never felt much kinship with the Chinese mainland."
"The fact that the previous regime in Taiwan had for decades sought foreign backing to recapture the mainland is a problem."
"The existence of two Germanies, two Vietnams and two Yemens ultimately came to an end because one was able to swallow up the other."
"The EU Member States withdrew their recognition of Taiwan in favour of China."
"If a majority of the European Parliament now chooses to recognise two states after all, the debate about this must be conducted openly instead of being concealed."
". (NL) EU Member States caused much damage in the former Yugoslavia through their participation in the war in 1999."
"It is therefore their duty to contribute to its restoration."
"Not only in Kosovo but also in Serbia."
"This has now been proposed, and rightly so."
"In 1999 there were good grounds for suspecting that the war was not only about Kosovo."
"The deep loathing that the inhabitants of Kosovo had developed against Yugoslavia looked as if it would be misused as a crowbar with which to achieve a whole different set of objectives."
"The coercive proposals made to Milosevic before the outbreak of the war did not, oddly enough, provide for independence for Kosovo, but rather for foreign influence on the government and the economy of Serbia and Montenegro."
"If it is now being proposed that the European Agency for Reconstruction, which was originally intended for Kosovo, now be extended to include Serbia and Montenegro and if there are also calls for Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro to be made more dependent on one another by creating a common energy supply, this raises the question as to whether Serbia has been promised that it will get Kosovo back in exchange for adapting to and integrating into the EU."
"If this is the case, it will not only evoke a lot of resistance within Serbia but will in particular cause uncontrollable anger on the part of the deceived inhabitants of Kosovo."
"The EU is playing with fire."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.50 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"The next item is the debates on the cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law."
"The next item is the debate on the following five motions for resolution regarding the case of Dr Saad Eddin Ibrahim, in Egypt."
"B5-0465/2002 by Mr Wuori, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery and Mr Piétrasanta, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the case of Saad Eddin Ibrahim;"
"B5-0471/2002 by Mrs Napoletano and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the sentencing of Saad Eddin Ibrahim in Egypt;"
"B5-0473/2002 by Mr Hugues Martin and Mr Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the case of Saad Eddin Ibrahim (Egypt);"
"B5-0480/2002 by Mrs Boudjenah and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on human rights in Egypt;"
"B5-0484/2002 by Mr van den Bos and Mrs Malmström, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on Egypt."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Union devotes particular attention to the area of freedom of expression and fundamental rights."
"Strict observance of these rights is an essential condition of our association agreement."
"The Euro-Mediterranean partnership cannot be strengthened, therefore, by denying this indispensable and irrevocable clause."
"Since 1981, Egypt has been under an emergency law which grants extensive powers to the authorities, with a total disregard for human rights."
"Freedoms are increasingly restricted and subject to the tightest control by the police authorities, which are approved by the judicial authorities."
"Saad Eddine Ibrahim and his colleagues from the Ibn Khaldoun Centre have been sentenced on the pretext of misuse of funds or of procedures, but the real reason for this is that they are defending democratic freedoms, as Nawal El Saadawi or other human rights activists have done in the past, whilst individual freedoms are also flouted, several homosexuals having been sentenced."
"We therefore urge the Egyptian Government to put an end to the emergency law to allow all citizens to fully enjoy their lawful rights, to allow sexual orientation, freedom of religion and freedom of opinion to be expressed without being equated to crimes and to allow the freedom of association to be guaranteed so that civil liberties campaigners will no longer be persecuted."
"We want the State of Egypt, like the other States which have signed the association agreements, to understand that the democratic clause in Article 2 is not a luxury, nor is it an option."
"We want our friends to know that we are not interfering, not acting out of a notion of superiority, nor a wish to preach, but we are in fact acting out of duty, a duty to denounce and condemn violations of freedom wherever they occur."
"Human rights are universal and transcend all borders."
"Mr President, we welcome the fact that all the Parliamentary groups are willing to discuss and vote on this subject for urgent debate which involves the case of Professor Ibrahim, who has been sentenced by the supreme court for state security to seven years' imprisonment for two offences: conspiracy and activities against the state, and fraud."
"The first question needs to be considered in more general terms, since the Constitutions of some of these countries - in particular, I would recall the recent modification in Tunisia - contain an article to the effect that the citizens must not carry out any activity which may be directed against the state, which can even be interpreted as conspiracy."
"Moreover, this is applied to freedom of speech, and therefore an opposition supporter, a journalist or any free person who criticises the government may then be accused of activities against the state."
"This is a very serious issue, which requires a more general response."
"As regards the offence of fraud, however, checks, will, of course, have to be carried out, but according to our records, as Commissioner Patten has said, there has been no fraud with regard to the use of the Community funds which Professor Ibrahim's institute has administered on behalf of the Commission."
"I believe that we are dealing with a case of defence of human rights and I therefore feel that the European institutions should exert every possible pressure on the Egyptian authorities."
"Mr President, Ibn-Khaldoun was one of those major historical figures who demonstrate how much we in Europe owe to the Arab and Islamic world."
"We accordingly have a duty to give our support to a man, Professor Ibrahim, who has worked in the tradition of Ibn-Khaldoun, and we should make it clear - and this is also something that we owe, as it were, to the heritage of Ibn-Khaldoun - that there are not two concepts of human rights, one for Europe and one for Egypt, but that there is a single concept of human rights here, which is also appropriate in common cultural and historical terms and which should apply universally today."
"That is precisely why we owe it to both Professor Ibrahim and the Egyptian people to get involved here."
"First, to get Professor Ibrahim released and second, as his health is poor, to secure help for him."
"However, the third issue is for us to very clearly advocate close cooperation between Egypt and the European Union."
"Egypt is one of our most important partners in the Mediterranean area."
"As is evident from the current political crisis, Egypt, alongside Morocco and Turkey, is our most important ally in the Islamic world in the Mediterranean area."
"Precisely because Egypt is a partner and an ally and not a debtor country or a country we do not want anything to do with, and precisely because Egypt is an important ally, we should not mince our words in talking to them, as is usual between friends, and we should plead the case of persecuted minorities and persecuted people in general. Above all we should support those people within the Egyptian State and within the Egyptian Government who want to strengthen human rights rather than demolish them."
"Egypt has a great tradition of which I have personal experience from the times when Anwar al Sadat and President Mubarak addressed this House."
"We are taking about important partners, and I believe that we should continue along that path and support Professor Ibrahim."
"Mr President, the Barcelona Process will never get off the ground as long as the common principles are not being complied with."
"Fine words like peace, stability and prosperity will degenerate into empty slogans if partner countries continue to sacrifice the constitutional state on the altar of unbridled political power."
"The intensification of economic cooperation cannot be seen as a separate issue from progress in the areas of human rights and democracy."
"Many Arab leaders refuse to realise that openness, power-sharing and fair judicial procedures will promote rather than hinder stability and economic development."
"A properly functioning civil society is not a threat, it is a necessary precondition for decent government."
"Egypt is a big and important country with a rich history."
"She must play a leading role in the political modernisation of the Arab world."
"In order to achieve this, she must set an example that other states can emulate."
"Unfortunately, there is no evidence of this as yet."
"Openness and democracy still leave much to be desired, and the constitutional state is often violated."
"Thus Dr Ibrahim's recent seven year prison sentence is a flagrant breach of every legal concept."
"The accusations of fraud with EU money are not only unsubstantiated, according to the Commission, they are completely unfounded."
"This sentence therefore undermines the cooperation treaty."
"We are therefore urgently appealing to President Mubarak to do everything in his power to reverse this injustice."
"Good relations with Egypt are also of vital importance for us."
"The European Union is willing to inject new life into the Barcelona Process, but this can only be done if our partners stop flouting the principles."
"Mr President, it is always sad to talk about human rights abuses because we in the EU take for granted the universal rights that we exercise day in, day out."
"The case of Dr Ibrahim is deeply worrying because it is part of a trend that we see increasing in Egypt."
"Yet Egypt - as we have heard from Mr Posselt - is a friend and ally."
"Therefore I urge the Commissioner on his visit to Egypt to raise at the highest level with President Mubarak the case of Dr Ibrahim and his colleagues. He should be released immediately."
"There should be a fair appeal process."
"I equally urge him to raise the case of the 'Cairo 52', who are also undergoing a retrial, and of the four British men held pending trial in Cairo at this moment."
"We are friends of Egypt."
"We must encourage dialogue."
"When dialogue fails, we must bring forward sanctions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we must first of all pay tribute to one of the greatest enemies of our topical and urgent debates and one of the champions of the bureaucratisation of our Parliament, Mr Corbett. The damage has been done."
"We are not talking today about tough regimes. We should be devoting much more attention to Saudi Arabia or Syria."
"We are dealing with a so-called moderate regime, Egypt, as a way of hiding all our shame and cowardice."
"We are talking about Professor Saad Ibrahim, who is one of the most ardent Egyptian supporters of democracy in his country, and we too should be much more determined in our quest for democratisation in the Arab world."
"I would like to thank Commissioner Patten for his clear statements in defence of Professor Ibrahim and refuting allegations of any kind of fraud."
"I believe that all possible checks have been carried out and that there is therefore no excuse: we must fight for his release."
"Lastly, I would also like to thank all those who have supported his nomination for the Sakharov prize."
"Mr President, the trial of Dr Saad Eddin Ibrahim and his colleagues has aroused widespread international interest and concern, not least among those who, like many of us here, consider ourselves true friends of Egypt and the Egyptian people."
"When Dr Ibrahim and his co-accused successfully appealed for a retrial last February, we hoped that the best traditions of justice would prevail, not only on the merits of the case, but because of the evident damage to Egypt's international reputation caused by the handling of the case by the Egyptian authorities."
"We were therefore profoundly shocked on 29 July when Dr Ibrahim was again sentenced to seven years' imprisonment with hard labour, a cruel sentence for a man in his frail physical condition."
"A further four defendants were also sentenced to prison and the remaining 24 have suspended sentences."
"Even if the charges were credible, and we do not find them so, these sentences are completely disproportionate."
"The following day I personally voiced my dismay and repeated that, despite careful monitoring and a mid-term external audit, the Commission has no evidence of financial or other wrongdoings by Dr Ibrahim or his co-defendants with respect to the two NGO contracts managed by them."
"We made this clear in an affidavit submitted during the appeal."
"Furthermore, I repeated then and I repeat now that we deplore the use of state security courts and procedures to pursue cases of this nature. Even the Court of Appeal has misgivings on the use of Military Court Order No 4 under which this prosecution was brought."
"We were disturbed by the decision to retry the defendants after a successful appeal and despite Dr Ibrahim's failing health."
"We are troubled by the conduct of the trial and the speed and manner of the court's decision."
"This unseemly rush to judgment did nothing to improve the court's credibility."
"The case has been closely followed by the EC and Member States and we made our concern clear at the highest levels from the beginning."
"With respect to the charge of accepting foreign European Union funds without authorisation, the Commission insists that direct grants to civil society are perfectly proper and are covered by the EU-Egypt Framework Convention on Financial and Technical Cooperation."
"At the conclusion of the first trial last year, the severe sentences led to an EC statement on 23 May and the presidency declaration two days later, expressing deep concern."
"Then, as now, the European Union stressed the importance it attaches to the development of civil society and reiterated that actions to this end are an integral part of Barcelona and bilateral programming which Egypt has signed up to."
"With respect to the claimed misuse of EU funds, the Commission is, to say the least, surprised that the Court has reportedly ruled as irrelevant the views of the Commission, the alleged victim, that its normal monitoring procedures, including an external mid-term audit, gave no cause for concern whatsoever, financial or otherwise."
"We have no access at present to the NGO files, which have been confiscated by the authorities."
"The European Union has always hoped that due legal process and justice would prevail."
"We have scrupulously avoided any intervention that might prejudice that expectation."
"The Commission's affidavit during the appeal was strictly factual and correct."
"We are concerned that the Court, in its written explanations, is reported to have implied the contrary."
"The Commission and the Member States continue to follow the case closely."
"The Cairo-based Troika has already visited Dr Ibrahim in prison and the Swedes visited again this weekend."
"We are in close touch with the family."
"If, as first press reports indicate, the Court's formal explanation of its verdict, which still has to be translated, misrepresents the European Union's position, we will not hesitate to rectify it."
"The legal process is not finished and I understand that the defendants will appeal."
"The Egyptian authorities are well aware of the wider implications of a judgment that is perceived as unjust and politically influenced."
"Only the due process of law in full transparency can prevent further damage to Egypt's international standing."
"The Ibrahim case raises issues of real concern, but the overall human rights situation in Egypt is complex and not entirely clear."
"There is some cause for optimism, for example, in relation to women's rights, judicial control of general elections and social legislation."
"But there are also some signs which give cause for concern, such as the new law on non-governmental organisations, the alleged harassment of homosexuals referred to earlier and the further arrests of members of the Islamic opposition."
"What we have to do is discern the trend and react accordingly."
"The Ibrahim case casts a long, but hopefully temporary, shadow over the Egyptian human rights and democracy movement."
"Although the international outcry at the verdict has provoked a strong reaction in Cairo, many influential Egyptians accept that Egypt must adopt the highest judicial and democratic standards if it is to achieve its developmental and political ambitions."
"We can only agree with that."
"We will continue to use appropriate measures to express our concern on individual cases."
"We shall discuss the broader issues concerning human rights and the promotion of democracy within the context of our cooperation programming and the enhanced political dialogue that must characterise the new and privileged relationship between the European Union and its Mediterranean partners."
"I confirm directly to the Member who raised this question that I shall certainly be discussing the matter when, God willing, I visit Egypt myself next month."
"Thank you very much indeed, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 4 p.m. or as soon as we finish the debates."
"The next item is the debate on the following six motions for resolution on Nigeria, and more specifically the case of Mrs Amina Lawal:"
"B5-0466/2002 by Mrs Frassoni and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the human rights breaches in Nigeria;"
"B5-0470/2002 by Mrs Gröner and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the death sentence of Mrs Amina Lawal in Nigeria;"
"B5-0472/2002 by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the case of Mrs Amina Lawal in Nigeria;"
"B5-0474/2002 by Mr McCartin and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the human rights situation in Nigeria;"
"B5-0479/2002 by Mrs Eriksson and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on human rights breaches in Nigeria;"
"B5-0486/2002 by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne and others, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on human rights breaches in Nigeria."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the African continent, which, for far too long, has been synonymous with tragedies and loss, recently wanted to present a new face to the international community."
"The foundation of the African Union as an off-shoot of the OAU and as a role model to the European Union is a promise of the future for this continent and a homage to the institutions that make up our own."
"As well as providing a model of political structure and a single project for the continent, the European Union must also protect the rights recognised by the international conventions."
"The tragedy of another age, however, currently being suffered by Amina Lawal, is threatening all these promises and signatures ratified by her country, Nigeria."
"The extreme distress experienced by Mrs Lawal and Mrs Husseini before her and so many other ignored voices, is evidence of the ludicrous gap between commitments and political and legal practices in certain countries of Africa."
"It is difficult to understand that, in this day and age, a sentence of death by stoning could be passed down."
"It is difficult to accept such a barbaric act could be carried out for the mere fact of having had a baby after a divorce."
"Above all, it is difficult to accept regional laws, in a federal state which denies and flouts a national constitution."
"Admittedly, it is the primary responsibility of the federal authorities of Nigeria to establish conformity and respect of its national laws and international commitments throughout its territory and the jurisdiction of its state."
"However, it is also the moral and political duty of the Union, many of whose Member States share a common history with the African continent, to oppose criminal abuses, such as certain interpretations of the Sharia law and to support, using every effort and every means at our disposal, those who are fighting for the rule of law, for rights and for real justice for all."
"If we are satisfied with a token statement each time a Kafkaesque crime befalls a citizen of the ACP countries, we are essentially becoming accomplices and are upholding, due to our diplomatic inertia, the return to obscurantist ways."
"That is why my group and I are calling for a working group to be set up on the question of Sharia law and women's rights as part of our forthcoming ACP-EU delegation."
"The stability of Nigeria is under threat and the stability of the whole country could be affected by what is happening in Nigeria, the most densely populated country in Africa."
"The shockwaves created by Amina Lawal's case have just reached Europe; let us take action to prevent further shockwaves in the future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to express in the strongest terms my horror and disgust at what has been happening over the last two years in the northern provinces of Nigeria, where Islamic fundamentalists have imposed Sharia law over and above the laws of the country and international law."
"I wonder, how can women - not men of course - be condemned to death by stoning for adultery in a country which has ratified the UN treaty on eliminating all forms of discrimination against women, in a country which has ratified the treaty against torture and the international covenant on civil and political rights, in a country with which the European Union has close ties under the Cotonou agreement?"
"How come the federal government of Nigeria is unable to make the Islamic fundamentalists respect the very constitution of the country?"
"What is the point of having a president if he is unable to guarantee the fundamental freedoms and human rights of his citizens?"
"I find it impossible to believe, Commissioner Patten, that intolerance, obscurantism and misogyny can triumph over reason and human values."
"I cannot accept that the Union does not have ways and means of preventing these criminal practices against women and that, in this specific case, we are unable to force the federal government of Nigeria to apply the law throughout its territory."
"We need to send out a very strong message from this House today both to Nigeria and to any other country in which crimes are being committed against women because, as we know from the press, sentences of death by stoning are also passed in Iran."
"We need to tell fundamentalists the world over that no tradition or culture can sanction the violation of the rights of half of mankind, which is why we are calling here and now for Amina Lawal to be released."
"Mr President, I have read up the case of Ms Amina Lawal and checked it out with Amnesty International, which I would like to thank for the assistance it gave, as also the staff of my own group who confirmed the facts that had been published."
"I looked into these facts and the first thing that strikes us about this case is the cruel and unusual punishment that is involved."
"Above all, we have to look at the unfairness of the decision that was taken in imposing a punishment on the female partner in the name of some kind of religious belief."
"This is not religious justice; this is a purely political policy by which men in many parts of the world, in the past and still today, maintain their control and domination over the weaker sex."
"The second hurtful aspect of this case is the absolute and wanton cruelty involved. It violates every instinct in mankind that prompts us to work for a world that can be shared in peace and enjoyment by us all."
"Above all, this case reminds us of the barbarous days when witches were burned, as somebody pointed out earlier, and when human beings were sacrificed to satisfy an unseen, unknown and uncaring deity."
"There are many people in this world who recognise many different visions and manifestations of their god or gods."
"There are many people who recognise no god whatsoever."
"This does not prevent us from sharing and enjoying the same world together."
"But if some people believe that on behalf of their god, they can take it upon themselves to punish and persecute their fellow men because they follow a different religion or do not have any religious beliefs, then mankind cannot co-exist in peace in this world."
"That is why we in this Parliament must make it clear that only democratic institutions have the right to make laws and impose humane punishment on other human beings and that the code of the United Nations will be upheld by the European Union at all costs."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once again, a woman, Mrs Amina Lawal, has been sentenced to death by stoning in one of the Muslim states of the Federation of Nigeria."
"Her crime is to have given birth to a child after her divorce."
"Some months ago, Safiya Husseini, sentenced to the same fate, was spared following an international outcry."
"But how many people have been sentenced to the same barbaric fate before this victory and how many will be sentenced in the future?"
"It is high time that these highly antiquated legal decisions, which show complete contempt for human dignity, are prevented from being passed in Nigeria and elsewhere."
"This strict application of Sharia law, which has nothing to do with respect of the Muslim religion, was declared unconstitutional by the Nigerian Minister for Justice, including in the federal Muslim states of the north."
"In its constitution, the Federation of Nigeria describes itself as a secular State."
"Nigeria is also signatory to conventions which spell out its commitments at international level."
"Although the Katsina state is involved, there are other responsibilities: those of the federal Nigerian authorities which have a duty to ensure strict respect of the constitution and the protection of human rights for all Nigerian citizens, regardless of status, religion or sex."
"The international community, and Europe in particular, must condemn this unacceptable breach of fundamental human rights."
"Europe is opposed to the death penalty."
"It has committed itself to protect women's rights against sexual discrimination and against religious intolerance."
"Doing everything in our power to save Amina Lawal from death by stoning is also one of Europe's duties."
"Human rights organisations are bravely fighting in Nigeria."
"These organisations are often under threat, but they are working together despite the lack of resources and the lack of support, other than support from European organisations."
"We must support their demands."
"Lastly, as part of the Cotonou partnership agreements, Europe can and must urge Nigeria to respect its international commitments and to promote democracy and women's rights."
"Mr President, are we going to support a country that pursues barbaric practices?"
"Now we are faced with the drama of Mrs Lawal."
"More and more states within Nigeria are introducing Sharia law."
"The political climate is often so influenced by Islam that politicians only have a chance in elections if they support this legislation."
"Barbaric ancient desert practices such as stoning women or hacking off limbs are naturally at odds with the most fundamental human rights."
"The much-discussed clash of civilisations, cultures or faiths can only be prevented if the strict Sharia law is abolished everywhere."
"Nigeria is a very fragile and unstable democracy."
"The European Union supports the democratisation process there, and with good reason."
"However, it can only continue to do so if the federal government does everything in its constitutional power to stop barbaric punishments from being administered."
"If they fail to do so, the support we recently promised must be reconsidered."
"Development aid and support for good government makes little sense if the recipients of this aid persist with their barbaric practices."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as Christian Democrats, and as the PPE-DE Group, our commitment to the defence of the value of human life and dignity, and the defence of the fundamental rights and freedoms required for that dignity, lead us once again to vigorously condemn the violations of human life and dignity represented by the death sentences - and, what is more, death by stoning - handed down in strict application of Islamic law; and to urge the authorities responsible to show clemency in order to prevent the ignominy of the execution of such sentences."
"It also leads us to remind not only the Federal State of Nigeria, but also Niger, Sudan and Somalia, that the current interpretation and application of the sharia is not only a clear violation of fundamental rights, but that it evidently contravenes the international commitments to human rights which they have signed up to, including the Cotonou agreements, article one of which clearly states that the rights of the individual will be respected and that the situation of women and issues of sex equality will systematically be taken into account in all areas, political, economic and social."
"Therefore, as well as our absolute rejection of the death sentences which have been handed down, and as well as asking for mercy for Amina Lawal, Ahmadu Ibrahin and Fatima Usman, we must and want to demand that the governments of these countries bring their legislation into line with the international standards and commitments in the field of human rights, in order to prevent an application of the sharia which violates human rights."
"Furthermore, as the European Union we must be prepared to use the mechanisms available to us under the Cotonou agreements in the event of the violation of the principles they stand for."
"Only in this way, Mr President, will we contribute to progress on freedom and respect for human rights in the world."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this mother, Amina Lawal, has been sentenced to death, to die by stoning, brutally, for having had sexual relations after being divorced, something very common which is done by millions of people, men and women, on all five continents, regardless of their beliefs, Muslims, Catholics, protestants and any other."
"'Why Amina and not me?', the whole world asks in the face of this Islamic hypocrisy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the current application of the sharia in the states of the north of Nigeria did not exist before."
"It is simply a fundamentalist interpretation."
"The harm it would do to the life of Amina is irreversible."
"Later, power relationships will change, there will be other tribunals, Islamic ones or American ones, which establish different criteria, but Amina's right to life will be irreversibly violated."
"Paragraph 11 reiterates that the European Parliament wants to see consideration of the victims of fundamentalist persecutions being given the right to asylum, particularly in cases of sentences to death by stoning."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we must not forget that these sentences to death by stoning are also being carried out in Iran."
"And a top official close to Khatami even had the nerve to praise them."
"Commissioner, we want to strengthen links with Iran, but are these stonings compatible with our coherence on foreign and security policy and the defence of human rights?"
"Commissioner, I would ask you also to take account of the stonings in Iran."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is with great sorrow that we follow the events in Nigeria."
"I was among those who believed that the election of President Obasanjo some years ago would usher in change."
"This latest report and discussion is just one in a long line indicating that the security forces are not acting as they should and that the causes are not being investigated."
"There are reports that some years ago the president was in principle calling for all those belonging to the Oodua People's Congress, that is, several hundred people, to be fired upon."
"Transparency International still classes Nigeria as the second most corrupt country in the world."
"The figures for child labour and trafficking in children are highest in Nigeria."
"If we were really sincere about these matters, we should now also call on the ambassadors to take steps in Nigeria to publicise the fact that Amina Lawal is welcome in any European country."
"We should act to say that she can come here, that we, as Europeans together, are prepared to save her."
"That is the only honourable way to proceed."
"I would ask the Commissioner to consider speaking with the ambassadors."
"Mr President, we shall vote in favour of this resolution in spite of all the criticism that can be directed at it."
"If the European Parliament can prevent a crime from being committed against Amina Lawal by adopting a position, then this is what it must do."
"Condemning a woman for having given birth to a child, in the name of antiquated laws, is a despicable crime, in the same way as all forms of oppression of women and all forms of mutilation are despicable, whether or not they are perpetrated in the name of religion."
"We firmly echo the protests against the fact that women are oppressed and deprived of their human rights in the name of the Sharia law, but we are equally firmly opposed to what is being done in the name of the Vatican or the Bible."
"We must, of course, condemn the barbaric acts in Nigeria, but we must also condemn these acts when they are committed in the United States, this superpower which poses as a model of modern civilisation, or even here, in the European Union which tolerates some of its Member States implementing laws which ban women from enjoying the basic right to own and control their own bodies."
"Whilst we oppose acts of barbarism perpetuated elsewhere, we must also ensure that our own house is in order."
"Mr President, in every part of the world we see examples of violence and cruelty by individuals and sometimes appalling scenes of mob violence and lynch rule."
"These are horrors which every civilised person, government and judicial system condemns."
"Some acts of savagery are doubly chilling because they are authorised by people supposedly appointed to administer justice."
"It is not just in Nigeria, but today we are focusing on Nigeria."
"The practices carried out there in the name of Sharia law are beyond the pale of any society that calls itself civilised and humane."
"Stoning for adultery is barbaric; flogging for sex before marriage or alcohol consumption and amputation for theft may be considered excessive."
"To give judicial approval to a stoning to death by a legal mob cannot be acceptable to the vast majority of Nigerians who are decent and responsible, including their president, and it certainly cannot be acceptable to us."
"Earlier this year, we saw international pressure helping to put a stop to plans to stone Safiya Husseini to death. Now Amina Lawal faces the same threat of death by torture."
"Safiya was married at 12 years old and Amina at 14 years old."
"They lost their childhood and Amina may now lose her life."
"The young couple Ahmadu Ibrahim and Fatima Usman face the same prospect, as does an older man accused of rape."
"This punishment is incompatible with the conventions and covenants signed by Nigeria."
"Tens of thousands of people have written from 110 countries to appeal for clemency in the Amina case."
"I believe the federal government understands that and indeed the minister of justice has also condemned the verdict."
"The key is the governor of Katsina state and it is important that the presidency and the Commission and the President of our Parliament add their pleas to those many of us have already sent to Umaru Musa Yar'Adua."
"Mr President, Commissioner, following the success of international action to save the life of Safiya Husseini in March this year, it is all the more shocking to again be faced with the threatened execution of a Nigerian woman and mother by being stoned to death."
"Despite international pressure, the Nigerian Government is not willing to meet its obligations under international law and is allowing 10 Nigerian federal states to apply local and religiously motivated criminal law contrary to national constitutional law and international human rights."
"At the same time, however, we need to be aware that Nigeria is by no means a unique case."
"According to information from Amnesty International, in Iran, for example, in 2001 and 2002 at least six women were sentenced to death by stoning for crimes such as 'adultery and earthly depravity', in some cases after a long prison sentence, and these sentences were carried out."
"In Iran alone a total of 35 people, both men and women, have already been executed this year in various ways."
"It is therefore high time that the European Union took a stand against this barbaric practice not just in individual cases, but as a matter of principle."
"It should also be possible to endeavour to impose sanctions on regimes where practices of this kind take place."
"This is, as every Member who has spoken in this debate has pointed out, an extremely troubling case."
"I am not surprised that it has caused so much outrage, as well as shock, in Parliament."
"Throughout, the Commission has been deeply concerned by the possible application of harsh penalties in Nigeria."
"This time we, like Members, are particularly concerned about the case of Amina Lawal, who has been condemned to death by stoning, which, as Mr Bowis said, is in effect a state-sanctioned and organised brutality, although she is at present awaiting appeal."
"The Commission is as strongly opposed as every Member who has spoken to the use of cruel and discriminatory punishments."
"We have consistently expressed concern over Sharia punishments in Nigeria and - I shall return to this point - we have expressed our concern about Sharia punishments elsewhere as well. This concern has been expressed, among other places, at the Commission on Human Rights."
"Quite simply, we expect all communities to accept international norms concerning human rights, gender equality and respect for human life."
"We are resolutely opposed to the use of the death penalty and fully subscribe to the European Union guidelines against the death penalty adopted in 1998."
"We have had the opportunity on more than one occasion to discuss those guidelines in this Parliament."
"A Troika démarche was carried out to restate this position only last year in Nigeria."
"The Commission will continue to provide support for human rights and democracy initiatives, through its cooperation programme with Nigeria and through other instruments such as the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, which has so many eloquent champions in this Parliament."
"This initiative includes Nigeria as a focus country, and will support interventions in the field of good governance and legal reform with the aim of achieving a positive impact on the status of women and awareness of their legal rights."
"The Union is, of course, in constant political dialogue with the Nigerian Government, as a number of Members have pointed out, for example, Mrs Karamanou."
"This could be intensified as foreseen under the Cotonou Agreement, depending on how the situation evolves."
"I was interested by the proposal, which was also mentioned by one of the authors of this resolution, to establish a working group on Sharia and human rights and women's rights under the Cotonou Agreement."
"As Parliament may know, we financed a study - the Peters report - on the problems of applying the Sharia Law in Nigeria."
"I am sure Parliament will not be surprised at the main conclusions."
"The report believed that some legal texts were poorly drafted and contradictory, that application of the texts was inconsistent, that the judges concerned were incompetent and poorly trained and that there were contradictions not just with international laws but also federal laws."
"I can assure Parliament that we will continue to raise this deeply troubling issue."
"As I have had occasion to say to foreign ministers from a number of countries, it is very difficult for us in Europe to accept that female lapidation is consistent with internationally acceptable norms of behaviour and of human rights."
"Mrs Izquierdo Rojo raised the question of female lapidation in Iran."
"I can assure her that I have raised that issue with Iranian ministers."
"I have raised it in Tehran, as well as at meetings outside Tehran."
"I very much hope that in the course of the next months we will be able to begin a comprehensive human rights dialogue with Iran, alongside the discussions we will be having with it on political issues and on trade and cooperation, so that we can continue to raise the issue with it, as we raise it with every other country where it is relevant."
"Parliament is concerned about this; we are concerned about it;"
"European public opinion is deeply troubled by it."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 4 p.m. or at the end of the debates."
"The next item is the debate on the following seven motions for resolutions on human rights in Zimbabwe:"
"B5-0464/2002 by Mr Van Orden and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on Zimbabwe;"
"B5-0467/2002 by Mrs Maes and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Zimbabwe;"
"B5-0468/2002 by Mr Andrews, on behalf of the UEN Group, on Zimbabwe;"
"B5-0469/2002 by Mrs Kinnock and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the human rights situation in Zimbabwe;"
"B5-0481/2002 by Mr Vinci, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on human rights in Zimbabwe;"
"B5-0482/2002 by Mr Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on Zimbabwe;"
"B5-0485/2002 by Mr van den Bos, Mr Mulder and Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the human rights situation in Zimbabwe."
"Mr President, it is with both sadness and frustration that I find myself presenting yet another resolution on Zimbabwe - the sixth within a year."
"The fact is that the situation there is getting worse and the European Union's actions to date have clearly been ineffective."
"They are not being pursued with sufficient determination or vigour."
"The European Union sends diplomatic missions to southern Africa but they come back empty handed and leave behind no impression that action against Zimbabwe is a high priority and a determining factor in the overall approach to southern Africa."
"Let us be clear: the issue is not the rights of white farmers, it is the rights of all of the people of Zimbabwe."
"If you are not a card-carrying Zanu-PF member then you are subject to harassment, discrimination, assault, selective starvation policies and murder."
"How serious does it have to get before effective action is taken?"
"President Mugabe has just returned to Harare from Johannesburg claiming support for his land policies."
"This is a travesty."
"To quote the opposition MDC, 'Mugabe's land reform programme has resulted in massive environmental degradation, condemned hundreds of thousands to poverty and put six million people at risk of starvation'."
"That is the reality."
"President Mugabe is a tyrant who has plundered the resources of his country for his own benefit and that of his cronies and who uses the apparatus of the state, including the police, to terrify and abuse his political opponents."
"Imagine our horror, therefore, when we discovered that Augustine Chihuri, the Zimbabwe police chief who is actually named on the European Union's prescribed list as being banned from travelling to EU countries, was nevertheless in France last week, at an Interpol meeting in Lyon."
"You might rightly ask what a person like Chihuri is doing as a vice-president of Interpol in the first place, but that is a different question."
"The fact is that he should not have been in France and the Council must now take vigorous and effective steps to close the loopholes and galvanise international moves against President Mugabe before the tragedy of Zimbabwe is again overshadowed by other international crises."
"Let us have some determined action for the sake of all the people of Zimbabwe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, President Mugabe's dictatorship is reprehensible."
"He is running his country into the ground, the fields are bare, the economy is going downhill, the people are suffering shortages, there is hunger; he gags the press, he terrorises the opposition and his motive is to remain in power."
"Nevertheless, he still finds sympathy in black Africa."
"After all, Zimbabwe's neighbours do not want to go to war against her."
"The farm workers working on the white farms often have to live in unacceptable social conditions."
"The landless poor want to be given the chance to survive."
"There is therefore a need to redistribute the land, but this must be done according to legal and transparent procedures, without violence and without corruption."
"The European Union must therefore play its own role."
"We have too much respect for the people of Zimbabwe."
"We cannot interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign country."
"Our sanctions must affect President Mugabe and his circle, but not the people of Zimbabwe."
"The people must know that we understand their desire to acquire land and that we want to provide financial support for a legal procedure for acquiring land."
"We must help Zimbabwe's neighbours to take care of refugees."
"If we do not do this, we will actually be providing them with an excuse to send the refugees back over the border, where they will once again fall prey to the repression."
"This is the role that I hope this Parliament will support, and that is why we have submitted the amendments."
"I understand that some people will not support them, but I really do not want to be seen simply as the white man wagging an admonishing finger at Africa."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what is happening in Zimbabwe is quite simply an unparalleled tragedy."
"In his speech in Johannesburg, Mr Mugabe made the unspeakable assertion that these events, which are totally contrary to constitutional law, are even contributing to sustainable development. That really takes the biscuit!"
"It would be hard to top that comment for audacity."
"It would be good if there were some louder voices in black Africa exposing this for what it really is: a power struggle on the part of a man who has failed in the course of 20 years to push forward a process of land reform that could have been carried out constitutionally."
"He only took action on this when his personal position was threatened, and only resorted to these tactics when his hold on power was at risk."
"We must never forget that this action is only partly directed again white farmers."
"It is above all aimed at Zimbabwe's opposition, which managed, despite enormous repression in the parliamentary elections, to achieve a very remarkable result, and which of course has a great deal of backing amongst the public."
"That is the real background to this."
"I would like to quote some comments from the South African newspaper the Daily Newspaper, because it is one of the voices in a country which is, after all, our ally, which is important."
"It has criticised the way the Mugabe Government has carried out land reform as brutal, and as a means of bringing production to a standstill, which is futile."
"This paper has pointed out that Mr Mugabe is attempting to propagate a myth when he says he has the backing of all Zimbabweans."
"We know after all that there is a strong opposition and that it is not therefore legitimate, and I am quoting now, to talk about 'my Zimbabweans and my Zimbabwe', while ignoring his many opponents, and that Mr Mugabe is creating a false impression when he alleges that Zimbabwe is, as it were, his property."
"But as far as I understand he is in the process of selling off that property to his own family, so that the occupation of land is being misused to bestow gifts on his family members."
"As I have already said, the European Union should be willing to support a legal and constitutional process of land reform, but it should not support such machinations."
"We have to say that very clearly to our partner countries."
"Mr President, in the Zimbabwe of President Mugabe, there are terrible things happening every day."
"Just listen to this: 'The game we are going to play needs music,' the Zimbabwean police agent told the 12-year-old girl at 10 o'clock at night."
"But when he threw a mattress on the ground, it became clear that he had something other than a game in mind."
"For the next four hours, the girl's mother and her nine-year-old and seven-year-old sisters were forced to continuously sing the praises of Robert Mugabe and watch while the undernourished Dora was raped by a gang of five so-called 'war veterans' and the policeman behind the shack until 2.30 in the morning."
"'This is the punishment for those who want to sell the country to Tony Blair and the whites,' they screamed at the terrified girl."
"Dora was abused because her absent father was an ordinary supporter of the opposition, the Movement for Democratic Change."
"Unfortunately, the abovementioned tragedy (see the Sunday Telegraph of 25 August) was not an isolated incident."
"Dora is just one of hundreds of young girls raped as part of a state campaign of systematic political purging of the population."
"Not to mention the approximately 50 militia camps where President Mugabe's opponents are locked up and tortured for 're-education', but which are also increasingly being used as rape camps."
"Meanwhile, President Mugabe does not seem to be in the least ashamed of this reign of terror."
"Quite the opposite."
"For example, take his outrageous performance at the UN Summit in Johannesburg, where this self-made pariah passed himself off as a victim of colonialism who wanted to free his 'occupied country' from 'British colonialism'."
"The fact that he is allowing half of his 12 million compatriots to starve on account of this non-argument does not bother him in the least."
"Namibian President Nujoma's active support for President Mugabe and the deafening silence from President Mbeki, the great initiator of the NEPAD programme, which is all about rulers' responsibilities towards the ruled, is worrying."
"In order to prevent the 'oil slick effect', I call on the Council and Commission to continue to give the crisis in Zimbabwe political priority."
"Because the fact that according to today's Frankfurter Allgemeine, only the US Secretary of State expressly criticised Mr Mugabe's reign of terror in the plenary assembly at Johannesburg hurt me personally a great deal."
"Was Europe really silent on this?"
"President Mugabe is allowing his people to starve and is blaming the West."
"It is not he who has driven his own people to starvation, but the neo-liberal development model."
"It is not he who has crushed democracy, violently intimidated his political opponents and manipulated elections, but the neo-colonial powers in Europe."
"It is not he who attacks the independent media, but reprobates who are beyond his control."
"It is not he who allows his militia to rape women who oppose him, but total strangers."
"And it is not he who withholds food from his political opponents, but the enemies of Zimbabwe."
"All this former freedom fighter's political actions now have just one goal: how to stay in power at any cost."
"No decent person objects to land reform, but every decent person objects to land reform as practised by President Mugabe."
"Farmers are deprived of everything without any compensation and are forced to flee."
"It is not the people of Zimbabwe who get the land they are entitled to, but Mr Mugabe's political buddies."
"The President was allowed to unashamedly propound misleading political propaganda at the Johannesburg Summit."
"The so-called smart sanctions against the regime are not being particularly smartly enforced."
"The penalties must be applied more strictly and the target group must be expanded."
"I therefore ask Commissioner Patten what the position is regarding the promised investigation into the freezing of these men's assets in Europe."
"It is high time that new, honest elections were held in this country."
"President Mbeki of South Africa and other leaders in the region must ultimately accept their responsibility and must support the people of Zimbabwe and not a president who neglects his citizens because of his own hunger for power."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Junker has already mentioned Mr Mugabe's cynical speech at the Johannesburg Summit."
"I tend to get the impression that speeches of this kind are, unfortunately, infectious."
"I hope that the crass speech by Namibia's President Nujoma in Johannesburg on the same day will not have any political consequences in Namibia itself."
"Meanwhile, the politicisation of food aid in Zimbabwe is continuing, amongst other things."
"Maize is being specifically distributed to the party faithful, church food stores are being stormed by the so-called war veterans, and the church has been banned from distributing aid on the grounds that it is creating parallel structures."
"What should we be doing?"
"We should do what we have decided to do."
"To be precise, I expect that Zimbabwe's Foreign Minister will not be invited to the EU-SADEC meeting of Foreign Ministers in Copenhagen in November, and we should make it clear to our partners in southern Africa that European money is not intended to finance an African renaissance or a new NEPAD programme of African development for President Mugabe and his political allies."
"We should financially participate in the reconstruction of Zimbabwe and land reform there once Mr Mugabe has gone and within a proper constitutional framework - but not now."
"If Zimbabwe's neighbours exert pressure in their own interest, because they themselves are suffering from the impact of Mr Mugabe's policies - for example the flow of refugees into neighbouring countries - then we should support them in accommodating refugees, but certainly not now."
"We should make our own policy perfectly clear and bring appropriate pressure to bear on our own Council of Ministers, because I really have the impression - as a number of Members have already said - that this is not really being given priority, and that no very clear statement was made about Mr Mugabe in Johannesburg."
"That is why I hope that we will at least take a hard line in relation to the meeting in November in Copenhagen."
"Our partners in southern Africa will then have to decide for themselves if they want to show solidarity with Mr Mugabe or with the people of Zimbabwe, and join us in the dialogue to put an end to this situation."
"Mr President, of course this resolution speaks for itself."
"It is an appalling litany of crimes against humanity."
"President Mugabe is bereft of principles, devoid of any sense of justice, his regime sinks to unimagined levels as each day passes."
"He has no respect for human rights, minority rights, international law or international opinion."
"He is a vile despot and we must cease all links with him and his regime."
"As Mr Van Orden said, we must hit Mr Mugabe and his regime where it matters most, i.e. in the pocket."
"There must be an end to international trade and effective freezing of the bank accounts of Mr Mugabe and his entourage."
"Further financial and targeted sanctions must be vigorously imposed."
"At the same time, we must aid and support those African states which take similar punitive actions against the Mugabe regime."
"The great sadness in all of this is the effect it is having on the citizens of Zimbabwe, whose only crime is to have Mr Mugabe as their president."
"Let us target Mr Mugabe, not the citizens of Zimbabwe, and let us ensure that our actions are effective and not merely international window-dressing."
"Mr President, once again, a Marxist dictator - or rather a dictator with Marxist leanings - who has come to power with the blessing of western governments and their advisors, has revealed his true colours."
"On the pretext of land reform, and completely illegally, he is waging vandalism pure and simple, but also intimidation and the most brutal violence; atrocities are being perpetrated against white farmers, and against black farmers too, with whom they work and whose situation continues to deteriorate."
"We already know what the outcome of the situation will be."
"President Mugabe's militia, spurred on by envy and a taste for pillaging, are forcing white farmers into exile, at best."
"Their departure will spell the end of farms, famine for 12 million inhabitants of Zimbabwe and widespread poverty."
"But the icing on the cake is that even here there will be support for holding the West responsible for this situation and this poverty."
"We have already seen this happen in Congo, Algeria, Angola and Mozambique."
"This has happened in several African countries whose leaders very recently applauded Mr Mugabe in Johannesburg."
"In the light of this situation, I do not know whether we can do anything for the people of Zimbabwe, but we must at least have the honesty to say to the leaders of these countries that the primary cause of their underdevelopment is nothing to do with the western world."
"Mr Posselt has the floor on a point of order."
"Mr President, just a few words. I wanted to mention that this is the first time we are holding an urgent debate since the Corbett reform of our Rules of Procedure."
"That means that the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is cut from three to two hours, in order to free up two hours for legislative work."
"That was the official reasoning."
"Having seen today's agenda, I have to say that this legislative work must be taking place in secret."
"I would like to emphasise that I am very willing to make concessions, but not when the other side throws them away."
"By that I mean that I accept the idea of allowing two hours for legislative work, but in that case legislative work must actually been done here on Thursday afternoon."
"If no such work is being done, then I would like to have those two hours back for the urgencies."
"I know Zimbabwe reasonably well."
"When I was my own country's Overseas Development Minister in the 1980s I visited Zimbabwe frequently in the years after its independence."
"I recall the hope with which Zimbabwe set out on its own road as a sovereign country and how blessed it had been by the Almighty with food and other resources."
"I can remember, for example, during a famine in Mozambique, purchasing food aid in Zimbabwe for dispersal in Mozambique."
"Recalling all that it makes me even more sad when I look at the situation in Zimbabwe today."
"The Commission has, as Parliament knows, suspended official development assistance to Zimbabwe since early 2002."
"We remain deeply concerned regarding the grave deterioration of the human rights situation in the country."
"The International Crisis Group, which is an admirable organisation that reports regularly on trouble spots around the world, recently described Zimbabwe as a country in freefall."
"That is no exaggeration of the position."
"We, in the Commission, will contribute to support any peer pressure that Heads of State in Africa, and southern Africa in particular, may put on the Zimbabwe Government to respect the essential elements of the Cotonou Agreement, such as human rights, the rule of law and democracy."
"I have to say in passing, and this is not irrelevant to the points made by Mr Van Orden, that I wish we had recently seen more evidence of that sort of peer pressure in southern Africa."
"The political situation in the run-up to the local elections due this September continues to be tense, and the deadline for eviction orders for 2 900 white farmers to leave their properties expired on 8 August 2002."
"The Commission is therefore continuing to contribute to projects which directly support the population in the field of democratisation, respect for human rights and the rule of law, and the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights includes Zimbabwe as a focal country."
"The food crisis in Zimbabwe is the worst in southern Africa."
"There are credible reports of extensive politicisation of the Government of Zimbabwe's own food supplies."
"I am sure many Members of Parliament will have seen reports of Zanu-PF supporters saying to the people of Zimbabwe that only fools starve."
"In other words, they have to subscribe to a set of political views in order to get fed."
"The Commission deplores this."
"The Commission, for its part, has responded with an estimated 110 000 tonnes of food aid, for a global allocation of about EUR 3.5 million."
"The food is largely being distributed through the World Food Programme and the NGOs, with extensive involvement of local communities to identify needy groups."
"An initial EUR 2 million was provided through our humanitarian organisation, ECHO, for vulnerable groups, particularly children and farm workers."
"A sizeable part of the humanitarian financing decision to be taken shortly for EUR 30 million for the region will go to respond to the emergency in Zimbabwe including monitoring needs and food aid distribution."
"An additional regional allocation of EUR 30 million within the 2002 programme of cooperation with the World Food Programme will provide food aid assistance in the region, in particular in Zimbabwe."
"The Commission believes that SADC has a leading role to play in the resolution of the increasingly serious Zimbabwe crisis."
"The Union will seek to ensure an enhanced dialogue with SADC, in particular during the forthcoming Ministerial Conference in Copenhagen in November."
"It is planned to raise the issue of Zimbabwe as a specific point on the agenda."
"Parliament will know of the targeted sanctions that we have introduced - sanctions which are focused on the leading members of this particularly nasty and deeply corrupt regime, on their travel and on their assets."
"It is important, as some Members have pointed out, that we should do everything possible to make those sanctions stick."
"I will certainly report the views of Parliament to Member States on this particular point."
"I would also like to draw the attention of Parliament to the recent report of the Expert Panel established by the Security Council on the rape and pillage of the assets of the Democratic Republic of Congo and, in particular, to what is said there about Zimbabwe's role in that systematic pillage."
"The report itself makes extremely disturbing reading. The report is, in my judgement, something which the international community has to make plain that it intends to do something about."
"President Mugabe and his cronies have wrecked a once prosperous and once stable country."
"Their record is a deplorable blot on the history of southern Africa."
"The sooner Zimbabwe is rid of them the better for that wonderful country and the better for its people."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten."
"The debate is closed."
"Mr President, looking through the Minutes I have just noticed that my name does not appear in yesterday's Minutes."
"It is very easy to confirm this, because I was present for the roll-call votes."
"There is no doubt about the fact that you were present, Mrs Schierhuber!"
"I declare this sitting of the European Parliament closed."
"(The sitting was closed at 4.25 p.m.)"
"I have voted in favour of the report but against approved Amendment Nos 1 and 2."
"I find it extremely regrettable that my own Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats tabled two amendments which weaken the committee's original text."
"Amendment No 1 removed the wording in paragraph 30 to the effect that the European Parliament 'expresses its indignation at the increasing number of executions in China' and 'recalls that the Chinese government systematically uses persecution and torture as a means to silence dissidents and minorities'."
"The way in which the Chinese Government violates human rights is clear from, for example, its treatment of Christians and Falun Gong adherents."
"I also voted against Amendment No 2, relating to paragraph 35, because, remarkably enough, it does not include Taiwan in the group of democratic countries."
"Moreover, there is a desire only to give Taiwan observer status, while other democracies in the region are to be given the opportunity of becoming full members."
"I also welcome the fact that the report sheds light on the serious problem posed by the increasing number of fundamentalist Islamic terrorist groups, such as Laskar Jihad, which constitute a serious threat to the Christian minority in Indonesia and are responsible for the fact that thousands of people have been killed and approximately 400 000 forced to flee their homes."
"Resumption of the session"
"Before I start, I should like to pass on the President's apologies for his absence."
"He is in Ireland on personal business."
"The final draft agenda, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 19 September 2002 pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of Parliament's Rules of Procedure, has been distributed."
"The following change has been proposed:"
"Wednesday:"
"I have received a request from the Confederal Group of the European Left/Nordic Green Left to bring forward the Council and Commission statements on the Middle East."
"Mr President, my group agrees with the modification of the agenda proposed by the GUE/NGL Group."
"However, given the seriousness of the events taking place, I would firstly like to add that we support the statement of the High Representative for the CFSP, Mr Solana, of 20 September; secondly, I would ask you - since no specific resolution on this issue is scheduled - to communicate, on behalf of Parliament, the resolution approved in April; and, thirdly, in the current circumstances, my group believes that the two hopeful amendments to the Brok report on the situation in the Middle East should be withdrawn."
"I note your point about the resolution of April."
"Mr President, I simply wish to say, on behalf of my group, that we are happy with this change to the agenda, since we believe that, furthermore, this change will allow the Danish Foreign Minister to be present at the debate, meaning that there will be participation on the part of the Council."
"With regard to the resolution, I agree with the concern expressed by Mr Barón, I support the comments of the High Representative for the CFSP and I would like to point out that the Brok report contains several paragraphs which express the position of this Parliament on the situation in the Near East."
"If you pass the document on to the relevant services it will be forwarded to Parliament's security services for investigation."
"Mr President, I have passed to the Sittings Services a report from the Commission about its Investigation and Disciplinary Office."
"The report represents a staggering indictment of the Commission's ability to handle its own affairs, let alone those of the people of Europe."
"Over the last five years there have been 40 actions taken against individuals found to be guilty of a total of 48 infringements."
"Despite reported cases documented in this report of rape, fraud, paedophile pornography, misuse of funds, harassment, theft, forgery, striking and wounding, depraved behaviour, aggression, corruption and conflict of interest, only one individual has been dismissed in the last five years."
"The Commission's own disciplinary process is clearly unable to take the appropriate action against employees who commit hideous and, in some cases, criminal offences."
"This Parliament needs to know that those responsible for this failure have themselves been removed from their posts."
"What new immediate measures are being put in place to improve the process and what police action has resulted from any of these infringements over the last five years?"
"I ask you to refer this matter to President Prodi as a matter of urgency."
"(Applause from the right)"
"Your comments have been noted, we have your document and we will pass it on to Mr Prodi."
"Mr President, on a point of order, Mr Heaton-Harris' speech was printed in The Times this morning, which is helpful because this means that I can respond to it now."
"I have checked his information with the Commission."
"In an administrative note dated 29 July 2002 the Commission reports that since 1998 there have been 49 - not 50 - disciplinary cases."
"Of these, nine resulted in dismissal - not one."
"One was for professional incompetence, eight for serious disciplinary offences and 32 other cases attracted a range of penalties."
"Only eight out of 49 cases did not lead to a conviction."
"Therefore Mr Heaton-Harris got his facts wrong."
"I know we have a difference on certain issues relating to Commission reform but we should be able to conduct a discussion based on facts not fiction."
"(Applause from the left)"
"Europe and its citizens are a much-debated topic."
"Recently, I received a complaint from Dutch citizens in Bellingwolde, a village situated on the Dutch-German border."
"The complaint was about the windmills which the German Government had installed very near the border, allowing green electricity to flow into Germany, while the Dutch village is landed with the pollution."
"This is what the Dutch wanted to lodge a complaint about to the European Commission."
"According to the Commission's website, any citizen can have recourse to Eurojust, a system which offers help and advice to people with a problem of a legal nature in connection with the application of Community law."
"On its website, the Commission pledges that a network of legal advisers is on standby in the different Member States to give legal advice free of charge."
"This is an excellent pledge, but unfortunately, it does not apply to the Netherlands."
"There is nobody on standby in the Netherlands."
"In fact, the Commission's representation in The Hague has been waiting for a legal expert to be appointed for years."
"Until such time, the Dutch cannot gain any legal advice about complaints, and are sent from pillar to post."
"Mr President, we urge you to broach this subject with the Commission as a matter of urgency."
"This is about a practical and specific problem faced by EU citizens who want to uphold their rights."
"It is unacceptable for a Dutch village that wants to fight the pollution generated by German windmills to have no rights in practice."
"We will draw your remarks to the attention of the Commission."
"There will be a debate on the Middle East on Wednesday."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"As you know, Rule 2 states that Members of the European Parliament shall exercise their mandate independently, they shall not be bound by any instructions and shall not receive a binding mandate."
"I have heard on good authority that there was a meeting of the Pesca Group of Fisheries Ministers in Portugal on or around 15 September 2002, that is to say the Fisheries Ministers of Spain, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy and Portugal."
"I have further heard that at that meeting there was some discussion of three draft European Parliamentary reports, one by Mr Jové Peres and two by Mr Varela."
"If this is the case then that seems to me to be a most scandalous attempt to violate the independence of Members of this House in carrying out their functions as rapporteurs."
"I would ask you to draw it to the attention of the presidency of the Council that such behaviour by sections of the Council is unacceptable, and to ask the Chairman of our own Fisheries Committee that he should ask his rapporteurs to ensure that they act with independence as rapporteurs for this House."
"It is rather flattering that the Council takes our reports so seriously and wants to discuss them in such a manner."
"I take your point, but none of the political groups has asked for a debate despite the fact that they are free to do so."
"Another way of looking at it could be that we in this House are so impressed by the work of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee that we have full confidence in it."
"Mr President, as Mr Heaton-Harris has obviously got hold of the wrong figures, I would just like to briefly repeat what Mr van Hulten has just said, namely that nine dismissals were requested."
"Let me point out to Mr Heaton-Harris that, for technical reasons, eight of these were described as 'removals' and one only as a dismissal, so I would ask you to look at these matters carefully."
"I wish Mr Heaton-Harris and other Members would put a stop to their smear campaign against the Commission and stick to the relevant facts when carrying on their dispute with the Commission and with Commissioner Kinnock."
"Mr President, I can add to what Mr van Hulten and Mr Swoboda have said, having had the opportunity last week to read the Commission's report on disciplinary measures because a British journalist wanted to interview me about it."
"Some Members may find it of interest that this lady had once been Mr Heaton-Harris's personal assistant."
"I have just one point to add to what Mr Swoboda and Mr van Hulten had to say."
"Mr Heaton-Harris has just asked what the Commission is considering doing about informing the law-enforcement services."
"The lady journalist asked me the same question, to which I responded by asking whether it was not the case in all European countries, as it is at any rate in my own homeland, that disciplinary proceedings are set in motion only after the law-enforcement services and the relevant tribunals have decided on the prosecution of offences."
"This leads me to wonder whether Mr Heaton-Harris has got the sequence of events right."
"I hope so."
"Mr President, while fully acknowledging the right of all the Members to speak, I would like, once again, to call upon the House to avoid antagonistic statements, confusing tragic situations such as those just mentioned - immigration tragedies taking place in Italy - with situations and decisions made by the Italian Government relating to matters of infrastructure."
"I believe that, with due regard for Parliament's role, when we choose to engage in controversial debate just for the sake of it, we are not helping either ourselves or the people afflicted by these tragedies."
"Mr President, we have been following the statements issued by the American administration over the last few days with mounting anger and anguish; basically, come what may, even if Saddam's dictatorship agrees to allow weapons inspectors in, Iraq is going to be attacked."
"The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece - and I believe the people of Greece as a whole - are opposed to any such eventuality."
"With or without the blessing of the UN."
"We consider it absolutely absurd that the UN, which was founded in order to resolve differences peacefully, should be used to rubber stamp this sort of crime."
"But what incenses us most is that the American leadership has no compunction about advertising its highly dangerous position on a pre-emptive strike."
"Do you realise that what we have here is the worst kind of terrorism, targeting anyone who refuses to accept the hegemony of the United States, which has granted itself the right to attack anyone it considers represents or might represent a threat?"
"The question, Mr President, is this: faced with this situation, is the European Parliament going to confine itself to playing Pontius Pilate and giving in?"
"Whatever happens, we believe that our nations urgently need to join forces against this neo-Nazi policy and stop the paranoid criminals governing the United States of America."
"Mr President, in connection with the Sixth Framework Programme, we have, in this House, had in-depth discussions on the protection of embryos."
"At the time, enormous pressure was brought to bear on the defenders of ethical principles, who were told that, important as the issue was, it must be not be allowed to lead to the blocking of this important research programme, of which the protection of embryos formed only a very small part."
"We are now in a situation in which the very same people who said that then are trying to block the whole Framework Programme because of an attempt by a qualified majority in the Council - that is, by quite legal means - to implement ethical principles that we should actually have laid down at an early stage."
"I would like to know what, if anything, makes it legitimate for Mr Westendorp to go around claiming to speak for Parliament and declaring that we want a Budget reserve for all or part of the programme."
"I do not recall us ever coming to such a decision in plenary."
"So I ask that tomorrow's trilogue with the Council should not address issues on which this House has never voted!"
"Mr President, on a point of order, from the reply you gave me you have misunderstood the point I wanted to make."
"I totally agree with you that this House should always be delighted when the Council as such pays attention to our reports."
"However, the point to which I was drawing attention is that a subset of Council, the Pesca Group, is said to have held a meeting in which it discussed drafts of reports to this Parliament which have not yet been seen by the committee; in other words, that they have been ""cooking up"" reports ahead of their being seen by the committee."
"If true, that would be a grave infringement of the rights and privileges of this House and a breach, in effect, of Rule 2 of our Rules of Procedure."
"I wish to lodge a protest about that and suggest that it be taken up with the Presidency of the Council and with the chairman of our own Committee on Fisheries."
"You are quite right, I did misunderstand your original remarks."
"That concludes this item."
"The next item is the report (A5-0276/2002) by Evelyne Gebhardt, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the initiative by the French Republic with a view to the adoption of a Council Decision setting up a European Judicial Training Network (13348/2000 - C5-0757/2000 - 2000/0829(CNS))."
"Thank you, Mr President, for allowing me to speak on behalf of Mrs Gebhardt, who has at the last moment been prevented from being here, and has asked me to deliver the statement that follows."
"Making Europe an area of freedom, security and justice is a very ambitious objective for the EU as a whole, but primarily a very central one, promising protection to almost 380 million people in fifteen countries."
"This area of freedom and justice is intended, at the same time, to allay fears."
"If this area is to be created, we need legislation on it at European level to be very well constructed, and on this we are, step by step, making good progress, but we also have to create an infrastructure to build on if we are not to end up with a ruin and give our citizens good cause for disappointment."
"The resolution before us is concerned with an important element in this infrastructure, dealing as it does with the training of lawyers at European level."
"Widely divergent systems and legal traditions mean that there are difficult issues to be resolved in this context."
"The French Government came up with an interesting proposal, which Mrs Gebhardt improved by making corrections, adding to the proposal at a number of points."
"It is thanks to the good cooperation of all involved that a good outcome has been achieved, one which the committee was able to adopt with only one abstention."
"One of these amendments has to do with the legal basis; whereas the French proposal takes as its basis Articles 31 and 34 of the Treaty on the European Union, ours is founded on Article 42, firstly in order to keep bureaucracy within limits, and secondly, in order to facilitate flexible extension of the network."
"The French proposal refers only to judges in the criminal law field who wish to receive such training."
"That is not enough."
"Civil law is a natural part of the area of freedom, security and justice, which is not created only by judges."
"There is room for all professions concerned with the law and the administration of justice - such as lawyers, public prosecutors and police officers in the United Kingdom - to play their appropriate parts."
"An understanding and acceptance of the different legal systems needs to be promoted in all these professions, or else there will be a lack of trust leading to them resisting judicial measures originating from a different legal system, even though they have to be accepted and implemented as if they were rulings originating from their own national legal system with which they are familiar."
"Smooth and speedy completion of procedures promotes public confidence in the area of freedom, security and justice that they are promised."
"What is self-evident in the business world must also become the rule in the judiciary, namely that success comes from learning more."
"It is that success that is made certain by the Judicial Training Network, which also makes life easier for those who work with the law."
"That is urgently needed."
"What is evident from the report on Pro Eurojust's activities in 2000 is that those who work with the law in the different Member States do not always find it easy to work together efficiently, whether this be because of differences in the legislation or insufficient language knowledge in their specialised field."
"A strong training network would make it possible to remove such obstacles, so let us get one connected up!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Evelyne Gebhardt, on her report and express my agreement with the principle that judicial cooperation at European level can work more effectively if the main practitioners concerned, in other words judges and magistrates, are given ongoing training."
"The need for this was acknowledged and reaffirmed by the Heads of State or Government at the Laeken European Council, who gave a new boost to the project of creating a training network."
"In the debate following up the initiative of the French Government, the Commission raised a series of questions of a legal and technical nature about the creation of a judicial training network."
"The Commission's concerns were specifically the following: first, the independence of magistrates, which must be safeguarded."
"Rather than imposing rigid training schemes, judges and magistrates should be given the necessary means to design and undertake this training in a flexible way."
"Secondly, account must be taken of already existing structures and available awareness-raising instruments, such as the European judicial network and the European civil and commercial network, must be fully exploited."
"Lastly, consideration must be given to the broad problem of the division of judicial cooperation issues between the first and the third pillar of the Treaty, which, in our view, requires the adoption of two identical acts, a problem which is aggravated by specific features of the opt-out protocols pertaining to Denmark, the United Kingdom and Ireland."
"By supporting this initiative, the European Parliament has sought to respond to these questions, specifically this last issue of the dual legal basis."
"The Commission fully acknowledges the rapporteur's efforts but does not subscribe to the 'bridge' formula laid down in Article 42 of the EU Treaty, which we consider to be disproportionate and somewhat unrealistic."
"We share the idea that the division of judicial issues between two pillars creates difficulties."
"We take the view, however, that the most effective way of overcoming these difficulties would be to abolish the pillar structure in the Convention on the Future of Europe."
"In the working paper that the Commission presented on the 'European Judicial Training Network? we advocated three possible options: one is to create a training network by means of a Council act, another is to create a Community agency for this purpose and the third option is to keep the existing network operational and at the same time increase the support given to it by the Union."
"The Coreper of 27 June of this year reached broad agreement in principle on the third option, emphasising the importance that it attaches to the actions of the existing network and to strengthening its activities."
"The Commission considers that, at the current juncture, this is the formula that best matches needs and which is most likely to achieve positive results."
"The network has, in fact, already started to work along these lines."
"The Council has adopted the Framework Programme on Police and Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters; the AGIS programme based on the Community framework model of activities designed to facilitate judicial cooperation in civil matters."
"The Commission is of the view, therefore, that we already have programmes that are able to support activities to develop judicial training in Europe, in both the civil and criminal fields, which is a particularly important objective in light of the impending enlargement."
"Mr President, as has just been said this initiative was limited originally to the training of criminal law judges, but it was recognised that a second phase would be developed to address the training of civil and commercial law judges."
"There is a tradition in certain Member States that judicial independence should not be encroached upon."
"Indeed, this is enshrined in the Irish Constitution."
"Therefore, an appropriate solution needs to be found as to how to carry the work forward."
"I am sure we can find one."
"We already have an independent judicial training network."
"This particular initiative has been overtaken."
"I suggest that we now need to make immediate use of the existing network and to ensure, at the same time, that there is improved support for it."
"We really need to concentrate on the fight against terrorism which is, as we all know, national, European and global, and it is a priority for the European Union."
"I welcome the Council's determination, together with the Member States, to play a full role under the aegis of the United Nations in a global coalition against terrorism."
"Terrorist attacks are an attack on the most fundamental human right - the right to life."
"They are attacks under the cloak of night, human bombs in crowded streets and on buses; there are always victims of terrorism, as there are victims of crime, victims of man-induced famine."
"There is state-sponsored terrorism and terrorism of war and retribution, as we are witnessing in the Middle East."
"The form of terrorism that now threatens the world has no boundaries, no identifiable location."
"It moves money as well as infiltrating business, politics and worldwide legal and police systems with impunity."
"Ireland has had 30 years of terror, which effectively ended in stalemate."
"We should draw some lessons from that."
"Nations, cities, towns and most of all people are the victims of terrorism."
"The victims are the real prisoners of terrorism; the perpetrators all too often walk free."
"I would like to pay tribute again to the rapporteur."
"Mr President, it is thanks to the reform of the Rules of Procedure that we are here today discussing a text which - as has happened on many, too many occasions in Parliament - will be adopted by the Council in a different form from that in which it was submitted, while we are denied the chance to debate the European Union's proposals on terrorism, which are much more important in terms of the rights and freedoms of the European citizens than the document we are now compelled to debate."
"I refer, in particular, to Mr Galeote Quecedo's report, which examines two proposals made by the Kingdom of Spain."
"We are going to vote on this report tomorrow without even having the chance to debate it."
"I am talking about texts on which the Commission itself, which is usually slow to adopt positions, has expressed convincing reservations of a legal and political nature, which are, moreover, appended to our report."
"I am sad to say that the major Parliamentary political groups, clearly concerned to conceal the contents of the measures from public opinion, have decided to deprive the House even of the usual semblance of a debate."
"This is deplorable."
"Thus, we are not going to talk about the Kingdom of Spain's proposal on police and judicial cooperation to combat terrorism, a proposal which we could certainly endorse."
"However, the proposal to use joint investigation teams, as well as Europol and Eurojust, to facilitate such exchanges raises problems which Parliament has mentioned on several occasions: the absence of democratic and judicial control over Europol and Eurojust and their essential lack of connection to the Community; the lack of specific guarantees concerning the action of members of the joint investigation teams."
"Such aspects, relating to investigations and criminal procedure, are in many cases codified in detail at national level as part of the Member States' legal codes or even their constitutions so as to be able to determine the rights and duties of the parties involved."
"All this is lacking at European level"
"The second proposal of the Kingdom of Spain is also being concealed from the citizens."
"This relates to the mechanism for evaluating the legal systems and their implementation at national level in the fight against terrorism, which, as explained by the European Commission, is still unacceptable because it is incomplete and unspecific and its legal basis is misapplied."
"In other words, once again, the fight against terrorism is being used as a pretext for riding roughshod over principles and rules."
"Indeed, the initiative goes beyond what is authorised under the proposed legal basis and the evaluation comes on top of that already provided for under the Framework Decision on the fight against terrorism."
"We must ensure that the Council hears what we have to say, rejecting a text which will never be approved and rejecting texts which are based on the intention to combat terrorism even at the cost of undermining the fundamental freedoms and rights which are at the heart of democracy itself."
"The major political groups have decided not to discuss these issues, whereas a debate is necessary and would have yielded useful results."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be at noon tomorrow."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0257/2002) by Robert Evans on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on Common asylum procedure and internal security (COM(2001)743-C5-0129/2002 - 2002/2053(COS))."
"Mr President, as you said, this report - on an 'open-coordination-method' common asylum policy and internal security - covers two methods."
"It is really two reports in one."
"It should have been two separate reports but owing to Parliament's Rules, and also to time restraints and organisational factors, it is a single report."
"The whole approach of the common asylum policy is integral to the work of our committee and we are very much committed to it."
"Regarding the open coordination method, we stress that this must not be a substitute for Parliament's involvement in the whole process of working towards a common asylum policy and indeed a common immigration policy: we are committed to the full communitarisation of these topics."
"It is very important that Parliament has a full role in the legislative process in this area."
"We welcome the open coordination method."
"The sharing of statistics and everything else it involves must not be seen as a substitute for moving towards the full communitarisation of a common asylum policy with full involvement for Parliament."
"We must also ensure that using the open coordination method does not reduce asylum policy to the lowest common denominator of Member States' current policies."
"We want high standards."
"We want best practice to be followed."
"Accordingly, the open coordination method must be used as a transition period towards a second stage where asylum is a full legislative agenda item."
"Furthermore, best practice in the open coordination method should not be seen as a substitute for the Geneva Convention and the relevant Protocol thereto."
"We must put pressure on all Member State governments to integrate asylum policy, and indeed immigration considerations, into all policy areas as a horizontal policy objective."
"The second part of the communication is on internal security. This has clearly been moved up the agenda since the events of 11 September last year."
"We must ensure that Member States' provisions already existing under the Geneva Convention exclude persons who have been involved in terrorist activities, crimes against humanity or other similar offences which are already clearly defined."
"We must make certain that these provisions are presented in such a way as to ensure that terrorists do not enter EU territory via the asylum procedure."
"There is no evidence at the moment that would-be terrorists are entering the European Union or any Member States and seeking asylum, but the report seeks to make absolutely clear that there are safeguards and procedures to cover that eventuality."
"It is crucial that the measures that are introduced to deal with the threat to internal security are proportionate, that they are effective and above all that they safeguard human rights."
"I welcome the Commission's commitment to using only the Geneva Convention exclusion clauses as a basis for rejecting individuals' claims for asylum, but I urge the exclusion clauses to be used carefully."
"I reiterate that the EU must have a consistent approach and should not extradite individuals to countries where they may be at risk of incurring the death penalty."
"We need to be absolutely clear on the status and treatment of people who are excluded from international procedure, but who are non-removable from EU territory owing to any of the different reasons which may lead to this status."
"In general, with certain reservations that I have outlined, we welcome the Commission's commitment in this report to ensuring that access to asylum procedure is guaranteed."
"I ask that the exclusion clauses should not be routinely considered for practical as well as humanitarian reasons."
"I have tabled some amendments to this report either to correct minor errors or owing to setbacks in committee, but these do not detract from the importance and significance of the report."
"I commend the work that Commissioner Vitorino has been doing in moving towards a common European policy on asylum."
"There is no way forward other than for all 15 Member States to have a similar policy with guidelines that are not just similar but the same, and which are recognised and enforced by all Member States."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Seville European Council marked a major commitment in the field of asylum."
"It set the end of 2003 as the deadline for the adoption of all the legislative instruments of the first generation of acts concerning European asylum policy."
"In my view, this commitment by the Heads of State or Government is important for gauging the credibility of European policy in a field as sensitive as asylum policy."
"I shall not hide the fact from Parliament - and never have done - that negotiations are currently giving some cause for concern. To be precise, I do not believe that the solution lies in a form of harmonisation that is tied to the lowest common denominator."
"This is clearly not where the added value of a European asylum policy lies."
"In parallel with these negotiations, however, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr Ruud Lubbers, attended the informal Justice and Home Affairs Council in Copenhagen last week, and alerted us to the important decisions that will be taken at the next meeting of the executive committee of the High Commission: the approval of an agenda for international protection that will contribute, I am certain, to the debate on the major issues of asylum policy at world level and, consequently, also at European level."
"With regard to today's report, I thank and congratulate the rapporteur for the content of his report."
"The Commission is certainly proposing to introduce the open method of coordination into the field of asylum and immigration policies. I wish once again to make it clear, however, that we do not consider there to be any incompatibility between the open method of coordination and the adoption of legislative measures on asylum at European level."
"In fact, adopting legislation is an important part of creating a common asylum policy; the management of asylum policy can benefit from the open method of coordination, from convergence and from the harmonisation of the practices, measures and guidelines implemented by national administrations in the field of asylum."
"I shall not hide the fact that not all the Member States are in agreement on applying the open method of coordination to the asylum policy."
"The fact is, however, that the Council itself recently followed the guidelines proposed by the Commission to request the creation of a network of actors in the field of asylum with a view to exchanging information and to studying current practices."
"The Commission, for its part, intends to use these instruments to identify new fields of action in relation to asylum - not only a comparison of policies, but also the idea of sharing best practice."
"There is, therefore, no contradiction between the open method of coordination and communitarisation, as generated by the Treaty of Amsterdam, and we even think that in the European Convention on the Future of Europe and in the context of the future Intergovernmental Conference, this compatibility between these two types of instruments must be demonstrated and emphasised."
"With regard to the second dimension of the report: we will deal with the issue of the balance between internal security and the obligations of protection."
"The Commission maintains, in the document that we forwarded to Parliament on the relationship between safeguarding internal security and complying with the obligations and instruments of international protection, that it is possible to achieve an equitable balance between improving internal security in Europe, especially following the events of 11 September 2001, and ensuring that the rights of refugees and other values that are crucial to Europe's democracies are protected."
"The Commission welcomes the fact that the report we are debating here today shares this basic approach and recommends that genuine refugees and asylum seekers must not be victims of the events of the last year, but also that no opportunity must be given to those who support or commit terrorists acts to gain access to the territory of the Member States of the European Union."
"For this reason, the Commission fully supports the guideline adopted and reiterated by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, that the appropriate approach to follow must not be based on major changes to the refugee protection system but must be based instead on the application of the exceptions to the protection conferred by the Convention on refugees in the form of exclusion clauses."
"We share the opinion that these clauses must be used in accordance with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees' own interpretation of them."
"Finally, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to emphasise that the Commission subscribes to the European Parliament's explicit call to reaffirm the Union's policy that individuals cannot be extradited to countries where they could face the death penalty for their crimes and where there are no acceptable guarantees that can be legally enforced within the framework of a fair and equitable trial."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, negotiations on a common European asylum policy are proving to be tough and difficult."
"It often appears as if we are stuck on a road going nowhere."
"However tendentious this House's debates on the subject may have been, MEPs are not at fault in this."
"Although we have done prompt work in this area, we have a right to be consulted and nothing more."
"As we are all aware, the Council has to reach a decision unanimously."
"This does of course mean that the Commission deserves all praise for trying to find new ways ahead, but I tell you that the open coordination method is not a solution - at any rate, not in Parliament's eyes."
"Unlike the rapporteur, the PPE group is firmly opposed to the introduction of an open coordination method in the area of asylum policy."
"We see an open coordination method as leading to the Community decision-making procedure being bypassed and to Parliament being left on the sidelines."
"That would be the first step towards returning asylum policy to the intergovernmental level and towards asylum policy ceasing to be one of the European Community's responsibilities."
"Quite apart from the fact that a majority in the Convention are convinced that asylum should continue to be governed by Community rules, we cannot and must not allow Parliament, which is the only European institution with any democratic legitimacy, to be shut out from the process of shaping a common asylum policy."
"That being the case, we in the PPE Group reject Mr Evans's report."
"Our group has other reasons for rejecting the report."
"The first is the call for a restrictive interpretation of the exclusion clauses of the Geneva Convention on Refugees."
"The second is the demand that it be ensured that applications are first examined by reference to the inclusion clauses of the Geneva Convention on Refugees, before any grounds for exclusion are taken into consideration - a deviation from current legal practice - and that accelerated procedures or admission procedures should not be used in such cases as a matter of routine."
"Thirdly, we reject the demand that routine checking for grounds for exclusion be prevented in the course of the processing of asylum applications."
"Nor will we in any way approve any attempt at nullifying Eurodac."
"We simply cannot have a situation in which biometric data - even fingerprints - taken from asylum seekers cannot be used for the purpose of investigating criminal offences."
"Security is of great value to the citizens of the European Union, just as it is to those who come here seeking protection and safety."
"To sum up, the PPE Group can approve Mr Evans's report only if a plenary vote adopts extensive changes which we, the European People's Party, have submitted in the form of amendments."
"Parliament must, though, firmly reject the open coordination method."
"Mr President, we would like to congratulate the rapporteur for having brought together two sensitive issues which many of us would prefer not to see linked since the question of security often provides a questionable alibi, feeding the prejudices of those who prefer to restrict asylum and develop a policy of deterrence towards those needing to exercise their individual and fundamental rights."
"We are pleased that we can concur with the rapporteur on his statements on the need to uphold human rights and civil liberties."
"We believe that civil liberties are not secondary to security; we are told that a key value of the European Union is the protection of freedom, justice and civil liberties, and we agree with the last speaker that we need to be vigilant on this."
"We also fully support the view that the governing principle must be that of international obligations, fairly and humanely applied."
"So for example, we can agree with paragraph 12, that immediate and general detention should be avoided."
"We also fully support conclusion 5 of the report, which stresses the need for an holistic approach towards asylum and immigration looking at this as a horizontal policy objective and considering all policy areas, particularly those with an external dimension, such as trade, development, environment and agriculture."
"We have long argued that we need to look at the effect of European Union policies in acting as push factors, and after Johannesburg we must be even more aware that what we are aiming for is sustainable development, reducing the causes of seeking asylum."
"We trust that will form part of the open coordination."
"We agree with the number of concerns raised about open coordination: in a number of other policy areas, it has almost become a democracy bypass, leaving out the European Parliament and often also national parliaments."
"But we hope that, through the open coordination method, solutions to difficult issues, such as finding best practice for legal entry for asylum seekers and other immigrants, will be found."
"Mr President, the asylum system is under pressure and in order to solve this problem, we must give priority to a common immigration policy."
"Mr Evans gets straight to the point in Paragraph 1 of his report."
"Pressure on the asylum system is indeed considerable."
"Many asylum seekers are knocking on Europe's doors."
"Experience has taught us that the majority of them do not fall within the definition of refugee as enshrined in the Treaty of Geneva."
"All manner of conceptions have come into being of what a 'refugee' actually is, and the Member States have developed secondary forms of protection."
"How difficult it is to establish any common ground is clearly obvious from the negotiations in the Council on the concept of refugee."
"It is therefore useful, based on the guidelines proposed by the Commission, to compare notes in terms of the Member States' legislation and policies in order to move forwards in joint partnership."
"However, the solution proposed in Paragraph 1 of the Evans report strikes me as misconceived for different reasons."
"It is, of course, a strange circular argument."
"The EU Member States, for reasons of their own, do not pursue an active immigration policy."
"The asylum system is getting overheated because many people who actually fall within the immigrant category still try to enter the EU via the asylum system."
"They are given the confusing label of 'economic refugees'."
"Should we solve this problem by adopting an active immigration policy?"
"That strikes me as a futile exercise."
"Surely, it will first have to be established that these people are not entitled to asylum."
"It is thereafter possible to address the content of the notion of an immigration policy."
"Is this desirable for the European Union?"
"I think that the views on this are very different in each Member State."
"This is also evident from the reactions to the Commission communication about an open coordination method for Community immigration policy."
"Accordingly, the Dutch Government explicitly does not view labour migration as a goal in itself."
"Research carried out by the Dutch Government has shown that this form of migration does not solve the Dutch problem of an ageing population or the bottlenecks within the labour market."
"I can imagine that this is probably different for other regions in the EU, but it is certainly not possible to adopt a straightforward, all-purpose policy here."
"Moreover, it would not solve anything."
"Rather than the asylum system, it would then be the immigration system that would guarantee the best ticket into the European Union."
"Even if the pressure would be off the asylum system, it would be transferred just as quickly to the immigration system and trigger off the same abuses."
"There is no easy solution to this problem."
"The best paragraph of the report is that in which a case is made for an integrated vision of asylum and migration issues, trade, development, the environment and agriculture, for as long as the gap between rich and poor is so immense, people will continue to try to build a better future for themselves and their children."
"This is a solution which will only bear fruit in the very long term, but it is the best one there is."
"Meanwhile, we in the European Union will need to continue to consider the practical implementation of our asylum and immigration policy, taking as its guidelines the notions of compassion and justice."
"We will need to employ compassion in receiving refugees who have been driven out of their own countries."
"This involves receiving them under humane conditions, as the report stresses, in fact."
"This should be accompanied by justice, which is not always easy, because it means justice not only in the form of access to the legal system, but also in the form of refusal and deportation."
"The exclusion provisions, which are very topical in the light of the events of 11 September 2001, also fall within the concept of justice."
"Needless to say, these must be used in moderation and with care, but the admission of people who are denied access elsewhere is, in fact, precariously naïve."
"If we want to safeguard the security of our citizens, then we ought to apply these provisions, for this has been something of a weakness in recent years."
"The Netherlands seemed to go out of its way to offer shelter to people who were denied reception in other countries, and is now experiencing the effects of this."
"I therefore endorse restrictive and careful application, but I urge you to apply the necessary dose of reality."
"Unfortunately, the world is not a paradise full of well-meaning people."
"Mr President, my impression - derived from item 1 as a whole - is that this report makes the serious mistake of confusing the sacrosanct principle of the right of asylum, which has been invoked and established on a number of occasions as one of the fundamental rights of the European Union, with the complex issue of immigration, which is, in any case, a different subject and should be addressed quite separately."
"The report before us deals with the need for a legal definition of the right of asylum, but item 1 of this report contains what is, or ought to be, an extremely disturbing admission, especially for its author."
"I am referring to the statement that the asylum procedure is often the only way to gain access to EU territory."
"If this is the case, the European Parliament's first task is to bolt the door to stop it, to prevent a major, fundamental principle of our legal tradition being distorted either by those seeking to exploit illegal immigration for unlawful ends such as organised crime, for example, whose intention is thus to use this principle as a means of obtaining entry to the European Union for those who not only are not entitled to it but who should be categorically prevented from setting foot on Union soil, or - worse still - by those seeking to enter the Union to carry out terrorist activities."
"The rapporteur states - and I say this with the utmost respect - in the tone of the author of 'Alice in Wonderland' that there is no proof that the right of asylum has been exploited to help terrorists enter the Union."
"I would like, if I may, to ask this question: since we know that thousands of potential terrorists and fundamentalists have penetrated the European Union - and we do not know how they got here, who they are or what nationality they are - how can we fail to draw the clearly logical conclusion that it is precisely the right of asylum that has enabled many of them to enter the Union?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, asylum policy is one of the hottest and most sensitive issues on the Community agenda."
"The last elections abounded with depressing examples of political advantage being taken of situations linked to asylum and immigration issues."
"The fact is that the drafting of mistaken asylum and immigration policies has contributed to the terrifying increase in xenophobic and racist reactions, which we can only condemn."
"Hence the need, which is greater than ever, for common immigration and asylum powers, confirmed once again at the Laeken Summit, which reiterated the need for a common asylum and immigration policy to be adopted by 2004."
"In fact, it is the Europeans citizens themselves who are hoping and calling for action that will add a European value to national policies, whose limitations are becoming increasingly clear, both in terms of security policies and of policies for safeguarding rights and fundamental freedoms."
"The proposal we are debating today supports the introduction of an open coordination mechanism, in which the implementation of a coordination policy must function as an incentive and as a means of harmonising national legislations and practices."
"We agree with the comments that Commissioner Vitorino has just made to the House underlining the need for legislative measures to be adopted at Community level."
"We agree with him not only when he refers to the need for this legislation and to strengthen the Community-led approach that he mentioned, but also because this mechanism, instead of representing genuine communitarisation, is a process that denies the European Parliament an active role in this process."
"It is also crucial that we create an equitable and effective asylum procedure, because this asylum procedure has frequently been the easiest means of gaining access to Union territory."
"Although we must be able to separate issues that must remain separate, specifically what falls under asylum and what falls under immigration, it must nevertheless be emphasised that it is equally crucial that we establish a common immigration policy that is rational and credible and which necessarily involves a policy of integrating these immigrants, and of effectively combating illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings."
"Not only for reasons of humanity, but also because we are constantly aware that this is also necessary in order to reduce the pressure that has been afflicting the asylum system."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Vitorino, it is cause for amazement that an institution such as the Commission should commit itself to the open coordination method."
"It is something of a Metternich method rather than a Monnet method, and the use of it by you - the European Commission - is an indication that your own approach to asylum policy has failed."
"That Mr Evans, the rapporteur, being British, should speak up for open coordination is not that surprising, but it is quite remarkable that you should adduce the Community employment policy as an example of how this method has been successfully used, as you have obviously not been following the current employment situation and the state of the labour market in the EU, otherwise you would be well aware of how open coordination has failed in this area."
"Let me make some comments on specific points."
"In the report, it is envisaged that asylum-seekers' biometric data will not be used in the investigation of crime until there is a separate system of European data protection in place for it."
"Vote for that, and you leave yourself open to the question as to why the general standard of data protection in the European Union and in its Member States is apparently not sufficient to offer asylum seekers adequate protection against the misuse of data."
"When it comes to data protection, we in Europe have the highest standards in the world."
"Why you should want to use such an absurd requirement to prevent the effective implementation of Eurodac and hence the protection of our citizens, remains a mystery."
"That this report should call for the procedure for acquiring refugee status to be speeded up is indeed a good thing."
"What we are dealing with here is indeed, in principle, just the checking of an application."
"That, too, is something the PPE-DE Group has been advocating for some time, yet it was your group, Mr Evans, that in various reports advocated one new appeals board after another, guarantees of legal redress that became ever more comprehensive and bureaucratic, the constant reduction of the State's right to submit evidence and hence, of course, more lengthy procedures."
"It would be nice if you were to back up the words in this report with actions in others."
"With my third observation, I come to what is our main problem. In this report, you have not a word to say about our society's real problems."
"You have not one word to say about how we should deal with those who support the committing of terrorist acts."
"What do we do when someone, with the provocation of our public in mind, wants to call his child Osama Bin Laden?"
"What do we do with people who publicly rejoice in the images of 11 September?"
"What do we do with Islamic preachers who preach hatred and violence?"
"How do we respond to people who by their words trample our free and democratic system of government underfoot?"
"Do we have to wait until these people commit a terrorist act before we are permitted to deport them, or before they cease to enjoy the rights of visitors?"
"It is that question that is currently being asked over and over again in our societies in view of the situation in which we find ourselves."
"It is to these questions that we must give answers."
"There is in fact nothing whatever about that in your report, but these are questions we will have to resolve in many future debates."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we all know that the events of September 11 and the war on terrorism are being used as an excuse in several Member States of the European Union to block progress on an integrated European asylum policy."
"The number of asylum seekers in the European Union fell by nearly two-thirds over the first 4 months of 2002, compared with the same period last year, having almost doubled over ten years."
"In Greece, which is usually generous towards asylum seekers, only 59 out of 2,810 applicants were granted asylum in the first half of 2002."
"This is a dramatic fall in comparison with 2001, when almost ten times as many applications were granted."
"At the same time, according to statistics from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, most mass movements of refugees are offered refuge by neighbouring, equally poor countries; fewer are opting to flee to the West, that is when they manage to get here at all."
"For example, out of four million Afghan refugees, only 38,600 asylum applications were filed in the Union last year, i.e. only one Afghan in a thousand asked for protection from the European Union; most fled to neighbouring countries."
"These statistics speak for themselves and claims that waves of refugees are supposedly threatening Europe and that we should pull up the drawbridge are groundless."
"At the same time, of course, xenophobia in the European Union is increasing, while the debate has lost sight of what it is that forces these people to travel so far from home in a bid to escape the endless violation of human rights in their own countries."
"It is not just that strict controls do nothing to prevent asylum seekers from heading for Europe; they encourage many to try and enter illegally, creating work for gangs of smugglers."
"And as a result, we end up counting corpses on our borders and coastlines and trying to deal with new forms of slavery and exploitation."
"We agree with the open method of coordination, Commissioner, but it is hardly an integrated solution to the problem and we trust that we shall have an integrated policy by the end of 2003."
"Mr President, I subscribe to the minority opinion of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms on this Commission communication, which is shot through from beginning to end with the notion of Europe as a fortress to which hundreds of thousands of victims of imperialist policy are denied access."
"It lines up perfectly with the xenophobia and racism which dominate the European Union, especially after September 11, as the Seville Council made perfectly clear."
"Unfortunately, the Evans report, give or take a few exceptions, follows in exactly the same vein."
"The Commission communication, which recommends introducing the so-called open method of coordination as a staging post on the road to complete convergence of the Member States' asylum policies, denies to all intents and purposes the spirit of humanity which should underpin asylum arrangements."
"It sets out new repressive measures, such as front security checks, a biometric database such as the Eurodac fingerprint system, gathering DNA etc., and all at a time when the percentage of asylum applications approved in the Member States of the European Union is already tragically low."
"For example, according to statistics from the High Commissioner for Refugees, Greece only approved 25 out of 2,838 or 0.8% of asylum applications during the first half of 2002 and only 34 refugees were granted temporary asylum on humanitarian grounds."
"These figures are a disgrace when you think that the overwhelming majority of people seeking asylum in our countries are from places such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Turkey, Iran or other countries with serious problems."
"And, unfortunately, there are more than a few who, instead of being granted asylum, are repatriated - to use the official term - in their country of origin, despite the fact that their very lives are at risk."
"Mr President, I should like to make two brief remarks following this most interesting and stimulating debate."
"Firstly, in reply to Mrs Boumediene-Thiery, I would draw her attention to the fact that these two issues were not brought together by the Commission."
"We addressed them in separate documents."
"We are discussing both of them today as a result of Parliament's organisational arrangements."
"For once you cannot blame the Commission."
"My second remark, in reply to Mrs Klamt and Mr von Boetticher, concerns the open coordination method."
"Since Amsterdam, it has been quite clear that the development of European asylum policy will take place in two stages ('generations')."
"The first generation will take the form of minimum common rules on a number of elements of asylum policy; the second generation, later on, will be based upon a common (maybe even 'single') European asylum system."
"In both generations it is undoubtedly quite clear that legislation will play a key role."
"You must recognise that, in spite of the fact that sometimes we do not agree on the solutions, the Commission has put forward all the proposals for the first stage of legislation only one year after Tampere."
"I freely acknowledge before the House, as I have always done, that finding a common level playing field on this legislation, even on minimum common rules, has been difficult in the Council."
"The Council is about to adopt a very famous rule based on one rule with 15 exceptions."
"If this was achieved in the field of chemistry it would probably merit a Nobel prize, having one rule with 15 different exceptions, one for each of the 15 Member States."
"We need to recognise that these minimum common rules are not sufficient."
"I therefore tried to put forward the idea of having a common European asylum policy by means of the open coordination method."
"The open coordination method does not go against legislation."
"However, its objective is to complement the insufficient outcome that I acknowledge will most probably be the concrete result of this first-generation legislation."
"I should like to draw your attention also to the fact that the open coordination method brings transparency into the system."
"This is the best way to respect the principle of subsidiarity."
"There cannot be a central managed asylum system in Europe."
"That would go against the principle of subsidiarity."
"Each Member State should be entitled to decide and to take into consideration asylum demands, and to decide in which cases they grant asylum status on the basis of minimum common rules at European level."
"The Commission considers that we need to exchange best practices, and to exchange information."
"That does not happen at present, and this means that the open coordination method has an added value in bringing transparency to the way Member States manage the system."
"Under our proposal, Parliament will be joining this exercise."
"I should like to make it plain that I do not want to go against any kind of communitarisation."
"On the contrary, I am trying to make sure that we take the necessary and consolidated steps to achieve the Treaty objective."
"I do not think the open coordination method is a cop-out."
"In the Lisbon agenda you will see a crystal clear reference to the open coordination method."
"If you see the proposals that the Commission has put forward on economic governance, you will see that our proposal is to use the open coordination method to determine legally-binding targets, making the open coordination method more effective and therefore achieving more concrete results."
"I respect your disagreement, but I do not think that I am wrong."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be at noon tomorrow."
"The next item is a joint debate on the following two reports:"
"A5-0309/2002 by Roberta Angelilli on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the Commission Green Paper on Compensation to crime victims (COM(2001) 536 - C5-0016/2002 - 2002/2022(COS))"
"and A5-0312/2002 by Giacomo Santini on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on a Proposal for a Council Directive to improve access to justice in cross-border disputes by establishing minimum common rules relating to legal aid and other financial aspects of civil proceedings (10856/2002 - C5-0423/2002 - 2002/0020(CNS))."
"Mr President, in its opinion on the Green Paper on compensation to crime victims, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market congratulates the Commission on the approach it has proposed and adopted and welcomes the definition of the three major objectives for possible action at Community level: firstly, the need to guarantee crime victims within the Union the possibility of obtaining state compensation, providing for a safety net for all Union residents; secondly, the need to adopt the necessary measures to limit the unfair effects that result from the great differences that currently exist between levels of compensation in the different Member States, which, in practice, vary according to the Member State of residence of the victim or the Member State in which they were the victims of the crime; and, thirdly, the need to facilitate cross-border victims' access to state compensation, ensuring that victims' access to compensation is not excessively dependent upon the place in the Union in which the crime was committed."
"However, the Committee on Legal Affairs has expressed some considerations - and I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Angelilli, for having included in the body of the text all the amendments contained in the Committee on Legal Affairs' opinion - to the effect that compensation should cover both material and non-material damage caused to the victim."
"Generous time limits should be set for the submission of claims for state compensation; similar provisions must apply concerning the dies a quo (the date from which the time limit is calculated) in order to avoid disparities in the way cases are treated."
"Moreover, it is crucial that harmonised compensation claims forms are drawn up in all the Community languages and that the minimum procedural guarantees include, inter alia, the right to impartial judgment, the right to be represented by a lawyer, the right of access to the procedure and easier access for cross-border victims to State compensation."
"In conclusion, the Community initiative on compensation to victims would indeed be a major contribution to the creation of a European area of freedom, security and justice."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, victim protection has already long been a topic of political discussion even at European level."
"Parliament has regularly called, ever since the 1980s, for an improvement in the position of victims of crime."
"That victims of criminal offences have to be supported and protected is not a matter of dispute; the only question is how this is to be done, and to what extent."
"With the Vienna Action Plan, Europe took up the issue of care and compensation for victims."
"In 1999, Parliament's agenda included an item on the improvement of the position of crime victims in the EU, and at Tampere there was a call for the establishment of minimum standards for the protection of crime victims."
"Today, we in Europe's Parliament are giving our opinion on the Commission Green Paper on compensation to crime victims."
"We are doing this out of the conviction that the rules of nation states on the compensation of victims are inadequate."
"It is unacceptable that victims should be compensated differently within the European Union, simply because, over and above the misfortune of falling victim of a crime, they were unlucky enough to be victims in the wrong country."
"To take one example, one Member State may take over the costs of psychiatric treatment of victims of sexual violence, whilst in others, the costs of all medical treatment needed as a result of other offences are covered."
"Looking at another area, the burden of proof in all Member States rests with the applicant for compensation, but there are great variations in the degree of proof, and another example is that, in certain Member States, it is required that an offence shall have been reported to the police before any compensation can be paid out, whilst in others that is not the case."
"I adduce these examples in an attempt to show the quite different assumptions on the basis of which the fifteen Member States work."
"Critics of the Commission and of Parliament charge that we are too slow to pass and implement resolutions on the protection and compensation of victims, and the criticism is also levelled that this Green Paper is aiming at a Community initiative in the form of minimum standards."
"What is sought by many victim-support organisations is harmonisation."
"I can well understand why it is victim-support organisations in particular that seek speedy solutions, but many small steps and comprehensive educational work are needed if we are to achieve the objective of Europe-wide victim protection."
"That means finding and deciding on common rules for all, in all the Member States."
"It is, then, all the more important to take the first step of laying down minimum standards for State compensation for those victims of criminal offences who get no compensation from their assailant or by other means."
"All this is covered by this Green Paper."
"This is a good approach, and, on behalf of the PPE Group, I welcome it as being the right way towards Community rules for victim support in the EU."
"I would like to conclude by expressing my thanks to Mrs Angelilli, firstly for her excellent report, but also for her willingness to support the many compromise amendments which crossed group boundaries."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are now considering two reports that form part of a set of measures designed to promote the creation of an area of security, freedom and justice in order to provide a useful response to the everyday concerns of Europe's citizens."
"I congratulate Roberta Angelilli and Giacomo Santini, because both reports make it clear that the enormous challenge we face consists of creating a genuine area of justice, in which European citizens can see their integrity protected, enjoy access to justice and have their rights guaranteed regardless of the place in which they live and as easily as if they were in their own country."
"The Angelilli report is concerned with citizens who have been victims of crime."
"It is crucial that we devote all our efforts to preventing secondary victimisation."
"It is unacceptable that someone who has been the victim of a crime should be victimised once again because the system provides them with inadequate or non-existent protection."
"Mrs Klamt has already given paradigmatic examples of some such situations."
"Compensation must be awarded for losses and damage sustained in a way that is immediate, full and effective."
"The Member States must, to this end, promote the appropriate harmonisation of their legal and regulatory provisions, because it is unfair that, as a result of the profound disparities that exist, there should be unjustifiable differences in the compensation to which European citizens are entitled merely because they have been crime victims in one particular part of the European Union rather than another."
"The citizens must also have accessible and full information on these rights, provided in the various Community languages."
"Often rights are not exercised not because they are not in place or are not regulated, but because the citizens are not able to access this information."
"The Santini report is based on the observation that the exercise of the freedom of movement will lead to a huge increase in cross-border cases involving individuals with such modest incomes that they might not be able to access justice or benefit from adequate legal aid."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights, specifically Article 47, provides that legal aid is to be made available to those who lack sufficient resources in so far as such aid is necessary to ensure effective access to justice."
"We therefore agree that, as already laid down in the Tampere conclusions, minimum rules that guarantee an adequate level of legal aid for cross-border legal disputes throughout the Union must be established, whilst emphasising, nevertheless, that the Member States always have the option of laying down more favourable provisions in line with their own traditions."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Santini, who I have been shadowing on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"It is a very good report."
"However, we have done ourselves some damage."
"As has been referred to, this will not be viewed easily or lightly accepted by the Council because we have wrongly broadened the scope."
"I agree absolutely with the principles within Mr Santini's report, but we have to be realistic on a consultation process on how to achieve those principles."
"This is particularly about cross-border disputes."
"If we make it include internal disputes, we create a great deal of problems not only for the Community but also for those Member States that will have to face the potentially huge legal bills that will follow."
"That is why I will recommend to the Socialist Group that we support the amendment by Baroness Ludford which reintroduces the notion that this refers specifically to cross-border disputes."
"I welcome the fact that the Brussels 1 Regulation will apply to these disputes on the mutual enforcement of civil law decisions."
"Equally, I accept that it should not cover proceedings relating to tax, customs or administrative matters."
"However, I should introduce one correction."
"It may have been a linguistic matter, but Mr Santini said that citizens will be judged irrespective of their financial positions."
"This is not true because there is an upper limit set within the directive."
"I welcome that the victims of crime will be guaranteed legal aid in order to get compensation."
"We agree that legal aid should cover both pre-litigation advice and representation in court."
"We also back the proposal to include within the scheme mechanisms for resolving disputes outside the courts."
"I will finish as I began by congratulating Mr Santini but by expressing regret that, by broadening the scope and going far beyond that which we can achieve in the House, we are actually urging the Council not to accept our recommendations."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we have all fought for freedom of movement - which is a good thing - along with all that has developed from it, in order that people might have the fullest possible enjoyment of it."
"Here and there, alas, this freedom of movement brings with it adverse consequences, and both reports deal with this."
"The first report - Mrs Angelilli's, which has to do with the compensation of victims of crime - addresses a mechanism that would help to alleviate to some extent the effects of these unwelcome emergencies, which arise from freedom of movement itself."
"With that in mind, the attempt is made to lay down minimum standards across Europe, so that a citizen travelling from one State to another and sustaining some detriment, shall receive appropriate compensation under the same conditions."
"I welcome the way that this, in view of post-11 September discussions, is not being focussed only on the victims of specific offences, but that the range is being extended and the victims in question are being granted aid to minimum standards."
"It is also noticeable from the second report that the increase in cross-border disputes and offences is actually a consequence of freedom of movement and of the Common Market."
"That is why it is so important that we should see the EU as being also a social community, one that does not deny access to the law to people who have been affected by such offences but have fewer resources at their disposal."
"This step can, then, only be welcomed and supported."
"In particular, I welcome the way in which Mr Santini has put these into more concrete terms and enlarged upon them, stating for example, that the states should bear court costs or that the application for legal aid should be submitted to national authorities designated for that purpose."
"Alongside these, there are a plethora of other items that effect very real help for victims and for those with a claim on aid."
"Both reports help us as EU citizens to have a positive experience of life in the EU, with all the principles associated with freedom of movement, which we can and must make a reality."
"I congratulate both rapporteurs on these excellent reports."
"Many thanks!"
"Mr President, I would like to refer to Mrs Angelilli's remarks at the beginning of the debate, when she spoke of this issue as being very complicated from a legal point of view."
"I have no legal training whatsoever but I have no doubt, as the Commissioner mentioned in his comments on forging together the chemistry of 15 countries, that mutual cooperation across the legal systems and judicial processes of 15 countries is very difficult to achieve."
"From the point of view of the ordinary citizens of Europe, however, I would suggest that the notion of the victim of a crime is a very simple one."
"Whether while abroad on holiday, for business purposes or perhaps as a student, the victim of a burglary, a violent personal crime, or a terrorist attack takes that crime very personally and expects something to be done about it."
"We all suffer, indeed the whole idea of Europe suffers, if nothing is done."
"Victims become disenchanted and frustrated, and to them the whole idea of Europe seems to have failed."
"We are, then, absolutely right to do all we can to press forward in the ways outlined in these two reports."
"We need to look for common rules and common understandings and agreements on legal aid so that, as far as possible, people can receive the sort of support that they would expect in their own country."
"The Commissioner spoke about the European Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"This is a step forward, but people expect, since this Charter exists, that they are entitled to rights in other countries."
"We have established a common market for goods and capital and made it work as a kind of rich playground."
"So, just as the previous report called for common European standards on asylum, we are absolutely right to be calling for common European standards for the victims of crime and access to legal aid."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks, first of all, to the rapporteurs, but also to the Commission."
"You see, Commissioner Vitorino, that I am being very even-handed with praise and blame today."
"Let me start with victim support."
"Past decades saw well-known worldwide NGOs concerning themselves time and again with offenders in every corner of the globe, with the conditions under which they were detained and with their rehabilitation into society."
"Often, unfortunately, their victims were forgotten and left alone."
"Even today, far from all our Member States guarantee comprehensive victim support, particularly not to nationals of third States."
"In many States, as little account is taken of victims of offences of negligence as of victims who are unable to prove lasting or grave detriment."
"To date, only the victim compensation rules in the Scandinavian States - Denmark, Sweden and Finland - can be described as exemplary."
"Time and again, in my capacity as a member of the Committee on Petitions, I come up against cases in which compensation was either not paid out to victims, or it was at any rate unreasonably delayed, where even EU citizens in other EU States had applied for it."
"In the past year alone, a dozen petitions from victims of violent crime within the EU have been passed on to us."
"Admittedly, there has hitherto been no legal basis on which we would have been entitled to intervene."
"It is to be hoped that this will now change, particularly if the Commission allows its Green Paper to be followed up by definite legal acts."
"There is one thing we should not do at this juncture."
"We should not set up another EU fund, as it is intolerable that the Member States should evade their own financial responsibility in this matter."
"If the USA can manage to lift the financial burden from dependents of the victims of 11 September, wherever in the world and irrespective of their nationality, then it can also be expected of the Member States of the EU within their own territory."
"Mr Santini's proposal on legal aid is also a significant step towards the creation of this legal area."
"The regulation on cooperation and enforcement in civil and commercial cases is already in place, as is judicial assistance between the Member States of the European Union in criminal cases."
"This has enabled us to get quicker and simple cross-border justice for Europe's citizens, which means that time is pressing upon us when it comes to creating a European form of access to legal aid, by which means alone we will contribute to the fair application of existing European regulations to those who would otherwise be unable to take a case to trial."
"And, Mr Cashman, you are quite deluded if you believe that this can only apply to cross-border trials, for if you were to establish a higher standard for the whole of Europe, your own people would blow up a storm, and if you were to create a lower standard across Europe, you would have to answer the question as to why you were treating the EU's citizens worse than your own."
"That makes the approximation of laws absolutely necessary, and I do not know any reason why we should not go ahead with it on a Europe-wide basis."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by saying, on behalf of the Commission, that we very much welcome the joint text on the proposed regulation on animal by-products, agreed by the Conciliation Committee on 12 September."
"This proposal is the second major component in our defence barriers against BSE and other serious animal diseases."
"The first component was the regulation on TSEs adopted last year."
"This proposal is very important - it is essential for the safe collection, transport, storage, handling, processing and disposal of the millions of tonnes of animal by-products produced in the Union every year."
"The continued absence of a sound comprehensive regulatory framework to deal with these by-products would be a very dangerous thing indeed."
"I would like to express the Commission's sincere thanks to Mrs Paulsen, for her enormous efforts and tireless work, over nearly two years, in pursuing an agreement between the Commission and the Council on the proposed regulation."
"The position we have reached here today owes much to her personal commitment, tenacity and determination."
"I also thank, in particular, Mrs Caroline Jackson, chairperson of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and Mr Joseph Daul, chairperson of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for their valuable input."
"The Commission is greatly encouraged that all three institutions are in general agreement on four key principles."
"Firstly, that only animal by-products derived from animals fit for human consumption should be used in feed, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products."
"Secondly, that intra-species recycling - known as 'cannibalism' - should be banned."
"Thirdly, that certain provisions should be tightened in order to improve control and traceability in the animal by-products sector."
"Fourthly, that alternative disposal options should be approved to take into account scientific and technological developments."
"We are also pleased that the difficult issue of catering waste has finally been resolved."
"The solution permits a temporary relaxation of the ban on the use of catering waste in feed for some Member States, under certain highly controlled conditions to be established by the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health."
"The use of catering waste in feed constitutes a major threat of transmission of serious animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease and classical swine fever."
"It is certain that nobody would wish to see a repeat of the kind of outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease we recently saw in the UK, with its enormous losses to the farming and non-farming community."
"The Commission will now focus on preparing implementing measures - including the approval of alternative disposal methods and a derogation on intra-species recycling for fish and fur animals - as well as a number of transitional measures covering such matters as catering waste and used cooking oil, to bridge the gap prior to the application of the regulation."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Mrs Paulsen for the inclusive approach she has given all the other groups during first and second reading and secondly congratulate her on the way she represented Parliament during conciliation, particularly when dealing with some of our friends in the German Green Group, a difficult task at the best of times as I am sure Chancellor Schroeder has found out and will continue to find out."
"The European Union produces millions of tonnes of animal by-products and these are separated into three categories according to the risk to humans or animals."
"Category one, which contains specified risk material, was implicated in the spread of BSE."
"I am pleased that we also included in category one waste from airlines which may have come from countries that do not have the same standards as we do, although I am sure some people would say that some of the airline food would not be considered fit for human consumption anyway."
"There is category three, which is fit for human consumption, including catering waste, and category two, which is all the rest."
"The big issue at conciliation was that of catering waste and there we had two national problems."
"In the UK catering waste is banned."
"It was implicated in the start of the foot-and-mouth epidemic in the north-east of England and also in the inquiry into the Classical Swine Fever outbreak in East Anglia, which suggested that the cause might have been a discarded ham sandwich thrown into a field of outdoor pigs."
"But historically in the UK, we carried out our processing of catering waste on farms - so-called pigswill."
"This was very hard to control and it is not surprising that there were breakdowns in the way that was done."
"In some ways I wish that we had gone down the same route as the Germans and the Austrians which was not to process this material on farm, but to put in state-of-the-art multi-million pound installations which were run with typical German efficiency."
"Some of those are brand new and it would be unfair to shut them down at very short notice, particularly when one considers the alternatives as to where this waste would have to go."
"Maybe it would go into landfill, as much of the catering waste in the UK does, and that would be subject to rodents or seagulls taking part away and distributing it around the countryside."
"A second possible way of getting rid of it would be using incineration, which is both costly and damaging to the environment."
"It is very good that we negotiated this transitional period to 1 November 2006."
"I said that in the UK we do not have pigswill."
"We do, however, recycle waste oil produced from such establishments as fish and chip shops, that monument to the culinary art, but also from other catering establishments and private homes that produce waste cooking oil."
"In the UK this was a thriving cottage industry."
"Every week a 25 litre drum was taken away and the chef was given GBP 5, part of the black economy."
"This was taken away to be processed into animal feed."
"However, when doubts were expressed about the continued use of this, the collectors started to charge a fee and at that point the chefs made alternative arrangements."
"That meant it went down the drain. That has resulted in blocked sewers and other environmental problems as congealed fats and oils interfere with the infrastructure below our streets taking away the waste water."
"It is important that the UK gets an extension to give it time to review the situation, to evaluate the risks of the continued use of cooking oil, although personally I think they are insignificant, and to put in place systems for alternative uses such as biodiesel."
"Mr President, the first task of anyone who has served on the Conciliation Committee must be to congratulate Mrs Paulsen for her drive and tenacity in surviving a complex conciliation which was at times almost overturned by some very unorthodox manoeuvres."
"That would not have been right for Parliament, and I am glad that the various parties to this agreement converged in this way."
"Mrs Paulsen had to keep her nerve because events elsewhere, including elections, were bringing special pressures to bear on the way in which these events were being looked at."
"Yet she was vindicated the whole time by the saga of continuing food contamination scandals which went on in a number of Member States right through 2002 and in the way in which this matter has worked out."
"We know all about full traceability for specified risk materials in the United Kingdom because we were forced in the wake of BSE to introduce, almost at gun-point, something which is now going to be uniform across the Community."
"This is all to the good."
"I believe that the number of by-products that have found their way into the food chain this year show us that perhaps even now, and later when this regulation is fully enforced, there will still need to be vigilance to ensure that above all else the principle of separation is rigorously upheld."
"I turn to the questions mentioned already by Mr Goodwill regarding the problem some Member States have experienced."
"I am glad that we have found a solution which leaves a temporary period of transition, rather than shrugging aside the need to bring this matter to a conclusion."
"I make no comment on the situation as regards the Austrian and German industries and confine myself to the United Kingdom."
"In the United Kingdom we had certain specific problems: perhaps the Commissioner can make a note of them, because in the final statement we will need to see how these are addressed in connection with the transition."
"The first question, familiar to Mr Goodwill, is of small incinerators which have been used as an extremely sensible way of destroying fallen stock on site with the minimum period of contamination risk."
"We need to be sure, during the transition period for inspection, that the reasons why these have been used, and used effectively, are fully understood by the Commission and that they are not simply arbitrarily removed from the scene."
"The second area is the question of cooking oil."
"The United Kingdom is now prepared to accept, rightly, that the transition period should be two years instead of four years and that in that time, given that this whole directive is only going to take effect something like eight or nine months from now, there will have been an adequate period for the industry concerned to adjust its practices - and probably its profits - to other ways of disposing of this, particularly in the field of biofuels."
"Lastly, I am glad the United Kingdom withdrew its objections relating to the application for a transition period for the land application of blood from slaughterhouses."
"This is a pretty repulsive habit."
"We could not have justified it and am glad that the United Kingdom withdrew its objections."
"In this matter, too, the principle of cleanliness and separation should be paramount."
"Mrs Paulsen has showed us the way and it is up to us to follow."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should sincerely like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Paulsen, who has guided us through the minefield of issues which this regulation has presented in an atmosphere of mutual consultation."
"I am pleased that this regulation provides a modern version of obsolete legislation on offal."
"After two years of negotiations, it was very much overdue."
"What is important in this regulation is that dead animals and condemned animal material can no longer be brought into the food chain."
"The only products which may still be used for the production of animal feed will be material derived from slaughtered animals declared fit for human consumption."
"Additionally, it is clear that the recycling of animal meal in animal feed is nothing short of cannibalism, and should thus be banned by introducing separate production lines and full traceability."
"This regulation's implementation should therefore be foolproof, and we have not heard the last of this, of course."
"Controlling cannibalism will require an important reorganisation of the sector that collects, and disposes of, animal waste."
"We are aware that there are quite a few tricksters and frauds active in this sector who are involved in very shady practices, and that this matter is highly susceptible to fraud."
"This will therefore require considerable efforts in the area of inspections on the part of the Member States, as Mr Whitehead rightly pointed out."
"I should like to finish off with a comment on kitchen and restaurant waste that contains animal products, on which we have reached a respectable compromise."
"It was not easy, but the compromise is before us, mainly thanks to pressure from our German and Austrian fellow MEPs."
"I do not want to hide the fact that this issue is very sensitive in my country."
"All agricultural organisations in Belgium insist on an absolute ban on this practice due to health risks."
"Minor causes can indeed have grave consequences, as was borne out by the outbreaks of foot and mouth disease and African swine fever."
"Despite this, I can tell you that the majority of my group will eventually be endorsing the texts before us."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me just start with warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Paulsen."
"I am committed to retaining the use of food waste as feed under appropriately strict conditions."
"Let me make it clear that we are talking here about dishes officially permitted for human consumption."
"Let those listening to me understand that, to take a couple of examples, this is about unsaleable bread that will no longer be fresh the following day, about left-over pieces of cake and that sort of thing."
"The prevention of disease is adequately taken care of by the heating of food waste in the manner prescribed, which furthermore facilitates proper recycling of such remnants and thereby acts as a deterrent against even more 'rubbish tourism'."
"Moreover, it provides pigs with a first-rate supply of essential amino and fatty acids, and makes it possible to reduce the importation of feedingstuffs."
"It is a fact that liquid feed, that is, swill, derived from food waste, is known to have relatively few negative effects on rearing pigs."
"There is a need to guarantee an appropriate standard of sterilisation in order to kill off pathogens."
"The outcome of the conciliation procedure, with the seven amendments, was indeed accepted by the Council without further ado, and, on the extremely important Amendment No 25, which embodies a comprehensive compromise, I welcome the Council's draft providing for transitional measures under stringently monitored conditions for at most four years from 1 November 2002 onwards."
"Any firm undertaking by the Commission to develop a directive on biowaste including kitchen and food waste, by the end of 2004, must primarily aim to stipulate safe use, recovery and reuse."
"Contamination has to be monitored, and we welcome this approach."
"It is the firms that have invested a great deal of money in these measures in order to meet the very highest standards, and are officially monitored, that are the best guarantee of food waste for feed being harmlessly removed and processed under controlled conditions."
"As has already been pointed out by those who spoke before me, we could give a whole catalogue of examples to demonstrate that no adequate guarantee can be provided by a general ban on feeding this sort of stuff to animals."
"What becomes of it then?"
"The future should find us still not destroying this valuable feed."
"Let me say in conclusion that, on this issue, I am myself a strong advocate of a regulation rather than a directive, because I can already see how these things will be transposed differently in different countries, because I have an inkling that competition will be distorted, and because, if something is wrong, then it is wrong everywhere, be it in Germany, in Austria, or in any other Member State in this internal market."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to express my gratitude to Mrs Paulsen for the good cooperation."
"The outcome is a respectable one."
"I believe that what have before us is a good regulation, one that meets Parliament's requirements arising from the committee of inquiry into BSE."
"The main reason why this is important is that we are not just talking about feeding methods or about the authorisation of feed subject to certain conditions; it is also being made clear what happens to those things that cannot be used in feed."
"Rules are therefore laid down on destruction."
"That is what we must also achieve when it comes to the area of food waste."
"A simple prohibition will not suffice, as it is not known what will then become of the stuff."
"As I have always said, you can't just chuck the stuff in a ditch."
"It is precisely then that it becomes hazardous, when, unsterilised and unmonitored, it can find its way to animals, possibly leading to the spreading of plague and foot and mouth disease."
"But not if it is sterilised."
"I am glad the Commission has acceded to this proposal and said that it will, by 2004, present a directive - and yes, Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, I too think it should be a regulation - on biowaste, in which it will lay down rules on all the possible uses of food waste, including its use as feed."
"It is unfortunate that the compromise we reached has not been minuted."
"As it will be the next Parliament that will have to negotiate about it - and things are forgotten very quickly - I will be distributing a note for the records which you can have a look at."
"We may be able to sign it, and then give this a permanent place as what we want as regards the handling of this issue in the next Parliament."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.15 p.m.)"
"Decision on urgent procedure"
"Mr President, a letter was sent from Commissioner Patten to the President of Parliament yesterday asking Parliament to adopt, as quickly as possible, Supplementary and Amending Budget No 4 in order to allow the budgetisation of the EUR 70 million for Afghanistan."
"The additional funding is consistent with the pledge made by the Commission in Tokyo last January."
"At the trialogue which was held yesterday evening between 9 p.m. and 10.30 p.m., an agreement was reached between the representatives of Parliament and the Council that Supplementary and Amending Budget No 4 should be adopted as quickly as possible, as already approved by the Council."
"On the basis of the letter from Commissioner Patten, could I ask you to consider the vote on the SAB 4 as an urgency, so that we can adopt it during this part-session?"
"If that is agreed to, then we will be calling a meeting of the Committee on Budgets at 10.30 a.m. this morning."
"I should therefore like to inform those of my colleagues who do not already know, that there will be a meeting of the Committee on Budgets at 10.30 a.m. today in place of the coordinators' meeting that was planned."
"As soon as your Committee tables the report, it can be placed on the agenda."
"As there are no problems we will deal with it this week."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0289/2002) by Jonas Sjöstedt on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the transboundary movement of genetically modified organisms (COM(2002) 85 - C5-0079/2002 - 2002/0046(COD))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly like to thank Mr Sjöstedt, who is rapporteur for this subject and who has made a sterling contribution to this complicated area."
"It is an area that is important not only for ourselves here in Europe but also for the rest of the world and, in particular, for our partners in the developing countries."
"As you must be aware, the Protocol we are to debate today is linked to the European Community's recently implemented ratification of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety."
"The overarching purpose of this UN agreement is to establish common rules for the transboundary movement of genetically modified organisms with the objective of creating global protection of biological diversity and human health."
"The European Union must fulfil its international obligations."
"We must therefore incorporate the provisions of the Protocol on Biosafety into our legislation."
"This proposal supplements the Community's existing regulations, particularly on the issue of the export of genetically modified organisms, so that it is in greater accordance with the provisions of the Protocol on Biosafety."
"The proposal consists of the following main parts."
"Firstly, the obligation to give notice of exports of genetically modified organisms intended for deliberate release into the environment."
"Secondly, the obligation to inform our international partners about the Community's methods, legislation and decisions concerning genetically modified organisms, as well as about any unintentional release of such organisms."
"Thirdly, a set of rules to be used for identifying genetically modified organisms for export."
"These rules are in accordance with the latest developments within Community legislation on genetically modified organisms and, in particular, with the provisions of the draft regulation on traceability and marking."
"The present proposal contains no new special Community provisions concerning imports by one Member State from another, or movements between Member States, of genetically modified organisms."
"Such imports or movements will, in the future too, be covered by existing Community legislation."
"I would emphasise in no uncertain terms how important it is for the work on this proposal to proceed swiftly."
"The EU has played a key role in the international negotiations right from the beginning."
"We must show that there is no doubt that we shall fulfil our commitments and that we shall be able to implement the Protocol in full as soon as it comes into force."
"Mr President, when the Cartagena Protocol was adopted a couple of years ago, it constituted major progress both for the European Union and the EU countries."
"The Protocol is based on the precautionary principle and respects the right of states to have stricter national rules governing the trade in genetically modified products."
"The Protocol is an important example of the way in which global trade regulations can be based on environmental and consumer protection."
"It constitutes a positive alternative to parts of the World Trade Organisation's practice."
"With the adoption of the proposed law we are now debating, the Cartagena Protocol will become EU law."
"While existing EU rules would apply to imports, the proposed law would regulate exports from the EU."
"It is a matter of urgency that the rules be adopted."
"The number of countries ratifying the Protocol is increasing, so that it will soon be possible for it formally to come into force."
"By adopting this legislation, the EU can become a positive global example in this area."
"We in Parliament should like to cooperate closely with the Commission and the Council to ensure that these laws are made ready as swiftly as possible."
"As rapporteur, I believe that the Commission's proposed legislation has quite a few weaknesses."
"In important areas, the proposals do not go as far as the Cartagena Protocol itself, and in other areas the proposals create an unnecessary lack of clarity."
"I and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy therefore propose tightening up on a number of points."
"It must not be possible to export seeds or products not approved for use within the European Union."
"Only for reasons concerned, for example, with the climate, will it be possible for seeds to be exempted from this rule."
"We cannot have one set of safety and consumer protection measures for ourselves, and another set for others."
"In order for products to be approved for export, the importing country must be required expressly to have approved their importation."
"It must never be possible for a failure to respond to be interpreted as authorisation, as it in actual fact could be under the Commission's proposed law."
"That especially applies to countries with limited technical capacity in this area, for it is crucial to ensure that they genuinely recommend the imports and are able to handle them."
"The actual exporter shall always be responsible for notification."
"That is important in order to prevent a lack of clarity where the matter of responsibility is concerned."
"It is also more in line with what is in actual fact prescribed by the Cartagena Protocol."
"In the continued negotiations within the framework of the Cartagena Protocol, the European Union must support proposals for international regulations explaining companies' legal responsibilities."
"The public's right to information about what is exported must be both clarified and reinforced, at the same time as respect for legitimate company secrets is maintained."
"EU regulations must also make it unambiguously clear that exports to other countries must always respect the stricter rules which these countries are entitled to introduce, and this in full accordance with the Cartagena Protocol."
"I therefore hope to see the adoption of as large a proportion as possible of the amendments by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, as well as of the amendments tabled jointly by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"I also wish to thank the responsible Commission officials for their very helpful cooperation."
"I would also thank my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was in the year 2000 that the European Union signed the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, an international agreement which is now to be implemented, and as quickly as possible."
"The Protocol aims, by applying international rules to trade in living GMOs, to prevent effects detrimental to biodiversity and to human health."
"It governs the safe transfer, handling and use of genetically modified organisms, placing the emphasis on their movement across borders."
"For this there is to be a procedure involving the prior informed consent of the importing country."
"In the case of GMOs intended for immediate use as foodstuffs and feedingstuffs, or for processing, it envisages notification to the Commission or to the Biosafety Clearing House."
"The Regulation's provisions will apply only to export to third countries outside the European Union."
"Community law already applies to imports into the European Union and to trade between its Member States."
"The future EU Regulation should be as strictly as possible in accordance with the Protocol's requirement, in order to avoid unnecessary bureaucracy and for uniform international standards to create legal certainty."
"It must, at the same time, be ensured that European export businesses do not, as a result, face formalities additional to those with which they must already comply when exporting to third countries."
"The report that Mr Sjöstedt has presented has, however, largely lost sight of the aim of maintaining biodiversity."
"Of the many demands contained in it, some, on the one hand, go far beyond what the Cartagena Protocol requires, whilst others attempt to artificially restrict trade in living GMOs."
"I see it as inexpedient to incorporate into the Regulation requirements relating to traceability and liability, as these issues are currently being debated in the course of a separate legislative procedure and therefore do not belong in this Regulation."
"The Protocol takes for granted the exclusion of GMOs exported for use in closed systems from the complicated and expensive notification procedure."
"No such provision is present in this report, or in the Commission proposal."
"That is why I, along with Mrs Sommer and Mr Purvis, am reintroducing the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee's Amendment No 50, which we ask you to support."
"It is my conviction that GMOs used in laboratories and not released into the environment represent no danger to biodiversity or to human health, and should therefore be excluded from the notification procedure."
"Our Amendment No 51 calls for further derogations from the notification procedure in order to avoid unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles hampering trade in GMOs."
"Moreover, the Regulation must follow the Cartagena Protocol as closely as possible in order to create greater legal certainty for international trade."
"That is why GMOs in respect of which the importing country has already granted an exporter a license, and GMOs in respect of which the importing country has already granted a license for field trials, need to be capable of being exported without expensive approval procedures."
"Dual notifications make little sense, as they result in more bureaucracy and far from greater safety for people and the environment."
"What we need is sensible and practical rules in order to make good use of biotechnology's chances in third countries while maintaining biodiversity."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start by thanking our rapporteur, Mr Sjöstedt, for the good work he has done on this report on the implementation of the Cartagena Protocol on biosafety."
"As the Commissioner has repeatedly observed, he has obviously studied the original document with great care, and this has enabled him to add even greater precision to certain items in the Commission proposal, which is in any case essentially a good one."
"The implementation of this Protocol has mainly to do with seeking something long overdue, namely rules for EU exports of living GMOs to third countries, and in this practicability is of the utmost necessity."
"We have to bring into being a realistic and usable piece of legislation."
"It is precisely for this reason that I consider it wrong and, indeed, damaging for us to want to use this report on the implementation of the Cartagena Protocol to intervene in ongoing legislative processes."
"By this I mean the proceedings relating to genetically modified foodstuffs and feedingstuffs and their labelling and traceability."
"It was only a few weeks ago that we debated their first reading and had a plenary vote on them."
"The decision was a close-run thing, in other words, there were divergent opinions, and we are at present waiting to hear what position the Council takes on this."
"The proposal for a directive on environmental liability is also only now being debated in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, with little prospect of any decision on it, which means that anything this report lays down on the issue of liability for the traceability of GMOs and additives must be emphatically rejected."
"These issues have nothing to do with the transposition of the Cartagena Protocol into Community law, and so I have decided to bring in a number of requests for separate voting in order to correct the result of the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which I believe to lack objectivity."
"Nor initially did the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development take the right approach, in that it, in its opinion, sought to extend the derogations from the documentary and information procedures for living GMOs in transit and in closed systems to organisms genetically modified for the purposes of research and development, that is, to field trials under Part B of the Release Directive 2001/18."
"This was however, in my estimation, more of an inaccuracy, or rather a misunderstanding, as such a course of action would not be justifiable in terms of ethics or morals."
"This is, in any case, about living GMOs, as yet at the research stage, and thus not guaranteed to be safe."
"If we allow GMOs that are not permitted within the EU to be exported to third countries for the purposes of field tests - that is, for the purpose of their release into the environment - and do so without the possibility of their being monitored, then we are acting irresponsibly."
"I say this precisely because I am an advocate of green genetics, as I am sure will have become abundantly clear in discussions to date in this House on the Release Directive and on draft regulations, traceability and the labelling of genetically modified foodstuffs and feedingstuffs."
"A derogation from the requirement for documentation of living GMOs intended for release in third countries would mean that we were helping to send research into a lengthy foreign exile outside Europe, whether the EU's moratorium remained in place or were lifted, as it would be, in every instance, much simpler to engage in research anywhere other than in the EU."
"We must see to it, though, that we make research within the European Union possible again and move it forwards, an incidental consideration being that we will then be able to monitor what it is up to."
"I am therefore, together with my colleague Mrs Emilia Müller, introducing two new amendments on behalf of my group, namely Amendments Nos 50 and 51 to Article 4, which have already been mentioned."
"The first of these amendments seeks to restrict derogations from the documentary and information procedures to GMOs in transit and in closed systems."
"This is where we really need these derogations in order not to hamper research, and I am convinced that fear of possible mishaps in this area, such as those that might result from containers fracturing in transit, is exaggerated."
"Were it not so, I would not dare cross the street, get into a car, or board an aeroplane, as the possibility of an accident is always present, even if its likelihood is minimal in the extreme."
"The second amendment has to do with a derogation from the information procedure for exports of GMOs to a third country, where this third country has already granted approval for release to another country in respect of the same GMO."
"These derogations are necessary, as the use of the so-called AIA - Advanced Informed Agreement - as an information procedure in this instance offers no greater security and thus makes transborder movement unnecessarily difficult."
"I hope you can follow my line of reasoning, and, of course, therefore ask you to support me with your votes."
"I should first like to thank the Commission for the proposal for a regulation it has tabled and to thank Mr Sjöstedt very much for an outstanding report on the implementation of the Cartagena Protocol, which will place us in the best possible position to ensure global protection in connection with the movement of GMOs."
"I think it important that the developing countries in particular be protected against the harmful effects of what is often the aggressive marketing of GMOs, with their possible serious consequences for people's health, especially if we wish to conserve biological diversity in the countries concerned."
"Certain points in the Commission's proposal for a regulation are not perhaps entirely clear, but that is something I think is largely remedied by Mr Sjöstedt's report and a number of the amendments tabled. In this context, I shall just highlight the essential features."
"First of all, I think it crucial that we help the developing countries develop the administrative capacity and expertise needed if they are not to be crushed by multinational companies with unlimited marketing resources available to them."
"Secondly, it is important for the precautionary principle to be established."
"In relation particularly to the developing countries, it is absolutely crucial that doubts about the harmful effects on biological diversity in the countries concerned should really be taken seriously, and it is also crucial that the legislation apply both to GMOs released into the environment and to genetically modified food and animal feed."
"Finally, I think that Mr Sjöstedt is right to emphasise, and table proposals about, the fact that it is not enough for exporters to give notice of movements of GMOs."
"There should be actual approval on the part of the authorities in the recipient countries, organised in such a way that the absence of a response from these authorities could not of course be interpreted as a tacit acceptance."
"I think that this should apply to all movements, and not only the first, since the recipient country should have the opportunity to monitor the spread of GMO products in its territory."
"It is also good that only products approved by the EU itself should be exported from the EU area."
"Finally, I would add that it is very important for the EU countries to apply tough and uniform sanctions so as to avoid a situation in which certain countries visibly get away, or almost get away, with disregarding the legislation while others do not."
"A state of affairs ought not to arise in which there is more incentive in some countries than in others to contravene the legislation on transboundary movement."
"I think that by adopting Mr Sjöstedt's report and a number of the amendments tabled also on Mr Sjöstedt's initiative, we shall see the Cartagena Protocol implemented fairly and consistently."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome Mr Sjöstedt's report."
"In my opinion, he has done a splendid job, above all because he has dared to go beyond the minimal standard laid down by the Commission."
"I do think that the way we vote on this in Parliament has to set a milestone, and - as the lady who spoke before me said - must make it clear that the protection of biodiversity and of the public has pride of place, but that so too does the freedom of choice of what we term third countries, to which we export."
"It has become clear from the latest reports from, and the latest difficulties with, the United Nations, with African States, especially Somalia - countries who have, as it were, a gun put to their heads and who are told to eat or die, countries where the hunger of people in these countries is exploited as a pretext for forcing them to buy genetically modified foodstuffs - that we are dealing here with a real lack of free choice."
"I cannot do other than urge the Commissioner to take a firm line with the USA, and I want to take this opportunity to beg you not to bow down before the USA's threats, but rather make it abundantly clear that we will not give way on this."
"Most of all, though, we must not lift the moratorium, for, as you will be aware, only one Member State has transposed the Release Directive."
"Both a rule on liability and a satisfactory rule on labelling are a long way off."
"We have to focus on that."
"By this report and this vote, we have to show that we are in a position to close the gaping loopholes that are still there in the Cartagena Protocol."
"I want particularly to highlight food aid and the export of foodstuffs, where we must not yield to American pressure by denying these countries what they want, but must make clear that they have to be informed about these matters as well."
"Here too, what matters must be our refusal to trample on the right of consumers around the world to decide what they eat; above all, our vote must send a clear message that we cannot export to other countries a risk that we are unwilling to take ourselves."
"That was our experience with Eastern Europe, but especially with the Third World."
"We cannot simply move the risk elsewhere, but must make it our concern that the standard be enforced in Europe and that we avoid research that would not even be carried out here turning these countries into hazardous areas."
"We must not misuse these countries for the purpose of research that is full of risks."
"To do so would be not just an offence against safety; we would also be trampling human rights underfoot if we were to exploit these countries for the purposes of research that we find too risky."
"Mr Sjöstedt has, though, already addressed the importance of our finding a truly satisfactory solution to the issues of liability and labelling."
"We have to fashion liability into a tool to get industry to deal with this issue in a more responsible manner, and so I would reiterate my plea to the Commissioner that she should, in her closing statement, enlarge on her view of UN food aid and what she plans to do about the moratorium until such time as we have sorted out these criteria, of which we would remind the Commission too, in a satisfactory way."
"Mr President, here we are once again to speak about GMOs."
"Today, we are discussing the transboundary movement of these goods that are quite unlike any others."
"Will our next step be to pass legislation on cases involving the accidental release or the unintentional risks of GMOs?"
"I am, of course, being ironic."
"But this surely marks just the beginning of long series of debates which, we must admit, sometimes take on a surreal quality."
"We approve of the direction of the proposal for a regulation on the requirements of the Cartagena Protocol, but we would like to point out the paradoxical aspect of the process."
"This agreement is designed to provide the necessary legal framework for the transboundary movement of GMOs, but, at the same time, it acknowledges the contradictory notion of unintentional transboundary movements."
"It is evident that such provisions enable situations of scientific uncertainty to be dealt with, an approach that the countries of the South do not have the resources to undertake as impartially as ourselves."
"Moreover, during the vote we took in July to set a threshold of 0.5% or 1% for the adventitious contamination of GMOs, did we show impartiality?"
"Furthermore, are we not going round in circles at the moment in the Agriculture Council, with regard to the proposal on genetically modified products intended for animal feed?"
"Which procedure should be chosen to authorise these products?"
"Must we lay down a permitted level for non-deliberate traces of GMOs that are unauthorised but are considered to be safe?"
"The Community has decided to play a leading role in the sale of biotechnology, but the approach is entirely paradoxical: even though neither the safety nor the danger of GMOs has been established, it is already being presumed that they will be extremely successful on the market."
"It is also true that the Commission has started to ask that the moratorium be lifted."
"The protocol does indeed leave the Member States a great deal of discretion, based on the precautionary principle."
"Yet, the Sjöstedt report reduces this room for manoeuvre."
"We must remain vigilant and remember that Community law uses the precautionary principle as it sees fit and that, when the States wish to take advantage of it, it is suddenly placed well out of reach."
"The current French embargo on British beef is a worrying illustration of this."
"It is up to the Member States to ensure that scientific uncertainty is not transformed into a futile problem of social uncertainty in the face of the risks, or even to lay the foundations for an acceptable co-existence of GMO and non-GMO cultures."
"We are not closing the door on biotechnology or their transfer, but we wish to voice our reservations concerning a text which is merely a weak link of a shaky legislation thrown together in piecemeal fashion and which shows no hesitation in putting the cart before the horse."
"We are therefore choosing to abstain from the vote on this report."
"Mr President, I much regret that the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy did not deliver an opinion on this subject."
"Our coordinators were led to believe that there would be insufficient time to prepare an opinion before the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy finalised its report."
"In fact, this process took quite a lot longer than originally planned and there would have been sufficient time for the Committee on Industry to have given an opinion."
"An opinion from that committee ought to have been regarded as essential - in fact it is arguable that the Industry Committee should have been the committee responsible for this report."
"This proposal will have a substantial impact on the European Union's biotechnology industry, on the EU's research programme and, in particular, on the priorities of the Sixth Framework Programme for Research."
"It also impacts on our trade in GMOs and in genetically modified research material with both developed and less-developed countries."
"The Commission proposal adds undesirable restrictive requirements beyond the internationally agreed Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, but the Environment Committee's suggested amendments go drastically further."
"It is essential that in our vote today we radically change the direction of this report."
"I am only sorry that, coming late to this matter as I did, there was insufficient time to introduce all the changes and separate votes I would have liked."
"Why is it such a problem?"
"These additional restrictions and bureaucratic requirements will only discourage investment in life science research in Europe, and further encourage the investment in research to transfer to other areas with more favourable legislation outside Europe."
"Our scientists will go the same way as the research investment."
"Have the Commissioner and the rapporteur any concept of the damage this is likely to do?"
"Did they give any consideration to the ambition expressed at Lisbon for Europe to be the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world?"
"This proposal does not restrict imports into the EU of GMOs for contained research, but exports of public and private GM research material to third countries will be subject to yet further and disproportionate regulation."
"This proposal runs diametrically contrary to the EU's life science and biotechnology action plan."
"Was there any coordination or consultation with the Commissioner for Research and the Council of Ministers for Research?"
"It is quite appropriate that the Commission should propose, and Parliament and the Council approve, the requirements of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, but we should go no further."
"If we do, we will jeopardise our life science base for the future, our scientific community, the whole Lisbon strategy and Europe's future as a dynamic knowledge-based economic power in the world."
"I call on Parliament to vote overwhelmingly against Mr Sjöstedt's report in all its critical aspects and, in particular, to support Amendments 50 and 51, which will at least mitigate the extent of the damage this proposal and report are likely to cause."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to echo the words of thanks to the Commission for the present proposal."
"It cannot be emphasised enough that the proposal is important for, among others - and this is sometimes overlooked - the developing countries, and that sufficient resources must be made available."
"I should also very explicitly like to thank the rapporteur, not only for the volume of work, but also for the excellent work he has done, and for the political courage he has displayed in making a few observations with regard to the Commission proposal."
"I am also somewhat taken aback by the reactions in this House, where the divide is once again apparent."
"The MEPs to the right claim that we can apply the Protocol to the letter, but if we do, we must do it properly."
"At the same time, we must ensure that science can carry out its research unhindered."
"Those are the goodies."
"The other side of Parliament is represented by those who are always frightened of God knows what and who want to impose restrictions on everything."
"This is the wrong way to view the situation."
"It should be viewed within the framework of the general debate surrounding GMOs, in terms of the consumer's right to freedom of choice and of the precautionary principle."
"We still have no 100% certainty about this technology."
"We must therefore ensure that at least the consumer has the choice."
"This must be included in the Protocol."
"This is also what we should now have the courage to vote in favour of."
"I therefore wholeheartedly support the rapporteur's political courage and his observations."
"I hope that tomorrow's plenary will adopt the same stance."
"Mr President, I am pleased to speak on this report on the transboundary movement of GMOs in which the Committee on the Environment has adopted a more stringent and more comprehensive position than that proposed by the Commission, following the lead given by the rapporteur."
"I would like to add to what colleagues have said in thanking him for his work."
"I also welcome the fact that the Committee on the Environment expanded the regulation to cover food and feed which have been produced from or with the aid of GMOs, as well as GMOs intended for contained use."
"The report shows that whilst the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety is a good basic framework for regulating the transboundary movement of GMOs, this is a minimum, a base line from which parties can and should be proactive in aiming for ever higher standards of control to meet the demands of the consumer."
"This includes, as many colleagues have already mentioned, the right of freedom of choice."
"We are only too aware of the recent examples of food aid to developing countries being cynically used to force GM food on people, to promote GM food and to force countries that have declared themselves GM-free to accept GM grain."
"This includes countries such as Zambia, Mozambique and Zimbabwe which have all taken a stand against the untested and unproven nature of GMOs and it is totally unacceptable that these are being forced upon them by countries such as the United States."
"The European Union, in cases such as this, buys local non-GM food, adhering to the principles and the rules of the recipient countries in a manner in keeping with the ethos of the Cartagena Protocol."
"On the other hand, in the past two years Bolivia, Colombia, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Ecuador have all been forced to accept GM food aid even though this was contrary to their national regulations."
"I welcome the committee's report which clearly allows for countries to take more proactive steps to ensure international biosafety."
"It is an important step forward in the whole GM debate and the report has my full support."
"Mr President, I would like to start by offering Mr Purvis some small comfort."
"He is indeed right that it would have been a good thing to have had an opinion from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, but we, the European People's Party members of the Environment Committee, whilst of course representing the interests of the environment and of consumers, also represent the interests of business."
"We all stand for an environmentally responsible market economy."
"We know that protecting only the environment while ruining the economy is no use to consumers."
"With us, Mr Purvis, the environmentally responsible market economy is in safe hands."
"Austria ratified the Cartagena Protocol this year, depositing the instrument of ratification with the UN in New York on 27 August."
"We know that some Member States see ratification as dependent on the passing of this draft EU regulation on the implementation of this Protocol."
"This gives us all an interest in this draft being passed quickly."
"Allow me, Mr Sjöstedt, to comment on some of the amendments, for example Amendment No 6."
"The Regulation addresses only the Community, so that it is quite unnecessary, and, I think, irrelevant, to speak of 'any other Party'."
"Like some of my predecessors on the floor, I think that the Protocol should cover only living GMOs, and that anything else would be wrong."
"The area of liability and compensation is also, of course, very, very important and crucial, but on this we should wait for the outcome, which we expect to bring with it traceability and labelling."
"It would, after all, be absurd for us now to insert some provision or other, and then engage in long-winded discussions on a quite different regulation, or another directive, on traceability, labelling and liability."
"I rejoice in the knowledge that the Danish Presidency has as one of its objectives a Common Position at the Environmental Council on 17 October, following the conclusion of the First Reading stage in plenary, which is planned for the end of September."
"We look forward to 17 October with great interest and wish the Danish Presidency and ourselves all the best for it."
"Mr President, EU legislation runs up against boundaries on a regular basis."
"Many of our rules affect imports and exports, and this brings with it a dual responsibility."
"We must ensure that we do not compromise in the area of safety and at the same time, we must resist the temptation of imposing unnecessary restrictions on third countries and European exporters."
"I should like to thank Mr Sjöstedt for the courage with which he has negotiated this narrow path."
"Where biotechnology is concerned, there is in this Parliament a strong need to send a message to the rest of the world."
"The message is that biotechnology is controversial, possibly even dangerous and undetectable."
"The consumer must therefore be informed of GMOs."
"I have no problems with sending out this message within the European Union, but we must refrain from applying it in the context of the Biosafety Protocol, which is about safety."
"In the case of non-detectable GMOs, safety is not an issue."
"If the importing country does want this notification, then this should naturally be supplied."
"However, this is completely unrelated to safety, and this is why we do not actually need Amendment No 30."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we continually need to send out our message, but we should realise that forced evangelisation does not work."
"The world is certainly not waiting to be patronised by Europe."
"In his explanatory statement, Mr Sjöstedt states that the EU must play a leading role in legislation in the field of biotechnology, but we should realise that we have long given up our pioneering role in this respect, in which we could give the world much more."
"Unfortunately, with regard to biotechnology, Europe is trailing behind."
"Hardly any GMOs are being exported, at the very most products produced by means of them."
"Cheese and olive oil are prime examples of this."
"I should like to ask the Commission a question."
"What will be the implications if this report were to be adopted?"
"Would this increase the EU's deficit?"
"What would be the additional administrative burden for exporters, and what would be the economic implications of this?"
"Mr President, the regulation on the transboundary movement of genetically modified organisms is a rather surreal document."
"Therefore, please will you forgive me my customary digression, for I cannot stop my flights of fancy."
"Yesterday, I met a GMO wandering about between borders, who said to me: 'Why have you got it in for me so badly?"
"Yesterday, while I was wandering between borders, I went to Naples."
"I saw the beautiful Gulf of Naples, Vesuvius and Mergellina."
"It was absolutely beautiful!"
"Then, a little further on, still by the sea, I saw a horribly ugly, uninhabited area where there was a steelworks that had been deserted for 10 years."
"The area was called Bagnoli."
"Why do you not do something in Europe to enhance the environment in this area near Naples?"
"There you are, you see, wandering from one place to another I have been useful: I have seen an area where you, as Europe, might be able to do something to enhance the environment."
"Why, then, have are you so against us GMOs?"
"Even we have our uses."
"Are you sure you are aware of our full potential?"
"Therefore, be more flexible in allowing the genetic modification of organisms which are useful to the human race.'"
"Mr President, I wish to thank both my colleagues and Mrs Wallström for the viewpoints that have been put forward in this debate and that I think provide quite a clear picture of the lines of demarcation."
"I think that there are a number of factors that should be borne in mind where this protocol is concerned."
"The first is, of course, that we are concerned here with minimum regulations."
"We must comply with what the protocol requires of us, but we may, according to the protocol, go further if we wish."
"That is the situation that applies."
"It also, of course, means that other countries around the world may go further than the protocol requires."
"What I state in the report is that we shall respect this."
"We require of our exporters that they respect the Cartagena Protocol and so, too, the legislation that other countries may adopt and that may go further than the European Union's. If we did not, we should in practice be acting contrary to both the spirit and the letter of the Cartagena Protocol."
"I believe there is no question of our doing that."
"Secondly, we should be aware that the Cartagena Protocol is in the process of development."
"Regular negotiations are under way."
"Quite a few areas of the Protocol have still not been clarified. It is just the general thrust of it that is being delineated."
"Other areas have been clarified."
"We must therefore bear in mind that we need a policy that is far-sighted and that shows the general direction in which the EU wishes to develop the Cartagena Protocol in the future."
"It is precisely this to which the regulations on liability relate."
"We are not concerned here with the EU's liability legislation, which we are in the process of debating elsewhere."
"What is at issue is Article 27 of the Cartagena Protocol, which says that we must begin to negotiate internationally concerning liability where this type of product is concerned."
"As a Parliament, we support the Commission and the Member States in campaigning, in future negotiations within the framework of the Cartagena Protocol, for a global system of liability which would of course favour the serious actors in this area."
"It is a system of this kind that is required."
"When it comes to the amendments, I believe that Amendment Nos 50 and 51 seriously weaken the report by aiming to remove important areas from it."
"Amendment No 50, in particular, actually goes against the Cartagena Protocol."
"We cannot adopt that amendment."
"I should also like to ask those who regard GMOs differently from myself to reflect for a moment."
"We naturally form different judgments of what is possible and different assessments of the risks that this technology may involve."
"Irrespective of how we regard the future of this technology, I think there is something we must bear in mind, namely that we must have a system of rules under which the companies that operate in this area are credible."
"Is a company credible if it exports to countries that have not given their permission?"
"Is a company credible if it exports to a country that has not been able to respond to the request for permission?"
"I believe that an industry that acts in this way disgraces itself."
"We do not stand to gain, and nor should industry stand to gain, from rules that lead to what is in actual fact the bypassing of countries' right to say yes or no to would-be imports."
"Next question: are we credible if we export to others what is not good enough for ourselves?"
"Are we credible if we export what we have rejected, for example for reasons that have to do with environmental safety, biological diversity or consumer protection?"
"Of course we are not."
"Even someone who takes a very positive view of this industry - complicated though it is, with both advantages and disadvantages - ought to appreciate that it is in everyone's interests to have comprehensive, credible regulations."
"If the European Union accepts these regulations, they will have an effect not only upon ourselves and our exports, but also upon the world as a whole."
"They will show that the major global players too take this issue seriously and are prepared to assume their responsibilities."
"It is with this in mind that I have prepared this report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want first of all to thank you for your interesting and constructive contributions to this debate."
"I want to begin with a general comment."
"The Commission is, and remains, very active where the issue of biotechnology is concerned."
"As you know, we have presented a communication on how we should make use of biotechnology."
"We are actively working on our internal Community legislation in this area, partly by revising Directive 2001/18/EC on traceability and marking, and we are also working on the issue of liability for environmental damage."
"It is constantly a question of striking this delicate and difficult balance between, on the one hand, exploiting the advantages of a new technique, a new technology and new knowledge in this area and, on the other, preserving biological diversity and, most importantly of all, protecting people's health."
"I believe that this proposal is in line with Community legislation and that we are still being ambitious."
"I was myself involved in the negotiations in which the EU was the party pushing to guarantee the introduction of international regulations."
"I believe that we are achieving that balance in this area too."
"It is also true, as Mr Sjöstedt points out, that there will be further negotiations and work in a number of areas with a view to shedding more light on a number of important issues."
"If, finally, I may now offer my views on certain of the amendments in order to clarify the Commission's attitude, I will begin by commenting on Amendment Nos 30 and 57 which cannot be approved because they go against the proposal on traceability and marking by extending the proposal also to include food and feed manufactured with the aid of GMOs."
"It is important for different legal acts on biotechnology to tally."
"Amendment Nos 5 and 47 deal with the important issue of capacity development in developing countries but contain no mechanisms for putting this into practice."
"The Commission believes that this is an important issue but that it can better be dealt with in a more suitable forum, for example the European Development Fund."
"Amendment Nos 7 and 45 relate to the issue of environmental liability, and the Commission again believes that this proposal is not the right instrument for getting to grips with this problem, to which special international negotiations are better suited."
"Further attention will be given to this issue in international negotiations."
"Amendment No 22 proposes that the export of GMOs for deliberate release into the environment should be limited to organisms already authorised within the EU."
"In its present version, the amendment could entail serious obstacles to research outside Europe comprising, for example, field trials involving GMOs not cultivated in our latitudes."
"The Commission is not therefore able to accept this amendment in its present form."
"Amendment No 29 addresses more fundamental problems."
"Firstly, procedures are being established that do not in their entirety correspond to Article 11 of the Protocol on Biosafety and, what is worse, are inconsistent with Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law."
"For that reason, the Commission cannot accept the amendment."
"The proposal in the last sentence of Amendment No 60 to the effect that an exporter should be obliged to give notice of further movement of GMOs already authorised in the recipient country would not be in accordance with Community legislation governing deliberate release or with the Protocol on Biosafety per se."
"This part of the amendment cannot therefore be approved."
"It is, of course, a question of not creating unduly bureaucratic rules that cannot be implemented in practice."
"The Commission is, on the other hand, able to accept Amendment Nos 50 and 51."
"Mr President, I want in conclusion to repeat that the Commission shares most of the European Parliament's priorities and views in the problem areas."
"If we want it to be possible to implement the Protocol on Biosafety, we must, at the same time, be accountable for the feasibility of such implementation."
"International discussions on the Protocol on Biosafety are still going on."
"A proposal capable of being implemented will not only help make it possible for the negotiations to continue in a constructive climate but also help show that sound protection of the environment and of human health can be combined with trade."
"We shall have to return to other issues mentioned in the course of this debate, such as the moratorium and UN food aid, for they demand both time and thorough preparations."
"I hope that they will lead in time to a constructive exchange of opinions, but this is not the right time and place to touch on all these different aspects."
"A summary of the Commission's position on the matter of the amendments is being presented in writing to the President"
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be at noon today."
"The next item is the debate on the motion for a resolution (B5-0490/2002) tabled by Dagmar Roth-Behrendt on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the postponement of the ban on the marketing of cosmetics tested on animals."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what we are discussing today is actually a technical measure."
"The resolution before you, on which we are to vote, refers to what we term comitology, something which the spectators in the galleries will be surprised to learn, many Members of this House have difficulty understanding, and indeed, they certainly do not have to."
"It is comitology that entitles the Commission to use the specialist committees to approximate legislation within the scope of the power that the legislation itself confers."
"The resolution passed unanimously by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy charges the Commission with now desiring to avail itself of a right which it does not possess."
"What we are talking about is the Commission's intention of deferring the entry into force of the sixth amendment to the Cosmetics Directive, which was actually meant to have happened some time ago."
"In the sixth amendment to the Cosmetics Directive, Parliament decided on a ban on the marketing of cosmetics that had been tested on animals, sharing as it did the conviction of most of the public that we have enough cosmetics and do not need more - toothpaste, shower gel, and so on - for which animals have had to suffer and die."
"This ban had a definite deadline - 1998."
"In 1997, the Commission gave itself the power to delay its entry into force."
"Whilst, admittedly, stating that the entry into force was to be in 2000, it added, at the same time, the option of an extension of two years."
"I do not want right now to state whether that was lawful."
"As things stood, the marketing ban was meant to enter into force on 30 June 2002, and it did so."
"The Commission is now planning to use a comitological measure to again, very soon - in a week or a few days, quite possibly on 24 September - put back the date of entry into force, by six months."
"This it justifies by the assertion that we are in the midst of the conciliation procedure on the seventh amendment to the Cosmetics Directive, and that the measure could therefore not enter into force in June."
"Mrs Wallström, I am sorry that you are the member of the Commission to whom I must say these things."
"We charge you with acting illegally, with breaking the law."
"You are in breach of the Treaty and of existing legislation!"
"I would much rather say that to Mr Liikanen, but he is, unfortunately, not here today."
"I am aware that the Commission acts as a collegiate body;"
"I am equally aware that there are individuals sitting on the Commission who have very different views."
"That, Mrs Wallström, is why I regret that it is you whom I have to address today."
"I would very much prefer to have been very hard on Mr Liikanen."
"I admit that, with you sitting there, I find it more difficult."
"Nonetheless, what you are doing is illegal!"
"It is against the law, and we will therefore be taking you to the Court of Justice if necessary."
"I am sure that the majority in this House will support that."
"What you are now proposing to do is not merely contrary to the law, but is positively absurd."
"I could use old-fashioned language and call it daft!"
"You want to pass a measure with retroactive effect."
"You want to pass something that enters into force retroactively, namely from 30 June."
"Why, actually, do you want to do this?"
"We are already at the end of September."
"The conciliation procedure will be completed in two months at the latest - it has to be."
"Even now, you have not implemented the marketing ban."
"In theory, you are already acting illegally, but we are saying: OK, that's something of a legal vacuum, we'll put up with it."
"The Member States are not proceeding with transposition, and we know that they are doing the right thing by waiting for the seventh amendment."
"What the Commission now has in mind is the creation of a precedent, and we are not going to let them get one past us."
"They want, again, to give themselves the right to defer the sixth amendment, and if we now lie down quietly like little lambs, then they will believe that they have the right to carry on doing the same thing."
"We will not let you have your precedent!"
"We are not good little lambs!"
"I'm not one, and nor are my fellow MEPs!"
"That is why we are telling you now that your actions are illegal."
"This resolution makes that very clear."
"We call upon you not to implement this measure."
"The four articles are very clear in calling on you to desist. We are telling you to keep your hands off this measure."
"We are telling the Member States not to touch it, not to pass it into law."
"And we are telling you that if you do it anyway, we will drag you off to the Court of Justice!"
"Mrs Wallström, I really do beg you to take this message back to the Commission."
"I can see the gentleman from the Industry Directorate-General sitting beside you."
"Tell them that we are serious about this."
"We believe that you are in breach of the law!"
"As the Commission, you may not break the law."
"You know that it did not do past Commissions any good, and you too should act as properly and honestly as possible."
"You are not doing that if you want to pass another Implementing Measure."
"So, as rapporteur for the Cosmetics Directive, I can only tell you, as firmly as I can: hands off!"
"Mr President, of course it is nicer to stand in for colleagues under circumstances where you might receive applause rather than be attacked."
"I would never want to be attacked by Mrs Roth-Behrendt, because I respect her very much."
"On behalf of the Commission, I would like to thank her and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for the resolution on the postponement of the entry into force of the ban on the marketing of cosmetics tested on animals."
"The aim of this postponement is quite simply to regulate a short-term situation, from 1 July 2002 until 31 December 2002, and this corresponds to the period envisaged for conciliation."
"The directive currently in force prohibits the marketing of cosmetics products containing ingredients or a combination of ingredients tested on animals after 30 June 2002."
"The current conciliation procedure between the European Parliament and the Council relating to the seventh amendment aims to settle definitively the question of tests on animals in the cosmetics sector."
"This conciliation procedure is expected to be finalised in the coming months."
"At the same time, there are responsibilities incumbent upon the Commission in the areas of the free circulation of goods, protection of public health and respect of international rules."
"The Commission therefore considers it has an obligation to take the appropriate measures in accordance with the provisions of the current directive."
"The Member States, represented in the Cosmetics Committee, will have to express their views on this proposal."
"The Commission is convinced that further work, in close cooperation with the European Parliament and the Council, will finally lead to a balanced solution within the context of conciliation."
"This solution should be of genuine benefit to animal welfare whilst safeguarding consumer health and our international commitments."
"It is the intention of the Commission to do its utmost to achieve a result which satisfies everyone."
"I will, of course, give your regards to Commissioner Liikanen."
"Mr President, Commissioner Wallström always brings a light and happy touch to our proceedings and we are grateful for that."
"The severity of some of the remarks you will hear from the floor today do not reflect on her, but on the fact that she is caught in one institution which is now on a collision course with another."
"The rapporteur said that those listening to us in the gallery today may be curious as to what the word 'comitology' means."
"Some of us are too."
"Our visitors should not go away with the feeling that comitology could be effectively translated as a lateral means whereby the Commission can frustrate the will of the Parliament."
"We are an elected institution."
"We have certain powers. They have been extended."
"They are still not all that considerable, but we know where the boundaries are."
"On this issue I must say to the Commissioner - and I hope she will take this back to Mr Liikanen - that we in this House have had a debate which has continued through a number of Parliaments, through pretty much the entire parliamentary lifetime of everyone sitting in this Chamber now, from 1993 onwards."
"In 1997 the Commission purported to give itself a further power of delay and that was extended, although challenged, because all of us here - and everyone who serves as I do on the Conciliation Committee - agree with the rapporteur in acknowledging the difficulties which arise where there are not yet viable alternatives to some forms of animal testing."
"That is perfectly taken into account in the deliberations we have had, which estimate that it may take another decade to reach the point and the conclusion that we all want."
"But what happens in the meantime?"
"What happens if this conciliation fails?"
"We are not talking then of something which is only temporary, only due to last for the duration of the present conciliation."
"We are talking of something quite different."
"I would like to read to the Commissioner the fifth paragraph of the vice-chairman's letter, written on behalf of our committee, to Commissioner Liikanen."
"He says that the Commission exercised its powers - which are disputed anyway - in 1997."
"When the implementation date for the marketing of animal-tested cosmetics was postponed to 30 June 2002 by Directive 2000/41, this postponement was to be - to quote the words of Recital 10 - for the 'last time'."
"Now here we are again - and it is not the last time, it is the penultimate time."
"Or is it just one in a whole series of delays and frustrations?"
"If you have an elected Parliament you have to listen to what it says, otherwise these people in the gallery are wasting their time and we are wasting our time in coming here."
"Commissioner, you must go back and say to Mr Liikanen that he should think again."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we are as one in our displeasure with the Commission."
"It is not acceptable for the Commission to act illegally, for them to put off the implementation of this decision, delaying it, and so on. Nor is it acceptable for them to look on and do nothing while the Member States endow their omissions with something like legitimacy."
"Now at last, what has been resolved upon - namely, a ban on the marketing of cosmetics tested on animals - must be put into effect with all force."
"The Commission is itself, after all, the guardian of the law, and as the guardian of the law, it must ensure that laws are implemented."
"Now the Commission, rather than guarding the law, is obstructing it."
"What you are achieving here will be catastrophic in its effect."
"It is precisely in terms of the great implementation deficit in our European Union that you are giving such a bad example that in future all the Member States will be able to point to the Commission and say: Look at that, even the Commission itself is incapable of implementing its own laws, preferring to make laws for itself, and set itself above the law."
"As Mrs Roth-Behrendt so rightly said, it acts illegally, bending the law to suit itself and contributing to the Member States' noticeably diminishing interest in putting the law into real effect."
"Therefore, Commissioner, I would like to reiterate, with as much emphasis as I can muster, that it is not acceptable for you to send out this calamitous signal; on the contrary, the Commission must change its ways, become the guardian of the Treaties and do everything in its power to really get the Member States to transpose this law, and not itself go and break current European law."
"That is not tolerable, and Mr Whitehead was right to say so."
"How on earth do you intend to get it across to the public that the Commission has failed to make any real effort to put into effect things that should have been done in the past?"
"Quite apart from that, I find it positively absurd that the Commission is also stabbing the Conciliation Committee in the back, depriving it of fallback positions, and making something of a mockery of the work currently being done in Parliament."
"That the Commission should go so far as to do that really is unique in history."
"You can see how great is our displeasure, and I cannot expect us to do other than adopt this resolution by a large majority; I look forward to the Commission really seeing what an emphatic rebuke this is and realising how far-reaching is its significance."
"Mr President, everyone is becoming caught up in the revision of the directive on cosmetics."
"What has happened to the sixth revision?"
"Are we moving straight on from the fifth to the seventh and ignoring the sixth?"
"That is what everyone is wondering."
"However, we all want to have safe and anti-allergenic cosmetics, to spare animals any unnecessary suffering, to maintain jobs, competitiveness and the expertise of our businesses."
"This seemingly straightforward desire seems difficult, nigh impossible, to implement."
"This resolution is a good illustration of Parliament trying to gain the upper hand, and the Council, quite rightly, refuses to support it."
"To impose a target date for a ban on animal experiments could lead to several measures."
"The first is to no longer guarantee the safety of products placed on the market."
"These products would not have been subject to the full tests that provide the same guarantees as those carried out on animals."
"The second point is to put European products on the markets of third countries at a disadvantage by continuing to carry out tests on animals, these are currently the only fully reliable tests."
"The third point is to risk a sanction being imposed by the WTO which may perceive this ban as a barrier to the marketing of cosmetics produced outside the European Union, even though it is generally accepted that few directives proposing alternative solutions will come to light until another ten years or so and that animal experiments may be phased out completely in perhaps another 20 years."
"In my view, it would be more realistic to enter into dialogue with the Council, leaving behind this overly passionate - and now ideological - debate, so that we can work together to find the best solution which will be acceptable to industry, consumers and animal campaigners."
"I believe that a ten-year ban which includes exemptions for three types of tests - namely reproductive toxicity, toxicokinetics and toxicity through repeated use - would be more acceptable."
"Lastly, I note that some directives are being revised for the seventh time whereas others, such as Directive 79/409 EEC, have never been revised before."
"Mr President, I should like to concur with Mr Bernié, who stated that this is an ideological debate."
"However, and this is meant for the Commissioner's ears, it transpires that the Commission does not share Parliament's ideology which has been approved here many times."
"It therefore breaks the law - if I may put it that way - by flouting the rules that we have laid down several times."
"In other words, the Commission's ideology is not in line with Parliament's wishes."
"This strikes me as a dangerous situation, not only because Parliament is thus rendered a plaything, but also because the responsibility of Parliament - which has not always been undivided in this very complex matter, but has always acted responsibly - is being eroded at the very moment that we are discussing the conciliation procedure relating to the seventh amendment."
"I would therefore once again ask the Commission to take account of what Parliament has always stated, namely that animal testing for the purpose of cosmetics is unacceptable, that safety should always come first and that we are willing to help consider all the possible alternatives, and help weigh these up."
"This is, in fact, something we have always pointed out for every amendment to this directive."
"I would now ask the Commission not to frustrate Parliament, to withdraw its plans and implement what we jointly agreed on."
"Mr President, I know that our concerns are close to the Commissioner's heart."
"You, Commissioner, are a young and beautiful woman, and, whilst you have no need of cosmetics, I need them urgently."
"I will be seventy next year, and, whilst I am very keen to get some anti-wrinkle cream, I do not want some animal to suffer as a result."
"Do you really believe any woman would use any cosmetic product if she had to see an animal suffer for it?"
"We want to look good without others having to suffer to make it possible."
"I really want to make an appeal to the cosmetics industry."
"Look how the introduction of the catalytic converter led to prophecies of ruination and claims that the end of the motor industry was nigh -- and yet, it experienced a boom."
"Why does the cosmetics industry not announce that it will invest money - a great deal of money - in research, in order to have the means to make women beautiful, but not at the cost of the suffering of others?"
"I believe the cosmetics industry would enjoy a massive upturn, and European women like us would be even more beautiful than all the other women on earth."
"Mr President, it would be indeed tempting to enter into this debate."
"I used to be a minister for consumer affairs so I could very well do so, but will not because my task is to represent the Commission."
"This is purely a technical issue of ensuring legal clarity during the six months that the conciliation procedure is ongoing."
"The Commission does not want to impinge on future decisions or the result of the conciliation procedure, but would underline that it has a responsibility to ensure the observance of rules on the free circulation of goods, the protection of public health and the respect of international rules."
"We have been urged by the Legal Service to make sure that we provide legal certainty to economic operators, who must ensure that the products they put on the market are safe."
"That is the aim of this postponement."
"This is important because the Commission proposal also has to be retroactive in order to achieve the objectives of ensuring that products are marketed only when they fulfil the conditions laid down by Directive 76/68 and because we must also be able to require manufacturers to guarantee that the products they put on the market are not harmful to human health."
"The situation is such that there are no comprehensive alternative testing methods at the moment and that is why we must ensure that there is legal certainty for these six months."
"That is the background to the Commission proposal."
"I have taken note of everything you have said and fortunately, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, we have developed the capacity for listening to two people at the same time."
"You have to do that and the advantage of listening to German is that all the verbs come at the end so that also helps!"
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your additional intervention."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Casaca (A5-0275/2002), on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on scrutiny by Member States of transactions forming part of the system of financing by the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund."
"Mr President, Commissioner, pursuant to Rule 9(1) of our Rules of Procedure, I must first inform you that I am a farmer and as such I hold a direct interest in every aspect of the Agricultural Fund, such as this proposal for a regulation."
"The Commission is proposing a reduction in the minimum number of compulsory scrutinies for commercial and industrial undertakings which have received an agricultural subsidy from the Community budget, for the disposal of agricultural surpluses from the internal market or for other purposes."
"We have nothing against reducing this number, since the quality, the Community character, the selection process and the transparency of this process are, of course, significantly improved."
"We have been extremely concerned to see the high level of fraud and irregularities that beset operations whose control is covered by this regulation, specifically livestock exports and subsidies for the disposal of milk products and we have expressed this view on numerous occasions."
"As seen in the European butter falsification case, fraud against the financial interests of the Community is indissociable from fraud against the financial interest of the Member States, against public health and against farmers, in whose name these considerable amounts of Community monies are spent, but who are often harmed by them."
"According to information published recently in the press, the number of seizures by Members States' customs services of falsified food products rose from 2 340 in 2000, to 4 106 in 2001 and Commission administrators have stated that organised crime is today focusing more on falsifying food products than on falsifying luxury articles."
"We are also receiving news of glaring shortcomings in the fight being waged by the Member States against food falsification, specifically in key fields such as wine, oil, and meat and milk products."
"Given these circumstances, we again insist, as we have done over the last three years, on the Commission's significantly increasing its direct action to monitor fraud and falsification in the food trade and industry."
"We welcome, of course, the proposals to reform the CAP, which call into question the continuity of these intervention mechanisms, which have proven to be open invitations to fraud and falsification, being of dubious effectiveness in supporting farmers' incomes, opting instead for direct aid granted according to the area farmed and to the rural work undertaken, using criteria of sustainable development."
"There cannot, of course, be effective control without transparent procedures and without democratic scrutiny by Parliament."
"A few years after the scandal broke of the more than 35 thousand tonnes of butter falsified by the Camorra and disposed of in Europe and beyond by milk product companies from various Europeans countries, we have still not been told which companies were involved and what measures have been adopted against them by the European Institutions, and to prevent this type of activity."
"When will this matter be finally cleared up?"
"What progress has been made on physical scrutinies of these high-risk products that allow us reasonably to expect that we will see no further occurrences of scandals of this scale?"
"I must highlight once again that the idea that only the falsification of milk products directly subsidised by Community funds can be considered to affect the financial interests of the Community is unacceptable."
"If this approach is accepted, whereas farmers that exceed their production quota for cow's milk, respecting the financial interests of the Community, are heavily penalised, industrial concerns that sell milk products that are not made with milk would not be penalised, despite having a much more damaging effect on the Community's financial interests."
"I also think it is important, where this regulation is concerned, to disseminate the list of commercial and industrial undertakings and the amounts with which they are subsidised by the Agricultural Fund to dispose of surpluses."
"I fail to understand why any competition process to adjudicate a commercial bid for tender or even to award a scientific grant has to be public, divulging the sums and the actors involved, but when we are talking about multinationals that receive sometimes enormous sums to get rid of food products, the public does not have the right to know who is receiving funds and to what ends."
"Democratising Europe and increasing the confidence of the citizens in their institutions inevitably require a more transparent attitude and equitable procedures."
"We hope that due account is taken of this regulatory amendment by both the Council and the Commission because it presents a unique opportunity to overcome the obvious shortcomings in this field of protecting the Community's financial interests."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Casaca for his report, although the Commission does not agree with all aspects of it."
"I should underline that the implementation by the Member States of Regulation 4045/89 is generally satisfactory."
"The Commission's proposal therefore only contains technical amendments aimed at adjusting reference amounts for inflation, as was the case with the last amendment in 1994, simplifying Member States' reporting requirements and including the possibility of reducing the number of scrutinies in certain duly motivated cases."
"These would be cases in which control services from more than one Member State joined forces in scrutinising international-scale companies receiving EAGGF aid."
"As I have said, the implementation by the Member States of the obligations arising from this control regulation is satisfactory, but some technical amendments are called for."
"Let me stress one important factor: the regulation is a control regulation and not an anti-fraud regulation."
"The Commission therefore shares the opinion of Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that Article 37 and not Article 280 is the most appropriate legal base."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I really would like, as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, to thank the rapporteur most warmly for the work he has done."
"The Commission proposal is one that I am able to welcome in its entirety, as it aims to improve the combating of fraud in the area of agriculture."
"For there is one thing that must be clear to all of us, and that is that fraud harms farmers themselves."
"The EAGGF guarantee is a means of financing, for example, export refunds, interventions by the various market organisations or the co-financing of supporting and other measures for the development of rural areas outside the Objective 1 regions."
"As the Commissioner has already pointed out, Regulation 4045/89 deals with retrospective checking of the business records of undertakings in receipt of agricultural aid from the Community budget for EAGGF guarantees."
"Thus, this Regulation is the core anti-fraud measure in the agricultural sphere."
"I welcome the Commission's presentation of proposals for adapting this instrument and bringing it up to date."
"Controls are important, especially in agriculture, which is a sensitive area, because the whole industry would suffer without them."
"The selection criteria for the undertakings to be audited were last amended in 1994, but have not been further adapted since then."
"To take an example, the annual rate of inflation has to be taken into account."
"Use of risk analysis techniques is to be even further improved."
"Aid payments already received, which are fixed as the threshold at which scrutiny starts, are to be raised, and administrative assistance has to be simplified."
"This makes me very thankful that this will take place across all the Member States, as this will enable us to reduce the number of audits by up to 25%, which must in no way be taken as a reduction in their quality, but a more targeted selection of undertakings to be audited, and one that relates more to the risks involved."
"Fraud needs to be combated in a hard-hitting and focussed way."
"In future, therefore, electronic data and documents will be subjected to scrutiny, yielding data on production and on the type of produce. Direct payments to the producer will continue to be excluded from scrutiny, as will those payments covered by the integrated administration and control system."
"I would like to conclude with particular reference to the real importance of taking into account the need to create special framework conditions, based on a multi-annual approach, for this in controls and measures or rural development projects."
"Mr President, first of all I welcome the report."
"I think it is very timely, and it will certainly be welcomed by everyone, because most people would welcome a reduction in inspection."
"However, that does not mean in any way actively encouraging lesser controls."
"I happen to believe that if you are going to have real control of the finances of the European Union, it can only be best carried out at Member State level, because the Member States also have the ability to follow such controls through."
"I would agree totally with the previous speaker, that the vast majority of people in the agricultural industry, be they in the manufacturing side, the factory side or indeed at the farm level, are not involved in fraud."
"There will, however, always be a small number of people in any country who are prepared to abuse a system."
"I think that in Europe we must be more specialised in what we try to do, we must be clearer and more specific in our targeting of inspections as regards the areas we inspect, because in many Member States there is no doubt that some European money is not spent very wisely, and could be much better spent."
"I welcome the fact that the threshold is to be increased."
"I think it is timely and I return to my point - I still believe that the majority of contacts should be left to the Member States and that we in Europe should be more specific and more targeted in the areas that we want to see inspected."
"No one, I repeat, wants to encourage fraud; certainly we in this Parliament would not in any way want to encourage fraudulent acts and where they are found they must be dealt with very severely."
"So, we must have good control but it must be targeted, it must be specific, it must be to the point, and it must be in areas where abuse has been found."
"I certainly believe we can improve the situation, I believe this can be achieved, and I believe it can be done by targeting particular areas which we consider to be the most vulnerable."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of our group, I wish to thank Mr Casaca for this report and also make it abundantly clear that we support him, even on those points where the Commission thinks it can make distinctions between control measures and anti-fraud measures."
"According to your institution's information, losses of EUR 430 million were sustained in this area last year, which means that it is not we who suffered, but those sitting up there - the taxpayers of this European Union of ours."
"When we talk about how we should reform agricultural policy in Europe, as the Commission recently proposed, in order thereby to bring agricultural policy closer to the public, and in this case, closer to the taxpayers - something to which Mrs Schierhuber, a farmer herself, referred, and on which point I wish to give her my support - we have to distance ourselves from such quibbles about what is control, and what is directed against fraud."
"It is therefore my view that the Commission would have been well-advised to follow our thinking, which is that of the rapporteur and of the Committee on Budgetary Control, and, in the final analysis, give these measures the legal basis of the protection of the Community's financial interests."
"We have already given some thought to how we could put a stop to export refunds, especially in the area of live cattle exports."
"The images we see of Mediterranean harbours, which our young people get to see, are far from being an advertisement for this agricultural policy and far from being an advertisement for the European Union."
"That is something we have to do away with, and there have been amendments on the subject tabled by this House in this Budget."
"Let me say loud and clear that, in the preliminary draft budget, the Commission has given us no support."
"The amendments will be back, and we can then expect more cooperation in the future, for, in this Parliament, which makes it its business to monitor the budget, we are well aware that this system of export refunds cannot be made immune to fraud."
"On the contrary, such a thing is impossible."
"The system of agricultural export refunds as currently practised is an invitation to fraud."
"That is a challenge, and I see the debate on the choice between Article 37 or Article 280 from the Treaties as purely academic."
"Ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, we, who talk more to the people who live alongside us, eat and drink with us and pay us taxes, cannot afford that for the future."
"Here the wholehearted support for our rapporteur and for his report."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"I should also like to congratulate Mr Casaca on behalf of my group."
"I share his relentless ambition to improve agricultural controls."
"If this policy is already controversial, and European agricultural policy is controversial, then we must in any event ensure that the money is well spent."
"What is the essence of the Commission's proposal?"
"It aims to reduce the number of controls, but to improve them at the same time."
"We hope that the latter is the case, but everything is yet to be proven, of course."
"We will be closely monitoring this process, something that I support."
"The proof will be in the pudding."
"You will be given the benefit of the doubt, but I hope that your premises are indeed genuine."
"Something which Parliament has always asked for are margins of error for the individual sectors of the budget, and this also applies to the agricultural budget."
"How great is the margin of error in the dairy sector, for example?"
"How much is it in the cereal sector, or the tobacco sector?"
"The big question is whether you are able to supply these figures by means of this other system, because based on the Commission's new system of accounting, we expect that these figures will be available in due course."
"The Court of Auditors has said that it will not be able to do this."
"We would therefore ask the Commission to indicate, more or less on an annual basis, what the estimated margin of error and the estimated improvement will be."
"This will enable us to assess improvements in the Commission's control procedures."
"One subject that has not been touched upon, not even in the Commission proposal, is that we have noticed an increasing emphasis on rural policy in Commissioner Fischler's proposals."
"Funding for rural policy is subject to good agricultural practices, which is excellent, and we must incorporate the environment and similar issues in this."
"However, what exactly are good agricultural practices?"
"My guess is that good agricultural practices in Sweden may on the whole be different from good agricultural practices in the Netherlands, or Portugal, or Greece, or wherever."
"This is the essence."
"What is considered normal in one country is still not normal in another country."
"My final comment concerns Amendment No 10 pertaining to the publication of all data on the various destinations of agricultural funds."
"I agree with this in principle, but as far as I know, this does not apply to any of the other subsections of the budget."
"This is why we will be keeping our powder dry for the time being and will not be voting for this amendment at this stage."
"Mr President, like my colleagues, I endorse the Commission proposal that has been tightened up by Mr Casaca."
"As we have grown accustomed from Mr Casaca, it is a very sound report with good recommendations, and I regret that the Commission is unable to indicate that it will be adopting all of Mr Casaca's proposals, certainly in the light of the wide support which these proposals are enjoying from the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"One of the aspects involved is the legal basis of this proposal."
"As is generally known, we take the view that this should be Article 280 because it is essentially about the good management of EU funding."
"This is not about giving in to the agricultural lobby for the umpteenth time."
"In a way, the agricultural subsidies are, in fact, the EU's best kept secret."
"We know that a great deal goes wrong."
"Only last week, it transpired from the Court of Auditors' report that subsidies for oilseeds are being misused on a large scale, and yet, little seems to be done about it."
"It is absolutely essential that we should make these flows of funds transparent."
"Indeed, not a great deal of aid lands with the small farmers for whom it is intended, but ends up instead with large multinationals, as Mr Casaca has already explained."
"Yet, it is not possible to make this data public."
"The VVD and CDA in the Liberal and Christian-Democratic groups - that are, incidentally well represented in this debate today - are opposed to making these public."
"Why?"
"Fear of public access?"
"Mrs Maij-Weggen was this Parliament's rapporteur who spoke in favour of public access to documents."
"The Liberal group has always set great store by public access."
"So that cannot be the stumbling block."
"Could other elements be at play, such as self-interest and looking after the group's supporters?"
"Or a reluctance to make the flows of funds transparent because that would clearly demonstrate the need for reforming the Common Agricultural Policy?"
"I am afraid that this is the case."
"I also regret that Mr Mulder is unable to support Amendment No 10 by Mr Casaca about making the flow of funds known, giving the excuse - for it is nothing but an excuse - that anything that does not apply to other areas of policy should not apply to agriculture either."
"Mr Mulder constantly hides behind this argument."
"He has done this for the past couple of years, and this is not the way forward, certainly not given the fact that the agricultural budget accounts for half of the European budget."
"This problem will become more pressing following enlargement."
"Even more businesses will join, and it is then even more important that we know where the money ends up."
"Agricultural policy has taken on undesirable forms over the past few years."
"Subsidies do not end up with those for whom they are intended."
"An example of this, which was quoted only this summer, is the fact that even the Dutch Queen receives subsidies for creating an olive tree plantation in Italy."
"If there is somebody in Europe who does not need this money, then surely it is one of the world's richest women."
"And this is going on while rural policy in Groningen in the Netherlands, for example, has insufficient funding to help small farmers keep their heads above water."
"This proves that this policy has got out of hand and that we must inject transparency into the flow of funding."
"This could, in turn, serve as a basis for a thorough reform even before the new Member States join."
"For this is desperately needed."
"Mr Casaca's report is a first step in this direction."
"Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur, Paulo Casaca, on the quality of the work that he has submitted for our consideration, but especially on the rigorous work he has undertaken as a Member of this Parliament on accounting transparency and Community procedures."
"I, like the rapporteur, acknowledge that the Commission proposal is acceptable, because it undoubtedly represents a significant increase in the quality of Community controls and procedures and demonstrates that the Commission is already committed to this procedure."
"The monitoring of expenditure and of all Community funding procedures is indissolubly linked to greater transparency and equity."
"It is, therefore, in these fields that the Commission and Parliament must focus their main concerns."
"We are all aware of the quantity and the scale of fraud that has been perpetrated - despite the existing monitoring system - and therefore nothing that we can do to improve the system will be cost-free or dispensable."
"The Commission in particular and the European Union in general can only gain by disseminating all available information to the citizens and primarily by the public's understanding of the relationship between the main beneficiaries of common funding policies."
"We look forward to seeing whether the promises made by the Commissioner responsible for agriculture in this field can be fulfilled in the short term."
"I also wish to endorse the rapporteur's proposal aiming to change the legal basis from Article 37 to Article 280 of the Treaty."
"This would be a major change, of great significance, which would attach the utmost priority to protecting the Community's financial interests."
"I should like, finally, to remind you that fairness in international trade is an incalculable asset in the medium term and, above all, that there are no isolated or unconnected economic sectors."
"The potential harm to third countries arising from protectionist policies or the absence of transparency in procedures or in the implementation of rules will eventually be suffered by those who make this form of behaviour the norm for intervention."
"It is absolutely crucial that the proclaimed reform of the CAP can incorporate these and other principles."
"As there is plenty of time before the vote, I intend to apply the catch-the-eye system so that Members not on the list of speakers can take the floor."
"Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I wish to thank all my fellow Members who have been kind enough to refer to the work that we have produced in this field and I should like to say that, on this matter, the Committee on Budgetary Control has, in fact, worked extremely well."
"We have all shared the same vision, which essentially we all hold with regard to the need to protect our financial interests, and we have produced a piece of work that is essentially collective."
"Having said this, I should also like to thank the Commissioner for the attention that she has paid to this report, but I must say, Commissioner, that your intervention raised some questions that I think are absolutely crucial to clarify."
"And, with the permission of the President, I should like to ask you four very specific questions highlighted by this report:"
"Firstly, the Commissioner tells us that Article 280 only concerns fraud and that this regulation is about scrutiny."
"Commissioner, this is not the first time that I have heard the Commission say this, but I am tempted to say that perhaps the Commission needs to take a closer look at Article 280."
"Because, and to translate freely from the English version, the first paragraph of this very Article states that 'the Community and the Member States shall counter fraud and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Community'."
"It is quite clear, therefore, from the wording of Article 280 that we are not only dealing with fraud but with all and any illegal activity that threatens the financial interests of the Community."
"It is, therefore, perfectly clear that this regulation falls entirely within the scope of this protection, and I must say that the overwhelming majority of processes to recover money undertaken by the Community are done carried out under this regulation."
"I would say that perhaps around three-quarters of these processes and three-quarters of the appropriations recovered fall under this regulation."
"How, then, can the Commission say something like this - that this has nothing to do with Article 280, when this regulation is a straightforward transcription of what is laid down in Article 280?"
"Secondly, the Commissioner says that the performance of this regulation has been satisfactory."
"As has already been said, I do not believe we can look at this regulation in isolation from the other regulations and from the entire legal structure intended to protect the financial interests of the Community."
"From this point of view, I only wish to point out once again the scandal that I have already mentioned; the scandal of the butter falsified by the Camorra of Naples and which had the cooperation of major European milk-product undertakings in almost all large European countries."
"This is a scandal that started in 1995, that involved at least 35 thousand tonnes of falsified butter, and which was only stopped in the year 2000, in other words, 35 thousand tonnes of butter were falsified over five years, involving large undertakings in France, Germany, Belgium and probably in other countries."
"And not once did this regulation enable the Commission to understand the first thing about this falsification of butter."
"A local investigation had to be conducted by the Italian police in Naples for this scandal to start to be unravelled."
"We are now in 2002, and we still do not know which undertakings are involved and what the Commission intends to do to these undertakings."
"And the Commissioner thinks that this is satisfactory. Please forgive me for saying so, but this is not satisfactory."
"I do not think it is satisfactory that food falsification has almost doubled between the year 2000 and 2001, which is, for example, another figure that has appeared in the press and which has not, so far, been denied by the Commission."
"This, as far as I am concerned, is not satisfactory;"
"Thirdly, Commissioner, we have the issue of transparency."
"I have heard the Commissioner call for transparency - and rightly so - in the most varied circumstances."
"In these circumstances, however, I do not understand why it is that when we reach this point, the Commission and, therefore, also the Commissioner, are no longer calling for transparency."
"How is it possible that we can go onto the Internet and see who is applying for grants funded by the Community science Programme, for example, and who has received these grants, but we cannot find out which multinationals receive millions and millions of euros to export European food surpluses or to dispose of them on the internal market?"
"Why is this a State secret?"
"Why is the Commission not telling us which undertakings these are?"
"How much are they receiving?"
"For what purpose?"
"What aspect of this needs to remain secret?"
"And here, as our fellow Members have already said, and quite rightly so, our problem is not just with the Commission, but also with our fellow Members from the PPE and the Liberals, who have also hitherto refused to accept that this rule, which I believe is fundamentally transparent, is included in the regulation;"
"Lastly, Commissioner, I have a question to ask you about the definition of the protection of the Community's financial interests."
"Because this definition has been made in the following way: the falsification of milk products is only considered to be a problem for the Community if the perpetrators are in receipt of a Community subsidy."
"In other words, if they do not receive this subsidy, it is no longer an issue for the Community."
"This is completely absurd, Commissioner, for the following reasons: milk producers exceed their reference quantity - in other words, they are producing milk - and this milk has not been subsidised - the Community allows the industry that buys their milk to immediately enforce preventive retention, in other words, even before a quota surplus is observed, a preventive retention of money is made to pay a fine on the quota."
"In other words, even if these farmers have committed no offence, have not even increased their milk production, money is nonetheless taken from them."
"This is what is happening to milk producers."
"If we have an undertaking that is producing 'fake' milk products, in other words, that is making butter without milk, that is making butter with a huge variety of things that should never be used in any food product; totally artificial things, then the Community says the following: well, this is not our problem unless Community export subsidies have been received."
"This makes no sense at all!"
"This is the Community doctrine, however, and has been the doctrine advocated in the Committee on Budgetary Control, year after year, and is still being advocated."
"I cannot accept this, Commissioner!"
"I would like you also to explain to us clearly why the Commission is adopting this attitude, because I cannot explain it to anyone!"
"I cannot go to the farmers of the region that I represent here and tell them something like this, because there is no possible explanation for this and therefore I should like the Commission to clearly explain the reason for this incongruity."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Members of Parliament for their interesting speeches - I have learned a lot of new things, including about the equal treatment of the Belgian Queen, and olive growing."
"Mr Casaca was right to express concerns about irregularities."
"I would like to point out that Regulation 4045/89 scrutiny results in a high number of irregularities being reported to OLAF, and also in the identification of and follow-up to cases, to which Mr Casaca referred."
"This is very important."
"I should like to make clear the Commission position on some of the amendments and I will also try to answer Mr Casaca's four questions."
"The first one concerns the legal basis."
"I have three points to make."
"Firstly, Regulation 4045/89 is a control regulation and not an anti-fraud regulation."
"Therefore, Article 37 is the most appropriate legal basis."
"Secondly, these are technical amendments and there is no justification for making substantive changes at this point."
"Thirdly, the opinion of Mr Casaca's own committee - the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market - based on the advice of Parliament's Legal Service, was that Article 37 was the most appropriate legal basis."
"It is very important for all those involved that a distinction is made between control and anti-fraud."
"That is why the Commission rejects this amendment on the legal basis."
"Amendments 2, 3 and 4 expand on or slightly strengthen the existing provisions and are acceptable to the Commission."
"Concerning Amendment 5, I have to stress that, as Member States are already required to send the Commission a list of beneficiaries, this part of the amendment is unnecessary."
"The methods used by the Member States to calculate the minimum number of scrutinies have been checked by Commission services and found to be satisfactory."
"That is why the Commission rejects this amendment."
"We can accept Amendment 6, even though it seems to be superfluous."
"Amendment 7 exceeds the nature of a technical amendment, would mark a major change in the relations between Member States and could also have major legal effects."
"The Commission is not opposed to the amendment in itself but, in view of the legal and political issues, it is a question that needs to be taken up at horizontal level, and that is why the Commission rejects it."
"On Amendments 8 and 9, the Committee on Budgetary Control wants Commission staff to carry out a certain number of controls each year, one in each Member State, plus one multinational control."
"In allocating its control efforts, the Commission makes use of risk analysis."
"This approach has been demanded and supported by the European Court of Auditors and Parliament."
"These Amendments 8 and 9 would drastically limit the effectiveness of any risk analysis because of the amount of work that would have to be done every year."
"DG Agriculture's audit services are responsible for the control of many measures, and to oblige them to carry out all the controls required by these amendments - whether they are high risk or not - is not an acceptable approach."
"Furthermore, some Member States have one control service, others have several, and difficulties may be identified in some but not in others."
"However, Amendment 8 requires one control per Member State per year whatever the circumstances: this does not take account of the risks identified and will mean scarce resources also being used on low-risk controls."
"If Parliament insists on diverting from this professional audit approach, then it would also effectively be requiring the Commission to commit additional budgetary means to recruit the necessary staff."
"Finally, the amendment by Mr Cunha aimed at publishing the list of beneficiaries, to which Mr Casaca referred."
"The Commission promotes openness and transparency but does not think that this is a wise proposal."
"The programme may be decided up to 12 months before the beginning of some scrutinies, and giving a beneficiary 12 months' notice of a control cannot be good control practice."
"In any event, Regulation 4045/89 forbids the use of nominative data in this way."
"I understand that there is also a volume question that has to do with the practicality of giving out some of the information in a meaningful way."
"That is why this amendment is not acceptable to the Commission."
"With regard to the specific case concerning butter, I cannot supply all the details on that."
"However, I would ask you to send the Commission a written question on this case."
"We could then update you on what actions have been taken."
"We will have to come back to the other more general political questions, because I would like to restrict my comments to the proposal before us."
"Mr President, as we have a bit more time today, I would like to avail myself of the opportunity you mentioned earlier."
"Here is a Commission proposal, one that has been the subject of wide public discussion in Europe, on how the agricultural policy should be reformed."
"We are now telling you, Commissioner, which strands of the agricultural policy the Budget Control Committee believes should be changed."
"Its arguments are well known."
"The question of the legal basis - about Article 37 or Article 280, as proposed by us - is of course not just an academic one."
"It is about how public the area of agricultural policy should become."
"Is Parliament really on board, or is it not?"
"It is about all these things."
"That is what we want, and we owe it to our citizens."
"When I said earlier that our present systems of export refunds cannot be made proof against fraud, you on the Commission ought really to have pricked up your ears, if you are really serious about protecting the tax revenues that we raise in the Member States."
"No reaction on the part of the Commission reaches my ears - on the contrary."
"Looking at the preliminary draft budget for the coming year, we find one particularly sensitive area, one I have mentioned before, namely the subsidies for exports of live animals, specifically cattle."
"On that, I must say that our budget is so lacking in transparency that Parliament first has to coax these export refunds, which do not even have a credit line of their own, out of it!"
"Commissioner, we will try to get one in the 2003 budget year, so that we can get a slightly clearer view of things."
"Let us get back to our cattle."
"I see that the figures for these next year are bigger than those for this year, adding up to a policy precisely contrary to what we actually wanted - down with export refunds, especially where live animals are tormented in the way they were in the past, and where the Commission is not in a position to guarantee the correct implementation of what the directives contain on the subject."
"In today's budget, Commissioner, we already have an agreement between the Finance Ministers and Parliament to the effect that the Commission will, by 31 May, present a report on the proper implementation of the Animal Transport Directives in the Member States and the number of sanctions eventually imposed by the Commission on those Member States that may have contravened them."
"As yet, nothing has been put on the table - nothing!"
"How are we to get to grips with the issue if you simply refuse to do anything?"
"We will bring this issue up again."
"I would be very happy if we could leave this debate at least with the certainty that we would soon have your institution's report on the table."
"To repeat: the policy you are at present pursuing runs directly counter to our own interests."
"You are increasing export refunds, at any rate for cattle."
"You cannot, then, shuffle off onto anyone else the responsibility for the unspeakable torments inflicted on the live animals that we are exporting to the Middle East."
"You yourselves must shoulder that responsibility, and if you think that controls in the Member States are in fact satisfactory on the whole, then I will repeat that last year's irregularities and frauds amounted to EUR 430 million."
"I do not know how our fellow-citizens of the EU understand your utterances on the subject."
"Finally, I was not in Johannesburg, and so I do not know whether you also represented us, but, Commissioner, was it not made clear to us there, all the time, that export refunds of this sort, this kind of agricultural policy, this type of subsidy, ends up making a massive contribution to the great misery to be found in many parts of the world?"
"Oh yes, we will find room in our budget for some sort of aid, for handouts of some kind, but what I have said is a fact, and you are at present engaged in a policy contrary to the interests of these countries and, above all, against those of Europe's taxpayers."
"Please do not let these announcements be the end of the matter."
"You may well have had the opportunity today to show your goodwill with a few small steps closer to what Parliament is proposing, but - and not only with regard to transparency - you have failed to do so, preferring to hide yourselves behind this or that paragraph."
"We, who seek re-election by our fellow-citizens, cannot do that."
"That is why we have to counter your conception of agricultural policy with our own."
"Mr President, since we are all having a go at the common agricultural policy, I too would like to state a few facts in relation to it."
"In the UK this weekend there was a huge rally - Liberty and Livelihood - where thousands of people gathered in London to protest at various problems relating to the countryside."
"What this rally did not put across, however, was the way that the countryside is massively subsidised."
"Agriculture in particular is very heavily subsidised compared to every other industry in the European Union."
"When we see 40% of the EU budget going to 5% of the EU population then the policy is clearly in need of radical reform."
"It seems strange to me, however, that within this reform process two areas are not being touched upon. These are the scandal of the EU sugar market, where extortionate prices throughout the EU enable people to take advantage of what I believe to be a very corrupt regime, and also the scandal of the tobacco industry, the existence of which people are bound to feel is an absolute contradiction at a time when the European Union is also trying to promote health initiatives."
"These are key areas."
"But the most important issue here today is transparency."
"Why is it that, while I can go to a website and find out where every single euro in relation to regional policy and Structural Funds is paid out in my area, I cannot do the same in relation to the common agricultural policy?"
"That possibility does not exist and it is a possibility I want to see created."
"That is the relationship the taxpayers of Europe need to have with the recipients of this funding: in that way perhaps we will be able to see how much Prince Charles, the Queen and the rest of the royal family receive in relation to subsidies granted under the common agricultural policy."
"We need to crack this open."
"It is crucial that we get the support of the people who call repeatedly in this House for transparency."
"That is what we are asking for."
"The Commission needs to cooperate much more closely with Member States across the whole of the European Union to ensure that this is the case."
"Agricultural subsidies make up a huge proportion of the European budget."
"This is a fact."
"For 20 years, I have been hearing that this proportion should be reduced, but this is an extremely slow process."
"As an MEP, it fills me with great sadness and I am extremely disappointed about the fact that Parliament still has no grip on the situation."
"When Mr Casaca then tries - at least based on the authority which we clearly have, which is a budgetary authority - to gain an overview of the whole subsidy scheme, we do not exactly receive satisfactory feedback from you."
"It appears that you, as Commissioner, allow yourself to be fobbed off with what is being whispered into your ear by the bureaucrats who have accompanied you for so many years and who have for so long denied Parliament any direct input."
"After all, we want to gain a grip on agricultural policy, the export subsidies, and the way in which these subsidies are distributed."
"We would like to see an end to the exploitation of the developing countries."
"I fully concur with what Mr Bösch and Mrs Morgan said on this subject."
"When I was in Johannesburg, I was ashamed when I saw how, with our subsidies, we sound the death knell for a number of countries that have few resources to survive."
"There are a few countries that only have sugar to export, and we have managed to hold on to these wretched subsidies that we grant to our sugar barons thanks to our Member States."
"Parliament has decided in the Committee on Development and Cooperation that this should stop."
"However, an amendment has crept in surreptitiously, upon which the plenary has yet again voted to maintain the agricultural subsidies for sugar."
"There are innumerable examples quoted here."
"As democratic representatives of our citizens, we would like a grip on these subsidies."
"Similarly, I fail to obtain an explanation for the way in which Europe manages to distribute unnecessary and harmful subsidies, while we are actually committed to solidarity with the developing world."
"I recently visited Botswana, where, apart from diamonds, they only have a few cattle to export."
"We concluded an agreement in this respect."
"There are so many African countries that wish to trade fairly with us, yet we still fail to create the opportunities for this."
"Finally, I should like to point out that with regard to agricultural subsidies, export subsidies for live animals too are a disgrace and unacceptable to our public opinion."
"I am appalled to find out that you intend to increase these."
"Surely that is impossible."
"I should therefore like to concur with our fellow MEPs in their plea."
"I myself was a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control for a while, and I have great respect for my fellow MEPs and for their reports."
"I always read the reports with great interest, but I would finally like to see some change."
"In the final analysis, we are not here to keep the show on the road; we are here to create justice."
"Mr President, I do not want to discuss what has been said."
"I am just very glad that I came into the Chamber early in order to do some work in peace and quiet, and then witnessed an interesting debate."
"I would like to congratulate you, Mr President, on permitting it and making it possible, and on giving your colleagues in the Bureau a good example to follow in the future."
"What a pity so few Members were here, but perhaps more will turn up in the Chamber when word gets around."
"Thank you, Mr Swoboda for your kind words."
"I can assure you and the rest of the House that the Bureau as a whole is making an effort, now that the Rules of Procedure have changed, to ensure that debates in Plenary are exactly as you said."
"This is a policy of the Bureau as a whole and I think that, as we have just seen, we can make debates in Plenary even better than they have been in the past."
"Mr President, following on from Mr Swoboda's excellent suggestion perhaps this could be taken on board in the context of the whole debate about the catch-the-eye procedure."
"We have a debate this afternoon on the budget where catch-the-eye is to be applied."
"Perhaps the Bureau and the Council of Presidents could also consider the possibility of formalising the rule so that every debate that ends before the time allocated to it then finishes with a period of catch-the-eye."
"I agree with Mr Swoboda that it is an excellent innovation."
"It adds to the liveliness of the debate and it also means that the people in the public gallery have something to watch and to listen to in the last half hour, rather than having to face an empty Chamber."
"The next item is the vote."
"Mr President, might I just ask you to give the floor to our Committee's rapporteur on this area, so he can say a few words on this report?"
"The rapporteur is Mr Mulder."
"Mr Mulder I will give the floor exceptionally to you because I understand you have been carrying out the work on behalf of the Chairman of the Committee."
"Mr President, Parliament is not always able to congratulate the Commission, but I should like to do so on this occasion."
"Agricultural policy in the EU is controversial and if that is the case, for whatever reason, we must, above all, ensure that there is a sound mechanism to control the expenditure of the funds."
"So far, the Commission has been able to inspect these funds two years following closure of the accounts."
"Last year, Parliament proposed in a resolution to extend this period to 36 months."
"The Commission followed this up promptly, for which I should like to give it credit."
"At this stage, we can only hope that the Council meets Parliament's and the Commission's wish to improve control on agricultural expenditure."
"Mr President, in June last year, we debated the First Reading of a Commission proposal on the regulation on structural business statistics, in order to add to it two sectoral annexes, one of which relates to credit institutions and the other to pension funds and, at the same time, to extend the scope of the regulation to other financial institutions, pension funds and credit and insurance auxiliaries."
"Finally, two new items relating to the environment are included in the statistics on industrial firms."
"Structural business statistics on credit institutions, pension funds and other businesses in the financial services sector are necessary in order to evaluate the single financial market, back up macroeconomic statistics and keep the stability of the EU's financial system under observation."
"Data on industry's expenditure on the protection of the environment are an important tool for policymakers in assessing the cost of adherence to environmental law, including its effect on businesses' competitiveness, and checking whether the polluter-pays principle is being adhered to."
"Following the first reading, I, as rapporteur, made contact in July 2001 with the then new presidency of the Council in the hope of an early Common Position from the Council, but this turned out to be over-ambitious."
"The Belgians appeared to have forgotten us, and the Common Position eventually turned up towards the end of the Spanish Presidency."
"I am glad that, despite what we term the summer recess, Parliament has allowed me to present my report for Second Reading just three months later."
"I can sympathise with those Member States who have problems with submitting definite data on pension funds, but the Council has accepted four amendments by us, and I propose that this House should vote in favour of it."
"Mr President, this report is concerned with N1 vehicles which is Commission jargon for vans."
"This is of interest to that most notorious of British drivers - white van man! White van man, as we know in the UK, is a person who despite being in a Ford Transit van thinks he is Michael Schumacher."
"I know that this is a uniquely British thing, as here on the continent - and particularly in Italy - every driver thinks he is Michael Schumacher."
"This report is largely technical and concerns how we test the CO2 produced from these vehicles."
"I have managed to secure exemptions for small manufacturers of specialist vehicles, in particular ambulances, and have also introduced the concept of families of vehicles in order to group together the thousands of vehicles produced in different derivatives."
"N1 vehicles are important to all of us because you are likely to make your last-but-one journey in an N1 vehicle i.e. an ambulance."
"But you will also be pleased to know I have secured an exemption for the vehicle you will make your last journey in, because hearses are also to be exempted from this directive."
"It gives me great pleasure, as a fellow Scot, to welcome to the European Parliament Sir David Steel, President of the Scottish Parliament, who has taken his seat in the distinguished visitors' gallery."
"Sir David will be holding a number of meetings in Parliament and will be observing the proceedings."
"You are most welcome to this House, Sir David, and we would like to wish you a pleasant and fruitful stay."
"Mr President, I cannot disguise my disappointment that the report has just been rejected."
"I would say to those who voted against it and to the members of the PPE-DE Group that I hope they realise they have just voted against greater cooperation in matters of asylum in the European Union; they have voted against sharing best practice in measures as we move towards a common asylum policy; they have voted against looking at good ideas and sharing those ideas ..."
"(Applause from the left)"
"They have voted against measures to make certain that we are absolutely clear that people do not abuse the asylum system for terrorist purposes."
"Those are the things we were looking at and it has been rejected by members of the PPE-DE Group."
"That is a disappointment for this House."
"(The President interrupted the speaker)"
"(Applause from the left)"
"I do not want to start a debate."
"Mr Ribeiro, can I ask what your point of order is and perhaps you could tell us under which Rule you are making it?"
"Mr President, I wish to use this point of order to draw attention to this highly irregular procedure, which demonstrates merely what it is to be a bad loser following a vote."
"This intervention should have been made, at the latest, at the time of the explanations of vote and not now."
"To my mind, this is a most irregular procedure."
". (DE) The Commission proposal for facilitating more extensive financial corrections is to be welcomed."
"The accumulated fraud with EU funds gives cause for concern, as do a number of situations in the institutions - I wish briefly to refer here to the Court of Auditors' most recent special report on the support system for oilseeds."
"These matters call for more effective action than has hitherto been the case."
"The Commission proposal for increasing, by means of an extended time period, the possibilities for recovering amounts lost, is a step in the right direction."
"The Freedom Party delegation has therefore voted in favour of the report."
"The reason why we are not opposed to this draft text is so that workers who so desire can leave employment before retirement age."
"Several aspects of the draft text are, nonetheless, unacceptable."
"It is unacceptable, first and foremost, that job cuts are not being made on a voluntary basis and that all those who so desire cannot benefit from being released from their duties."
"What is equally unacceptable is that 600 officials are being encouraged to retire, whilst only 273 are being taken on."
"This means there will be additional work for those who remain, whereas the report acknowledges that 1 254 positions need to be filled."
"And, if the institutions are planning to compensate for the lack of employees by increasing job insecurity and sub-contracting - which is often one and the same thing - this is no better."
"All this is unacceptable in a context of unemployment and job insecurity."
"Therefore, whilst we are not opposed to the draft text, we did not wish to give it our backing and we abstained from the vote."
". (PT) Because Portugal, and more precisely the coasts of the Algarve, have already suffered unprecedented maritime pollution, I can only agree with the recommendation by the rapporteur, Mr Bakopoulos, with all the European Commission initiatives that aim to improve legislative standards applicable to maritime safety and to the prevention of pollution by ships, and with making the implementation of European policy in this field more effective."
"This is why I agree entirely with the proposal to create a single maritime safety Committee, thereby replacing national committees."
"This new structure will constitute a qualitative leap in the safety of European coasts and in the fight to prevent pollution caused by ships."
"I voted in favour of Mr Goodwill's report on the basis that it will help to further protect the environment."
"The proposal extends the scope of existing Directives 70/156/EEC and 80/1268 as regards the measurement of carbon dioxide emissions and fuel consumption."
"In other words new light goods vehicles will now have to respect requirements that are broadly similar to the ones that are already applied to passenger cars."
"I hope that by measuring the fuel consumption and carbon dioxide in these vehicles we will be able to develop possible measures to improve vehicle performance in these areas."
"In order to secure an EU type approval for light commercial vehicles, the Directive will include a requirement that in the future vehicles be tested for carbon dioxide emissions and fuel consumption."
"Member States will not be able to allow the registration and entry into service of light commercial vehicles if they do not have a valid certificate of conformity for this type of approval after 1 January 2007."
"Ultimately, both the environment and vehicle operators stand to gain from this proposal if carbon monoxide can be measured and then cut back and if vehicle performance can be improved."
"We voted against this report which again proposes, on the pretext of 'combating terrorism', to 'facilitate co-operation between the police and judicial authorities in the fight against terrorism'."
"Stepping up repression wherever this may be (Ireland, the Basque Country, Corsica, etc) with contempt for the quest for a political solution, has not yet shown that it is the way to stamp out terrorism."
"Repression has instead, in response, played a part in fuelling terrorism."
"In reality, 'combating terrorism' is only being used here as a pretext to further strengthen Europe's security measures, whilst once again highlighting the fact that it is beyond the control of the population."
"The fact that this proposal emanates from the Kingdom of Spain, whose security measures have retained many of the traits inherited from Francoism, does nothing to inspire confidence."
"It is certainly not a lack of security measures that Europe is suffering from. It is, on the contrary, suffering from abuses of security, where migrant workers must, in addition to all their other problems, deal with the suspicion of being potential 'terrorists'."
"I have voted in favour of these two proposals because they form part of a coherent set of horizontal measures that will ensure the correct and effective implementation of the measures that the EP has already adopted in the fight against terrorism (the framework decision on combating terrorism and the framework decision on the European arrest warrant)."
"Serious account must be taken of the terrorist threat, on both sides of the Atlantic, because it constitutes not only one of the greatest threats to democracy, the free exercise of human rights and free economic and social development; above all, it constitutes an attack on the most fundamental of human rights; the right to life."
"I am, therefore, pleased to see that the European Union has made considerable progress since the terrible events of 11 September 2001, on exchanging information, on police and judicial coordination in the fight against terrorism and on its legislative framework."
"I hope that the next step will be to reach agreement on the priority that must be attached to the issues of funding the fight against terrorism and of stepping up our dialogue with the United States (and the priority for the negotiations opened this summer and an agreement on judicial cooperation with the United States to be concluded)."
"The fight against terrorism must always be marked by the values of the democratic rule of law, by respect for citizens' rights and by common standards of justice."
"Any fight that disregards these priorities would represent an unjustifiable concession to barbarity and an unacceptable rejection of the values of our civilisation."
"This initiative by Spain, within the Council, is part of the process of strengthening supranational police and judicial mechanisms - specifically at EU level - in the name of the so-called 'fight against terrorism'."
"Bodies which evade democratic and jurisdictional control (Europol and Eurojust), are being developed and strengthened, bypassing the guarantees for rights and freedoms laid down in national legislative and constitutional frameworks."
"Cooperation between national States is bypassed with the creation of mechanisms for supranational control over these States."
"It is worth emphasising that the proposal for the creation of a 'mechanism for evaluating the legal systems and their implementation at national level in the fight against terrorism' bypasses and breaches the legal base that currently exists in the Treaties."
"Amongst other aspects, these initiatives are part of a security shift that increasingly threatens fundamental rights, freedoms and guarantees."
"Although the rapporteur has tabled proposals for amendments that seek to introduce assurances and safeguards for fundamental rights, freedoms and guarantees - for example, for the transfer and management of personal information and data (it should be noted that Europol is bound by agreements with third countries, not least with the USA) - this does not change the general tenor of the initiatives that have been proposed."
"Hence our vote against the report."
"I have voted against the report by Mr Galeote in the conviction that the new Rules of this Parliament have been used in an improper manner by the big political groups of this House."
"The Galeote report is best summed up in the words used yesterday by Mr Turco during the debate."
"I would support his analysis as a whole."
"While the British Conservative Delegation are determined to play a full part in the fight against terrorism and fully support enhanced cooperation between the police and other law enforcement organisations in the various Member States, we cannot support moves towards the extension of Eurojust."
"The United Kingdom should not become a member of Eurojust and should retain its own strong resistance to terrorism."
"The Delegation supports the initiatives in the recent Kirkhope report on the establishment of Joint Investigation teams in which police forces combine intelligence in the fight against major criminals."
"This initiative has yet to be implemented in the Member States."
"Eurojust is not the way forward and is unnecessary if cooperation is improved following the Kirkhope report."
"For the reasons outlined above the British Conservative Delegation abstained on this report."
"As today's debate has amply illustrated, the machinery for producing undemocratic, repressive legislation has gone into overdrive in the European Union."
"The objective of the Spanish Government's initiatives (voted without debate under the new Rules of Procedure) is to strengthen and accelerate the decisions on collecting and exchanging information which have already been taken and to stifle the Member States with strict supervision to ensure they transpose the European terrorism law and the European arrest warrant into their legislation quickly and faithfully."
"Their fear appears to be that, with pressure from democratic grass-roots movements already voicing their opinion in numerous countries, the Member States may not fall into line with this dire legislation."
"As part of improved coordination, Member States are obliged, contrary to all notions of national sovereignty, to collate a minimum number of facts on so-called terrorist-related crimes and pass them on to Europol and Eurojust."
"Just what is meant by coordination and uniform police and judicial cooperation is perfectly clear from the confidential Europol document leaked recently which, under the telling title 'European Best Practices on Handling Information Sources', sanctions the use of grasses and sting operations by agents acting for the police who will go unpunished even if they help commit the crime!"
"That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the texts in question."
". (NL) Authoritarian governments have always been characterised by the notion that they can best survive criticism on their policy by restricting their citizens in their freedom of information exchange, opinion, organisation and travel."
"The fear of terror attacks that has grown since last year has prompted a revival of plans to reinforce the army, police and secret services and to restrict civil liberties."
"For a while, this fear makes these controversial plans more acceptable to a large proportion of the population than they would be at other times."
"The public have since discovered the drawbacks of such a development."
"In the Netherlands, a campaign among computer users against the requirement that electronic mail be stored, requested by the Council, gained 2500 supporters within the space of two days last week."
"Quite apart from this breach of the mail's confidentiality, which has been in existence for more than a century, there have been attempts to deprive radical opposition movements of all prospects and cause them to resort to violence, upon which they can be declared illegal."
"Political organisations in exile, based in Europe, are stripped of their right of residence and are cut off from the movement of payments."
"Fortunately, this Parliament too is starting to realise that fear of terror should not be a reason for abolishing the democratic and tolerant character of our society."
"I reject the proposal, but endorse the proposals to better protect personal data, inform Parliament and place reports in the public domain."
"(PT) My vote in favour of this report reflects my agreement with the two initiatives by Spain aimed at establishing measures to facilitate cooperation between the police and judicial authorities in the fight against terrorism. My favourable vote also reflects my support for the main amendments tabled by the rapporteur: the stipulation that information transferred under this decision should be limited to criminal investigations of terrorist activities; the call for each Member State to appoint a Eurojust correspondent responsible for issues involving terrorism, rather than giving the Member States the option to appoint another competent authority and the call for Member States to set up joint investigation teams to combat terrorism whenever closer cooperation is needed and, specifically, for complex cases with transnational implications."
"Mr President, I have to say, with regard to the Gebhardt report, that I could not prevent myself dreaming of Mr Antonio Di Pietro, our fellow Member, who is well-known in Italy and throughout Europe in circles where judicial networks are a topic of conversation."
"On the subject of networks, I dreamt that Mr Di Pietro was a fisherman and that he was casting nets from his boat."
"However, the net he was casting was a judicial net and it caught a lot of big fish, but the small fish managed to escape because, as you know, they want to become pensioners."
"Well then, in my opinion, this dream means that we will have an excellent catch of European criminals in this judicial network, as I saw in my dream."
"The British Conservative Delegation do not see any cause to introduce pan-European judicial training."
"This is a matter for individual Member States and the present system of training the Judiciary is unique and particular to each of those States."
"It should remain this way."
"There are also implications for the budget of the European Union which are unacceptable and will be separately resisted in the budgetary process."
"The British Conservatives cannot support the measures in this report."
". (PT) I voted in favour of this report because I believe that the French initiative under our consideration will improve our knowledge of the legal and judicial situation of the Member States and of the Community and, consequently, the performance of all members of the judiciary in the European Union and its Member States - judges, magistrates, lawyers and, possibly, police officers with duties similar to those of a magistrate."
"This network, comprising national schools and institutions of the Member States responsible for further judicial training, has already existed informally since October 2000, but does not have legal personality."
"This limitation means that it cannot receive funding from Community or Member States' budgets, which will change if this French initiative is adopted, as it will then be eligible for funding under the EU's general budget."
"In short, this is yet another boost to improving our knowledge of the judicial and legal systems of the Member States and of the legal instruments on which judicial cooperation in the EU is based."
"Mr President, if Commissioner Wallström will forgive me, last night, I dreamt of her too."
"Why is that?"
"Because I had met a GMO who said to me - none of us know what GMOs look like - that he, in his turn, had dreamt he was Ulysses, tied up so as not to succumb to the temptation of the sirens, and that he had seen a beautiful GMO - resembling Mrs Wallström - which called to him: 'Follow me, follow me and you will be happy.'"
"But it was only a dream, Mr President: reality is different."
"I therefore voted against the report, despite the fact that I was convinced in my dream that I should follow the recommendations of the siren, Commissioner Wallström."
"I am afraid Mrs Wallström seems to be paying more attention to Mr Barón Crespo than to you, Mr Fatuzzo."
"The Commission proposal on the transboundary movement of genetically modified organisms unfortunately does less than the Cartagena Protocol which it is supposed to apply."
"The main shortcomings which need to be addressed are as follows:"
"One: the principle of prevention needs to be clearly stated in the Community text."
"Two: the same weights and measures should apply to both the EU internal market and external trade."
"If a product is not marketed on the internal market, it should be banned for export."
"Three: full responsibility for the movement of banned genetically modified organisms should rest with the country of export; it should not be shifted on to the country of import."
"Four: the public must be fully informed."
"Five: everything should be done to ensure that large companies do not use their multinational structure to evade controls."
"The amendments by the European Parliament Committee on the Environment are on the right track, which is why I support them."
"In May 2000, the European Union and its Member States signed the Cartagena Protocol on the prevention of biotechnological risks in the fields of the safe transfer, handling and use of GMOs."
"This European Commission proposal for a regulation is extremely important because it boosts the practical implementation of the Cartagena Protocol in the European Union, thereby preventing situations of distortion of competition that could arise if these rules were defined at national level."
"The rapporteur has improved the proposal for a regulation, and his proposal to ban GMO exports that have not been authorised in the European Union itself warrants particular applause."
"It is crucial that we make ongoing efforts, also within the framework of transboundary movements, to ensure an adequate degree of protection for the safe transfer, manipulation and use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) created by modern biotechnology, which are likely to have adverse effects on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, and thereby to prevent risks to human health."
"This is the concern of this Regulation, now being studied at first reading, which seeks to establish the provisions necessary to the implementation of the Cartagena Protocol."
"We fully support this because in this highly sensitive field, the Community Regulation is seeking to prevent disparities and the imposition of Member States' regulatory and administrative legal provisions and thereby to provide greater legal security and to contribute to the smooth functioning of the internal market."
"In view of the potential risk that GMOs can constitute for the environment in general and biological diversity in particular, we Swedish Christian Democrats have chosen to support a restrictive policy."
"With reference to the precautionary principle, we believe that the country of import's rules must be respected by the exporter."
"We also believe it to be very important for common rules governing liability for damage to be drawn up at international level."
"It should, moreover, go without saying that we must not export GMOs that we do not ourselves permit within the European Union."
"The provisions of the regulation should be applied, irrespective of when the Cartagena Protocol comes into force."
"Mr President, last Thursday, I was taking part in a television programme in Milan."
"The Cardinal of Milan, His Excellency Dionigi Tettamanzi, from the city of Genoa, had stated the day before that we must open our arms to the immigrants who come to Europe, particularly, to Milan, and I am afraid that he received abusive telephone calls during the programme from disgruntled people who did not agree with this recommendation."
"Therefore, voting for better immigration, I thought of what Mr Vatanen said to me, personally, a few days ago: 'What if we had been born in Senegal?"
"What if we had been born in one of the countries from which these people are forced to emigrate to come to Europe and make a living?'."
". (NL) During the Cold War, refugees from the East were very welcome in Western Europe."
"Seeking refuge was praised as a freedom-loving act, which presupposed universal solidarity. These days, refugees mostly hail from further afield, look different to western Europeans, and there is far less understanding for the situation from which they are fleeing."
"Since the standard of living in the country they are leaving behind is always lower than ours, they are from the very start suspected of having economic motives for fleeing."
"This situation has been exacerbated over the past year by the fear that refugees could be terrorist infiltrators."
"EU Member States tend to prescribe upper limits to the number of refugees they will allow in their countries, and set their reception levels lower than those of the neighbouring states."
"This is how we create a Fortress Europe, which denies access to people even in huge distress and in respect of whom international treaties are being violated."
"The upshot is that, even more than before, families are being torn apart and that people are sent back to a country that is unsafe for them, where they head for disaster."
"I reject the main idea, but support the proposals tabled by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs not to extradite anyone to countries where capital punishment is a threat, possibly to deny refugee status only to war criminals, and to take account of the increasing number of female asylum seekers."
"Mr President, Mrs Angelilli's report recommends - and I support this - providing compensation to crime victims."
"I personally and the Pensioners Party which I represent, not least because many pensioners and elderly people are the victims of crimes, albeit minor crimes such as bag-snatching and burglary, believe that it is right that the state should provide compensation for the victims of crimes."
"Indeed, it is not just the authors of the crimes who are guilty: the State which ought to be carrying out scrutinies and monitoring and guaranteeing that these crimes do not happen, preventing them, and which ought to be educating its citizens to respect the law, is guilty too."
"I therefore call for this initiative to provide compensation for the victims of crimes to proceed and for public officials who do not do their job properly, especially the most influential, high-level politicians and administrators in our States, to receive heavy fines."
"The report by Mrs Roberta Angelilli is an improvement on the Commission's Green Paper on a legislative framework for compensating victims of crime."
"The basic idea put forward in the report, that all Member States should establish compensation schemes for victims of crime who cannot obtain compensation from the offenders responsible for the crime or through any means, including victims of terrorism, is a good one, because the European Convention on the Compensation of Victims of Violent Crimes, which has applied since 1988, has not been signed by all the Member States and, even where it has, it does not allow the victims of violent crimes to apply for state compensation."
"The directive on best practices in the various Member States, which the Commission is also called on to introduce, is a good move and will help less-experienced Member States deal with these issues."
"My vote in favour of this report reflects first my applause for the Green Paper on 'Compensation to crime victims', presented in May of this year by the Commission, which has provided a considerable boost in this sensitive field, attempting to lay down minimum common standards for the compensation of victims, that are respected throughout EU territory and, whenever possible, in accordance with the principle of reciprocity where third countries are concerned."
"Furthermore, my vote reflects my support for the magnificent report by Mrs Angelilli."
"The report suggests specifically that the minimum standards must include a clear definition, agreed on by all the Member States, of the types of offence that could be liable to compensation, with the prior provision of some objective characteristics."
"I also agree with the rapporteur's recommendation for the creation of a European victim support freephone line which would operate around the clock in all the official languages of the European Union."
"Mr President, what purpose do the cosmetics with which many women beautify themselves serve?"
"One poor elderly pensioner said to me: 'I have beggared myself with these cosmetics which have made these women look so beautiful."
"I have spent all my money."
"Now I am penniless, a poor pensioner, but I am happy because I have enjoyed my life'."
"Another pensioner, however, said to me: 'I, on the other hand, resisted the temptations of these women who use cosmetics and now I am a rich pensioner, but I regret the fact that I too did not have a happier, more enjoyable life with more contact with beautiful women who use cosmetics.'"
"I did not know what to do, so I looked at Mrs Roth-Behrendt, who I am sure uses cosmetics which have not been tested on animals."
"What a beautiful lady Mrs Roth-Behrendt is!"
"It is patently obvious that the cosmetics she uses are useful, maybe even more so than those tested on animals."
"Well then, we must follow the example of Mrs Roth-Behrendt, and so I voted for the motion."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.50 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"It is my sad duty to inform you of the murder, in a terrorist attack, of Don Juan Carlos Beira Montes, a Civil Guard, in Leiza, in Navarre, Spain."
"Once again, the blind hatred of ETA terrorism has struck a citizen of the Union, a member of the police force of a democratic State."
"As on previous occasions, I would like to express the European Parliament's total condemnation of this act and our complete solidarity with the family of the deceased, the citizens of Spain and the Spanish authorities."
"Together we will win the battle against terrorism."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to observe a minute's silence."
"(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr MacCormick has the floor."
"Mr President, might I draw attention to Item 12 of the Minutes, dealing with one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"My name appears twice in that list, but Members present will recall that I specifically made a point of order, concerning rule 2 of our Rules of Procedure."
"I therefore think that this should have been recorded as a point of order, while the point that I was making should be recorded in the Minutes."
"Your comments will be taken into account and the Minutes will be duly corrected."
"Are there any other comments, ladies and gentlemen?"
"(The Minutes were approved thus amended)"
"Mr President, we have never done anything like this before and I welcome the opportunity to open this debate."
"In normal, run-of-the-mill circumstances when we have the budget debate, we have already voted on first readings in committee, we come to the Chamber and most of us make a three-minute speech if we are lucky or, if not, a one and a half minute speech."
"What is more, they are statements and nothing is really gained because the work has already been done."
"What we are trying to gain from this session is a real dialogue, mainly with the Commission, but also with the Council, to seek guidance on how we should vote next week and to ask questions concerning events since the preliminary draft budget (PDB) was first presented."
"Since the PDB several things have happened, including the Council's vote on its draft budget which is what we vote upon."
"Our committees have been working with the rapporteurs to ensure that we can bring forward sensible amendments."
"As always, the amendments in front of us always exceed the amount of money that is available."
"It is the job of both our rapporteurs to assess those amendments."
"No doubt during the debate you will be asked questions concerning what you think of some of those amendments."
"We also have the situation of a more precise legislative programme since the PDB and we need to assess the changes."
"We have had external events such as the floods and we want to know how these will affect next year's budget."
"From our own perspective there are areas where we are unclear on how things will be funded."
"For instance, we still have no agreement with the Council or the Commission on how the EUR 27 million in Category 2 for the fisheries reconstruction programme will be found."
"Maybe someone will ask about that and if there are any ideas we will be grateful to hear them."
"A prime objective of the Development Committee is to ensure that the Global Health Fund has a significant amount of money."
"One of the reasons for this is that if we do not put in significant amounts the European Union may not have a seat at the table - a seat on the board."
"Is that true?"
"What amounts do we need?"
"I would hope that this issue will also be raised with the Commission so we can have guidance on it."
"With those few opening remarks, let me thank not only the Commission in general but also the individual Commissioners who are going to contribute to this debate."
"I would also like to thank the President-in-Office for being here."
"I hope the debate will be useful, fruitful and influence our votes next week in committee, because if it does not we will all have wasted four hours of our time."
"Mr President, like the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Wynn, I am most grateful for this new debate."
"We floated the idea as early as last spring, when we were extremely uncertain as to whether our efforts would come to anything."
"For us, it has been the overarching objective to try to reform the European Parliament's budgetary work, especially with a view to next year's completely new method of 'Activity Based Budgeting'."
"In this context, it has been important also to be able to renew the debate itself, which is perhaps the most visible part of Parliament's budgetary work."
"This reform also means that we have endeavoured to increase the committees' participation in the work."
"I have been round practically all the committees and discussed budget issues with them, and we are now also encouraging the committees to take an active part in today's debate."
"By using working parties and different types of report to focus more sharply upon the degree of implementation and upon the major budgetary deficiencies we have in the area of implementation, we shall now tighten up our demands for Parliament's budgetary decisions actually to be put into practice."
"Against this background, I welcome the way in which the Commission, the Council, a majority of Commissioners and the Danish Finance Minister in his Presidency role have taken part in the debate, and I hope that Parliament's own representatives will also make substantial efforts to ensure that we obtain a more exciting and constructive debate than has been provided by the fairly predictable monologues delivered up until now."
"The EU's budgetary system suffers from serious defects, especially a lack of flexibility."
"I believe that both Parliament and, certainly, the public have difficulty understanding why it is completely impossible to find resources for the proactive part of agricultural policy known as rural development, while billions are allocated to the other dimension of agricultural policy."
"Knowing, as we did, that there were resources elsewhere that were not being used, it has also been difficult for us to refuse the administrative expenditure needed for enlargement and to try to find a way of funding this expenditure without making use of the flexibility instrument."
"Consequently, one of this year's innovations is that we have tried more systematically to find and make use of unemployed resources and have contrived more systematically to bring expenditure forward in order to ease the pressure on a heavily burdened category over the next few years, something which might, for example, make it easier to meet the needs that exist prior to enlargement."
"That is a temporary solution."
"I really think we need a much more extensive budgetary reform."
"I also think we should address this issue in the Convention."
"The incredibly inflexible budget ceilings we live with at present should not be turned into permanent fixtures. They should definitely not be enshrined in the Treaty, and Parliament should self-evidently have the same right of co-decision in agricultural policy as we have in other areas."
"I should also like to thank the Danish Presidency for its extremely sober and constructive approach so far."
"We reached some sound agreements in July, and we had a stimulating three-way meeting yesterday about how we might solve the problem of the floods."
"I should like to round off this introduction by appealing for the same constructive approach when it comes to solving the major outstanding problems, above all in category 4, concerned with external expenditure."
"We need much more flexibility."
"Parliament will protest at the fact that, without new resources being supplied, we are constantly adding new expenditure in relation, for example, to Afghanistan and the Global AIDS and Health Fund, over and above the contributions we have already made in relation to the Balkans, Kosovo, Serbia etc."
"That, I believe, will be one of the main points in Parliament's criticism of both the Commission's and the Council's handling of the budget."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as President of the Council, I am delighted to have been given the opportunity to attend this debate, in which Commission representatives are taking part, on the European Parliament's 2003 budget."
"I am convinced that today's debate will give Parliament and the Commission the opportunity to touch upon many important subjects relating to the 2003 budget."
"I again have the pleasure today of meeting Mr Wynn and the two rapporteurs for the 2003 budget, Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck."
"I should like to begin by expressing my personal thanks for the constructive and focused dialogue on next year's budget that has been conducted by Parliament and the Council to date."
"I also wish to take the opportunity of thanking the Budget Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, and the other Commissioners for their really helpful cooperation."
"There is no doubt that the EU's 2003 budget is a major challenge."
"The EU is to take up quite a few new tasks next year."
"Allow me to mention just two. The EU institutions are to prepare themselves for enlargement, and the EU is to assume responsibility for the UN police force in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"The Council, Parliament and the Commission are agreed that what is at issue here are political priorities to be adopted by the EU."
"For that reason, the budget procedure has until now also been characterised by a desire to find practical solutions and reach compromises."
"I am convinced that this fruitful cooperation can continue in the autumn, and I shall do everything in my power to help bring this about."
"I want to conclude by wishing the Members of the European Parliament, together with the Commissioners, a constructive debate."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members, the 2003 budget is probably the last budget to apply to 15 Member States of the EU."
"We are, more or less, on the eve of enlargement."
"The budget year 2003 will, then, have further challenges in store not only for the candidate states, but also for all the European institutions that need to prepare themselves."
"These will be areas of major concern in 2003."
"But, of course, we also have other priorities in addition to these."
"I agree with all those who say that European politics must concentrate on stability and security."
"These are also reflected in the 2003 budget, in Commissioner Vitorino's budget for measures in the areas of internal affairs and justice policy or - and in many and varied ways - in the budget for foreign policy measures."
"Your House has tabled several motions relating to the security of our external representation, but of course also to all the aid given to Afghanistan."
"Aid, the increased funds for the Mediterranean, and of course pre-accession aid as well, are, in the final analysis, expenditure on Europe's enhanced political stability."
"The Commission has decided on sustainable development as the third focus of its attention."
"This, too, touches on many specific budgets and programmes - the energy programme, the research programme, Mr Nielsen's programme or, to take another example, the rural development funds and the major Structural Funds for which my fellow Commissioners Mr Fischler and Mr Barnier are, respectively, responsible."
"In this debate, we will probably have much to say about the state of the accounts, and the implementation, of the Structural Funds - but not to the exclusion of other funds."
"The budget books for 2001 did indeed reveal a surplus of EUR 15 billion at year-end."
"Parliament has had the consolidated revenue and expenditure accounts since 1 May."
"That is a massive surplus, not a fictitious one as occurred in certain private firms' recent accounting scandals, but a real surplus."
"The Finance Ministers were very happy to enter this real surplus in their books, although Parliament took a rather more critical view of it."
"It is a fact that we must manage many programmes better in 2003."
"The Member States also have their part to play in this, and there is a need for good cooperation in this area."
"The Commission informs Parliament and the Council of the state of the accounts on a weekly basis."
"I might mention that this demonstrates an openness not shown by any Member State's government in its relations with Parliament."
"It goes without saying that such budget information is important in deciding on the best approach to the budget for the coming financial year."
"For it is evident that funds are short in any budget, even if it is a relatively large one."
"We have to face up to new challenges, for example when great and terrible catastrophes occur, in order to provide aid in a spirit of solidarity."
"A new instrument has now been created for this."
"I am very grateful for the speed with which agreement could be reached on the creation of such a new instrument."
"It really does give expression to the fact that Europe is a community of solidarity."
"Apart from that, though, the new programmes require us to do a lot of restructuring and free up funds elsewhere."
"This should not be forgotten in today's debate, in which, no doubt, voice will be given to new desires and new proposals."
"We should also bear in mind the subsidiarity issue, on which subject I have to say that the Commission cannot work miracles; if political objectives are to become reality, and of course if expenditure programmes are to be implemented, it needs the staff to do it."
"I hope that Parliament will give its support to finding a solution to this question of the staff expenses for 2003."
"Let me express my gratitude to Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck for what they have just said, and for the motions that have already been submitted."
"Development shows how much is expected of Europe, and how much from European politics, and we should live up to these expectations."
"I do think that today's debate will be an exciting and wholly innovative one, showing again that the European institutions are very much ready to innovate."
"My group welcomes this new procedure."
"It is rather an imaginative way of reshaping our political debate on the priorities for the budget for 2003."
"My particular role in introducing it today is to look at our strategy as a group, one which we have accumulated over the past couple of years."
"On this basis we have six particular points which we have put down as amendments which I wish to review briefly."
"The first refers to how we handle outstanding budget commitments, which now amount to something around EUR 110 billion."
"In a joint declaration which we signed with the Council on 14 December 2000 we wanted to see these commitments reduced to normal levels by, if I remember correctly, December 2003."
"Therefore, the first of our amendments aims at getting clarification from the Commission as to exactly what its intentions are in trying to fulfil this commitment, how it is going to be done and how quickly it will be achieved."
"Secondly, in terms of Commission reform, which was also included in this joint declaration back in December 2000, we wanted to have a range of knowledge about how to achieve the reform."
"Some of us are in doubt about how far this reform has gone, how the rest of it is going to be achieved and when it will be implemented."
"That is the reason we have put the five hundred posts in reserve, which we wish to see released in stages as and when we receive information about the completion and the effectiveness of the reform."
"Thirdly, in relation to this there is the specific case concerning the Chief Accountant, where we have put a small amount of Commission travel expenses in reserve."
"We want to get to the bottom of the situation."
"We are seeking information and not the resignation of the Commission as some have rumoured."
"Therefore, we want Mrs Andreasen to come and tell us exactly what her allegations are."
"We also want to know exactly what the Commission's response to those allegations is."
"Fourthly, we wish to deal with the Council in terms of foreign policy and security."
"This is because we have had amounts put in the budget for 2003, but before approving them we want to enhance the position of the other institutions - Parliament as well as the Commission - in knowing how policies will be implemented."
"We have an instinct that we do not like to see the Council spending large sums of money in managing foreign policy without proper accountability."
"Fifthly, we have consistently said as a Parliament that we do not want to see expenditure on Afghanistan made to the detriment of other spending priorities in category 4."
"We are therefore suggesting that the flexibility instrument could be used for this purpose as well as perhaps dealing with that commitment made in the 2002 budget to deal with the EUR 27 million on fleet restructuring."
"Lastly, we have taken a slight departure from the norm and are recommending that the 220 Council posts are not approved until we have received a satisfactory explanation on a number of points which are listed in our amendment."
"These include the implementation of the early retirement scheme."
"We also need explanation, more particularly, on foreign policy so that we know what the projections are and how the Council thinks expenditure might be implemented over the next five years."
"I conclude by saying that this has nothing to do with revolution or our socialist leader, who says that these are undercover censure motions."
"This is about accountability and the proper functioning of democracy, where we as a Parliament are taking our responsibility in the budgetary process, using the reserve on a judicious basis to get the information that we need to be able to carry out our job effectively."
"Mr President, Commissioners, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, let me also, on behalf of my group, in this new sort of debate - not indeed the only one, as we will be having another in October on the substantive votes - set before you our position, our approach and our concerns."
"I wish to make reference to the great challenges before us, which have just been described."
"I have great confidence in the work of our two general rapporteurs, Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck, who have previously shown their capacity for excellent work."
"In managing the workload over the coming months and weeks, it is on their shoulders that we are standing."
"The greatest challenge is enlargement, which has already been referred to many times, and which marks a fundamental change in this European Union of ours."
"The European Union will, in two years' time, have an appearance quite different from any it has had before, which will not only have an effect on financial matters, but will also bring cultural changes in its wake."
"All this will need proper preparation."
"Here in Parliament, we will, whilst taking up our respective positions, have to show openness - freedom and openness to the acceptance of others, of new ideas and new impetus."
"This must also show itself in the budget."
"Secondly, we have experienced in recent weeks, which started with a vast catastrophe striking Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, followed by other regions of the European Union, that we are inadequately prepared for the disasters that can afflict our continent."
"It is not enough to give assistance only in cases of emergency, although thank God this assistance will now be financially resourced in such a way that we are not only giving people the impression that we can help them, but are actually able to provide aid efficiently and effectively."
"No, it is not enough to help only when something has happened; we have to take preventive action."
"We have to work together on early warning systems, on research into environmental changes, in order to be able to prepare ourselves, rather than, like a rabbit fixated by a snake, waiting for the worst to happen, but getting to grips with it early on, in order to see what can be prevented right from the outset."
"Thirdly, there is the issue of work creation."
"This continent still has too many people unemployed."
"Although this is one of the richest continents in the world, people are forced to remain unemployed even though we have vast amounts of money to use to counter unemployment."
"I speak, of course, with particular reference to the Structural Funds, but I also have others in mind."
"It must be possible to guarantee greater efficiency, and the faster and more efficient distribution of resources."
"We have proposed an efficiency force to shed light on all the bureaucratic apparatus, enabling us to act quicker and get money to where it is really needed so that people gasping for breath in the tangled bureaucratic undergrowth do not sink back in despair and say they can do no more."
"We also have to ensure that this EU of ours plans for the long term, with regard to staff expenses as much as to anything else."
"Thank God our staff are relatively young, but we have to finance all their pensions out of the budget."
"If we want to plan for the long term here, we have to make an early start on ensuring that funds are put by for this purpose so that we can give help in this area, or else we will run into major problems, at any rate further down the road."
"There are initiatives that have been in place since 1996, but which have not to date been implemented."
"That is something we have to get to grips with."
"We must help small and medium-sized enterprises in the European Union to have their share of economic development."
"Success in this European Union of ours must not be the preserve of the big firms that can afford their own legal departments and tax departments; it must be put within the reach of small enterprises and micro-businesses."
"We have submitted amendments on that subject."
"In these discussions, you will find us to be willing to work constructively with you."
"Other amendments have been tabled, but I wanted to set out the focal points of our approach."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, firstly I wish to thank the budget rapporteurs, Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck, who have done some excellent work and aided the Committee on Budgets in its task."
"European Union budgetary policy is overshadowed by the unsatisfactory way in which the budget itself has been implemented."
"As Mr Elles stated in his speech just now, a good EUR 15 billion in budget commitments remained unspent last year, which is an inconceivably huge amount of money."
"The Commission has suggested the blame lies with the Member States."
"We must ask what the Commission intends to do in the area of legislation to eliminate this defect in the system."
"I would similarly like to ask the Council what it intends to do to simplify the implementation of the Structural Funds, pre-accession aid and other long-term programmes, in order to avoid the build-up of such enormous outstanding sums in the future, and, indeed, reduce them."
"The payment appropriations in next year's budget stand at just 1.01% of GNP, which is to say EUR 5.9 billion below the financial perspectives."
"Such meagre sums will not help to reduce the arrears: they will, instead, pile up when the eastward enlargement of the EU has taken place and a lot of other problems lie ahead."
"Our group supports preparations for enlargement to the east."
"Next year is the last in which they can be carried out properly."
"For this reason, the administrative process must be reformed and made more flexible, so that human resources may be deployed more swiftly and appropriately than is the case at present."
"We support the reform of the Commission, but at the same time we insist on greater clarification in the areas of personal accountability and job descriptions."
"Moreover, we believe it is important that administrative accountability is also reflected in greater efficiency in such areas as making payments."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the biggest problem with the budget is the outstanding RAL appropriations."
"The problem is so huge that it cannot be seen."
"It is good that an attempt is being made to reduce the scale of the RAL problem."
"As a 'sunset clause' is being introduced to achieve this the Commission's inefficiency might fade from view as a result."
"Today, however, that inefficiency is visible in the growth of RALs, as certain other groups have remarked here."
"Our group agrees that enlargement should become the budget's main area of focus."
"In that connection we must ensure that the European Union is able to function in all its official languages right from the outset."
"We call on the Commission to reject any proposals that state that some languages should be accorded a position that is inferior to others with regard to interpreting."
"If an interpreting facility cannot exist for all languages, let us draw lots to see which ones are not to enjoy that facility."
"In July's conciliation process the Council promised to produce a legal basis for the early retirement of twenty or thirty officials on temporary contracts employed by Parliament's political groups. In exchange it obtained provisional budgetary unity."
"It got a very good deal."
"The spirit of budgetary unity allows certain Member States to obtain financial aid from the EU in exchange for scrapping their fishing fleets."
"This has been agreed and we do not oppose it."
"However, losses cannot be overcompensated for, and, for that reason, many members of our group feel it is important that the new fisheries programme proposed by the Commission be approved."
"Nevertheless, there are forces at work to block it, in the same way as it is being reduced to what is just a new agricultural programme under the direction of a certain large Member State."
"Some of our group wish the Commission every success in its reform of the fisheries and agricultural programmes, and some do not."
"Opinions differ in our group on the question of whether it is necessary to support European-wide political parties out of the EU budget."
"As there is no legal basis for supporting Europarties this way, we are proposing, as a technicality in the budget, that we should make a p.m. entry under the corresponding budget heading."
"It should not be proposed that money be given away when it is not legal to do so."
"I would like to say this to the President-in-Office of the Council: do please correct the regulations pertaining to the Members of the European Parliament so that a legal basis is achieved in respect of this issue too."
"We are pleased, in the main, that the Commission has proposed reducing the amount spent on propaganda in the wake of the Prince programme."
"The Commission's actions are evidently worse for the EU with propaganda than without it in terms of legitimacy."
"We on the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy were disappointed with the course of action the Council took when it made its funding decisions in respect of the Sixth Framework Programme for science and research."
"The programme was agreed upon without any formal settlement."
"We hope that the traditionally excellent spirit of cooperation that exists between Parliament and the Council can continue with regard to this issue also and that the Council will restore matters to what was originally agreed."
"Mr President, the Commission formulated three priorities in its Annual Policy Strategy: enlargement, security and sustainable development."
"The Commission has now requested 500 additional positions to guarantee the smooth running of the enlargement."
"In principle, I can understand this, for if 10 new countries join, this will result in more work."
"However, I do have a few questions in this respect."
"Is it correct that you are now requesting staff for the priority of enlargement, while the priority of sustainable development is systematically being managed with too few officials?"
"If I understand the Commission 'Better Regulations' proposals correctly, the Commission even suggests passing the responsibility for notification mainly to the Member States from now on."
"Is this because you really believe that Member States are better placed to comply with environmental legislation and to monitor it, or are there simply budgetary reasons for this, namely that you do not have enough officials to check whether the Member States indeed comply with this legislation?"
"If this is a budgetary issue, I do fear for the priority of sustainable development."
"Another question concerns the 700 positions which we rubberstamped in previous years."
"Am I right in thinking that these have been distributed reasonably evenly across the entire Commission and have not really been clustered according to certain priorities?"
"It would be regrettable if this were the case."
"I should now like to turn to the enlargement and the EU budget."
"If I understand it correctly, six candidate countries risk receiving less funding from Brussels in 2004 than they did in 2003, and four countries are even at risk of becoming net contributors."
"It is fortunate that you are prepared to compensate for this, and it is, indeed, excellent, but the bill could still be higher than estimated in these candidate countries if their implementation of the Structural Funds is not as successful as you estimated."
"Is it therefore possible - and this is a proposal on our part and I would appreciate a response - to see if these candidate countries could take their projects through the entire procedure as early as 2003?"
"In other words, if they could complete all the administrative formalities, so that they can start immediately with the real construction work on 1 January 2004?"
"Allow me to make one final point."
"If this is also a debate on what Mr James Elles said in response to Mrs Andreasen, my group is also of the opinion that any problems in the accounting system must be closely examined after the Commission's and the Court of Auditors' hearing."
"We would possibly need to invite Mrs Andreassen at that point."
"It is up to us MEPs, though, to examine this."
"As for the link with the Commissioners' wages, it is really beyond me how the PPE has worked this out."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"I have been a Member of the European Parliament for 23 years - the first 10 in the Committee on Budgets - and I am from time to time a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I was involved in putting Parliament's house in order following its scandalous dealings with taxpayers' money which have left us with the still unfinished business surrounding the issue of reimbursed travel expenses."
"I have read the annual reports by the Court of Auditors. I was involved in dismissing the last Commission, and I have always been very critical of the lack of transparency in the Commission."
"Not by any stretch of the imagination did I, however, at any time think that the Commission did its accounts on an Excel spreadsheet so that the figures could be adjusted without anyone's knowing."
"If the owner of an ice-cream stall or hardware shop were to do his accounts in the same way, it would be unlawful and lead to legal action by the tax office."
"In this case, we are talking about the Commission, but the legal action is being taken against the person who revealed the accounts scandal."
"There is a desire to shoot the messenger for bringing bad news."
"The Spanish Chief Accountant, Mrs Andreasen, deserves a lot of praise for having given Parliament the information we should have received from the Commission."
"Mrs Andreasen initially went through the internal channels and passed her observations up the line to Mr Prodi, but to no avail so far as I understand."
"The Commission wanted her to sign off an account that half the Directors-General had signed only with reservations."
"Since 1994, the Court of Auditors has refused to vouch for the correctness of the underlying transactions."
"For eight years, therefore, my web site, bonde.com, has contained a letter from an office in the Court of Auditors to the Commission, and it is the most alarming letter I have read in my 30 years in the EU."
"The Commission's current practice of accounting on spreadsheets lends itself to poor administration and fraud."
"Against that unfortunate background, SOS Democracy wishes to invite all adherents of ordinary accounting to meet Mrs Andreasen on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in conference room R3.1."
"We should together discuss how we can deal with what, to me, looks like the worst scandal in the EU's history."
"Now, we know a little about how matters stand."
"From now on, we all share the responsibility."
"Thank you, Mr President and Mr Pedersen."
"Mr President, previous speakers have already addressed many important items in the 2003 budget, but we have to take care not to focus on too few of its specific areas and end up trying to give everyone a slice of the cake."
"Those who suffered flood damage must now get aid very quickly and without red tape, and it goes without saying that provision must now also be made for the future."
"We must, though, take steps to deal with the constant increase in unemployment."
"SMEs continue to gasp under the excessive burden of taxes and levies placed upon them, whilst, at the same time, investment activity in Europe is declining, and the unemployment rate is, as already mentioned, constantly rising."
"The excessively high rate of unemployment among young people is a particular problem, and there is urgent need for special programmes to reduce it."
"I hope that Members of this House will support the motions we have tabled on this subject, which seek to promote apprenticeships in SMEs."
"Such action would strengthen SMEs and help those young people who, in Europe, have little or no chance of vocational training."
"Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner Barnier."
"On behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I must express our concerns regarding the implementation of the budget for the European Social Fund."
"The Social Fund plays an important role, of course, in the development of poor regions and of the European Employment Strategy, and it will indeed also be very important in connection with the forthcoming enlargement."
"In this area too, moreover, we see the build-up of outstanding commitments, something which we regard as a problem."
"Now, Commissioner Barnier has just presented a communication on developments concerning the implementation of the Structural Funds, providing us with a number of explanations as to why larger outstanding commitments than expected are accumulating, and that is something for which we should thank the Commissioner."
"There are of course new rules and procedures for the 2000-2006 programming which are to be incorporated, and the Member States have apparently overestimated the ability to implement the projects in the first few years."
"What basis have we, however, for believing that things will be much better over the next few years, apart from the incentives contained in the 'N+2' rule (otherwise known as the 'sunset clause') according to which the money is lost if too long a period elapses before the payments are utilised?"
"As MEPs, we constantly hear complaints that this is an unwieldy system."
"A good overdraft facility at the bank is needed if money from the Social Fund is to be received."
"It is the long time it takes to make the payments that is a problem, and one that the Commission must do something about."
"We are also told that the rules and procedures are too complicated, and it was agreed in July that Parliament and the Council should simplify matters in order to encourage utilisation of the funds."
"You too, Mr Barnier, have put simplification on the agenda."
"How quickly will it be possible, however, for the work on simplification to take effect?"
"Will it have done so by 2003?"
"What are the deadlines for this work?"
"Thank you, Mr President."
"Mr President, for us the problem of implementation should be a shared problem, and I personally cannot accept what Commissioner Barnier has said, when he simply washes his hands of the problems of four or five Member States."
"The problem is a shared one, the solution is a shared one."
"The fact that we have EUR 100 billion of outstanding commitments should be a problem for all the Community's institutions."
"We cannot accept the premise that it is the sole responsibility of those Member States."
"We certainly want to see action by all the institutions, including the Commission, and this Parliament in particular, as a matter of urgency."
"Turning to transport, we want to see action quickly here too."
"In particular, we want to see a reinstatement of the cuts of EUR 1 million proposed by the Commission in overland transport safety."
"It is absurd to propose to cut accidents on the roads by 50% in 8 years and yet cut the budget in that key area."
"Thirdly, we want to see a reinstatement of the 20% reduction proposed by the Commission in sustainable mobility."
"Again we talk a lot about the environment, but the very programmes that will help protect and preserve it will be cut if the Commissioner has his way."
"Fourth and finally, I agree with the Commission on the need for more transparency."
"At the moment my committee, which takes its job seriously in trying to scrutinise the budget, simply does not have the facts at its disposal to make a proper quantitative, as well as qualitative assessment, of what is happening to the budgets for transport and the Structural Funds."
"I hope that after this debate we can work harder to make sure that we can demonstrate to the European taxpayer that value for money is being given."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as many speakers have stated here already, the latest budget monitoring figures also show that the implementation of the Structural Fund programmes and payments made with regard to the programmes have progressed far too slowly."
"On the other hand, regional differences have also grown."
"It is therefore very clear that regional aid will be needed in the future too, as Mr Puerta suggested."
"Delays in structural policy were largely due in the early stages to the slow preparatory work undertaken by the Commission and the Member States."
"Now it is burdensome administration and complicated, rigid procedures that are causing the delays."
"These are also causing problems in countries that have kept to the timetable."
"The implementation thus far of both last year's and this year's budgets have led to a considerable increase in unpaid amounts of money."
"Our group is very worried about the possible negative impact that will have on next year's budget and the Union's structural policy both later on and in general."
"There should be compliance, however, with the N+2 rule, as it will help shore up implementation of the Structural Funds."
"Now we are compelled to ask, despite this communication and Mr Barnier's fine words, what the Commission intends to do before this parliamentary term ends."
"What concrete measures are there, whereby practices associated with the Structural Funds can be clarified, simplified, and speeded up?"
"This is a very tough question too because enlargement is just around the corner and we need to find remedies for these problems, with more in the way of results and less bureaucracy."
"Mr President, whilst the Budget Memorandum for 2003 still leaves many questions open, the economic situation in 2002 is becoming clearer and it is easier to get an overall view of it."
"I believe that it is not only in Germany that the goal of stabilising euroland by not exceeding a public debt of 3% of gross domestic product is in danger of being missed."
"The absence of 2%-3% annual economic growth means that grossly excessive unemployment figures can no longer be artificially covered up."
"This makes it all the more understandable that the backlog of Structural Funds is being treated as if the funds were not there."
"The prospect of actually successfully solving the problem of mass unemployment in the coming fourth quarter is made fainter by mounting indirect labour costs and the failure of the European Union, among others, to solve the problems caused by distortions of competition."
"I also believe that the days of public jubilation at the freedom apparently won through globalisation are over."
"The 2003 budget will instead be measured against the yardstick of seriousness, transparency and honesty."
"I can recall that Parliament was always more than merely critical of the annual accumulation of financial resources from the Structural Funds."
"What is decisive for the public's sense of belonging is what goes down well with them."
"The Commission's non-existent policy on non-existent Structural Funds does little to promote a feeling of belonging on the part of the European Union's citizens."
"The winter months are going to be the most difficult in economic terms for a long time."
"The many pledges made in the wake of the flood disaster must at last be worked off at a more rapid pace."
"If they are not, there is a growing danger of those aspects of land use for which we have already accorded financial assistance from the sources available triggering substantial conflicts between business, transport, housing, leisure and tourism at the various structural levels."
"The situation is grave, and I assume that it is known that the public are seeing the gap between income and expenditure narrowing still further."
"They need the money that is kept in Brussels."
"Mr President, Commissioners, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I welcome Mrs Schreyer's statement to the effect that sustainable development is a focus of attention, and hope that it really will be possible to promote it even with these deficits, by which I mean the unused appropriations, which will, next year, be subject to the N+2 rule."
"We know that the deficits are primarily the result of long drawn-out problems with approval, but also of the Member States' inability to really create proper programmes out of the reform measures contained in the last reform of the Structural Funds; this obliged the Commission to follow matters up any number of times."
"Both, then, are to blame."
"There is now the danger of big projects being supported because there is suddenly more money, and for that reason I warn the Commission against allowing that."
"There are indications that projects will again be supported without their being either efficient or sustainable, and I would ask the Commission to exercise its monitoring functions and ensure that sustainable development becomes a reality in the budget."
"Mr President, I do indeed believe that this debate is extremely useful inasmuch as it allows us to discuss a number of difficult issues, including funds, in a general context."
"What some people seem to be suggesting is completely unfair, namely that fraud would be involved in funding that goes unspent, for that is the problem with commitments outstanding."
"The problem lies in the very fact that it goes unspent, which is an entirely different issue."
"I also think that too much blame is being apportioned to the Commission and not enough to the Member States."
"I myself come from a Member State which is very much to blame for not spending the necessary resources properly and promptly, and I hope that this situation will improve in future."
"This is a good example, though."
"In my view, the system is flawed on two counts."
"Firstly, we have a new fund each time, which means that each time, we lose a year."
"This is exactly what happened now and seems to be inevitable."
"I would ask the Commission to examine whether this can really be done in this way, for this is an inherent problem."
"Secondly, I wonder whether we will ever be free of these commitments outstanding."
"Is it not possible, or conceivable, instead of simply leaving these, to conclude an agreement at a given point with a Member State that fails to manage to spend that money?"
"We could, for example, say that we will channel this money back to the general resources, and this Member State will receive a reduction on their contribution, which has to be paid anyway."
"I think that this Member State could be very happy with this proposal, and indeed that everyone could be, as it allows money to become available for those who need it."
"Needless to say, this should be done on a voluntary basis; if not, the system would never work and Member States would never agree to it."
"Maybe, though, it is possible to solve this issue relatively quickly and pragmatically."
"I fear that it might be too pragmatic, for everyone likes to claim that funds should be spent, only to place many obstacles along the way should this then appear necessary."
"Mr President, I would like to draw attention to a number of budget lines that are dealt with in the Committee on Employment."
"First of all the three lines dealing with social dialogue - B3-4002, B3-4003 and B3-4310."
"The last one deals with the Trade Union Technical Bureau for Health and Safety."
"We are looking to increase the amounts on each of these lines, largely because of enlargement."
"It is very important that we get the basic building blocks of social dialogue in place in the applicant countries and we need to begin to channel resources in that direction."
"Secondly, I should like to mention B3-4314. This concerns health and safety improvements in small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"We are looking to renew this line once again."
"I very much hope that following the work we have done on the new European Health and Safety strategy here in Parliament - a report will shortly be appearing in my own name - on a proposal from the Commission for a multi-annual programme for high levels of health and safety in SMEs."
"I hope that will come forward in the coming year and give us a permanent legal base."
"My final point concerns B3-4106. This is a proposal for a new budget line in the names of Mr Howitt and Mr Andersson, although it was endorsed by the Committee on Employment as well."
"It seeks to give a solid base for support to social NGOs. It is very important that we do this to underpin civil dialogue."
"Mr President, we have already talked about the under-implementation of the Structural Funds, and the menacing shadow of the guillotine has already been invoked."
"I would now like to add that it is no coincidence that many are in danger of losing part of their entitlement too."
"In other words, we risk suffering the blows of the stick without even tasting the carrot."
"We must take action but, Mr Bonde, we must make sure we do not set our sights on the wrong target."
"The European Commission is not the only one with responsibility in this area: a great deal of responsibility lies with the Member States too."
"We must make sure that we do not prescribe ourselves the wrong medicine."
"Personally, I am allergic to the reserves pill, which often does more harm than the original problem, and the idea that some political groups have of putting some of the Commissioners' expenditure in reserve is downright ridiculous."
"The direction we must take is that of increasing payments and simplifying procedures."
"Commissioner Barnier has already told us what he intends to do and we are waiting for further clarification."
"Nevertheless, I would also like to hear what the Council has to say, if possible, and I call for greater attention to be paid to some of the Member States, who are sleeping the sleep of the unrighteous where this whole issue is concerned."
"Mr President, I would like to take a few moments to confirm what I said earlier and provide some more detailed answers."
"I would also like to thank the speakers who have clearly understood what I meant earlier, particularly Mr Pittella who pointed out just now that the Member States have some responsibilities."
"But, to be very honest, Mr Watts must have misunderstood: the Commission is not shirking its responsibilities."
"I myself am greatly concerned, Mr Watts, by the underspending."
"I must simply reiterate that my work is based on estimates which are compiled by the Member States."
"There are some details that I must give to you, or confirm for you, which have been in evidence for three years, in other words, since I took up this position."
"For example, the Member States gave priority, at the beginning of this programming period, not to new programmes and to new projects, but to old programmes and to old projects which should have been completed."
"They therefore concentrated their efforts on winding up old programmes and they took longer to prepare the new programmes."
"This is one reason."
"A new method of certification was also introduced, which caused some problems."
"We should also mention the new payment system."
"All sorts of rules were adopted in Berlin or after Berlin, which I am obliged to introduce."
"I would also add that many Member States - and Mrs Fiebiger mentioned the crisis and the lack of growth earlier - must cope with relative budgetary difficulties."
"I would point out that we are not funding the programmes 100%."
"There is an additionality rule whereby the Member States must provide part of the funding and some of them probably found it necessary to stretch their budgetary expenditure further."
"These are some of the details that you will find in the report and the communication that Mrs Schreyer and myself have given you."
"With regard to the RALs, once again, I think that it is usual to have approximately two years of programming since this is in line with the N+2 rule - so that makes about seven years of programming and two additional years in total."
"What would be unusual is for us to continue to support, through the RALs, very old programmes."
"That is why my work seeks, as a matter of priority, as I said to you at the beginning, to withdraw the RALs from the old programmes, which has almost been achieved."
"I would also warn you against drawing an assessment of the situation from one moment to the next."
"When you look at the RALs, at the beginning of the year for example, you do not gain an accurate picture because, although almost 99% of expenditure was committed in April, the payments can be made up to the end of the year."
"Therefore, at the beginning of the year, it looks as if the RALs are substantial."
"That is how the figure of 100 billion may have been arrived at."
"As I am speaking to you today, namely 24 September, the RALs for the old and new programmes amount to approximately 50 billion, which is an accurate reflection of these two years of programming."
"Mrs Schroedter, whom I would like to thank, moreover, for the work that she has done - and I am thinking, in particular, of her excellent report on the second progress report on cohesion - emphasised the issue of sustainable development."
"Mrs Schroedter, rest assured that I am keeping a very close eye on ensuring that the Structural Funds are implemented as per the regulation and in accordance with European directives on the environment."
"For all sorts of political and personal reasons, I am working to ensure that the Member States, both present and future, use the Structural Funds in the appropriate manner, with respect for sustainable development."
"That is why for example, Mrs Schroedter, I decided to propose, with regard to the consequences of the floods, that, in the future regional policy that I shall submit to you at the end of 2003, whilst consolidating what we have already done under these programmes, the prevention of natural risks is virtually a compulsory priority in all the regional programmes."
"The N+2 rule is strict, but it is useful."
"Once again, as for natural disasters, I have placed the emphasis on prevention."
"Last November, I wrote to all the Prime Ministers, as did Mrs Schreyer."
"Since prevention still costs less than restoration, we hope that this will enable us to reduce the risk, Mr Pittella, of appropriations being wasted."
"At the end of the year, since it is the first meeting, the risks of wasting money under the N+2 rule will be very low."
"The risks will probably be higher next year, because, since the programmes were signed in 2001, the effects will be felt in 2003 under the N+2 rule."
"As far as the floods are concerned, Mrs Fiebeger, you urged us to act quickly."
"To be very honest - and many German and Austrian leaders pointed this out to us - rarely has the Commission reacted quite so quickly to current events."
"It took us less than four weeks to propose a flexible budgetary instrument, with Mrs Schreyer's leadership."
"A few days later, I proposed the rules and arrangements for this fund to the Commission."
"The ball is in the European Parliament's court."
"Last night, the Council held a trialogue meeting."
"I hope that we will be in a position, before the end of the year, before winter, in other words to grant the appropriations which are expected so that restoration, repair and even prevention work can begin."
"Regarding the social dialogue, I listened carefully to the questions which have been put to us."
"They concern, in the main, Heading 3, and Mrs Schreyer or Mrs Diamantopolou will answer them later."
"Lastly, I would like to point out that, with regard to all these problems, and I am coming to my conclusion, Mr President, the Commission is not shirking its responsibilities."
"I am trying to favour transparency, to explain the truth and to be proactive in terms of transparency, as I have just said, as well as in terms of simplification, as this is the purpose of the meeting on 5 October with the ministers."
"I would also like to emphasise how the useful role played by the Structural Funds in improving governance on the ground, in the regions and in each country which is in need of them, including the oldest countries of the Union."
"In the area of partnerships, assessments, discipline and planning, the role they fulfil is that of a lever. I would like to convince you of their importance."
"The Structural Funds do not just represent money, they also represent real progress in terms of public administration, governance and, ultimately, democracy."
"Thank you, Commissioner Barnier."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, my Committee has very carefully considered its amendments, and its vote to introduce them was unanimous."
"As already set out in the guidelines, we put the emphasis on such things as the management of borders, an area in which the ARGO programme is of fundamental importance, contributing as much to the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice as it does to preparations for enlargement."
"Enlargement makes the topics of external border control, visas, asylum and immigration even more urgent."
"Efficient cooperation by the Member States and the candidate countries in these areas, and especially in combating illegal immigration, is indispensable, and requires that the necessary resources be made available for it."
"My Committee also supports efforts to integrate third-country nationals who are long-term residents here by establishing a pilot project."
"This would serve to transmit the values underpinning our coexistence in Europe."
"I am very glad that the Commission accepts this."
"Security, freedom and justice are not, of course, to be had for free, but my Committee's present proposals do not represent any increase in the financial framework over against last year's budget."
"What we are asking for is only 99.4% of last year's figures."
"This is something I particularly want to underline, as we have greater responsibilities towards the EU's citizens in view of 11 September."
"I would like to conclude by reminding you of the 21 September 2001 action plan to combat terrorism, which envisages joint action by all specialist units to prevent and combat terrorism, and requires that Europol and Eurojust be equipped for this purpose with special resources."
"It is with this in mind that I hope that my Committee will be backed up by Parliament's, the Commission's and the Council's own proposals."
"Mr President, the culture, education and information element of the budget accounts for barely half of 1% of the EU budget, compared with 50% of the budget that goes on agriculture."
"So I will remind Parliament and the Commissioners, as culture spokesmen do every year, that perhaps we have not got our priorities quite right."
"To turn to the issue of information: this should be a shared responsibility between the institutions and the Member States."
"We wonder whether the Member States have got their responsibilities quite right in this respect."
"Earlier this year the Culture Committee visited Copenhagen, and we would like to pay particular tribute to the Danish Government and Danish Parliament for the information they give to their citizens about the working of the European Union."
"The EU has a responsibility to see that its citizens are well informed."
"Certain members of staff make great efforts in this respect, and we would also pay tribute to Commissioner Vitorino for the work and the vision that he is putting into this."
"However, we are not succeeding."
"The citizens of the European Union do not have enough information."
"We do not live in a neutral situation, we live in a situation where there is a great deal of disinformation and it is the responsibility of all concerned to see that is answered."
"I therefore make no apology when I point out that the proposed budget for information policy on the various B3 lines is less than EUR 100 milion or less than 37 cents per citizen per annum."
"That is a very small sum indeed."
"As I speak, I know that Euronews - the television channel that seeks to give objective information about all European issues - is itself suffering very serious financial difficulties."
"I hope the Commission and the budget rapporteur will look very closely at their pleas and make sure that Euronews is a success."
"I will remind the House that the successful slogan for the Irish 'No' campagin was 'If you don't know, vote no.'"
"We must see that the European citizens do not vote no, because they understand what the European Union is about."
"Mr President, first of all I wish to thank the Parliament for its invitation to this debate today."
"I tend to interpret your invitation as the recognition of the political importance of the areas of Justice and Home Affairs and Information Policy, and definitely not of its budgetary importance, because comparing my budget with those of my colleagues, I feel like a beggar who is invited to a Christmas party in Wall Street."
"As far as budgetary issues are concerned, in order of presentation, I wish to thank the LIBE committee, Mr Ceyhun in particular, for the non-stop support this Commission has been given in establishing the area of freedom, security and justice."
"Once again, the LIBE Committee proposes the increase of the budget lines thought to be politically more important."
"The PDB was prepared by the Commission based not only on political considerations, but also on the financial framework approved for each of the programmes, or on past experience in the running of the preparatory actions or pilot projects."
"Moreover, it presents a difficult balance between the human resources needed to ensure the correct management of the credits and those needed to ensure the creation of this area from a legal point of view."
"For these reasons, the proposed amounts represent a certain stability concerning the total amount, but with a re-centring of activities, a recast of the cooperation programmes, and an intensification of the actions in the area of asylum and immigration, including the external border control and the establishment of Eurojust."
"The Commission welcomes the very constructive opinion of the LIBE Committee, which brings into the PDB the major political developments which have occurred since its presentation - such as the conclusions of the European Council of Seville - which obviously could not have been considered at the time our PDB was presented."
"Nevertheless, I will make a plea for careful examination, bearing in mind such difficulties as human resources."
"I now turn to the Cultural Committee, Mr Perry in particular, and also to the Economic and Financial Affairs Committee, particularly Mr Bergman."
"In terms of information and communication to the public in general, over the last few years we have seen great progress in cooperation between our institutions, in the provision of information to citizens, at political level between our relevant services and most importantly, on the ground, in the Member States."
"Recognising that the challenge of communication with 370 million citizens is immense, and the means available are definitely limited, we are now working increasingly with the Member States so that they share the responsibility for informing their citizens, engaging them in a dialogue that is a prerequisite for good governance and increased public support."
"The adoption by the Commission, in July, of the communication on an information and communication strategy for the European Union, and the warm welcome it received, both by the Culture Committee and the Interinstitutional Group on Information, provide tangible evidence of our shared political will to be proactive in generating awareness, combating ignorance and apathy and improving perceptions about the Union."
"Returning to budgetary aspects, I must underline that, as in all other aspects of the budget, the Commission took a very realistic position in relation to information and communication."
"We recognised that, whilst informing and communicating with citizens must be a priority, we have to ensure that we have the capacity, especially in terms of human resources, to manage the expenditure of the funds."
"The PDB is therefore the firm basis for our consideration of amendments, with one exception that relates to the new priority topic proposed in the July communication mentioned above."
"I am referring to the role of Europe in the world."
"If the Interinstitutional Group on Information confirms this proposal at its meeting later today, we will suggest that an additional EUR 1.5 million should be committed for the PRINCE programme."
"This will be for a campaign which specifically relates to the role of Europe in the world and our actions to regulate globalisation so that it can bring benefits to our citizens and the wider world."
"The Commission welcomes the constructive opinions of the Culture Committee as well as the Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Constitutional Affairs Committee."
"At the meeting of the Interinstitutional Group on Information later today, we must reflect on the amounts proposed in the amendments and the practical implications."
"I will of course emphasise the need to ensure that we have the necessary human resources available to spend those amounts in an appropriate and proper way."
"On the subject of expert assistance and the priority campaigns, we particularly welcome the specific proposal that the budget line for financing of PRINCE correspondents should also be increased."
"Without such an increase, we will not be able to engage Member States in developing the priority PRINCE campaigns."
"We also strongly support the amendment to restore a cut of EUR 500 000 made by the Council, in the line that provides for the use of information correspondents to work with the media in the Member States and for the use of Eurojust experts to answer citizens' questions relating to European law."
"On the euro campaign, I must re-state what the Commission has already said in the past."
"The information to the candidate countries on the euro is included in the enlargement campaign, and the Commission believes that, in the case of the countries which are not yet part of the euro, the necessary funds will be proposed the day that each of these countries decides to join the euro."
"Finally, in the new basis of cooperation between the Parliament and the Commission and engaging the Member States, we will be able to improve our information and communication policy and therefore make better use of taxpayers' money."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a PPE member of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, I would first of all like to express my regret, as has Mr Ceyhun, that the budget does not truly reflect the priority that the Commission and the Council claim to give to the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice."
"It is all well and good to affirm a priority, but this priority must also be followed up by concrete action."
"Yet, the appropriations for the area of freedom, security and justice are increased by less than the average level of increase for internal policies."
"Why is this, Commissioner?"
"I would like to say that the PPE Group supports the amendments by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms proposed by the rapporteur in the crucial area of immigration and asylum policy."
"I would like to know if the Commission and the Council are prepared to support us in this direction."
"It is the first time that all the instruments of an active and balanced policy for managing migratory flows have been identified and strengthened by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms."
"We want to improve the ways of predicting migratory flows more accurately by providing increased subsidies for the European Migration Observatory."
"We want to improve control at external borders."
"We support the increase in resources for cooperation with third countries."
"We support the increase in appropriations designed to support integration efforts for immigrants who have settled legally in Europe and we also support the increase in resources set aside for the European Refugee Fund, although we regret that, in the draft budget and preliminary draft budget, these resources have been reduced in comparison to last year."
"I would like to know if the Commission and the Council are prepared, in these matters that are strategic not only from a point of view of the development of the European Union, but also from the point of view of the way in which our fellow citizens perceive them, to increase the resources set aside in these different areas."
"I have one last question to put to the Commissioners and the Council."
"Last year, the European Parliament put aside EUR 5 million in the budget for use by Europol in combating terrorism."
"Why has the Commission waited nine months before proposing a legal basis?"
"Is the Council prepared - yes or no - to accept this legal basis and to ensure that these appropriations can be used effectively?"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, the European Union's information service has all too often seemed like propaganda passed down to the masses from above."
"The language of communication is also often cumbersome and not enough attention is paid to cultural differences."
"However, now it would appear that there is hope for better things to come."
"In the plans drafted under the guidance of Commissioner Vitorino we can read of the aim to base communications on the public's need for information."
"That is how it should be too."
"The Commission's four priorities concerning information - enlargement, the future of the Union, establishing the area of freedom, security and justice, and the EU's role in the world, are absolutely crucial."
"That is why it is unthinkable that the Council should make cuts in its own draft budget in the area of appropriations for the information service."
"The Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which supports Commissioner Vitorino's information policy, has unanimously proposed there should be additional resources for the budget headings concerned with information."
"The social democrats in the Committee on Budgets adhere to the same policy."
"We cannot ask the people to become interested in our work if they do not know what is going on here."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we too would like to express some concerns regarding the preliminary draft budget, some of which relate to issues which have already been raised during this debate."
"I would like to focus, in particular, on two issues."
"Firstly, security and enlargement."
"It has already been stated that we need to be more aggressive with these active policies, but clearly, considering that we have not increased appropriations despite the fact that the concerns linked to terrorism and enlargement - including the extension of our borders with all the problems that will bring - are known to and in the minds of all, greater awareness and greater political aggressiveness should have been demonstrated with regard to these issues and a commitment should have been made to increase the budget."
"Secondly, as regards information policy, I agree with Mr Perry, who pointed out that 30 cents per citizen is an absolutely ridiculous proposal if we are to achieve an effective European policy in this field."
"Mr President, the debate on the flood disasters has shown Europe to the public in a new light - as a community of solidarity."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is a bonus that we should not carelessly fritter away."
"Great changes and challenges are ahead of us."
"The crucial issues are evident - to us, but not to the European public."
"The man in the street in Vienna would say that there is something missing from our information policy."
"It is precisely on this area that a large number of amendments have been submitted."
"The pressure to inform is huge, and that information must be one-sided - glossy brochures, ivory-tower conferences and websites - no matter how inventive, brilliantly conceived and really informative."
"It reminds me of something I frequently experienced in my professional life."
"If the public don't come to the theatre, the theatre must go to the public."
"We have to go out to people, to universities, into schools, and the Member States cannot be discharged from their obligations in this respect."
"We are all open to that criticism."
"We should inform each other better, as the lack of information gives rise to misunderstandings, and it is precisely those that we have least need of."
"That brings me back to cultural policy."
"You always hear it said, in a cynical tone, that in Brussels there is money lying all over the streets, and you just have to pick some up."
"Well, when it comes to culture, you can't talk in terms of collecting money and certainly not of just picking it up - counting the pennies is more like it."
"Bureaucracy in this area is simply unmanageable."
"Although we have only limited competence in it, I wonder what became of the three institutions' will to do something about cultural policy."
"It is far too weak."
"Rather than promote European content in this globalised age in which we live, we are supporting the big boys - big countries, big co-productions."
"That way, the little guys, the smaller countries, and the lesser-used languages lose out."
"What I want to ask the Commission is this: a legal basis for the financing of the A-30 lines is being planned, but what conception does the Commission have of it?"
"Is there to be a multi-annual plan?"
"Is there to be an interinstitutional working party, in order that the criteria in the individual areas can be defined jointly and more exactly?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises - SMEs for short - has hitherto always been one of the European Union's major concerns."
"I am, then, all the more astonished to note that, in the preliminary draft budget, the Commission is reducing the amounts for this over against last year and the years preceding it."
"What it boils down to is that this programme has an implementation rate of between 97% and 100%."
"The development of small and medium-sized enterprises is the cornerstone of the internal market, it being beyond dispute that this area accounts for over 90% of the workforce."
"It is an area that we must promote and develop, especially as regards new technologies."
"I would like to ask the Commission to support our motion that these amounts be augmented."
"I would like to use my remaining speaking time to call on the Council to at last come up with a ruling on the seats of the new agencies, so that this House does not end up getting through the legislative procedures in no time, with the Council then needing years to come to any decision on the seat issue."
"Mr President, having listened to Commissioner Vitorino and several of my fellow Members, I can see that we share a concern to provide information to our citizens, and I listened with great interest to the Commissioner asking us for more resources than those which were set aside in the preliminary draft budget and the budget."
"We were, in fact, extremely surprised to see the reductions which had been made to these lines, at a time when so many doubts are being harboured by European citizens who still do not seem to be receiving the right information."
"Commissioner, I would like to emphasise the fact that we tabled many amendments in order to give the Commission another chance to complete this essential task, namely the communication on the work of the European Union institutions."
"But I would also like to stress the fact that this communication must be, as Mrs Iivari said, targeted towards the ordinary citizen, the average citizen, who, when working or going to the market, does not understand what the European Union is doing for the future."
"We must undertake a thorough review of the strategy used by our institutions to communicate with the public."
"Let us go to meet the inhabitants of our fifteen countries and try to understand them."
"I believe that, as we did for economic measures, we must move from macrointervention towards closer intervention."
"As we do for SMEs, let us go and look for the citizens one by one!"
"Mr President, I shall begin by responding to Mr Deprez, who is an expert in budgetary matters, justice and home affairs."
"As far as Europol is concerned, Parliament did indeed set aside 5 million in the 2002 budget."
"Yet, we came up against an issue that you are very familiar with, that of the legal basis, since Europol was set up by an intergovernmental convention, and the only funding available under this intergovernmental convention is that derived from Member States' contributions."
"We began by asking Europol what it would do with this 5 million and, after some time, we finally received a response whereby Europol, realistically and pragmatically, told us that it wanted to use EUR 3 400 000 out of the 5 million in order, as part of the fight against terrorism, to create a database and improve the communication systems between the security forces and intelligence services."
"Based on this information, we prepared what we believe to be a legal basis which is currently being examined by the Council."
"I share your hope that the Council will find a solution to the issue of the legal basis so that the EUR 3 400 000 can be used before the end of the year."
"As for the amount of time that has passed in between, I shall now explain the reason for this."
"I mentioned the issue of the 5 million to illustrate that I do not fully agree with your comparison of the figures."
"The 5 million was not proposed again this year."
"This amount has not been reproduced in this year's budget."
"We must compare the JHA budget less the 5 million from 2002, in other words EUR 114 million, with the EUR 119 million that we want to propose."
"I understand that this may not seem very much to you, but I am speaking under the watchful eye of Mrs Schreyer, who will not allow me to agree with you."
"As far as the budget for asylum and immigration is concerned, I think that the budgetary line for cooperation with third countries was devoted, in 2002, mainly to aid operations for Afghan refugees and to the return of Afghan refugees."
"No one can question the priority given to Afghanistan."
"My intention for the future is to grant the appropriations from this budgetary line, for which no increase is planned, primarily to third countries which are currently negotiating or have recently been negotiating readmission agreements with us."
"This will allow us to finance measures to accompany the execution of readmission agreements."
"That said, I support your idea that we should have at our disposal a general overview of the budgetary situation of funds that the European Union is already providing, at the current time, for cooperation with third countries in the area of asylum and immigration."
"These funds do not only appear in the JHA budget; they also appear, and to a great extent, in the Relex budget, in the Country strategy papers, in the regional programmes such as MEDA or CARDS."
"That is why the Seville Council asked us to draw up a report on the effectiveness of financial resources that we provide for cooperation with third countries."
"We shall do this within the timeframe laid down by the Seville European Council and I shall take this opportunity to present to you the first mid-term assessment of the use of the European Refugee Fund over the period 2000-2002."
"Regarding the issue of enlargement that Mrs Sbarbati has just raised, I must tell you that 60% of all funding granted in recent years from the justice and home affairs budget to candidate countries has been used to improve controls at the external borders of the candidate countries and that the programmes concerned, which are part of the PHARE initiative, will continue until 2006."
"We have an assessment of the results of these programmes compared to the results obtained by the candidate countries each year."
"I can tell you that this is the number one priority as far as the candidate countries are concerned."
"Let us now move on from justice and home affairs and discuss information and communication."
"I can only support the idea that an information and communication policy must be a policy of proximity."
"That is why we proposed a new approach."
"I cannot promise you that the new approach will succeed."
"No one can."
"But I can assure you that the only solution is to form an interinstitutional partnership and work very closely with the Member States."
"If the Member States do not engage in an information and communication policy of proximity, we cannot do this from Brussels."
"In my view, this evidence cannot be contested."
"You also know that the commitment from the Member States is totally voluntary."
"This means that the Commission and Parliament, in an interinstitutional framework, shall invite the Member States to become involved in this exercise, because we believe that, ultimately, it will be in everyone's interest, not only the interest of the European institutions, but also of the Member States' governments, to have a general public that is better informed of what is going on at European level."
"But, to do this, we must have the necessary human resources."
"That is why I called for the amounts which are included in the preliminary draft budget and which refer to the Prince and MEDIA correspondents working in the Member States' capitals to be retained."
"Without these intruments, we will not be able to succeed in establishing this partnership with the Member States."
"I would like to thank you for your support in this respect and I hope that we will be able to develop, on the basis of this partnership, a more proactive, clearer and better targeted information and communication policy."
"Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino."
"We will now have the debate on the areas of external action."
"the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy is of course interested in international development and especially the opportunity to play a part in shaping policy within the WTO."
"We have two problems here."
"On the one hand, our Committee's resources do not permit us to monitor and influence the debate to the extent that would be genuinely useful."
"On the other, we have many parliamentarians from other countries - primarily from developing countries - who cannot meet the costs, even for travel and accommodation, in order to attend these debates and play a role in this decision-making process."
"Firstly, we want Europe to commit itself to playing a leading role in global affairs."
"The WTO and the capacity to make decisions on matters of WTO policy are extremely important, especially for our small and medium enterprises."
"Secondly, we want to press ahead with standardisation, because what we want to push for first and foremost, in terms of legislation, is mutual recognition, rather than harmonisation within the European internal market."
"In this context, standardisation is essential and fundamental."
"Thirdly, in the energy field, we want to ensure that the intelligent energy programmes, but also the ALTENER, SAVE and SYNERGIE programmes, are used intensively and that the Commission sets priorities here, especially for our energy self-sufficiency, where the aim, after all, is to achieve an increase from 50% to 70%."
"In this context, more intensive measures need to be adopted as a matter of urgency to safeguard and secure our energy supply."
"Let me make one further point, which originates from Parliament alone: we want Basle II to have its own action programme."
"We are concerned that the equity capital requirements for our SMEs will not be achievable by 2006, and that this will precipitate a massive number of foreclosures and bankruptcies. So let's do our homework here first."
"Mr President, once again this year the increase in funds committed to pre-accession in category 4 means an overall decline in Europe's external action devoted to development."
"Sadly, the only real long-term solution to this problem lies in the revision of the financial perspective in 2006."
"I shall concentrate today on two issues where we can make a real difference this year."
"Firstly, the global health fund against AIDS, TB and malaria."
"The Committee on Development has proposed that all regional budget lines contribute to achieving the sizeable recurrent contribution needed."
"AIDS is a global problem."
"India is the country with the second-highest level of infection after South Africa, and the biggest increase in infections is in Eastern Europe and Central Asia."
"Already the fund has committed 13% of its money to the Americas."
"But if the Commission and Council disagree with this approach, let them tell us where the money will come from."
"Let them admit that the EUR 35 million budgeted for does not achieve Mr Patten's own commitment made on 16 September in order to keep the Commission's own seat on the Global Health Fund board."
"This is right for Europe as a leader and innovator in the field, and it is right for the 3 million people dying of AIDS worldwide to make sure that the money works."
"I have been given a clear understanding that the Global Health Fund's transitional working group meeting in Brussels agreed USD 100 million for a board seat, that the Global Fund secretariat has already budgeted for a USD 120 million European Community contribution for next year, and that approved projects will be cut if we fail to match that figure."
"I have given the Commissioner advance notice of these questions."
"If I am wrong, let him put this on the record today, and if I am right let him support our amendments."
"Secondly, the quality of aid."
"It is regrettable that agreements made since the reform of external assistance still mean that three times as much European aid is spent on transport as on health and education, combined, for the poorest people in greatest need."
"That is why Parliament this year is seeking to earmark this spending and promote it as part of the deconcentration of staff and in the new country strategy papers."
"Commissioner Nielson will be aware that on 15 July his services promised a firm proposal on this point and that I received his reply by fax only at 3.40 p.m. this afternoon after this debate had begun."
"I conclude by saying that I hope the Commissioner will therefore defer the proper concerns he may wish to raise in relation to Parliament's proposals this afternoon, and commit himself to the further discussions where I agree with his wish, and I quote 'to press ahead together in achieving our common goals'."
"I look forward to hearing his response."
"the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr Titley, is unable to attend the debate and has asked me to make various comments on the Committee's behalf."
"The Committee has set itself three objectives: firstly, to make clear which foreign policy priorities the European Union intends to set in the new financial year without wrecking the stipulated financial framework."
"Secondly, we want more transparency."
"A number of amendments to the budget's nomenclature are designed to increase the flow of resources."
"These proposed amendments also have no financial implications, but will lead to more budget transparency and thus facilitate budgetary control."
"The third issue, which is a particular priority for the draftsman of the opinion and the Committee, is to improve the security of our delegations around the world."
"Remedial action needs to be taken here and we want to support this process."
"Let me take each of these three points in turn."
"On the first point, we are planning some increases in funding to reflect political priorities for the cross-border programmes under TACIS."
"The European Union's new external borders require more funding for cooperation across these borders, which is why we have proposed a number of increases."
"The second issue is nuclear safety."
"This too is a priority for this House, and we want to see this reflected in the budget figures for next year."
"Anti-personnel mines and the rapid reaction mechanism are also areas where we have proposed budget increases."
"Then we have a scenario reminiscent of the film Dinner for One at New Year, with the 'same procedure as every year', when the Commission cuts the funding for human rights and democracy budget lines and the Parliament bumps it up again."
"We intend to do so this year as well, and we would ask the Commission to take note for once next year that Parliament is setting these priorities and that this should be reflected in the draft budget."
"In the interests of transparency, we would like Afghanistan to be a separate budget line, not a sub-item under Asia."
"A great deal of money will flow to Afghanistan over the coming years, so this is very important."
"Finally, the draftsman has also urged us to ensure that there is, in future, regular disclosure of the budget lines for Palestine so that it can be ascertained from the outset where the money is going."
"In my view, better budgetary control is needed here. These are our priorities."
"Let me conclude by addressing a request to the Council."
"This House asks to be involved more closely in future when making new political promises in the foreign policy field. Otherwise, if the Council continues to make a succession of new promises without the money to back them up, we will forfeit our credibility."
"Since my colleague Chris Patten is attending two summits simultaneously today, I would like to respond to some of the points on his behalf."
"Firstly, in the foreign policy field, we face, after all, the most substantial new requirements for many years, without any scope to expand the budget."
"The Council and Parliament have already used the flexibility instrument several times here in order to meet the new requirements."
"On the issue of Afghanistan, I would like to extend my thanks to the Council and especially, in advance, to this House for agreeing to the very rapid release at this time of EUR 70 million which are still in reserve for this year in order to provide assistance here, and especially also for granting the necessary direct subsidies to the transitional government."
"On the issue raised by Mr Howitt, which also relates to the Global Health Fund, I would point out that we have earmarked EUR 35 million for the Fund in the budget."
"After all, we have already contributed EUR 120 million to the Global Health Fund from the EU and EDF budgets."
"The decision was only taken recently, so we assume that these funds are adequate."
"My colleague Mr Nielson, in particular, has various budget lines available."
"He will make a statement on this issue shortly."
"As regards Mr Rübig's question on energy, the Commission has proposed a new multi-annual programme for action in the field of intelligent energies, which also provides funding for these energies in third states."
"I think the Johannesburg Summit made it very clear once again that we should be giving special priority to this area."
"Let me first address the issue mentioned by Mr Howitt, of the amounts targeted towards health and education."
"Most Members of Parliament will recognise that, since we have discussed this again and again, it is not easy to say anything new."
"That is also the reason why Mr Howitt has not missed anything, even though I did not have the opportunity to reply to his last letter in time."
"That does not, of course, prevent us from continuing to discuss the matter amicably."
"The agreement last year on a 35% benchmark on health and education is an input indicator for our commitments to social infrastructure."
"The Commission will provide the breakdown of figures against the various DAC codes from the OECD showing commitments in 2002 and 2003 for health and education."
"The level of commitments will depend mainly on the results of the programming exercise in our partner countries."
"There is no need to re-open the agreement of last year, and there is nothing to be gained by it in terms of additional information."
"The systems of tracing and categorising more clearly what we do is under implementation - according to what we have promised Parliament - and that will create a basis for a more enlightened discussion on these issues."
"On the funding of the Global Health Fund, as my colleague Mrs Schreyer has already said, the Commission will ensure that it will do what is expected."
"This is all we really need to say at this point."
"I agree very much with Mr Laschet that the increase in TACIS is important, inter alia for reasons of stepping up our presence in general in that region."
"On what was said about involving Parliament more closely when making political promises, I understood that to mean that Parliament should be involved more before making political promises, otherwise I do not see why we need to discuss it."
"This is certainly a good and correct way of working and, in general, I feel this is the way things are being done."
"Remarks were made about staffing and security in delegations."
"We welcome the amendment by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy underlining the difficult security situation of many of our delegations."
"However, the Development Committee amendment relating to the recruitment of specialists - the other point raised by Mr Howitt - puts very rigid and complicated conditions on the release of EUR 10 million of these funds."
"It would seriously undermine the deconcentration process, since we need to know the funds available in order to recruit and train staff."
"It will also unnecessarily penalise some of the poorest beneficiaries, since the main impact will fall on delegations in 30 ACP countries."
"What we do, and what we prefer to do, is to strengthen the handling of the different sectors by means of networks of specialists both in headquarters and out in delegations."
"However, a very rigid system, as proposed by the Development Committee's amendment, will not help us in getting things done in an efficient manner, so we do not welcome that proposal."
"Mr President, my point concerns the next four hours."
"Commissioner Nielson was not here when I made my opening remarks but one of them concerned the Global Health Fund."
"One question we need answering before we take a decision next week on category 4 is: what is the amount of money that the European Union has to pay to get a seat on the board of the Global Health Fund?"
"We are getting conflicting comments from the Commission and from our colleagues in the Committee on Development."
"The Committee on Budgets needs to know a figure."
"Mr President, my reluctance to answer is based on the fact that we do not have a figure."
"If we look at what it took to get a seat in the first year, following the establishment of the Fund, the mathematics tell us that it was around EUR 84 million, but the United States says that it is paying for about four seats."
"We would not like to see a larger Health Fund board."
"That would not be efficient."
"Other actors are trying to get seats on that board, so there is some pressure."
"As you know, we came up with EUR 120 million for the first year."
"The actual use of that money and the overall availability of funds compared to the actual spending in the first year makes for a very open discussion as to the actual funding need for the coming year."
"It is against this background that the Commission finds it advisable not to come up with a figure today."
"We want to have a picture of what other donors are doing to make sure that we feed money into the fund in a prudent manner to make it work as expected, but also to maximise value for money whatever we do in this area as a whole."
"We do not have a figure right now."
"Also, we are not under pressure at this stage to clarify all the details of how we find the money, so we advise waiting a little."
"That is why you do not have a clear answer."
"Mr President, I would just like to raise four points."
"Firstly, the G8 recently reached agreement on the need to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy in developing countries."
"Mrs Schreyer referred to this (to the intelligent energy programme) earlier."
"My question to Mrs Schreyer is: Would she say that EUR 19 million over four years is adequate for preparatory work in over 80 - 90 countries?"
"My question to Mr Nielson is: It is recognised that energy is a factor in poverty for the developing countries, so could he tell us how he proposes to coordinate his work with other DGs to tackle this?"
"My second point is that Commission Patten has made statements that the EU should have a poverty focus in its development aid."
"Therefore, would you agree that it is inconsistent to increase funding, as foreign affairs amendments have done, to Latin America and MEDA lines, and actually take away money from Asia lines?"
"What do you think of Mr. Elles' statement today that Afghanistan should be funded from the flexibility instrument?"
"I would like to return to the Global Health Fund."
"I am not really satisfied with the response and the answer we have had from Commissioner Nielson."
"What I want to know, with regard to the EUR 35 million that we are proposing, is whether that is enough to get us a seat on the board?"
"Is that adequate in terms of the EU leading the debate and fighting AIDS in the world?"
"Finally, I would like to ask the Council their opinion on the U-turn in the PPE position, and the proposal to break the gentleman's agreement."
"In the July conciliation, the PPE agreed to the Council's budget, but this afternoon we were informed by Mr Elles that they will put EUR 6.3 million from their basics budget in the reserve."
"They are breaking their word, and if this amendment is accepted, what would the Council's response be?"
"(Applause from the left)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are all agreed that the budget should be a reflection of Parliament's political wishes."
"This is mostly the case, but not always when the so-called special delegates are involved."
"For example, the EU has one such delegate for the Middle East."
"Parliament has repeatedly said that it would be desirable to have such a special delegate for the Southern Caucasus or Tibet, for example."
"We are now facing the problem that the coffers are technically empty for this purpose, for these special delegates fall within the scope of the Council's budget."
"This is not to our liking, but the agreement is that we are not to touch the Council's budget."
"It now therefore looks like a widely shared political aspiration is set to wind up in the cogs of Parliament's budget machinery."
"I should like to draw both the Council's and Commission's attention to this, with the very specific question to the Council whether it would be prepared to make room in its budget for a special deputy for the Southern Caucasus and Tibet and if not, to make this known promptly and clearly so that the Commission can plug this hole."
"My question to the Commission is whether it is prepared to do that."
"After all, it is unacceptable for European presence in crisis regions to be restricted simply because a widely shared political aspiration is at risk of falling between all the financial stools."
"Mr President, Commissioners. ladies and gentlemen, enlargement is just around the corner and we continually speak of finance and various programmes for the new Member States, but we forget that action is also needed in the border areas of our new neighbours and for these new neighbours themselves."
"For that reason, my group and I want future border areas to receive more attention."
"That could be done, for example, by strengthening cross-border cooperation under the TACIS programme."
"If that is not done there will be tension, and a good example of that is Kaliningrad."
"It is not just a matter of the region's isolation: the social and economic differences between it and its neighbours are enormous."
"For this more money is needed right away."
"Another good example is the Northern Dimension."
"We must vigorously support it, and, for that reason, my group has proposed an extra EUR 10 million for cross-border cooperation under the TACIS programme."
"This has had the full support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"A third example is nuclear safety."
"For that we are proposing EUR 25 million."
"We all understand why."
"I have a question for the Commission."
"Implementation of action under TACIS has produced some very poor results."
"You must agree that it will be an important project for years to come."
"Could you say how you intend to improve the situation and describe to us the development strategy the Commission has for transboundary cooperation?"
"I then have a question for the Council."
"It is not acceptable that from one year to the next the European Union undertakes new commitments under Section IV of the budget, without putting more money into it."
"That weakens the credibility of our foreign policy."
"Can you give us your opinion on this?"
"If the Council makes promises with regard to every crisis without considering the financial implications, we will reach a dead end."
"What is your solution?"
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to come back to Mr Laschet's question regarding Parliament's proposal to set up a separate budget line for Afghanistan."
"We welcome this for reasons of visibility, but suggest that in return, so to speak, East Timor be reintegrated into the ECHO budget line so that the overall number of budget lines does not increase."
"As regards the issue of the Global Health Fund, which has again played a major role in this debate, I should point out that of the pledges made by the various donors, almost two-thirds come from Europe, in other words, from the European Union and from the Member States direct."
"This is a high proportion."
"The proposal we made in the budget plan - and we really gave this matter very careful thought - to include 35 million in the budget line at this stage is, in our view, adequate."
"However, we also said that if it is not enough to keep our seat, we will have to see what measures need to be taken."
"So far, there has been no sign from the other donors to suggest that this figure is inadequate at the present time."
"Nonetheless, it should be stated clearly once again that securing the seat on the board was a major priority."
"Let me turn briefly to Mr Lagendijk's question regarding the Special Envoy."
"This is indeed an issue which concerns the budget for the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"As you know, the Commission has already proposed increasing the funding by one-third, specifically to finance the shared costs of the International Police Task Force in Bosnia."
"However, we appeal very strongly for adequate funding for measures from the rapid reaction mechanism to be included once again in the Commission's budget plan."
"The Council had cut this area, and we would welcome it if Parliament could restore the funding here."
"Now to the issue of TACIS."
"In view of the fact that in category 4, i.e. foreign policy, we only have a very small margin available overall, we must decide whether there will be further cuts here."
"However, I would also like to appeal for us, as part of the enlargement process in 2004, to focus particularly on ways of boosting cross-border cooperation with our new neighbours in the East post-enlargement."
"Finally, a brief word on the implementation of the budget."
"I should point out that for this year too, we have achieved a higher rate of implementation in category 4 than was the case last year."
"The numerous measures adopted by my colleagues Mr Nielson and Mr Patten at administrative level, namely the adoption of new structures to facilitate more rapid implementation, are genuinely having an impact on the budget figures."
"I think this shows that the reform efforts are proving very successful and the assistance is reaching its target more quickly."
"Mr President, let me give a single set of figures to illustrate this in responding to Mr van Dam, who mentioned correctly the low level of implementation of TACIS and other programmes."
"When we took office at the end of 1999 the overall time it would take to work our way through the existing commitments at the level and the pace of spending at that time was 4.5 years."
"The following year this figure was down to 4.1 years and at the end of last year we were down to 3.66 years."
"This is a rough, primitive but correct measure showing that we are in fact reducing the gap between the decisions on commitment and the actual implementation in terms of spending per year."
"We are moving in the right direction but I have not been silent in trying to clarify to this Parliament what kind of a problem we had, the size of that problem and the complexity of it when we took office."
"I normally characterise our foreign relations and development cooperation work by saying that it is nice that the Commission is big."
"We do have a critical mass but when we look at the legacy of the past it is also true that we have a critical mess."
"We are changing this gradually."
"The figures mentioned by Mr Wijkman in this ongoing discussion on how much we do on health and education, the money devoted specifically to the Global Health Fund, is of course not the whole story."
"We are also discussing the totality of the money being spent and I need to come back to this figure of 35% as the target expenditure on the social sectors, which we agreed to with Parliament and which I still think is something we can deliver."
"The use of the flexibility instrument for Afghanistan has already been addressed by my colleague, Mrs Schreyer."
"We should normalise our development cooperation and support to Afghanistan."
"The best solution would be to put it into the budget as a whole."
"Still, money is needed regardless of the source, and we need to more or less mop up resources to do what needs to be done in Afghanistan."
"The figure quoted by Mrs Gill on renewable energy only regards a special initiative."
"The total figure for what we do in the field of energy also, especially with regard to renewable energy in development cooperation, is much bigger."
"I would also point out that in Johannesburg we launched the energy initiative together with the Member States."
"We have backed this up by the information that, in total, Member States and the Commission have an annual level of spending for energy-related development activities of about EUR 0.7 billion."
"I note with deep satisfaction that Mrs Gill quoted my colleague, Mr Patten, on the need to focus on poverty in what we do in this whole area."
"I could not agree more."
"On the Global Health Fund, I can tell you that the 15 EU Member States have pledged a total of 64% of all the pledges made in support of this fund."
"We must also take this into account when taking the final decision on how much we consider adequate from the Commission for each year as we move forward."
"To Mr Dell'Alba, I would say that the aspect of human rights and the inclusion of clauses referring to human rights matters is a standard element."
"If you look at the whole new generation of country strategy papers that guides what we do and creates the basis for it, country by country for the whole world - this not only applies to the ACP countries but also to Asia and Latin America, etc. these papers clearly give a strong, prominent role to the issues of governance, democratisation and human rights."
"We do not yet have the same kind of mechanisms as those embedded in the Cotonou Agreement, where we have a negotiated relationship, but this whole discussion is clearly an important element in the ongoing dialogue with all our partner countries."
"Finally, to Mr Paasilinna, on how to improve the TACIS programme."
"In the light of the experience of Afghanistan over the last year, we are determined to step up the focus on this group of countries for reasons of conflict prevention, but certainly also because of a stronger sense of a closer neighbourly relationship with these countries."
"All this is emerging, and we have long spoken about the need for redefining and updating the character of our development cooperation with these countries."
"I feel confident that we will see increased activity, and I hope stronger financial activity."
"As has already been mentioned, an increase of 5.4%, giving a level of EUR 502 million, now makes this group of countries a main partner, including from a financial perspective."
"Thank you, Commissioner Nielson."
"We now come to the horizontal aspects of the budget and other policies."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, I shall single out two separate points which I believe are the two key points of the document."
"Firstly, with regard to the equal opportunities budget itself, it is important in my view that the money intended for initiatives to promote women's equal opportunities - initiatives taken by the NGOs - should indeed be able to be allocated in a simple manner."
"The conditions now prescribed by the Commission are far too tough and far too difficult."
"For example, it stipulates that the initiative should be tabled by five countries, and also that it must have a very high budget."
"This is not feasible for quite a number of women's organisations."
"Hence the suggestion to admit initiatives if they involve three countries, where the budget can also be a little more restricted."
"I insist that this change should be made so that the budget can be used more efficiently."
"The second point of crucial importance to us is gender policy."
"This should not remain confined to the equal opportunities budget; it should be present in all of the Community's areas of policy."
"I would draw your attention to one point in particular, namely the conditions for cooperation with the developing countries at a political, economic and cultural level."
"Commissioner Nielson said a moment ago that the conditions for cooperation in the field of human rights with the ACP countries, Asia and Latin America, are very stringent."
"Nevertheless, I notice that when human rights are discussed, this does not always include women's rights."
"This is why we absolutely insist - and this is for us in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, and I believe also for all the women in Parliament a real must - that cooperation with countries be suspended if they fail to take measures to prevent violence against women, stoning, public chastisement, genital mutilation, cremation or rape."
"We would therefore ask for aid to be abandoned in those cases."
"Mr President, I have basically left it open to all members of the Budgetary Control Committee to suggest amendments in the sectors that they tend to cover."
"Mr Bösch has tabled a number of amendments from the point of view of a critical friend, regarding OLAF, the Anti-Fraud Office."
"We are now beginning to see the problems of the office not being completely independent of the Commission."
"Accordingly, Mr Bösch's amendments which have been adopted by the committee include questioning the mission expenses of OLAF, questioning their information and communication measures - having received a reasonable amount of money for this purpose, the office put out less than twelve press releases in both 2000 and 2001 - and indeed questioning both the Commission and OLAF over a cut."
"The PDB actually cut the budget for OLAF by a substantial figure and we had no answers as to why that money had been cut."
"The committee has reinstated the money cut, but has put this money into the reserve pending the answers from both those institutions."
"The committee has also taken a strong view on export refunds."
"There are many experts on export refunds on the committee."
"I am definitely not one of those, but essentially the amendments aim for transparency and to help people like me understand the purpose, scope, cost and implementation of export refunds."
"Other amendments include those on the Economic and Social Committee, cutting funds to reduce its dependence on external experts, increasing appropriations for the measures to combat counterfeiting of the euro - something I as a British Conservative have some trepidation in suggesting - and reinstating part of a cut in budget line B1-361 which seeks to improve monitoring and preventative measures in candidate countries concerning agriculture budgets."
"Those are the amendments that the Budgetary Control Committee has submitted."
"On behalf of the Committee Legal Affairs and the Single Market, I want to draw attention to those items affecting the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance."
"It is not possible to sit through this process without realising how many desirable projects for expenditure the European Union has and that, with finite resources, all budgets have to be trimmed here and there, but Members must give very particular attention to the problem of our two courts."
"The EU succeeds in being a Union under law only to the extent that it has an effective set of judicial tribunals."
"This Parliament has the ambition that the Charter of Rights shall become judicially cognisable."
"This is a highly desirable project but one which will put heavy demands on the judicial resources of the European Union."
"The Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance both believe that they have reached the limit of their resources and that without adequate funding they will cease to be able to provide what the European Union needs."
"The European Union needs efficient, well-working courts without undue delays, without delays in court dockets."
"Because we are a polyglot, multilingual union, there must be speedy, clear and accurate translation of the courts' judgments into all the languages of the European Union in order that citizens and their legal advisers throughout the European Union are up-to-date on the law of this Union and how it is properly interpreted."
"If we do not reinstate the estimates that the Court of Justice itself made, we will fail more and more often."
"There are very specific points: we need referendaires in the Court of First Instance because the European Union has failed to fill vacancies for judges, we need upgraded posts and we need improved translation services."
"That is what the amendments by the Legal Affairs Committee amount to."
"Mr President, as draftsman for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, I would like to draw the attention of the Commissioners and my fellow Members to two fundamental aspects of the amendments we have tabled, which I hope Parliament and the Committee on Budgets will be able to accept."
"The first aspect concerns the Prince programme."
"This was Parliament's main priority, which we quite rightly imposed on the Commission."
"I believe this programme proved its worth in the assessment and popularisation of a number of our priorities, European priorities: the euro and other subjects have subsequently been addressed."
"This year, the programme has been drastically reduced by the Commission in its preliminary draft budget, which is baffling considering that 2003 is the year in which the work of the Convention will end and that this great joint work will need to be given all the publicity and importance it deserves."
"We have therefore asked for substantial funding to popularise the work of the Convention, while giving those who are against this Convention or its results the opportunity to make themselves heard - which theoretically speaking is not my case."
"I am speaking out like this because I believe this programme to be important."
"The other aspect concerns the Internet."
"We have Europe by Satellite, our citizens already have some means of access to our work, debates and press conferences."
"The Committee on Institutional Affairs is proposing to make the Internet a proper tool that enables citizens to say: 'Let's see what they're going to say at the Commission briefing this lunchtime; let's see what the Court of Justice judgement will be today', etc."
"This programme must therefore ensure that soon, in time, the Internet becomes an important vehicle for publicising the work of all the institutions."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Commissioner on Sunday's election results in Germany."
"I know this is a national event, but all of us are members or one party or another at home."
"Sometimes this provides fresh impetus and then it should benefit everyone."
"Of course, the framework to be set in the budget for the Committee on Petitions is relatively small."
"Nonetheless, this framework is still quite important."
"After all, we had more than 2100 cases last year, which the Ombudsman had to deal with."
"We regard this still relatively new institution as a major step forward in guaranteeing the quality and control of the administration and citizens' access to it."
"We therefore fail to understand why our few requests relating to the coming year's budget, which primarily concern staffing, have obviously fallen foul of the restrictions and tight constraints governing administrative expenditure."
"Indeed, I have the impression that in the past, the Commission pegged future costs for the administration at an extremely low level, far too low, and that we are now having to live with the consequences of this mistake."
"Ultimately, it is down to us, as Parliament, to allocate the scarce resources as fairly as possible."
"I think this situation is open to severe criticism."
"Our colleagues have presented their cases for their areas - the small institutions - and I hope that in future budget procedures, despite the error that arose at the advent of this financial perspective, we will be able to find a solution in our area as well."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me respond first to Mr Bösch's question about the Ombudsman."
"This is after all a separate plan, and one which must, of course, be managed within the constraints of category 5 if new requirements exist."
"In response to Mr MacCormick's urgent call for more posts at the European Court of Justice, let me say that the category 5 ceiling applies here too, and I would point out again that you mentioned this in connection with enlargement as well."
"With enlargement, according to the financial perspective and according to Agenda 2000, we will have more resources available in category 5."
"Our joint task at that time will be to allocate these resources appropriately."
"This means that with enlargement, these restrictions will ease to some extent, taking account of the fact that in a European Union with 25 Member States, many new posts will be needed in Parliament, the Council, the European Court of Justice and, not least, the Commission."
"In response to the questions and comments made by Mrs Smet, I fully endorse her view that women's policy and equal opportunities policy must flow into all policy areas."
"This is not simply a voluntary statement, although I make it quite voluntarily."
"It is a binding commitment under the Treaty, and one that is taken into account quite explicitly in many policy areas."
"On the issue of human rights violations, especially violence against women, let me point out that Article 9 of the Cotonou Agreement also reaffirms that the equality of men and women is an integral element of human rights."
"Of course, this is also a guideline for all measures in the area of category 4."
"In response to Mr Heaton-Harris's question on the OLAF budget, and why the Commission has introduced a cut in the PDB of around EUR 700 000 compared with 2002, this is actually a technical adjustment."
"In 2002, Parliament amended the establishment plan, compared with the Commission's proposal, resulting in more 'B' posts instead of 'A' posts."
"Naturally, 'B' posts cost less than 'A' posts. This was not accounted for in 2002, but it has been accounted for in the preliminary draft for the year 2003."
"In other words, this is not a cut but an adjustment, although I would point out to the President-in-Office that during its first reading, the Council has now introduced a real cut which will have to be discussed."
"Let me add that in our call for additional posts in preparation for enlargement - posts which are not yet secure, although I greatly appreciate Parliament's efforts in this area - additional posts are envisaged for OLAF as well."
"With your permission, Mr Heaton-Harris, I will refer your questions on export refunds to my colleague Mr Fischler later."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the different effects of our budget decisions on women and men have scarcely featured in our debate today."
"For years, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has put forward proposals during the budget procedure to take account of the different impacts of our decisions on women and men."
"We have been successful in the field of employment policy and the Structural Funds, where gender mainstreaming is now enshrined as a principle."
"In foreign policy, too, gender sensitivity is increasing."
"In the context of aid to Afghanistan, targeted measures have thus been introduced to reintegrate women into public life and restore their human rights."
"We have achieved successes in combating trafficking in human beings, which is a modern form of slavery."
"Violence against women has also become an issue in the budget."
"Nonetheless, the STOP and DAPHNE programmes must not be used simply to carry out representative events."
"Ultimately, just 13% of the projects can be funded, which is why the NGOs must be given direct assistance."
"Gender budgeting must become even more of a theme than is currently the case."
"The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities is working on an own-initiative report on this issue."
"A word of criticism on the practice governing the allocation of funds as well: all too often - for example, in town twinning or the NGOs - it generates a great deal of resentment."
"There is much frustration among active Europeans."
"If on the one hand, we ensure that we do not spend any more on tobacco cultivation and we dismantle bureaucratic hurdles in this area, we cannot then put up similar hurdles in the way of the NGOs."
"I ask for your support."
"Mr President, I would still like to raise a couple of points."
"Employment is an important issue."
"Unemployment is on the increase in the EU."
"It is in small and medium-sized enterprises in particular that jobs are created."
